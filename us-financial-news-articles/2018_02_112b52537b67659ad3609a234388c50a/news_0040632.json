REUTERS/Claudia Daut Many in Mexico City slept through the shaking. Residents who rushed into the streets when the alarms sounded quickly returned to their homes once the quake stopped.\nThe head of Mexico’s civil protection agency, Luis Felipe Puente, said state emergency procedures had been activated in the affected states.\n“So far, no damage has been reported,” he said on Twitter.\nInfrastructure, including installations of state oil company Pemex, were intact, he said.\nMexico has suffered a series of more powerful earthquakes in recent months, including two in September that together killed hundreds of people and brought buildings crashing down.\nWriting by Frank Jack Daniel; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T09:44:21.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
