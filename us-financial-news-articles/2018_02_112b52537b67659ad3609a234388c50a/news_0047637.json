There is also a preliminary deal with Japanese utility Tohoku Electric.\n“Additionally, we are in advanced negotiations with a variety of buyers to meet our FID target,” Wells said.\nThe choice of European customer diversifies Anadarko’s Asia-weighted supply offering and could see east African LNG flowing into the region’s terminals as declining indigenous gas production makes Europe more reliant on imports, especially Russian piped gas.\n“Reaching this SPA continues to validate Mozambique LNG’s position as a competitive long-term LNG supplier and as one of the world’s leading greenfield projects,” said Mitch Ingram, Anadarko’s executive vice president of International and Deepwater Operations and Project Management.\nLNG project developers across the board have struggled to find the long-term buyers needed before banks and export credit agencies could commit financing for new plants.\nLow oil prices, surging global LNG output and buyer’s demands for flexibility, shorter contract terms and competitive pricing have challenged the profitability of many projects and delayed investments in new ones.\nAnadarko’s SPAs hint at a potential thaw in buyer-seller relations and a chance at becoming the first major East African LNG project to reach FID just as rising demand lifts prices and encourages investments in new supply.\nThe tug-of-war between buyers and sellers has unsettled lenders. A typical financing model asked buyers to pay for a plant’s entire output over 25-years, thereby guaranteeing returns on loans.\nBuyers’ growing rejection of this model has led to calls for shorter terms, smaller volumes and flexibility to adjust or divert supply as circumstances change, making it harder for banks to commit funds in light of new project risks.\n“With regards to our project financing efforts, lenders are keenly engaged and have indicated a willingness to support the initial project with the necessary levels of project finance commitments,” Wells said. “We are actively negotiating the terms and conditions of the financing.” (Reporting by Oleg Vukmanovic)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T01:06:02.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
