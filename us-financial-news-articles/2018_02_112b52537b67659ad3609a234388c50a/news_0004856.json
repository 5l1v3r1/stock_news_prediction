Hebei will strictly carry out the production restriction issued by central government,” the statement said.\nUnder Beijing’s winter production restrictions, steel mills were ordered to cut output by up to 50 percent from mid-November to mid-March, as part of the country’s efforts to combat air pollution.\nThree sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Tangshan, which is China’s largest steelmaking city and in Hebei province, is discussing prolonging the curbs after the traditional winter heating season ends.\nThey declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media.\nHebei produced 191 million tonnes of crude steel last year, 12 percent of China’s total. Tangshan accounts for more than half of that, more than the United States and is routinely listed among China’s 10 cities most affected by smog.\nThe move would help Beijing deepen its efforts to cut smog and reduce overcapacity in its bloated smoke-stack industries.\nIt is not clear how long or by how much steel mills in the city may be forced to curtail production.\nA spokesman with the Tangshan government declined to comment on the plan and said the city would obey environmental rules.\nThe Ministry of Environmental Protection did not respond to requests for comment.\nOn Wednesday, the MEP said it was drawing up plans for tougher curbs on smog for the next three years, after a five-year crackdown on pollution helped it attain air quality targets last month.\nReporting by Ruby Lian, Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T11:40:28.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
