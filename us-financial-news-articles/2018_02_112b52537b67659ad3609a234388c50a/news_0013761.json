REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach There will be a “little melancholy” involved when he takes his last four runs at the Olympic Sliding Centre.\n“It’s hard to give up the sports lifestyle and the Olympic movement, I love it and what it stands for,” he said on Friday.\n“But I‘m sure I’ll stay involved in the sport because I want to build it up in India now and focus on that.”\nSlideshow (4 Images) Keshavan will carry India’s flag for a fifth time in the opening ceremony later on Friday but his team mate Singh had not yet arrived in Pyeongchang.\nThere was no certainty he would even make it in time to march.\n“It’s part of the bigger problem, let’s say, for sports, and especially winter sports, in India, and it’s why I think it’s time for me to take a step back as an athlete and go and give a much-needed push, because there is no reason why we should not be having a big team and not doing well,” said Keshavan.\nSince debuting at the 1964 Games, India has never come close to claiming a Winter Games medal and are unlikely to break the drought in Pyeongchang.\n“We have the natural resources, we’re not a poor country, we have a big enough talent pool and there’s a lot of passion as well but something is missing,” Keshavan added.\n“We don’t have the culture or the tradition of winter sports so I think I can fill in that role a little bit.”\nEditing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T12:10:39.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
