It will be harder for all companies to maintain their profitability,” said Ellinghorst, who has an “outperform” rating on Daimler shares.\nMost major carmakers are ramping up spending on electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies, as well as services such as car-sharing, amid tightening emissions regulations and competition from the likes of Uber and Google.\nThe Mercedes star logo of an E Coupe is pictured before the annual news conference of Daimler AG in Stuttgart, Germany, February 2, 2017. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle Daimler’s EBIT for the fourth quarter through December was flat at 3.47 billion euros, missing the average forecast of 3.65 billion euros in a Reuters poll.\nThe return on sales at its Mercedes-Benz Cars division shrank to 9.7 percent from an unusually high 10.7 percent a year earlier, even as unit sales rose by 4 percent.\nFILE PHOTO: The Mercedes star logo of an EQ concept car is pictured before the annual news conference of Daimler AG in Stuttgart, Germany, February 2, 2017.
