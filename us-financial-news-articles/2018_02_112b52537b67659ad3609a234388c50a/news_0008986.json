The 230-foot rocket, sporting 27 reusable engines, was conceived as the most powerful space-transport vehicle since the iconic Saturn V that blasted the Apollo astronauts to the moon five decades ago.\nMr. Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002 with the goal of eventually transporting humans throughout the solar system, told reporters the change in plans wasn’t due to doubts about the Falcon Heavy’s design or capabilities. He said he remained “really hopeful for this flight going as planned,” adding that “I’m sure we have done everything we could do to maximize the chance of success.”\nStill, he said SpaceX has decided that even if the Falcon Heavy performs as expected, management will shift its attention to a larger space-transportation system called BFR, for Big Falcon Rocket, envisioned to ultimately take humans to Mars.\nThe spacecraft designed to fly on top of the BFR, according to Mr. Musk, could begin short test flights perhaps as soon as next year. With work on the follow-on system to the Falcon Heavy “moving quickly,” Mr. Musk said, “it will not be necessary to qualify Falcon Heavy for crewed space flights.”\nRelated\nNew Falcon Heavy Rocket Represents a Major Bet for SpaceX (Feb. 4) Lawmakers Grill SpaceX, Boeing on Safety of Commercial Crew Capsules (Jan. 18) NASA Safety Watchdogs Raise Concerns About SpaceX, Boeing Spacecraft (Jan. 12) Obtaining such federal approval is an arduous process requiring the company to demonstrate the safety and reliability of all major systems. SpaceX’s current workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, which completed 18 unmanned launches last year, isn’t expected to win approval to fly astronauts until late this year at the earliest.\nIn one fell swoop, Monday’s announcement appears to render moot discussions about Falcon Heavy’s potential participation in anticipated future government-industry missions carrying astronauts to the Moon. Mr. Musk also indicated that SpaceX’s earlier plans to use the combination of the Falcon Heavy and the company’s Dragon capsule to orbit two private passengers around the moon have been dropped, in favor of future missions using the BFR booster and its expanded spacecraft.\nSpaceX’s revised strategy sees an unmanned future for the Falcon Heavy boosting the largest commercial and U.S. spy satellites into orbit. On Monday, he called it an “incredibly capable rocket.” But the market for those types of missions has shrunk considerably since the rocket was conceived in 2011.\nMr. Musk said if the Falcon Heavy’s promise for carrying out unmanned missions pans out, “it is game over” for the competition. At the same time, the company’s chief executive emphasized that if progress on the BFR takes longer than expected, SpaceX has left the door open to returning human missions to the Falcon Heavy.\nFrom the Archives Billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX—Space Exploration Technologies—said it plans to take tourists on a trip around the moon in as little as two years, after it starts ferrying NASA astronauts to the international space station.

But on Monday, reflecting the evolution of his thinking and the expansion of his ambitions, Mr. Musk half-jokingly called the Falcon Heavy “a bit small.”\nThe latest shift in technical goals and corporate strategy marks the third time in the last three years that Mr. Musk has surprised the space world with a fundamentally recast business plan.\nIn 2016, when Falcon Heavy was mired in development difficulties, SpaceX’s founder and chief designer unveiled plans for a fleet of giant carbon-fiber rockets, equipped with detachable fuel tanks, able to fuel boosters in orbit and capable of reuse up to 1,000 times.\nA year later, he rolled out a revised plan for exploring deep space that focused on a somewhat scaled-down new rocket, still dubbed BFR, and capsules intended to be larger than superjumbo airliners. The changes entailed creating a single fleet of rockets to serve commercial satellite operators and U.S. government customers and to fulfill Mr. Musk’s dreams of ultimately colonizing Mars. But in that presentation, the Falcon Heavy remained an integral part of shorter-term projects.\nNow, SpaceX once again has shaken up its game plan by shunting Falcon Heavy to the side when it comes to Mr. Musk’s aim of carrying astronauts or passengers outside the atmosphere.\nResponding to questions, Mr. Musk ticked off the biggest risks of the flight, featuring hazards of structural failure when passing the speed of sound or blasting through the period of maximum stress on the boosters. As the three main portions of the rocket flex, he said, the main question is “do they have some sort of resonance” or increasingly destructive vibration that “we weren’t anticipating?” If the flight succeeds, SpaceX anticipates the next launch would be in several months, most likely carrying a payload for a paying customer.\nIn Monday’s appearance, Mr. Musk reflected both optimism and concern about the launch’s outcome. “I feel quite giddy and happy,” he told reporters at the start of the press conference, expressing satisfaction that all was ready for a successful flight.\nBut as part of his final remarks, he said, “We don’t want to set expectations of perfection.” Reiterating worries about a rocket explosion close to the ground potentially causing damage to launch facilities, Mr. Musk said, “it’s going to be exciting, one way or the other.”\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T02:54:38.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
