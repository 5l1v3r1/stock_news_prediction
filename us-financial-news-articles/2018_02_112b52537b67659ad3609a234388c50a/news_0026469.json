The S&P correction is the fifth of this bull market, according to Yardeni Research. The last bear market was during the 2008 financial crisis.\nWorld stocks were also on track for their worst week since 2011, knocked by a 4 percent decline in Chinese stocks.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives early on Friday approved a bill to fund the federal government through March 23 and to increase overall spending limits over two years, sending the legislation to President Donald Trump.\nWith Wall Street’s quarterly results season more than half-way through, 78.3 percent of the S&P 500 companies have topped profit expectations, above the 72 percent beat rate in the past four quarters.\nChipmaker Nvidia was up about 11 percent in premarket trading after its upbeat results and forecast.\nExpedia shares sank 19 percent after the online travel services company missed analysts’ quarterly profit estimate due to higher marketing expenses.
