Other central European currencies were mixed, while a sharp drop in the share price of Poland's largest telecoms operator Orange Polska dragged down Warsaw's main index. The zloty fell 0.5 percent to 4.169 against the euro by 1425 GMT and weakened 0.5 percent against the dollar to 3.380. The Hungarian forint fell 0.2 percent as bond yields eased ahead of a central bank meeting next week , while the Serbian dinar strengthened by 0.1 percent despite a euros purchase by the central bank. The Czech crown was stable, shrugging off news that trade unions at Volkswagen's Czech carmaker Skoda Auto rejected the company's latest wage offer. The Czech Republic sold 9.73 billion crowns of treasury bonds on Wednesday. Polish rate-setter Eryk Lon, one of the biggest doves on the 10-member rate-setting panel, was Quote: d as saying that the strength of the zloty was starting to hurt exports. The currency, supported by robust growth, record low unemployment and a surge in tax revenue, gained a 20 percent versus the dollar in 2017 and has added a further 3 percent this year. Most of Poland's foreign trade is settled in euros, with only about 10 percent settled in dollars, estimates Mateusz Sutowicz, analyst at Warsaw-based Bank Millennium. \"The dollar accounts for a small share of Poland's exports, so the zloty's gains should not have any major impact on foreign trade,\" he said. \"Additionally, we don't believe that the zloty still has big potential to appreciate versus the euro.\" A central bank quarterly survey published in January showed that Polish companies estimate that a zloty stronger than 3.33 to the dollar -- only about 1 percent away from the current rate -- would make exports unprofitable. Poland's finance minister has said the zloty's present strong level is no cause for concern. On the stock market, shares in Poland's top telecoms operator Orange Polska fell more than 5 percent after fourth-quarter results. Investors were concerned about the company's 7 percent year-on-year fall in mobile revenue, said Ipopema Securities analyst Marcin Nowak. \"There is also a risk that the cost of Orange Polska's (flagship) fibre investment will increase due to wage pressure,\" he said.
