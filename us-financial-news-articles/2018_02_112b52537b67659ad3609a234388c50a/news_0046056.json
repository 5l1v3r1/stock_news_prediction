The best chance to do this was last year,” Shirai told Reuters.\n“With that opportunity missed, the BOJ won’t be able to move for quite a long time. It might be tough for the new leadership to normalize policy,” she said.\nShirai, a former International Monetary Fund economist who served at the BOJ board until March 2016, retains close contacts with incumbent and overseas policymakers.\nThe government last week reappointed Kuroda for another term and chose an advocate of bolder monetary easing as one of his deputies, a sign policymakers are in no rush to turn off a sweeping stimulus program.\nBut the rising cost of prolonged easing, especially the hit to bank profits from near-zero rates, means the biggest task for the new BOJ leadership would be to engineer a smooth exit from ultra-easy policy, analysts say.\nAfter shifting to a policy targeting interest rates from the pace of money printing, the BOJ has gradually slowed its bond buying to around 50 trillion yen ($464 billion) per year. That compares to the 80-trillion-yen pace the BOJ loosely commits to sustaining.\nThe central bank will likely slow the pace to around 30 trillion yen, as years of huge purchases have lead to a dearth of bonds to buy, she said.\nRaising long-term interest rate target or slowing the BOJ’s purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETF) would be difficult given pressure from premier Shinzo Abe to keep supporting growth and boosting stock prices, she said.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:53:29.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
