REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji However, South Korea had decided to accept the delegation for the good of the Games, a presidential official in Seoul said on condition of anonymity. \nThe official said South Korea had informed the United States of the visit and they were in talks about Kim Yong Chol’s entry into the South. \nAnother top North Korean official, Ri Son Gwon, will travel with Kim Yong Chol for the closing ceremony. Ri, who is also involved in inter-Korean affairs, accompanied leader Kim Jong Un’s sister on her visit. \nThe eight-member delegation coming to the closing ceremony would travel by road and would meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in, an official in Moon’s office said. \nMoon won election last year promising to try to improve relations with the North. \nNam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University in Seoul, said the North was sending a message by including Kim Yong Chol in the delegation. \n“Given Kim Yong Chol’s reputation as the mastermind behind the Cheonan sinking, the North could believe his meeting with Moon would help dilute the negative image of him and the country”, Nam said. \nQUESTIONS OVER COST Ivanka Trump would have dinner with Moon on Friday and she had no plan to meet the North Korean officials, a senior U.S. administration official said. \nPence had been scheduled to meet Kim Yo Jong before the North Koreans canceled the meeting at the last minute, U.S. officials said. \nNam said the North Korean delegation would not want to be over-shadowed by Ivanka Trump. \nThe South’s Unification Ministry did not specify where Kim Yong Chol’s delegation would stay. \nKim Yo Jong and her entourage stayed at a five-star riverside hotel in Seoul. \nSome South Korean opposition legislators and conservative groups have questioned the amount South Korea spent on the North Korean delegation that attended the opening of the Games. \nA South Korean government official said 240 million won ($223,000) had been spent on Kim Yo Jong and her entourage during their three-day visit. \nThe International Olympic Committee paid about $50,000 for the training and preparation of North Korea’s 22 Olympic athletes, or about $2,300 each. \nNone of the athletes has won a medal. \nReporting by Christine Kim and Hyonhee Shin; Additional reporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Paul Tait, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T09:03:14.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
