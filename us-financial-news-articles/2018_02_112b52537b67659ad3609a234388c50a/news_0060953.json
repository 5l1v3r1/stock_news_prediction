This translated to an 18 percent increase in revenue to HK$23.1 billion.\nGalaxy said it was exploring opportunities in the Philippines to develop a beach resort on the Boracay Island. Galaxy currently does not operate any casinos outside Macau.\nThe Macau casino industry is recovering from a more than two-year decline that coincided with a government campaign against ostentatiousness among public officials.\nMacau’s overall market has grown over the past year, with new resorts intensifying competition for casino operators such as Wynn Macau Ltd, MGM China Holdings Ltd, SJM Holdings Ltd, Sands China Ltd and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd.
