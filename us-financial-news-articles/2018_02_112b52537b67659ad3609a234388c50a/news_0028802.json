In January it said it would spin off its sportswear brand Puma to focus more squarely on its luxury brands.\nOverall revenues at Kering rose to 4.26 billion euros ($5.25 billion) in the fourth quarter, up 27.4 percent year-on-year on a comparable basis, which strips out acquisitions and currency swings.\nThat marked a slight slowdown from the 28.4 percent growth notched up in the previous three months but beat a 24.3 percent analyst poll by Inquiry Financial.\n\"Kering delivered a phenomenal year in 2017,\" Chairman and Chief Executive Francois-Henri Pinault said in a statement, adding that the global environment remained uncertain but that Kering could do \"much better than our markets\" in 2018.\nMomentum at Gucci, which was reinvented with a flamboyant new look under designer Alessandro Michele, also eased a little yet remained well above that of most major rival brands, with comparable sales growth of nearly 43 percent in the quarter.\nKering financial director Jean-Marc Duplaix told journalists that the group's Balenciaga label, for which it does not break out earnings, posted higher growth than Gucci in the second half of 2017.\nKering posted a 56.3 percent rise in adjusted operating income to 2.95 billion euros for 2017 as a whole, also beating forecasts, while full year revenues rose 27.2 percent on a comparable basis to 15.48 billion euros.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T12:36:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
