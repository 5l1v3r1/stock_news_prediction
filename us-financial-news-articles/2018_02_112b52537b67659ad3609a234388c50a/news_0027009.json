It says U.S. sanctions are to blame for the delays.\nBetween its sovereign bonds and the debt of PDVSA, Venezuela is behind on more than $1.6 billion in payments, with a good portion of it falling outside the grace periods, Japanese bank Nomura said in a recent note.\nLegal experts say PDVSA is vulnerable to litigation because its offshore assets could potentially be targeted by creditors.\nFor a graphic on PDVSA’s problems click: tmsnrt.rs/2vc01II (Reporting by Marc Jones; editing by Alexander Smith)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:49:18.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
