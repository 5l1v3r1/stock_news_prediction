But in recent years jihadists have extended their reach into wetter, more populated central regions.\nThey have also used Mali as a launchpad for raids into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger, including one last October that killed four U.S. Special Forces soldiers.\nLate last month, a landmine explosion in Mopti region killed 26 people and wounded several others, many of them from Burkina Faso. Two days later, unidentified gunmen killed at least 14 soldiers in a pre-dawn assault on a military camp in central Mali.\nReporting By Tiemoko Diallo; Writing by Aaron Ross; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T17:12:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
