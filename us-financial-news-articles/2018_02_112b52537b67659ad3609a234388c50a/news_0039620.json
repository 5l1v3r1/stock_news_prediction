An independent report from Deloitte showed the bank could have been worth up to 1.3 billion euros when it was sold.\nSantander carried out a 7-billion-euro capital raise to cover for property writedowns at Popular and said restructuring costs, including the lay-off of around 2,000 staff, could total 1.3 billion euros.
