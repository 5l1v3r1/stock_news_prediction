The technology and social media company announced earnings today that impressed Wall Street, including an EPS loss that was smaller than analysts predicted and revenue that beat estimates.\nAnalysts had feared a lack of progress from Snap, but the company dispelled those fears with an 8.9 million jump in global active daily users. It is also continuing to work on a redesign of the app, meant to make the app easier to use in the hopes of attracting older users.\nDisney shares rose over 2 percent in the extended session. The mass media and entertainment conglomerate announced revenue that just missed expectations, but an earnings beat of nearly 30 cents. The company's parks and resorts segment beat expectations on top and bottom lines, with numbers for parks and cruise ships improving significantly.\nThe company has been fighting the decrease in TV viewership through on-demand services and mobile apps. It has still suffered losses on the traditional side, but mobile growth has nearly made up for these losses. Disney's CEO just announced a new ESPN Plus streaming service, marking its first ever direct-to-consumer offering.\nChipotle Mexican Grill stock fell nearly 5 percent in extended trading, though EPS beat estimates and revenue was in line with expectations. Same-store sales still experienced sluggish growth, with predictions for growth in the coming year in the low single digits.\nOperating margins increased this quarter, but they look to stay the same in the coming year. The fast-casual chain is looking to improve its digital catering and guest experience as well as rebuild consumer trust by reinvesting into the company. This means lower margins but could have a good long-term payoff.\nGilead Sciences shares fell more than 2 percent after hours. The biopharmaceutical company beat financial expectations, with EPS of $1.78 and revenue of $5.95 billion.
