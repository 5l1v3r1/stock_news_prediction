The deal price was higher than the market expected, which will help CJ Cheiljedang cut debt and use as a war chest for mergers and acquisitions, analysts said.\nCJ HealthCare makes over-the-counter drugs and health foods. It recorded about 500 billion won in 2017 revenue, Korea Kolmar said.\nDeutsche Bank advised Kolmar on the transaction, while Morgan Stanley advised CJ Cheiljedang.\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T11:24:14.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
