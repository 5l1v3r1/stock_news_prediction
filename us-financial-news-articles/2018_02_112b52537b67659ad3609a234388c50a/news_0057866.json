Kofoid's appointment follows founder Irv Shapiro's decision to transition from CEO to Executive Chairman. The move comes at a time of accelerated growth for DialogTech, which analyzes more than 60 million minutes of voice conversations each month for businesses that rely on inbound calls to drive growth.\n\"I handpicked Doug for the COO role 13 months ago with this very promotion in mind,\" said Shapiro. \"To continue our exceptional growth, having an expert in martech/adtech at the helm of the organization is imperative. And that's what we get with Doug. He shares my vision to provide the world's biggest companies with the data and insights they need to convert inbound calls into revenue, while improving the entire customer experience. Today, DialogTech serves more Fortune 50 clients than any company in our space, and Doug is a critical part of that success.\"\nIn its first 10 years, DialogTech pioneered the science of call attribution, conversation analytics and caller experience optimization, becoming the leading provider in the industry.

Prior to Publicis, he was Director of Search Operations for Google/DoubleClick. He has over 20 years of executive experience in digital marketing.\n\"I am as humbled by this elevation as I am excited,\" said Kofoid. \"Irv pioneered an entirely new martech discipline when he launched DialogTech to deliver call analytics. By recognizing the insights that marketers could capture and leverage from customer conversations, he changed the game for companies who grow revenue by creating a better, more personalized experience. We are looking at our best year on record in 2018, and I'm thrilled to build on the momentum that Irv and the incredible DialogTech team have achieved.\"\nAs Executive Chairman at DialogTech, Shapiro will continue to help shape the strategic direction and trajectory of the company he founded in 2006. A self-proclaimed serial entrepreneur, Shapiro founded Metamor Technologies and the online education platform Edventions prior to launching DialogTech. Both companies were successfully sold. An inductee into the Chicago Area Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame, Shapiro has won numerous awards for leadership and tech innovation.\nAbout DialogTech\nDialogTech provides actionable marketing analytics for businesses that value inbound calls.
