If they don’t make concessions, this could put other factories at risk,” said Lee Hang-koo, a senior research fellow at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade.\nGM is proposing a base wage freeze and no bonuses this year along with a suspension of some benefits such as tuition for employees’ children and gold medals for long-serving workers.\nThe GM logo is seen at the General Motors Warren Transmission Operations Plant in Warren, Michigan October 26, 2015. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/Files “We hope to make meaningful progress in future negotiations with our labour union ... We see this as a positive signal,” a GM Korea spokesman said of the resumption of talks.\nGM has said its discussions with the union and the government must demonstrate significant progress by the end of February, when GM will make important decisions on its next steps.\nOver the past week, the union has come under intense pressure from South Korean conservative media to make wage concessions.\n“The conservative media are putting us in corner. We can’t just stand still,” a union official told Reuters. The union, however, plans to continue to hold rallies later on Tuesday and on Wednesday.\nGM executives and conservative opposition lawmakers contend South Korea’s relatively high wages and unyielding unions have contributed to the U.S. automaker’s problems in the country.\nBut the ruling party’s senior vice policy chief, Hong Ihkpyo, lashed back. “The labour union should share the pain, but GM Korea’s latest problems stem from GM’s failed global management,” he said in a radio interview.\nGM Korea and its South Korean shareholder Korea Development Bank (KDB) have agreed to appoint a third-party accounting firm to conduct due diligence on GM Korea before a decision on government support is made.\nKDB Chairman Lee Dong-geol told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that the state-run bank would take legal action against GM if any irregularities were found during the process.\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Stephen Coates and Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T08:22:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
