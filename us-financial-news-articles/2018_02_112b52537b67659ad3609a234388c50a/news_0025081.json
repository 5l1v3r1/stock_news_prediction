If any wrongdoing is found we will take fast and decisive action and do everything possible to prevent future misconduct.” \nNovartis said publicity surrounding the case, at least so far, “appears driven in large part by the selective leaking of portions of a confidential and preliminary investigative file.” \nIt also cited reports that it says have included “many sensational and unfounded claims in a politicized debate.” Reporting by John Miller; Editing by David Holmes", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T12:07:50.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
