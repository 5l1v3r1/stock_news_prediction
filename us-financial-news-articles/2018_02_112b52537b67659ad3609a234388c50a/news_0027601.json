Jiangsu’s Xuzhou, a big steel production zone, was identified as China’s most polluted city in December. \nWhile China has claimed initial success in its four-year “war on pollution”, average PM2.5 in January remained far higher than the state standard of 35 micrograms. The World Health Organization recommends no more than 10 micrograms. \nChina’s anti-smog campaign has also not been without controversy, with businesses complaining that Beijing’s “one size fits all” approach has harmed their interests. \nAn over-ambitious attempt to convert millions of households from coal to natural gas heating has also proved a major challenge, with many villages left without gas supplies during parts of the freezing winter.
