Earlier to develop a specific product for India was the need of the hour,” said Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst at research firm, IHS Markit.\n“Now Indian customers want global products,” he said, adding that a government push to adopt stricter emission norms is also driving the switch to global models.\nPassenger vehicle sales in India grew about 9 percent in 2017 to 3.2 million units, industry data showed. India is expected to become the world’s third-largest car market by 2020.\nOn Wednesday, Toyota unveiled the Yaris sedan ahead of the car show. The car, which will compete with Honda’s City sedan and Hyundai’s Verna sedan, is expected to go on sale after April.\n($1 = 64.1300 Indian rupees)\nReporting by Aditi Shah; Editing by Euan Rocha and Miral Fahmy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T12:34:01.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
