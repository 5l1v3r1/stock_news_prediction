I couldn't guarantee we would have the votes by the end of February,\" he said. That was the government's deadline for passing the bill before lawmakers turned their attention to securing their seats in the October general election. \nPension reform is the cornerstone policy in Temer's efforts to bring a bulging budget deficit under control. Generous pension benefits and early retirement have turned social security into the main driver of a deficit that cost Brazil its investment grade. \nMarun, the cabinet minister charged with mobilizing coalition support in Congress, said pension reform would become a key issue in the election campaign if Congress did not take it up again. \nThe legislation to streamline social security, which required amending the constitution, was lined up for a first vote in the lower house of Congress this week. \nBut on Friday the government ordered the army to take over command of police forces in Rio de Janeiro state in a bid to curb violence driven by drug gangs, an intervention that blocks any constitutional changes during its duration. \nTemer decreed the Rio intervention through Dec. 31, his last day in office.
