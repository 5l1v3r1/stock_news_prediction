Ontario procurement agencies would be required to exclude companies from the U.S. state.\nOntario’s Liberals, who have ruled for almost 15 years, face a tight challenge from conservatives in June elections.\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo in December signed “Buy American” legislation mandating the purchase of U.S.-made steel and iron products for public road and bridge construction. Texas implemented a similar law came in September.
