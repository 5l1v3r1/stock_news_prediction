Echoing that practice, women hurl sticks at men, who try to escape. Those who get caught are made to wear women’s clothing and dance.\nThe main festival is on Friday this year but celebrations begin a week early in the town of Vrindavan, Krishna’s birthplace.\nThe town is home to Hindu widows who are made to forgo adornments and cannot return to their families after the death of their husbands. But on Holi, they sing and dance and play with colors before they go back to their sequestered lives.\nReporting by Neha Dasgupta; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:48:08.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
