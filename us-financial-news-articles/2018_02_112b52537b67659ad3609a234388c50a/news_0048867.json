Moorer, USN in Earning Service Academy Distinction\nARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CACI International Inc ( NYSE: CACI ) announced today that CACI Board of Directors member General William Scott Wallace has been honored with the Distinguished Graduate Award from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The award is given to graduates of the Academy whose character, distinguished service, and stature embody the qualities for which West Point strives, in keeping with its motto: “Duty, Honor, Country.” A member of CACI’s Board since 2009, General Wallace is the second CACI Board Director to have received a service academy Distinguished Graduate Award. Former Board member Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, USN (Ret.) was the recipient of the U.S. Naval Academy’s very first Distinguished Graduate Award in 1999.\nCACI Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board Dr. J.P. (Jack) London noted, “I am extremely proud that my fellow Director General William Scott Wallace has been honored with the Distinguished Graduate Award from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. General Wallace’s leadership continues the CACI Board’s long history as a governing body with significant vision and expertise. This includes the late Admiral Tom Moorer, who also received the U.S. Naval Academy’s Distinguished Graduate Award. We thank General Wallace for his outstanding contributions to CACI’s successful support of America’s defense and national security, and we congratulate him on this fine achievement.”\nBefore retiring as a four-star general in 2008, General Wallace was Commanding General of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command and the architect of the Army’s reorganization in continuation of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prior to this, he was Commanding General of the Army Combined Arms Center, where he was responsible for the development of new and emerging Army and Joint doctrine, providing the intellectual foundation for military leadership in the 21st century. As Commander of the Fifth U.S. Corps during the opening campaign of Operation Iraqi Freedom, he led 140,000 soldiers from Kuwait to Baghdad, and subsequently directed the occupation of Western and Northern Iraq. His military career includes serving as Commander of the Joint Warfighting Center, Commanding General of the 4th Infantry Division – the Army’s first “digitized” division that incorporated new C4ISR technologies – and Commanding General of the National Training Center. His many military honors include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Army Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the Legion of Merit with four oak leaf clusters, the Bronze Star, and the Meritorious Service Medal with oak leaf cluster. He graduated from West Point in 1969.\nAccording to General Wallace, “I am deeply honored to receive the U.S. Military Academy Distinguished Graduate Award. Throughout my career, I have committed to putting into action the values I learned at West Point, and to pass on to others the dedication to excellence and integrity that the Academy instills in all its cadets. It is a pleasure to work alongside my esteemed colleagues on CACI’s Board of Directors, and I look forward to continuing to serve the company in supporting our nation.”\nCACI provides information solutions and services in support of national security missions and government transformation for Intelligence, Defense, and Federal Civilian customers.
