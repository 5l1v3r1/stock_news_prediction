He was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-VW chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of Volkswagen’s controlling clan who was himself ousted in 2015.\nHis position as CEO has been questioned before but so far Audi’s board has rallied around him.\nReporting by Emma Thomasson, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T22:53:55.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
