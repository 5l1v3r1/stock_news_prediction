Shell says the market for LNG grew by 29 million tons last year, 30 percent more than previously expected. \nTrading in LNG reached 293 million tons in 2017, up from just 100 million tons at the turn of the century. At nearly 300 million tons, suppliers shipped enough LNG last year to power about 575 million homes, by Shell’s count. \nLNG is playing a growing role in the energy mix as nations around the world seek to mitigate the impacts of climate change. While natural gas is a carbon-emitting fossil fuel, it burns cleaner than coal and heating oil.

That’s nearly as much as Indonesia, the world’s fifth-largest LNG exporter, produced in 2017.” \nAt the heart of the problem, says Shell, is a sea change in the way importing nations purchase LNG. Traditionally, sellers entered into long-term contracts with customers, an arrangement that allowed them to underwrite investments in the massive facilities that process natural gas and ship it abroad in its super-chilled liquid form.

So-called spot deliveries of LNG, or shipments made on an as-needed basis, increased 17 percent in 2017 to an all-time high 1,100 cargoes. \nThese contracts allow buyers to take advantage of price fluctuations, a trend that should continue as several countries seek to establish LNG trading hubs. The rise of the hubs is expected to increase liquidity and transparency in pricing, similar to the development of benchmark crude oil futures years ago. \nBut in the interim, the disconnect between buyers and sellers’ preferences threatens to inject uncertainty into the industry and cause suppliers to hold off approving investments in new facilities. \nIn 2017, China surpassed South Korea to become the world’s second-largest LNG importer. The nation’s LNG imports reached 38 million tons last year as Beijing aims to reduce the nation’s reliance on coal-fired power, according to Shell.

Africa is also driving growth as several oil giants ramp up projects on the continent.
