Authorities estimated financial settlements from the accused would net about $100 billion.\nIn late January, a BBC broadcast featured a Canadian businessman who said he had spoken with the prince via video link and that the prince appeared to be sitting in jail rather than at the five-star hotel. Saudi Arabia’s authorities had converted the hotel into a luxury prison where hundreds of the kingdom’s wealthiest figures were being held.\nReuters reached out to Saudi authorities for comment; they denied the allegations. Then, they invited us to see Prince Alwaleed at the Ritz for ourselves.\nThe interview was arranged within hours. At 1:00 a.m. on Jan. 27, a government car picked me up and drove me through the hotel’s massive front gates. It was the first time I had seen them open in nearly three months.\nAfter a brief wait and a tour of the hotel’s empty facilities, I was escorted to an ornate sixth-floor suite where Prince Alwaleed was waiting.\nOfficials told me not to film outside the suite or catch any of them on camera. No conditions were placed on the interview itself.\nFILE PHOTO: A view shows part of the suite where Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has been detained, at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia January 27, 2018. REUTERS/Katie Paul/File Photo The prince promptly took control, ushering me into the office and enthusiastically granting permission to film. The officials exited the room, leaving only the two of us throughout our 25-minute discussion.\nPrince Alwaleed said he had been treated well during his time at the Ritz.\nHe took a defiant stance on the accusations of corruption, saying that he was innocent and that he was certain he would emerge from the process in full control of his assets and his company, Kingdom Holding.\nIt is impossible to know if Prince Alwaleed was truly free to speak his mind, given that he was still in detention as part of an extrajudicial legal process.\nHe appeared thin, but he was confident and upbeat, even making jokes as he took me on a tour of the suite. He smiled broadly and insisted that we take a photo together.\nI recorded our exchange on my iPhone, propped up by a golden tissue box and a water bottle on his desk.\nHours later, the prince was released.\nReuters interview with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal at goo.gl/gS4Zsn\nReporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:42:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
