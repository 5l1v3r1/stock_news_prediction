The timeline for a U.S. approval decision is now far less certain.\nJefferies analyst Michael Yee said it was “extremely unlikely that there is an inherent regulatory problem.”\nHe said it was “merely a delay and yet another short term problem that does not inspire Street confidence.”\nUpon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the new drug application are insufficient to permit a complete review, the company said.\nCelgene said it intends to seek immediate guidance from the FDA to determine what additional information will be required to resubmit the application.\n“We will work with the FDA to expeditiously address all outstanding items and bring this important medicine to patients,” Jay Backstrom, Celgene’s chief medical officer and head of global regulatory affairs, said in a statement.\nWall Street analysts had forecast ozanimod sales of about $263 million in 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data, a figure that will likely have to come down with any significant delay. Annual sales of the drug are projected to reach $3.46 billion by 2024.\nOzanimod is also being tested for Crohn’s disease and in combination with Celgene’s psoriasis drug Otezla for ulcerative colitis.\nCelgene shares were down 7.7 percent at $88.33 in extended trading.\nReporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by David Gregorio and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T00:32:39.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
