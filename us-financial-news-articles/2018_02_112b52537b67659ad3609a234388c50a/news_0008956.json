I want to find some good chance to announce some concrete timing in the market,” Yutaka Sanada, Nissan’s regional head, said when asked about the company’s plans for “e-Power” technology in Southeast Asia.\nHe said the technology was a “very good bridge” to attract car buyers to try electric vehicles as it gave the experience of driving an electric car, but did not require charging stations.\nCurrently, electric cars account for a small portion of the market in Southeast Asia, due to low affordability and the lack of charging infrastructure.\nFor example, the share of hybrid and electric vehicles in 2017 was less than 2 percent in Thailand and 0.4 percent in Indonesia compared with Japan’s 27.3 percent, data from LMC Automotive shows.\nSanada said that while there were no immediate plans to produce electric vehicles in Southeast Asia, Nissan would consider local manufacturing depending on market growth.\n“Once regional demand is to some size, of course in order to keep efficiency, we consider local production. It is normal for all manufacturers,” said Sanada, a regional senior vice president at Nissan.\nHe said the company was discussing a number of ideas, including the expansion of charging stations, with the government in Thailand, which is offering incentives to car manufacturers to localize.\nSuch discussions included potentially manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries in the country, but there were no concrete plans yet, Sanada said.\nReporting by Aradhana AravindanEditing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T13:33:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
