The size of the bankruptcy loan could not be learned.\nThe York, Pennsylvania -based retailer has also retained law firm Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor for its filing, in addition to attorneys from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the sources added.\nBon-Ton declined to comment. Young Conaway and Paul Weiss did not respond to requests for comment.\nBon-Ton serves smaller communities in 26 states across the U.S. Northeast, Midwest and Great Plains under banners including Bon-Ton, Younkers, and Bergner's.\nMacy's and competitors shuttering their stores has helped Bon-Ton in some communities it operates in, the retailer said in a business plan released this week.\nThe company had been looking for an investor to infuse new money into the firm ahead of a bankruptcy protection filing as part of a plan of reorganization, according to disclosures the company had made this week. Those plans called for the retailer's $350 million in bonds to take the equity in a reorganized company.\nThe company's bonds on Thursday were trading at about 15 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nOn Wednesday, Bon-Ton disclosed the 42 stores it will shutter across the country, with the bulk concentrated in Illinois , Indiana , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin .\nIn its business plan, Bon-Ton said its offerings in private label brands and e-commerce presence both need improvement to competes with the lines of Macy's , Kohls , and JC Penney .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T17:25:57.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
