REUTERS/Carlos Barria “We decided that we would change the skis because fresh skis are so much quicker than skis that have been used for 20km,” Paasanen explained.\n“That was an example of the sisu - you get the 10 seconds that he was behind, and then you fight for the gold,” Paasanen said.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “It is a very strong mental thing for us -- if we decide to do something, we do it, and with Iivo there was lots of sisu today,” Niskanen’s friend and team mate Ristomatti Hakola told Reuters.\n“There is some mythology also but it’s true that it’s in the Finnish people. It’s a very strong mental thing.”\nWinter sports are hugely popular among the Finns but results have not always been great for the Nordic underdogs.\n“It’s very important that we get it (the gold) from cross-county skiing, and for me it’s very important that one of my best friends gets the gold medal, and it’s very important for Finnish cross-country. It’s a very big thing,” said Hakola.\nEditing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T11:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T11:50:08.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
