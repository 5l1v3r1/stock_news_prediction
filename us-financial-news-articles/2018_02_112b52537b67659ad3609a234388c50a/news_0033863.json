Shortly afterwards, the palace announced he had dementia.\nAs in most monarchies, a Danish princess becomes queen when her husband takes the throne, but a man does not become king through being married to a queen.\nFILE PHOTO: Filer from 2017 showing Danish Queen Margrethe and her husband prince Henrik.

They have two sons, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim.\nBoth loved and criticized by the Danes for his aristocratic manner, exemplified by his colourful clothes and thick French accent, in recent years Henrik found support particularly amongst the Danish youth for breaking with Danish norms.\nKnown for his love of wine and food, the prince also wrote poetry, made sculptures and published cookery books.\nHe was diagnosed with a benign tumour two weeks ago and was later transferred from a Copenhagen hospital to Fredensborg Castle, where he had wanted to spend his last moments.\nThe funeral service will be a ceremony for his family at Christiansborg Slotskirke in Copenhagen on Feb. 20.\nWriting by Teis Jensen; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T06:35:27.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
