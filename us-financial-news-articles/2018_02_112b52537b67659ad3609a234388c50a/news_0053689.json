Their disappearance would deliver another blow to a U.S. organized labor movement already in a diminished state compared to past decades.\nThe justices considered a similar case in 2016, and after hearing arguments appeared poised to overturn a 1977 Supreme Court precedent that let unions force non-members covered by contracts negotiated by organized labor to pay fees in lieu of union dues to help cover non-political union expenditures.\nBut the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia the following month left the court with an even split of conservatives and liberals, and its 4-4 ruling in March 2016 did not resolve the legal question.\nRepublican President Donald Trump’s appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch last year restored the Supreme Court’s 5-4 conservative majority. Gorsuch could cast the deciding vote in dooming agency fees.\nDepriving unions of agency fees could hamstring their ability to spend in political races. They typically back Democratic candidates over Republicans.\nThe 2016 case was brought by non-union California public school teachers. The plaintiff in the current case is Mark Janus, a child-support specialist for the state of Illinois who opted not to join the union that represents employees like him, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).\nIn both cases, the challengers argued that being forced to pay the agency fees to unions whose views they may not share violates their rights to free speech and free association under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment.\nUnions in both cases contended that mandatory agency fees are needed in order to eliminate the problem of what they call “free riders” -- non-members who benefit from union representation, for example through salary and working conditions obtained in collective bargaining -- without actually paying for it.\n‘I LOSE MY JOB’\nJanus, 65, is backed in the legal fight by anti-union groups including the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation.\nHe said in an interview he is not a member of a political party and his objection to the fees was not based on politics. Janus said he has chafed at having to pay the fees, currently just under $50 a month, since starting his current stint working for Illinois in 2007.\n“I don’t agree with the fact that someone is telling me I have to support something without asking me about that. This is not freedom of association. If I don’t pay, I lose my job,” Janus said.\nAFSCME and other public-sector unions have called the case a well-funded attack by corporations and billionaires to undermine organized labor.\n“This case is about power,” American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said.\n“The funders of this case want a new Gilded Age, this time on steroids,” Weingarten added, referring to a period in the late 19th century known for its concentration of wealth among industrialists.\nTwenty-four states have agency fee requirements. While 28 states have so-called right-to-work laws that prohibit mandatory agency fees, Wisconsin and Michigan have exceptions for police officers and firefighters that permit agency fees covering those workers. In those right-to-work states, unions still represent workers but membership rates are lower.\nFederal employee unions cannot collect agency fees.\nThe union membership rate among public-sector workers was nearly 35 percent in 2017, more than five times higher than the unionization rate for workers in the private sector, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show. The case does not affect private-sector unions.\nTaking away mandatory agency fees could have profound implications for public-sector union coffers. Unions in New York state, for example, would lose an estimated $110 million per year without mandatory fees from non-members, according to the business-backed Empire Center for Public Policy.\nReporting by Robert Iafolla and Lawrence Hurley; ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T14:19:08.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
