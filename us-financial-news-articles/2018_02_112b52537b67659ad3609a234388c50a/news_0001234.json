This invite-only exclusive gala will be taking place on February 11, 2018 in Los Angeles and will feature: Live Music, a cigar room, silent auction (with all proceeds going to the Make-A-Wish Foundation®), food and drinks and entertainment to fill the evening.\nTrophy Automotive Dealer Group (TADG) was established in 2013 and acquired Mercedes-Benz of Encino in 2014. They have recently acquired 4 more dealers, namely, Mercedes-Benz of Valencia, Kia Downtown Los Angeles, West Covina Nissan and Universal City Nissan, which used to be the top-selling Nissan dealership in the nation. TADG has plans to acquire more dealerships and become one of the largest dealer groups in the country. They plan to differentiate themselves from their competitors by being employee focused, innovative, creative and outside of the box thinkers. Each client will experience a one-of-a-kind, and uniquely individualized, experience once they enter any of the dealerships’ showrooms.\nNasser Watar, Chairman & CEO of Trophy Automotive Dealer Group LLC stated, “TADG has been represented in the market with one of the top performing Mercedes-Benz dealerships in the nation and we are excited to expand our automotive footprint in the Los Angeles area with these acquisitions, making us one of the largest automotive dealer groups in the state of California in number of vehicles sold. With our Group’s focus to support customers throughout the car buying process from start to finish, TADG provides customers with the necessary information in a transparent manner to assist in making an informed car buying decision.”\n“Our key priority and a pillar of our business is to ensure that we deliver a class-leading Customer Ownership Experience, from the first time a customer interacts with our dealerships, whether online or in person, and throughout each customer’s journey with their vehicle. Training & Development of our staff will be a key area, in order to ensure every TADG employee is equipped with all the tools to provide customers with the care and experience they deserve when going through the important decision of purchasing a new vehicle,” said Nasser Watar. In addition to new vehicle sales, TADG will also focus on the used cars division and after-sales service experience to ensure the highest level of customer satisfaction.\n“These new acquisitions are part of our growth plan and our expectation is that our acquisition will see these dealerships also become trophy dealerships in sales and total customer experience. Furthermore, I would like to thank all of those that assisted us during the process of this acquisition especially the OEMs, our acquisition staff and employees of the dealerships that are part of the acquisition,” said Nasser Watar. “I’m confident that TADG will focus on delivering each brand’s respective brand promise and provide unparalleled customer satisfaction and total customer experience through innovative solutions and we are excited for the new opportunities to come,” said Nasser Watar.\nTADG has always believed in community outreach and a long-held belief in giving back. That is why they have partnered with the Make-A-Wish Foundation® with this event with all proceeds from their silent auction, and on-site donation boxes, going directly to the charity. Make-A-Wish Foundation® grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy.
