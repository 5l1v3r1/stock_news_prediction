(Nasdaq:DEPO) today reported financial results for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and provided an update to the business.\n“2017 was a challenging year for Depomed, and in response we have taken decisive steps to strengthen and diversify our business,” said Arthur Higgins, President and CEO of Depomed. “During the fourth quarter, we not only introduced but also began to implement our new three pillar strategy of Maintain, Grow and Build positioning the company for improved profitability in 2018 and beyond.”\nBusiness and Financial Highlights\nFull year net revenues were $381 million Full year GAAP net loss of ($102) million or ($1.63) per share Full year non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $117 million Fourth quarter 2017 net revenues were $94 million Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP net loss of ($33) million or ($0.52) per share Fourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $33 million Fourth quarter 2017 ending cash and marketable securities were $128 million NUCYNTA ® Commercialization Agreement with Collegium Pharmaceutical provides minimum royalties on net sales of NUCYNTA ® and NUCYNTA ER ® Acquisition of rights to cosyntropin (Synthetic ACTH Depot) creates new specialty/orphan franchise Lazanda ® sale to Slán Medicinal Holdings Company restructuring and corporate headquarters relocation aligns with new business model\nCollegium Pharmaceutical Commercialization Agreement Maintains a Strong NUCYNTA® Franchise\nIn January 2018, Depomed closed a Commercialization Agreement with Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“Collegium”) under which Collegium will commercialize both NUCYNTA Extended Release and NUCYNTA Immediate Release and, in exchange, for the first four years of the agreement, Depomed expects to receive a minimum royalty of $135 million per year.\nSlán Medicinal Holdings Strategic Asset Transaction Diversifies Portfolio and Creates New Specialty/Orphan Franchise\nIn November 2017, Depomed entered into a Strategic Asset Transaction with Slán Medicinal Holdings Limited (\"Slán\") under which Depomed acquired from Slán the rights to market the specialty drug candidate, cosyntropin (Synthetic ACTH Depot) in the United States and divested its Lazanda (fentanyl) nasal spray CII to Slán. This transaction formed the foundation of Depomed’s new Specialty/ Orphan portfolio. Under the terms of the agreement, West Therapeutic Development, a subsidiary of Slán, is expected to submit a New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a to-be-disclosed first indication for cosyntropin in late 2018, with the goal of a potential launch in late 2019 or early 2020. In parallel, Depomed is pursuing a second indication for cosyntropin in infantile spasms, a specific seizure type seen in infantile epilepsy syndrome.\nNeurology Salesforce Expansion Expected to Grow Business\nIn September 2017, Depomed expanded its Neurology salesforce to 90 representatives who are focused on Gralise®, CAMBIA®, and Zipsor®. The Company believes this sales platform will increase sales of these products and allow for the potential addition of other neurology-based product acquisitions.\nCorporate Restructuring and Corporate Headquarters Relocation Aligns with New Business Model\nIn December 2017, Depomed announced a restructuring and headquarters relocation to align Depomed’s staff, office size and location with its new business model. The restructuring reduces headquarters’ staff by approximately 40% and the headquarters’ office space requirement by 50%. The Company is in negotiations to move to a yet to be disclosed location and expects to be fully operational in its new headquarters in the third quarter of 2018.\nPuerto Rico Product Supply Update\nResults for the fourth quarter of 2017 were negatively impacted by shortages of certain dosage strengths of NUCYNTA ER. While Depomed’s manufacturing partner for NUCYNTA ER has informed us that their plant is now fully operational, they are still working to fill back orders. As a result, there have been spot outages of certain strengths of NUCYNTA ER. While this situation may continue into the future, the Company believes that, based on current information, supply should return to normalized levels by mid-March 2018.\nCebranopadol Development Update\nIn January 2018, consistent with the Company’s decision to cease commercialization of opioids, Depomed provided to Grünenthal GmbH (“Grünenthal”), 120 days’ written notice of the termination of the December 2015 license agreement between Depomed and Grünenthal and returned to Grünenthal the U.S. and Canadian rights to cebranopadol, an opioid analgesic in development for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic nociceptive and neuropathic pain.\nRevenue Summary\nREVENUES (GAAP BASIS) (in thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 (1) 2016 Product sales, net: Nucynta products $ 60,018 $ 74,693 $ 239,539 $ 281,261 Gralise 20,208 24,995 77,034 88,446 Cambia 7,749 8,373 31,597 31,273 Lazanda 1,770 7,454 15,010 26,547 Zipsor 4,415 8,160 16,700 27,539 Total product sales, net 94,160 123,675 379,880 455,066 Royalties 248 236 844 831 Total revenues (GAAP Basis) $ 94,408 $ 123,911 $ 380,724 $ 455,897 (1) In the the first quarter of 2017, the Company reserved an incremental $4.7 million associated with a dispute with a pharmacy benefit manager. This dispute was settled in the fourth quarter of 2017 at an amount equal to the Company'sreserve. The $4.7 million has been allocated to the specific products subject to the dispute and settlement.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe Company is providing the following 2018 financial guidance.\nGuidance Neurology Franchise Net Sales $120 to $125 million GAAP SG&A Expense $123 to $133 million GAAP R&D Expense $11 to $16 million Non-GAAP SG&A Expense $110 to $120 million Non-GAAP R&D Expense $10 to $15 million GAAP Net Loss ($72) to ($82) million Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA $125 to $135 million As the Company is no longer responsible for the commercialization of the NUCYNTA franchise, the Company is not providing revenue guidance on total revenue. The difference between GAAP Expenses and Non-GAAP Expenses relates to stock based compensation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, basis, we have included information about non‑GAAP adjusted earnings, non‑GAAP adjusted earnings per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non‑GAAP financial measures, as useful operating metrics. We believe that the presentation of these non‑GAAP financial measures, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provides supplementary information to analysts, investors, lenders, and our management in assessing the Company’s performance and results from period to period. We use these non‑GAAP measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the Company’s performance, and in part, in the determination of bonuses for executive officers and employees. These non‑GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, net income or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non‑GAAP adjusted earnings and non‑GAAP adjusted earnings per share are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and represent GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP earnings (loss) per share adjusted to exclude amortization, IPR&D and non‑cash adjustments related to product acquisitions, stock‑based compensation expense, non‑cash interest expense related to debt, costs associated with the special meeting requests made by an activist investor and CEO transition, costs associated with an attempted debt refinancing, restructuring costs, adjustments associated with non-recurring legal settlements and disputes, and to adjust for the tax effect related to each of the non-GAAP adjustments. Non‑GAAP adjusted EBITDA is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude interest income, interest expense, amortization, IPR&D and non‑cash adjustments related to product acquisitions, stock‑based compensation expense, depreciation, taxes, transaction costs, restructuring costs, adjustments related to non-recurring legal settlements and disputes, costs associated with an attempted debt refinancing, the special meeting requests made by an activist investor, and CEO transition. Non‑GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non‑GAAP measures used by other companies.\nConference Call and Webcast\nDepomed will host a conference call today, Tuesday, February 27, 2018 beginning at 4:30 p.m. EST (1:30 p.m. PST) to discuss its results.
