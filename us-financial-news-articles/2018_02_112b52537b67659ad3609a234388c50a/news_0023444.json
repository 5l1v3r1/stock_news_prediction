The credit added 169 million euros to Neste’s operating profit in 2015.\nBiofuel blenders in the United States are eligible for a tax credit of $1 per gallon, and the benefit is shared between the buyer and seller.\nNeste exports renewable diesel to the U.S. market from its plants in Singapore and Rotterdam.\nEarlier this week, Neste posted better-than-expected 2017 earnings.\n($1 = 0.8168 euros)\nReporting by Tuomas Forsell; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:06:10.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
