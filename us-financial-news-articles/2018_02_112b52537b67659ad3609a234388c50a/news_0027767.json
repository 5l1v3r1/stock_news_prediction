REUTERS/Mukesh Gupta India has long accused Pakistan of training and arming militants and helping them infiltrate across the heavily militarised Line of Control into Jammu and Kashmir, its only Muslim majority state.\nThe head of the Jammu and Kashmir state police, S.P. Vaid, told reporters over the weekend that they had communications intercepts pointing to the JeM, which has emerged as a top group fighting hundreds of thousands of Indian forces in Kashmir.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The army said the attackers wore fatigues and had assault rifles, a grenade launcher and grenades.\nIn 2016, India said its elite troops had crossed the Line of Control into Pakistan and carried out a raid on militants after 18 soldiers were killed in an attack on an Indian army base in Kashmir.\nPakistan denies giving material aid to the fighters in Kashmir and says it only provides diplomatic and moral support to the Kashmiri people in their struggle for self-determination.\nOn Monday, Indian soldiers foiled an attack on another camp in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir.\nReporting by Kay Johnson in Islamabad and Fayaz Bukhari in Srinagar, writing by Rupam Jain in New Delhi, Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Nick Macfie\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T09:53:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
