The High Peace Council, the Afghan government agency designated to handle negotiations, has little or no power, and analysts say the Taliban hasn’t taken seriously.\nSince President Donald Trump announced a rejuvenated U.S. policy in Afghanistan in August, the U.S. has dramatically increased military pressure on the Taliban, especially through airstrikes. What U.S. military officials described earlier last year as a stalemate has turned in the government’s favor, they say. The aim of the increased pressure, U.S. and Afghan officials say, is to force the insurgent group into negotiations.\nYet the Taliban have more funds and sophisticated weapons that at any time since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. According to the Long War Journal, a reporting and analysis outlet run by the Foundation for Defense of Democracy, a Washington-based think-tank, 162 of the country’s 398 districts are either contested or controlled by the group.\nAt the same time, the Taliban face internal divisions over strategy and an external rival for pre-eminence among radical Islamists in the form of the local affiliate of Islamic State.\nLittle of what Mr. Ghani said on Wednesday was new. But in raising the prospect of peace talks with the Taliban, a group he vilified as terrorists after a spate of ferocious attacks in Kabul this year, his invitation represented a shift in tone as he considers running for another five-year term in presidential elections scheduled for next year.\nAfghan officials say back-channel contacts with the Taliban have continued through even the bloodiest episodes of war. But until now Mr. Ghani has offered little detail on his conditions for broader talks, prompting criticism among many war-weary Afghans that Mr. Ghani is pursuing a solely military solution, a prospect few here view as realistic.\nIn his speech Wednesday, Mr. Ghani posed the possibility that if the Taliban agreed to a cease-fire and engaged in efforts to reach a negotiated solution of the war, it could be removed from international blacklists and have its own office in Kabul. The government would also consider issuing passports to members of the Taliban and undertaking a prisoner swap, he said.\nSome observers said some elements of Mr. Ghani’s proposal appeared nonsensical. One Afghan political analyst noted, for instance, that the offer of Afghan passports in exchange for the Taliban’s participation in the peace process was odd because its members already have passports. More generally, he said, political recognition is a moot point for the group.\n“The Taliban see themselves as much more than a political entity” he said. “They already have a shadow cabinet and government.”\nWrite to Craig Nelson at craig.nelson@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-2821?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2821?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2821?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2821?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2821?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2821?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-02-28T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T23:53:57.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
