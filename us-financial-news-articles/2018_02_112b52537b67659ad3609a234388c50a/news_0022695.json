Most carriers are loaded in the United States for delivery to the Pacific coast of Mexico or South America.\nHouston-based Cheniere Energy, which owns and operates the Sabine Pass LNG export facility in Louisiana, has been expanding exports while building a new LNG plant near Corpus Christi, Texas, expected to come online in December.\nAn LNG plant is used to process natural gas for export.\nCheniere, which signed an agreement last month to sell trading firm Trafigura 1 million tonnes of LNG per year for 15 years beginning in 2019, plans to inaugurate a second liquefaction at Corpus Christi and a fifth train at Sabine Pass next year.\nU.S. LNG exports via the Panama Canal fell temporarily in September due to damages caused by Hurricane Harvey to several Texas and Louisiana ports, but have recovered in recent months, Quijano said. U.S. export capacity jumped to 18 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) last year from less than 2 Mtpa in 2015.\nPanama is trying to be more flexible for LNG transit bookings so exporters can choose to pass through the canal even if that was not originally planned, Quijano said.
