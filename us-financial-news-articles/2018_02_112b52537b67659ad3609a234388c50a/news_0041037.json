REUTERS/Kacper Pempel A spokesman for the executive also said the Commission was still analyzing whether Poland was or was not violating the court’s interim injunction issued last year, which ordered Poland to stop logging immediately.\nEXPANDED LOGGING QUOTA Poland’s Environment Minister Henryk Kowalczyk, who replaced Szyszko in January, said in a statement following the adviser’s opinion that Poland would analyze it in detail and repeated that Warsaw would comply with the court’s final judgment on the forest, which he expects most likely in April.\nOn Wednesday Kowalczyk will likely meet commissioner Karmenu Vela, responsible for environment, maritime affairs and fisheries, the executive spokesman also said.\n“We hope that minister Kowalczyk ... will put an end to the destructive policy of his predecessor and grant the whole of Bialowieza Forest national park status,” said Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer at ClientEarth, an environmentalist group.\nMost of the area of the forest in Poland is managed by three local units supervised by State Forests, the state-run body in charge of harvesting timber and protecting woodland.\nAbout one sixth of the area is a national park, which protects the best preserved fragment of Białowieza Forest.\nAs an interim measure, the ECJ said last year Poland would be fined 100,000 euros ($123,610) per day if it did not stop large-scale logging in the forest.\nLogging quotas to 2021 have already been reached and in one part of the forest an expanded quota, declared illegal by the European Commission, has been more than half filled despite an injunction, official forestry data shows.\n“In 2017 a total of almost 190,000 cubic meters of wood was logged in Bialowieza Forest, which is four times an average annual harvesting. The last time when such huge annual logging was reported was 30 years ago, in the communist era,” said a local activist group Camp for the Forest.\n“We have a bitter satisfaction following today’s opinion,” said Robert Cyglicki from Greenpeace. Nothing would change the fact that an area of about 19 sq km (7.3 sq miles) of Bialowieza had been “devastated”, he added.\nAdditional reporting by Gabriela Baczynska in BRUSSELS; editing by Philip Blenkinsop, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T12:18:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
