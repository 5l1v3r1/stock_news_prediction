Around 464,000 SPD members will complete a far more uncertain, but binding, mail ballot on Friday, with results due out on Sunday.\nMerkel also called for a renewal of Europe, saying the EU was vital to ensure that German interests were addressed globally, but was “too weak and too slow” at present, and urgent work was needed to address the current patchwork of different regulations on border security, defense and capital markets.\n“We need more commonality,” the chancellor said.\nShe said Europe’s largest economy would continue to show solidarity with those EU members who “did their homework” on financial matters, but not with those who relied on others to carry their burdens. “It will not be possible ... that others take a rest at our cost,” she said to loud applause.\nMerkel also underscored Germany’s commitment to a strong EU defense union and the NATO alliance. “We need to pick up the pace, we need a new dynamic. If Europe wants to be a global player, then it has to act like a global player.”\nReporting by Andrea Shalal and Michelle Martin; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:48:08.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
