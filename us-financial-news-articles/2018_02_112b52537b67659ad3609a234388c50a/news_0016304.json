(Nasdaq: APPS), the Company empowering operators and Original Equipment Manufacturers (\"OEMs\") around the globe with end-to-end mobile solutions, announced financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent Highlights:\nFiscal third quarter revenue totaled $38.0 million, representing 71% year-over-year growth. Operators & OEMs (\"O&O\") revenue of $22.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was up 93% when compared to the prior year period. The Company has surpassed 130 million total devices with Ignite installed to date. GAAP net loss for fiscal third quarter was $3.8 million, or ($0.05) per share. Non-GAAP adjusted net income 1 was $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA 2 during the fiscal third quarter increased to $1.2 million, as compared to a loss of $2.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $4.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP free cash flow 4 increased to $1.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to a loss of $4.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company's cash balance was $6.9 million as of December 31, 2017, up $1.0 million from the September 30, 2017 balance of $5.9 million. The gross principal amount of the convertible notes was $8.6 million as of December 31, 2017, down from $10 million as of September 30, 2017, as an additional $1.4 million in principal amount was converted by convertible note holders in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company has successfully launched \"Single-Tap\" Installs (rebranded from \"Ignite Delivers\") across multiple operators. Single-Tap functionality is designed to provide end users with frictionless access to desired applications while improving advertiser conversion rates and providing an added source of monetization for our carrier and OEM partners.\n\"The December quarter was a breakthrough quarter for Digital Turbine in many ways,\" said Bill Stone, CEO. \"We achieved positive non-GAAP adjusted net income 1 while also generating $1.4 million in free cash flow 4 . As we have stressed previously, establishing and maintaining a sustainably profitable business model was a primary objective for us in fiscal 2018. The performance in the fiscal third quarter was driven primarily by better-than-expected results in our O&O business as well as in our Content business. Strength in our core O&O business was attributable to improved per-device metrics with our key U.S. partners, added contributions from recently launched partners in the U.S. and abroad, and growing demand from an expanding roster of established brand advertisers.\"\n\"As proud as I am of the December quarter results reported here today, I am at least equally pleased with the progress we have made in recent months toward the development of a more comprehensive, more versatile, more scalable mobile delivery platform. We have worked hand-in-hand with valued partners around the world to develop creative new products and tailor new services designed to enhance the end-user experience while generating additional sources of monetization over the full lifecycle of a mobile device. I am tremendously excited about the inherent potential of our new-and-improved Ignite-driven platform moving forward, and I look forward to providing updates to our investors as many related new product and service offerings, including 'Single-Tap' and 'Smart Folders', gain traction in the marketplace over the next several quarters.\"\nMr. Stone concluded, \"As we wind toward the end of fiscal 2018 and prepare to embark on the new fiscal year, I cannot help but feel confident about the future of Digital Turbine. We have accomplished our primary fiscal 2018 objective by establishing a core business capable of generating positive cash flow on a sustainable basis. At the same time, and with the influential support of strategically-aligned partners, we have developed several new platform innovations that are helping us seize noteworthy momentum in the marketplace that should, in turn, contribute to the next phase of growth for the Company in fiscal 2019 and beyond.\"\nFiscal 2018 Third Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $38.0 million, representing an increase of 71% year-over-year. Advertising segment revenue of $24.2 million increased 49% year-over-year. Within Advertising, O&O revenue of $22.7 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 93% year-over-year. Growth in the O&O business was attributable to organic growth derived from fully ramped partners, as well as incremental contributions from partially ramped carrier and OEM partners added to the Ignite platform over the preceding 12 months. Importantly, the Company benefitted from substantially higher revenue-per-device with its four largest U.S. carrier partners during the quarter. Higher revenue-per-device metrics are reflective of higher average slot counts and strong advertiser demand for unique homescreen access.\nContent revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 reached an all-time high of $13.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of 128%. Growth within the Content business was driven by higher merchant spending levels, as well as the addition of new merchants and services, during the quarter.\nGAAP gross margin was 25% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted gross margin 3 was 27% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to 24% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin expansion year-over-year was driven by an improving revenue mix, as the higher-margin O&O business has increased from 53% of total revenue in the fiscal third quarter of 2017 to 60% of total revenue in the fiscal third quarter of 2018. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results for all referenced periods is provided in a table immediately following the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss included below.\nNet loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $3.8 million, or ($0.05) per share, as compared to the net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 of $2.6 million, or ($0.04) per share. Non-GAAP adjusted net income 1 was $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA 2 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.2 million, as compared to a loss of $2.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Growth in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was achieved primarily via the combination of gross profit growth in the O&O business and effective expense management. Please see 'Use of Non-GAAP Measures' at the end of this press release for the definition of Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to GAAP net loss.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on information available as of February 7, 2018, the Company expects full-year fiscal 2018 revenue of $123 million, representing 34% annual growth. The Company expects non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA 2 of $2.4 million for the full-year fiscal 2018, as compared to a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $8.9 million for fiscal 2017. The Company further expects to generate positive non-GAAP free cash flow 4 for the full-year fiscal 2018. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow differ from comparable GAAP measures in that they exclude certain cash and non-cash expenses, such as interest expense, foreign transaction gains (losses), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of derivatives and warrants, impairment of intangible assets, loss on disposal of fixed assets, and loss on extinguishment of debt. Digital Turbine is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. For example, the Company cannot predict its stock price, which under GAAP can have a significant impact on the fair values of derivatives and warrants. Therefore, Digital Turbine has not provided guidance for GAAP net loss or a reconciliation of the foregoing forward-looking adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance to GAAP net loss.\nAbout Digital Turbine, Inc.\nDigital Turbine operates at the convergence of media and mobile communications, connecting top mobile operators, OEMs and publishers with app developers and advertisers worldwide.

To participate, interested parties should dial 855-238-2713 in the United States or 412-542-4111 from international locations. A webcast of the conference call will be available at ir.digitalturbine.com/events .\nFor those who are not able to join the live call, a playback will be available through February 14, 2018. The replay can be accessed by dialing 877-344-7529 in the United States or 412-317-0088 from international locations, passcode 10116627.\nThe conference call will discuss guidance and other material information.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company's condensed financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), Digital Turbine uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. Reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables below.\nNon-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance, prospects for the future and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these Non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain expenses and benefits that may not be indicative of recurring core business operating results. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures that exclude such items when viewed in conjunction with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations enhance the comparability of results against prior periods and allow for greater transparency of financial results. The Company believes Non-GAAP measures facilitate management's internal comparison of its financial performance to that of prior periods as well as trend analysis for budgeting and planning purposes. The presentation of Non-GAAP measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n1 Non-GAAP adjusted net income/(loss) and EPS are defined as GAAP net income/(loss) and EPS adjusted to exclude the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, changes in the fair value of derivatives and warrants related to the September 2016 convertible notes offering, and tax adjustments due to updates resulting from finalization of a transfer pricing study. Readers are cautioned that Non-GAAP adjusted net income and EPS should not be construed as an alternative to comparable GAAP net income figures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of profitability or performance, which is the most comparable measure under GAAP.\n2 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is calculated as GAAP net loss excluding the following cash and non-cash expenses: interest expense, foreign transaction gains (losses), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of derivatives and warrants that are recorded related to the September 2016 convertible notes offering, other income / (expense), impairment of intangible assets, loss on disposal of fixed assets, and loss on extinguishment of debt. Readers are cautioned that Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of performance, which is the most comparable measure under GAAP.\n3 Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit and gross margin are defined as GAAP gross profit and gross margin adjusted to exclude the effect of intangible amortization expense, impairment of intangible assets, and depreciation of software. Readers are cautioned that Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit and gross margin should not be construed as an alternative to gross margin determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of profitability or performance, which is the most comparable measure under GAAP.\n4 Non-GAAP free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures. Readers are cautioned that free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of profitability, performance or liquidity, which is the most comparable measure under GAAP.\nNon-GAAP adjusted gross profit and gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP adjusted net income and EPS, and free cash flow are used by management as internal measures of profitability, performance and liquidity. They have been included because the Company believes that the measures are used by certain investors to assess the Company's financial performance before non-cash charges and certain costs that the Company does not believe are reflective of its underlying business.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release includes \"forward-looking statements\" the U.S. federal securities laws. Statements in this news release that are not statements of historical fact and that concern future results from operations, financial position, economic conditions, product releases and any other statement that may be construed as a prediction of future performance or events, including financial projections and growth in various products are forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date made and which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may, should one or more of these risks uncertainties or other factors materialize, cause actual results to those expressed or implied by such statements.\nThese factors and risks include:\nrisks associated with Ignite adoption among existing customers (including the impact of possible delays with major carrier and OEM partners in the roll out for mobile phones deploying Ignite) actual mobile device sales and sell-through where Ignite is deployed is out of our control risks associated with the timing of Ignite software pushes to the embedded bases of carrier and OEM partners risks associated with end user take rates of carrier and OEM software pushes which include Ignite new customer adoption and time to revenue with new carrier and OEM partners is subject to delays and factors out of our control risks associated with fluctuations in the number of Ignite slots across US carrier partners required customization and technical integration which may slow down time to revenue notwithstanding the existence of a distribution agreement risk that strong Apple iPhone sales could result in a disproportionately low amount of Android sales risks associated with delays in major mobile phone launches, or the failure of such launches to achieve the scale customer adoption that either we or the market may expect risks associated with the level of our secured and unsecured indebtedness ability to comply with financial covenants in outstanding indebtedness the difficulty of extrapolating monthly demand to quarterly demand the challenges, given the Company's comparatively small size, to expand the combined Company's global reach, accelerate growth and create a scalable, low-capex business model that drives EBITDA (as well as Adjusted EBITDA) challenges to realize anticipated operational efficiencies, revenue (including projected revenue) and cost synergies and resulting revenue growth, EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and free cash flow conversion from the Appia merger the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on our reported GAAP financial statements, particularly in regard to the Australian dollar ability as a smaller Company to manage international operations varying and often unpredictable levels of orders; the challenges inherent in technology development necessary to maintain the Company's competitive advantage such as adherence to release schedules and the costs and time required for finalization and gaining market acceptance of new products changes in economic conditions and market demand rapid and complex changes occurring in the mobile marketplace pricing and other activities by competitors pricing risks associated with potential commoditization of the A&P business as competition increases and new technologies, in particular Real Time Bidding, add pricing pressure developing RTB for A&P to the level required to compete in the increasingly important programmatic bidding area will require additional investment that, given the Company's limited resources, may not be available in the time or on the terms necessary derivative and warrant liabilities on our balance sheet will fluctuate as our stock price moves and will also produce changes in our income statement; these fluctuations and changes might materially impact our reported GAAP financials in an adverse manner, particularly if our stock price were to rise technology management risk as the Company needs to adapt to complex specifications of different carriers and the management of a complex technology platform given the Company's relatively limited resources, and other risks including those described from time to time in Digital Turbine's filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), press releases and other communications.
