That’s down from a prior forecast of 9 percent growth at the top line.\nIt gave a mid-point outlook of 4 percent sequential revenue growth in the second quarter and said it expected a segment result margin, a measure of core operational profitability, of 16 percent.\nInfineon’s first-quarter revenues came in at 1.78 billion euros, compared with a consensus forecast of 1.79 billion euros, according to 15 analysts.\nOperating income rose 25 percent from a year earlier to 206 million euros ($256 million), below average expectations of 231 million euros in a Reuters poll of analysts.\n“Infineon has made a strong start to the new fiscal year,” CEO Reinhard Ploss said in a statement. “Earnings and margin were better than forecast – despite the expected slight seasonal dip in revenues.” ($1 = 0.8035 euros) (Reporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Maria Sheahan)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:04:33.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
