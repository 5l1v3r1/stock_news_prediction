Profit from wind power alone jumped to 2.1 billion crowns from 878 million.\n“It is related to a number of new wind projects that are now starting to generate profits. We are also growing profits on the distribution side,” Hall told Reuters.\nThe focus for the company, which still has a savings programme underway and which competes with the likes of Germany’s E.ON and Finland’s Fortum, is to maintain investments while keeping costs under control.\nVattenfall unveiled an investment plan for 2018-2019 of 46 billion crowns, of which 13 billion was earmarked for wind power. Its earlier investment plan, for 2017-2018, totalled 50 billion.\nHall told Reuters he saw little change in electricity demand and prices in the short term. Longer-term, consumption was set to pick up in Vattenfall’s markets, he added.\nIn Sweden, this was likely to happen on the back of an industry shift towards more electricity and electric vehicles while in Germany, a shift in heating away from gas and oil would be a key factor, Hall said.\nVattenfall, which generates most of its electricity from nuclear power, in 2016 sold its lignite power operations in Germany and said it would focus investments on renewable power.\nIt proposed a dividend of 2.0 billion crowns or 24 percent of profit to its owner, the Swedish government, against a target range of 40–70 percent of profit after tax.\nIn the fourth quarter, Vattenfall reported an operating profit before items affecting comparability of 7.3 billion crowns ($920 million), up from a year-ago 7.1 billion.
