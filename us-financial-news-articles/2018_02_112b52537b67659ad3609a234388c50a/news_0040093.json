The first run is scheduled for 10.15 am local time on Sunday (0115 GMT, 8.15 pm ET Wednesday) with the second at 1.15 p.m.\nThe top 30 go out in reverse order for the second run to produce a provisional winner before the backrunners get their chance to enjoy the Olympic experience again. The skier with the best combined time over the two runs wins.\nWHO IS THE FAVOURITE? Austria’s Marcel Hirscher. The six-times World Cup overall winner, who took gold in the Alpine combined event on Tuesday, is the supreme technical skier of his generation.\nNorwegian Henrik Kristoffersen and Frenchman Alexis Pinturault, who won bronze in 2014 and silver behind Hirscher in the combined on Tuesday, will be looking for an upset or to contest the minor medals.\nAmerican Ted Ligety is the defending champion and could claim a record sixth medal in the giant slalom at the world championships and Olympics combined.\nWHICH COUNTRIES TRADITIONALLY DOMINATE? Austria and Switzerland have both won four gold medals. Pinturault, nicknamed The Kid from Courchevel, could give France their third gold. Austria have won a total 18 medals in men’s giant slalom but failed to get on the podium in 2010 and 2014.
