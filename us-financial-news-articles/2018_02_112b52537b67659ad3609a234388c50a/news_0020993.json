It's not as though most billionaires have the bulk of their fortunes sitting in a savings account.\nTo break down where the super rich keep their money, Jeff Desjardins at Visual Capitalist used data from the Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances from 2016 to show how wealth distribution varies for those with a net worth of $10,000 or $100,000 versus those who are worth $1 billion.\nCheck out the infographic below and click to enlarge.\nThe infographic reveals some key truths about the difference between a five-figure net worth and a much larger one. For example, for every net worth up to $1 million, the most important asset is the primary residence. And the larger the net worth, the larger the percentage that's tied up in non-liquid assets, such as business interests.\nThose who are worth less tend to have their wealth concentrated in more tangible assets such as a car.\nNo matter where you keep your money, the amount you have of it doesn't define if you're rich or not.
