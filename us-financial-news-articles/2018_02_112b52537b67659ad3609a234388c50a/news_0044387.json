Tomas Tatar scored the other goal, and Jimmy Howard made 26 saves.\nThere were no power-play goals. Nashville had just one opportunity, while Detroit was awarded three. Nashville had a 25-20 advantage in hits and an 18-17 edge in blocked shots.\nHartnell’s ninth goal off assists from Josi and Ellis just 4:18 into the game put Nashville on top. The Predators scored again a little over five minutes later when Turris gathered in a rebound of a Josi shot from the point. He steered the puck toward the goalpost and then behind the prone Howard.\nAthanasiou tallied midway through the second period on a breakaway after a lead pass from Dylan Larkin. Howard had stopped a Nashville breakaway attempt moments earlier.\nArvidsson got behind the Detroit defense after a pass from P.K. Subban and beat Howard on the stick side 4:50 into the third period to make it 3-1. Detroit pulled within one goal three minutes later when Tatar poked the puck past Saros during a scramble in front of the net.\nDetroit had a power play during the last 28 seconds but couldn’t get off a clean shot.\nThe Predators will seek their third straight victory on Thursday when they host the San Jose Sharks. The Red Wings, who have lost three of their past four, remain home to face the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:42:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
