(NASDAQ:TLF) reported today sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 and announced plans to release financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $24.5 million, up 1.7% over fourth quarter 2016. North America increased 2.1%, while International decreased 8.0%. The company’s 2017 EPS are expected to be negatively impacted by an estimated 3 cents from the new US tax law, primarily due to the deemed repatriation of accumulated overseas earnings and profits. Tandy’s 2017 financial results will be released on Wednesday, March 7, 2018 after the market closes. A conference call will be conducted by senior management at 10:00 am Eastern Time on Thursday, March 8, 2018, and will be accessible to the public by calling 877-312-5524 or 253-237-1144.

For both, reference conference ID number 5879805. This call will be webcast and accessible at the company’s web site at www.tandyleather.com .\nShannon Greene, CEO, commented, “We were pleased to deliver a strong finish to the year, with our sales improvement the result of new merchandising efforts, targeted holiday promotions – particularly Black Friday and Super Saturday, as well as the expanded December shopping hours in our US stores. By customer group, however, the trends we’ve seen all year continued as our retail customers accounted for a 7% sales increase, while our sales to our non-retail customers were down 5%. While we don’t like the negative trend with our non-retail customers, the decrease in the fourth quarter was less than the 9% that we had experienced through the first nine-months of 2017. If there is a silver lining, it is that the shift in customer mix to more retail and less non-retail supports our gross profit margin. I look forward to sharing more of our 2017 results and our long-term outlook and strategic plans in early March.”\nTandy Leather Factory, Inc., ( http://www.tandyleather.com ), headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, is a specialty retailer of a broad product line including leather, leatherworking tools, buckles and adornments for belts, leather dyes and finishes, saddle and tack hardware, and do-it-yourself kits.
