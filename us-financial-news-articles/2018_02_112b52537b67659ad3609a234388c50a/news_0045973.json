Cambodia, like Beijing, does not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation.\nFor its part, Taiwan has been upset that Taiwanese extortion suspects have been deported to China in the past and has accused Phnom Penh of acting at the behest of Beijing.\nThe deportations have come as relations between Beijing and Taipei have deteriorated, with China suspecting Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen of pushing for the island’s formal independence.\nShe says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan’s security and democracy.\nReporting by Prak Chan Thul; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T08:57:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
