Discussions are currently under way with Iccrea and Cassa Centrale Banca on their applications to establish the two significant groups ... the parent banks must draw up suitable capital strengthening plans to be put into effect as and when necessary,” he said. \nTurning to Italian banks in general, Visco called for lenders to be more efficient and pro-active in managing soured loans, especially those that are not yet in default, and to take advantage of new accounting rules to book more writedowns. \nHe said an in-depth review of business models was necessary to lift profitability in the face of technological and regulatory costs, further loan losses and rising competition in the asset management industry.
