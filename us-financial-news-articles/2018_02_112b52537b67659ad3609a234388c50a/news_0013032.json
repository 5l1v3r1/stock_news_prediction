They said they were prepared to camp in Tawergha if necessary, but turned back to their overnight stopping point in Harawa after trying to advance west toward Sirte, which is controlled by Misratan forces.\n“Now we have returned to Harawa because the security situation in the area where we were wasn’t good,” Mohamed al-Tawerghi, a community spokesman, told Reuters.\nRoads between Misrata and Tawergha were also reportedly blocked by Misratan groups.\nReporting by Ayman al-Warfalli and Ahmed Elumami; Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T07:31:51.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
