But when I saw the other guys fall out, I decided just to finish it because it’s our first race and I wanted to finish my first competition at the Olympics,” he told Reuters at the foot of the mountain.\nBorn in Slovenia to a Slovenian mother and a Kosovo-Albanian father, Tahiri has long dreamed of representing Kosovo at the Olympics, but the country, which lacks ideal skiing conditions, only received International Olympic Committee recognition in 2014.\nAlpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Alpine Combined – Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 13, 2018 - Albin Tahiri of Kosovo competes in the Men's Downhill part of the Men's Alpine Combined. REUTERS/Dominic Ebenbichler “They have mountains but the infrastructure is really bad. The chairlifts are really old, especially, the slope is not prepared all the time,” he said.\nFor that reason he trains mostly in Austria, Italy and Slovenia, where he lives, and has just graduated in dentistry -- a subject that seems to excite him as much as skiing.\n“During these years that I’ve been waiting for Kosovo becoming Olympic family I just simply decided not to wait and to study instead -- so I graduated in dentistry, which was my passion. Actually, oral surgery is my passion,” he added.\n“I just graduated now, I have one more year of internship and then I‘m thinking about full mouth reconstruction with implantation and so on, something like that, a bit of oral surgery, a bit of prosthetics. Maybe I’ll fix some things from the skiers... no, I‘m just kidding.”\nThe downhill specialist, who turns 29 on Thursday and has Kosovar relatives scattered as far afield as Canada, is already turning his thoughts to the 2022 Olympics in Beijing.\nAnd he sees a good fit between his sporting and dental interests: “With private practice I’ll have more money to train.”\nReporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T04:52:57.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
