BOND GLOOM \nIndian government bond yields have risen by 110 basis points since July and are on track to post a third straight quarter of increase, marking the sharpest rise since the 2013 currency crisis, due to worries about a hawkish RBI, fiscal slippage and high inflation. \nThat has forced the government to cancel some of its bond auctions including its last scheduled one for 110 billion rupees ($1.71 billion). \n“We wanted to send a message to the market that we are not comfortable with the high yields. That is why we cancelled the auctions,” said the second person, adding the government won’t seek to borrow the amount it would have raised at last week’s cancelled auction as it was comfortable with its cash position. \n“We are trying to give as much relief as possible. Even the gross borrowing number was not high,” the person said. \nIn the fiscal 2018-19 budget outlined last week, India’s government announced planned gross market borrowings of 6.06 trillion rupees ($94.34 billion), in line with market expectations. \nAttention is now turning to the RBI’s monetary policy outcome on Wednesday, with the RBI expected to toughen its rhetoric around inflation and lay the ground for a rate hike, as recent data has shown a marked acceleration in inflation within the economy. \nAnindya Das Gupta, managing director and head of trading at Barclays India, said the RBI’s comment about its inflation stance this week will be an important cue for markets. \n“If state banks stay away from buying and the RBI tone is hawkish, then we’re headed for higher yields in bond markets,” Das Gupta said. $1 = 64.2100 Indian rupees Reporting by Suvashree Dey Choudhury and Neha Dasupta; Editing by Euan Rocha and Sam Holmes", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:14:40.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
