The full results are expected for Monday.

Some of those will require the involvement of Congress. \nCorrea said the referendum was aimed at destroying his legacy. “The struggle continues,” he wrote via Twitter. “We cannot accept such a constitutional rupture.” \nCorrea led Ecuador between 2007 and 2017, a period that saw him win support for anti-poverty programs but criticism for excessive confrontation and for allowing corruption to flourish. \nHe declined to run in 2017 and tapped Moreno, then Vice President, as the ruling party candidate. He now says Moreno is a “traitor” seeking to annihilate him politically. \nThough he has been living in Brussels with his Belgian wife since leaving office, he has returned several times to whip up support during campaign stops across Ecuador. \n“I’ve come to understand that Correa stole a lot from us, he fought with everyone, and now he wants to come back as if none of that happened,” said Maria del Carmen Nauya, 52, a maid, who woke up early to vote in a poor neighborhood in the capital of Quito. She voted to bring back term limits.
