Population Fund. Although the majority of African youth work, they still live in poverty, the International Labour Organization says.\nSchool curriculums in sub-Saharan Africa are often poorly adapted to local needs, leaving graduates ill-equipped for the job market, the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO says.\n“Most young Africans now have the chance at primary school education, which has been a big change in the last decade,” said Fore. “(But) we really need livelihoods training.”\nIntegrating digital learning into education - such as using radio to give children lessons in conflict-hit areas where they cannot access traditional schools - should be a priority, she said, as well as teaching maths and science.\n“We’ve been finding that technology, no matter how basic, is useful,” she said.\nReporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Robert Carmichael and Katy Migiro.
