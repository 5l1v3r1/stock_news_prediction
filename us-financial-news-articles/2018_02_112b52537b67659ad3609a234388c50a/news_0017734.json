The increase was primarily due to a one-time benefit of $177 million from the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as higher contributions from Global Housing, which benefitted from lower reportable catastrophes and the absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses.\nNet operating income 4 increased to $99.9 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2016 net operating income of $27.0 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. This was driven primarily by lower reportable catastrophes and the absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses in Global Housing, compared to fourth quarter 2016.\nExcluding reportable catastrophes, net operating income for fourth quarter 2017 increased to $100.0 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to $70.9 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, in the prior year period. This was largely due to the absence of Global Housing lender-placed regulatory expenses and higher contributions from Global Lifestyle, primarily from global mobile programs within Connected Living, including a $5 million client recoverable.\nNet earned premiums, fees and other income from the Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed segments totaled $1.52 billion, compared to $1.54 billion in fourth quarter 2016, reflecting a previously disclosed change in a program structure for a large service contract client in Global Lifestyle. Absent this change, revenue increased 5 percent, driven by continued growth in mobile, vehicle protection services and multi-family housing, offset by declines in mortgage solutions and lender-placed insurance.\nFull-Year 2017 Consolidated Results\nNet income decreased to $519.6 million, or $9.39 per diluted share, compared to full-year 2016 net income of $565.4 million, or $9.13 per diluted share. The decrease was mainly due to lower amortization of deferred gains and gains on disposal of Assurant Employee Benefits and higher reportable catastrophes related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. This decrease was partially offset by the one-time reduction of net deferred tax liabilities following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet operating income 4 decreased to $220.0 million, or $3.98 per diluted share, compared to full-year 2016 net operating income of $276.9 million, or $4.47 per diluted share, primarily due to higher reportable catastrophes and the ongoing lender-placed normalization. The absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses in Global Housing, higher contributions from Global Lifestyle, and lower corporate expenses partially offset the decline.\nExcluding reportable catastrophes, net operating income for full-year 2017 increased to $412.5 million, or $7.46 per diluted share, compared to $379.3 million, or $6.12 per diluted share in 2016. The absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses in Global Housing, higher contributions from Global Lifestyle, and lower corporate expenses were the main drivers.\nNet earned premiums, fees and other income from the Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed segments totaled $5.8 billion, compared to $6.2 billion in 2016, driven by a previously disclosed change in a program structure for a large service contract client in Global Lifestyle. Absent this change, total revenue was up 2 percent due to growth in Connected Living, vehicle protection and multi-family housing businesses, partially offset by declines in lender-placed and mortgage solutions.\nReportable Segments\nGlobal Housing\n(in millions) 4Q17 4Q16 % Change 12M17 12M16 % Change Net operating income $ 89.6 $ 10.8 730 % $ 97.4 $ 188.6 (48)% Net earned premiums, fees and other $ 562.8 $ 571.3 (1)% $ 2,175.0 $ 2,288.8 (5)% Net operating income increased in the fourth quarter mainly due to lower reportable catastrophes and the absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses compared to the prior year period. Results also included increased income for processing National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) flood claims following Hurricane Harvey, and more favorable non-catastrophe loss experience.\nIn the fourth quarter 2017, Global Housing recorded $3.1 million in net reportable catastrophes, reflecting losses mainly from California wildfires, partially offset by reductions in net losses and reinstatement premiums related to third quarter 2017 reportable catastrophes. Fourth quarter 2016 included $43.9 million in reportable catastrophe losses.\nFull-year 2017 net operating income declined year-over-year primarily due to higher reportable catastrophe losses. Excluding these losses, full-year 2017 net operating income was down slightly from 2016 levels due to higher non-catastrophe losses, including elevated claims from weather events that did not reach Assurant’s reportable catastrophe threshold, and the ongoing normalization of lender-placed insurance. These were partially offset by the absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses, higher income for processing NFIP flood claims following Hurricane Harvey, and profitable growth in multi-family housing.\nNet earned premiums, fees and other income decreased in fourth quarter 2017, mainly reflecting lower lender-placed insurance revenue, net of reduced catastrophe premiums, as well as lower volumes from originations and field services in mortgage solutions. This was partially offset by growth in multi-family housing and revenue from new lender-placed loans onboarded in 2017.\nFor full-year 2017, net earned premiums, fees and other income decreased, compared to 2016, driven by lower placement rates in lender-placed insurance and declines in mortgage solutions. The decline was partially offset by growth in multi-family housing and revenue from new lender-placed loans onboarded earlier in 2017.\nCombined ratio for risk-based businesses (a) decreased to 75.2 percent from 105.0 percent in fourth quarter 2016. This reflects lower reportable catastrophes compared to the fourth quarter 2016. Excluding these losses, the combined ratio improved to 74.1 percent from 88.8 percent in the prior year period, primarily due to lower expenses, including the absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses, increased NFIP income, and more favorable non-catastrophe loss experience.\nFor full-year 2017, the combined ratio for risk-based businesses increased to 99.1 percent from 91.1 percent in 2016, driven by higher reportable catastrophes. Excluding these losses, the combined ratio improved to 81.0 percent from 81.7 percent in 2016, primarily due to the lower lender-placed regulatory expenses.\nPre-tax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses (b) decreased to 10.6 percent, from 11.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. Declines in mortgage solutions, mainly from lower client volumes and weaker market demand for valuation and field services, were partially offset by growth in multi-family housing.\nFor full-year 2017, the pre-tax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 10.1 percent, compared to 10.8 percent in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to greater reportable catastrophes in 2017. Excluding the impact of reportable catastrophes, the pre-tax margin for the full-year 2017 was relatively flat as growth in multi-family housing was offset by declines in mortgage solutions.\n(a) Combined ratio for the Global Housing risk-based businesses is equal to total policyholder benefits, losses and expenses, divided by net earned premiums and fees and other income, for lender-placed and manufactured housing and other businesses. Income from processing NFIP claims is reported as a reduction in expenses and is included in the combined ratio.\n(b) Pre-tax margin for the Global Housing fee-based, capital-light businesses is equal to income before provision for income taxes divided by total net earned premiums, fees and other income, for multi-family housing and mortgage solutions businesses.\nGlobal Lifestyle\n(in millions) 4Q17 4Q16 % Change 12M17 12M16 % Change Net operating income $ 42.8 $ 34.6 24 % $ 178.0 $ 154.4 15 % Net earned premiums, fees and other $ 913.6 $ 929.1 (2)% $ 3,396.2 $ 3,706.1 (8)% Net operating income increased in fourth quarter 2017, primarily due to higher contributions from Connected Living, driven by global mobile programs, including a $5 million client recoverable and growth from vehicle protection. Results were partially offset by declines in credit insurance.\nFull-year 2017 net operating income increased compared to 2016, driven by higher contributions from Connected Living and vehicle protection. In 2017, Global Lifestyle benefitted from $22.1 million of disclosed items, excluding reportable catastrophes, compared to $18.0 million in 2016.\nNet earned premiums, fees and other income decreased compared to fourth quarter 2016, driven by a previously disclosed change in a program structure for a large service contract client in Global Lifestyle. Excluding this $89 million reduction, fourth quarter 2017 revenue increased 9 percent, primarily due to growth from global mobile and vehicle protection programs. This was partially offset by reduced mobile trade-in activity resulting from lower sales of new smartphones in the latter part of 2017.\nFor full-year 2017, net earned premiums, fees and other income decreased driven by a previously disclosed change in program structure for a large service contract client in Global Lifestyle. Excluding this $503 million reduction, full-year 2017 revenue increased 6 percent, primarily due to global mobile and vehicle protection growth.\nCombined ratio for risk-based businesses (a) increased to 96.3 percent from 95.6 percent in fourth quarter 2016, driven by declines in the credit insurance business, net of a $4.6 million favorable development related to third quarter 2017 reportable catastrophes mainly in the vehicle protection business.\nFor full-year 2017, the combined ratio for risk-based businesses increased to 96.2 percent from 95.9 percent in 2016 reflecting the 2017 reportable catastrophes mentioned above.\nPre-tax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses (b) was 5.4 percent, compared to 3.7 percent in fourth quarter 2016. The increase was primarily due to improved results in mobile, reflecting a client recoverable of $7.7 million, growth in covered devices and favorable loss experience. Lower mobile trade-in activity partially offset the increase.\nFor full-year 2017 the pre-tax margin for fee-based, capital-light businesses was 5.7 percent, compared to 3.5 percent in 2016. The margin improvement largely benefitted from $14.4 million in client recoverables for both service contracts and mobile over the course of the year. Absent those recoveries, pre-tax margin increased due to expense savings in service contracts and growth from new mobile programs. Trade-in activity was down year-over-year from lower volumes of new smartphone sales in the latter part of 2017.\n(a) Combined ratio for the Global Lifestyle risk-based businesses is equal to total policyholder benefits, losses and expenses, divided by net earned premiums and fees and other income for global vehicle protection, credit and other businesses.\n(b) Pre-tax margin for the Global Lifestyle fee-based, capital-light businesses is equal to income before provision for income taxes divided by total net earned premiums, fees and other income for Connected Living, including mobile and extended service contracts.\nGlobal Preneed\n(in millions) 4Q17 4Q16 % Change 12M17 12M16 % Change Net operating income $ 4.6 $ 10.9 (58)% $ 39.6 $ 42.3 (6)% Net earned premiums, fees and other $ 45.9 $ 42.1 9 % $ 181.0 $ 171.3 6 % Net operating income decreased in fourth quarter and full-year 2017 primarily due to a $5.0 million software impairment. Excluding the impairment, underlying business performance remained relatively constant.\nNet earned premiums, fees and other income increased in the fourth quarter and for full-year 2017, primarily driven by growth in Canada and realization of revenue from prior period sales in the U.S. of the Final Need product.\nFace sales for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 declined due to lower Final Need sales . Fourth quarter 2017 face sales totaled $221.1 million compared to $231.3 million in fourth quarter 2016. Full-year 2017 face sales were $915.9 million compared to $942.6 million for full-year 2016.\nCorporate & Other\n(in millions) 4Q17 4Q16 % Change 12M17 12M16 % Change Net operating loss (5) $ (29.1) $ (20.3) 43 % $ (62.8) $ (71.0) (12)% Net operating loss 5 increased in fourth quarter 2017, primarily due to lower net investment income and a $4.6 million charge related to workforce reductions. For the full year, the net operating loss was lower than 2016 reflecting reduced expenses partially from ongoing expense management initiatives.\nCapital Position\nCorporate capital was approximately $540 million as of Dec. 31, 2017. Deployable capital totaled approximately $290 million, net of the company’s $250 million risk buffer.\nDividends from the businesses paid to the holding company in the fourth quarter totaled $129 million. This included $21 million from Assurant Employee Benefits and Assurant Health. Dividends from the operating segments, Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed totaled $108 million.\nFor full-year 2017, dividends paid to the holding company totaled $374 million. This included $229 million from the Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Preneed segments, and $145 million from Assurant Employee Benefits and Assurant Health. Dividends from the operating segments, Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed were below total segment earnings for full-year 2017 to support the $95 million reduction in statutory surplus, resulting from the enactment of tax reform.\nShare repurchases and dividends totaled $169 million in fourth quarter 2017. Dividends to shareholders totaled $30 million, and Assurant repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock for $139 million. Currently, there is $293.4 million remaining under the current repurchase authorization.\nFor full-year 2017, share repurchases and dividends totaled $510 million. Assurant repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock overall for $389 million and paid dividends to shareholders totaling $119 million.\nCompany Outlook\nOn October 18, 2017, Assurant announced an agreement to acquire The Warranty Group from TPG Capital for $2.5 billion of enterprise value, including The Warranty Group’s existing debt. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. The impact of the acquisition and the related financing plan are not included in the 2018 outlook.\nBased on current market conditions, for full-year 2018 the company expects:\nAssurant net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, to increase between 10 to 14 percent from 2017 reported results of $412 million. Earnings growth to reflect a lower effective tax rate, and modest growth in underlying segment earnings when adjusting for $12.5 million of net benefits in 2017 disclosed items. Profitable growth in Connected Living and multi-family housing, as well as vehicle protection to offset declines in lender-placed insurance and credit insurance.\nWith the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), Assurant’s consolidated effective tax rate is expected to decrease to 22-23 percent from 33 percent, with approximately one-third of the savings to be reinvested to support future growth.\nAssurant operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses to grow in excess of net operating income, reflecting the benefit of a lower consolidated effective tax rate, modest growth in underlying earnings, as well as capital management.\nGlobal Housing net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, to be down before taking into account recently enacted tax reform. Further declines in lender-placed insurance expected as the housing market continues to improve. Declines to be partially offset by continued growth in multi-family housing and improved performance in mortgage solutions. Additional savings from expense management efforts to be realized towards the end of 2018 and into 2019. Net operating income to increase after reflecting a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20 percent, with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth. Revenue expected to approximate 2017 levels as declines in lender-placed are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.\nGlobal Lifestyle net operating income to increase, before taking into account recently enacted tax reform. Profitable growth driven primarily by newly launched mobile programs and vehicle protection offerings and ongoing expense management efforts, partially offset by ongoing declines in credit insurance. Mobile trade-in activity to vary based on the timing and availability of new smartphone introductions and carrier promotional activity. Results to benefit from a lower effective tax rate of approximately 22 percent, with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth. Revenue expected to increase from growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection, globally.\nGlobal Preneed revenue and earnings to continue to increase modestly from our alignment with market leaders, before taking into account recently enacted tax reform. Results to benefit from a lower effective tax rate of roughly 22 percent, with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth.\nCorporate & Other 6 full-year net operating loss to approximate 2017 loss of $63 million, before taking into account recently enacted tax reform. Increased investments for growth will be partially funded by continued expense management initiatives. The loss will increase after accounting for an effective tax rate of approximately 20 percent.\nBusiness segment dividends from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed to be at least equal to segment net operating income including catastrophe losses, subject to the growth of the businesses, the impact of TCJA, and rating agency and regulatory capital requirements.\nCapital to be deployed primarily to fund investments in the business, common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions, The Warranty Group acquisition financing plan and other factors.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call and webcast will be held Friday, Feb. 9, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

The company believes net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company’s ongoing business because it excludes the effect of reportable catastrophes, which can be volatile. The comparable GAAP measure is net income.

The company believes this metric provides investors a valuable measure of stockholder value because it excludes the effect of reportable catastrophes, which can be volatile.

Operating ROE, excluding AOCI and reportable catastrophe losses, equals net operating income (as defined below) for the periods presented divided by average stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and reportable catastrophes, for the year-to-date period. The company believes Operating ROE excluding AOCI and reportable catastrophe losses provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company’s ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of Assurant Health runoff operations, the divested Assurant Employee Benefits business, which was sold on March 1, 2016, and reportable catastrophes, which can be volatile. The calculation also excludes net realized gains (losses) on investments, amortization of deferred gains and gains on disposal of businesses and those events that are highly variable and do not represent the ongoing operations of the company. The comparable GAAP measure is GAAP return on equity (“GAAP ROE”), defined as net income, for the period presented, divided by average stockholders’ equity for the year.

A reconciliation would require the company to quantify amortization of deferred gains and gains on disposal of businesses, interest expense, net realized gains on investments, and change in derivative investment. The last two components cannot be reliably quantified due to the combination of variability and volatility of such components and may, depending on the size of the components, have a significant impact on the reconciliation. The company is able to reasonably quantify a range for the first component for the forecast period, based on certain assumptions relating to future reinsured premium on disposed business during the forecast period. In addition, the company is assuming it does not incur additional debt or extinguish debt in the forecast period. Amortization of deferred gains and gains on disposal of businesses is expected to be approximately $42-50 million after-tax while interest expense is expected to be approximately $42-44 million after-tax. This reflects the lower effective tax rate. In addition, the company is assuming it will refinance $350M of debt maturing in March 2018 but will not incur additional debt in the forecast period.
