But when the Games came round in 2016 the country was in its worst recession in decades and locked in a maelstrom of political uncertainty.\nCrime has also spiked with deadly violence in Rio up in recent years, with an eight percent increase in killings last year over 2016 and a 26 percent jump since 2015, according to statistics from the Rio state government.\n“The legacy is still not perfect,” Dubi said. “They (venues) need to be dismantled. These are not venues designed and built to last. I hope the city and government will do the right thing and dismantle those venues that were not built to last.”\nTo add to Rio’s woes, Games chief Carlos Nuzman, a long-time former IOC member, is to stand trial for his role in a corruption case involving alleged bribery in Rio’s successful bid to host the Games. Nuzman, who faces racketeering and money laundering charges among other, has denied wrongdoing.\nPolice raided his home and seized gold bars, computers as well as a Russian passport among other items.\nThe iconic Maracana football stadium has been looted after the Games, with seats ripped out, while the entire Olympic park remains shut for much of the 18 months since the Games.\nThe velodrome has been damaged by two fires, the most recent one in November last year.\nIn August 2017 IOC President Thomas Bach had urged to give Brazil more time to implement legacy plans due to the country’s political and economic woes.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\nOur ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T09:02:20.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
