She fell on both runs.\n“A handful of the girls were just like ‘no, it is not safe’ – and it is not like what we are doing is safe anyhow – but after we ran our practice, nobody had any complaints,” Anderson said.\n”Nobody mentioned anything and we were able to ride pretty good.”\nSeveral athletes said Anderson was the only one who wanted the final to run because she had one of the safest routines planned.\n“I realised on the second jump I barely had any speed – it was one of the more wind-affected jumps – so I pulled out of the double 900 and kind of opened up and landed cab 540 and so went as fast as I could into the bottom jump,” Anderson said.\nShe was backed by team mate Hailey Langland, who managed one complete run on the way to a sixth-place finish.\n“It shouldn’t have been cancelled. We are snowboarders and we should know how to ride through this kind of weather,” said the 17-year-old.\n“The girls on top of the podium today, that is why they are there, because they rallied against it and put runs down.”\nAnderson is the only woman to have won an Olympic snowboard slopestyle title as she also took gold when the event made its debut in Sochi four years ago.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:47:26.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
