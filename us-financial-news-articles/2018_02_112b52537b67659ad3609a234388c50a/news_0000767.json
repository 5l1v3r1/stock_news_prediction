That takes into account concrete assets, such the 830,000-square-foot Buckingham Palace and the family's extensive art collection, as well as more abstract assets such as the value of the royal brand.\nFor an idea of how valuable the brand is, consider, for instance, Princess Charlotte: She was just 10 hours old when she made her debut on the world stage draped in a G.H. Hurt & Sons shawl worth about $100. That day alone, 100,000 people from over 183 countries visited the website for the clothing line in a shopping \"frenzy,\" the Telegraph reports.\nQueen Elizabeth II's personal wealth totals $530 million, the most of anyone in the family, Forbes estimates, while the private wealth of all of the family members together would top $1 billion, by Wealth-X's calculation.\nBut wealth, even the royal kind, doesn't have to mean extravagance. In fact, the family's most prominent members prioritize habits that help them save.\nThey fly commercial Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, set to marry May 19th this year, fly on airlines with the public, often in economy class, Reader's Digest reports.

To cut costs and save energy, she posted warning signs around the palace that read: \"The attention is drawn of all members of staff to the need to switch off unwanted lights. By Order of The Master of The Household.\" According to one of her employees, she often took the task upon herself and roamed the halls flicking switches.\nThey hold onto clothes Prince George recently wore an outfit his father Prince William wore all the way back in 1984 .\nAnd the Queen herself has been known to re-use outfits. As Express reports, \"In 2013 she wore the same pink coat and hat for no fewer than four official engagements in the same year and in 2011 the primrose yellow outfit that Her Majesty wore to William and Kate's wedding six months earlier was then recycled for a subsequent tour of Australia.\"\nSamir Hussein | WireImage | Getty Images The royal family looks on during the annual Trooping The Colour ceremony on June 13, 2015, in London.
