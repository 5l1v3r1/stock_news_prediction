The area is near existing transmission lines, the remnants of a canceled coal-fired power project, he said.\nJormsup said Superblock was considering additional investment in a 50 MW solar farm in Vietnam and would make a full decision by the second quarter of this year.\nNext to Vietnam, Jormsup said Superblock plans to expand wind and solar capacity, in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. It is targeting revenue growth of 25 percent each year and to have overseas revenue contributions climb to 20 percent to 30 percent.\n“We want to be a regional player,” he said, adding the company was considering acquisitions in renewable companies in Southeast Asia and was also looking at projects in China, Japan and Australia.\nThailand is Southeast Asia’s biggest solar power holder, having broken into the top 15 globally in 2016, with a capacity of more than 3,000 MW, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).\nSuperblock holds solar power capacity of 760 MW and is waiting for government approval for s 695 MW wind project.\nEditing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:04:48.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
