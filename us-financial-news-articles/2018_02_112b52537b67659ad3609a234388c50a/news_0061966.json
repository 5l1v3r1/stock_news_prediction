Not because we have the capital, there's enough capital in this world. Because we have the ecosystem now, and the ecosystem has an exponential effect,\" Misra told CNBC in a TV interview at Mobile World Congress.\nMisra explained that by \"ecosystem\" he means SoftBank can connect the companies it invests in to each other to see if they can work together, as well as introducing them to new markets.\nBut SoftBank's fund has received some criticism for driving the valuations of private technology companies higher. This has the potential to affect some venture capitalists who may find it harder to invest in funding rounds at higher valuations.\nMisra said that the Vision Fund has an \"extremely symbiotic\" relationship with venture capitalists and provides liquidity for early investors that got into technology start-ups.\n\"The VC community benefits from the Vision Fund because we normally make primary investments into the company. We also buy secondary in all of our investments, from the VCs who really want to exit,\" Misra said.\nSecondary shares are bought by a new investor from an existing investor.\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T21:04:59.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
