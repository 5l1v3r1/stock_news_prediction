In the beginning, because the course is different from the usual World Cup runs, I thought there might be different names contending, but now it looks like the fastest guys will be fast.” \nMayer, who said he was feeling good and happy with his set-up, thought world champion Feuz was favorite for the gold medal - a mantle the Swiss was reluctant to accept.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger \nAnother skier being widely-tipped was Manuel Osborne-Paradis, but he was unable to back up strong performances on Thursday and Friday and finished off the pace in 1:42.50. \n“I kind of was hoping that would be faster but there was a couple of turns I did and I thought, argh, this won’t be as fast as I’d hoped it would be,” said the Canadian. \n“This does suit my gliding style of skiing and I feel confident on the course. It’s just about piecing it all together. It’s going to be a race of perfection.” \nWith winds in excess of 30 knots (55.6 kph) forecast for Sunday, organisers already have contingency plans in place to move the race should it be postponed. \n“I‘m ready for tomorrow, but I’ll be prepared for Monday, for Tuesday, whenever,” Feuz said. \n“We have to be flexible because no one can control the weather.” Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T07:22:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
