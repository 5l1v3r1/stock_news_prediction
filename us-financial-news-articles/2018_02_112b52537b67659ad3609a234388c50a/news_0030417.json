Barring a remarkable performance by one of the backrunners, Kjetil Jansrud will take the silver medal for a Norwegian 1-2 with Swiss world champion Beat Feuz claiming the bronze at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre. Norwegians, including Svindal in 2010 and Jansrud in 2014, have won five Olympic golds in the men’s super-G but none had previously claimed the biggest prize in Alpine speed racing. Svindal, now 35, came close with silver in 2010 and Jansrud took the bronze in Sochi as Norwegians took spots on the podium in five of the last six Olympic downhills. A year after undergoing the latest in a succession of operations on his battered body, though, Svindal stormed down the bottom half of the Jeongseon piste to erase the anomaly in one minute 40.25 seconds. Jansrud’s loss of control on the final jump probably cost him the gold medal and he finished 0.12 seconds behind his team mate and friend in 1:40.37 with Feuz third in 1.40.43. After nearly a week of the Pyeongchang wind wreaking havoc with the Alpine skiing schedule, the blue riband event of the program finally got underway four days late in almost perfect conditions on the Jeongseon mountain. The course, designed by 1972 Olympic champion Bernhard Russi, was supposed to be easier than some of the classic downhill runs but with little room for error. Alpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Downhill – Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 15, 2018 - Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway reacts. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Error-free skiing is Feuz’s stock in trade, and although he trailed pace-setter Dominik Paris at the top of the run, the Swiss world champion built up speed in the mid section and raced home to lead. Svindal, though, showed that five days of polishing from gale force winds had sped up the run and he was able to take a wide line on one corner and minor wobble through one of the jumps. His creaking, much-reconstructed knee was up to the task of the recovery and he powered through the bottom half of the course in his trademark style to knock Feuz off the top of the timesheets. Jansrud’s run was almost the exact opposite as he attacked the top section with relish to take tenths of seconds off Svindal’s time only to lose control on the final jump. The 32-year-old knew he had blown it and his body language after crossing the line contrasted starkly with a visible sigh of relief from Svindal waiting under the scoreboard. Sochi gold medalist Matthias Mayer of Austria finished well off the pace, continuing the ‘curse’ of the downhill which has seen not one skier repeat as champion in the 70 years of Olympic competition. Svindal was a popular winner with his rivals. “I think there is no bigger role model than Svindal,” said German Thomas Dressen, who moved into title contention after a World Cup win in Kitzbuehel last month but finished fifth. “I think it’s incredible what he’s achieved.” Editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T06:46:34.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
