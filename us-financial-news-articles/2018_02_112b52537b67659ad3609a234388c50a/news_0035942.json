Wind now accounts for 18 percent of the EU’s total installed capacity.\nReporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Kirsten Donovan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T14:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:23:22.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
