If Ms. Sperling is elected at Aimco’s annual meeting on May 1, 2018, she will serve as an independent director, and as a member of all Board committees.\n“I am pleased to add Ann’s talent, experience, and expertise to the Aimco Board,” said Terry Considine, Aimco’s Chairman/CEO. “Ann brings a welcome perspective and a multitude of personal qualities as the Board continues its oversight of Aimco and focus on Aimco strategy.”\nMs. Sperling has more than 35 years of experience as a real estate executive, including roles in commercial real estate investment and development, and leadership roles in public real estate companies in the areas of operations, finance, transactions, and marketing. She has served as Senior Director of Trammell Crow Company, the development subsidiary of the public company, CBRE, since October 2013, focusing on the capitalization and execution of new commercial developments. From October 2009 through May 2013, she served in two roles at Jones Lang LaSalle, first as Chief Operating Officer, Americas, and then as President, Markets West. Before then, Ms. Sperling was Managing Director of Catellus, then a mixed-use development and investment subsidiary of the public REIT, ProLogis. Previously, between 1982-2006 and prior to its merger with CBRE, Ms. Sperling held a variety of roles at Trammell Crow Company, including as its first woman partner and later as Senior Managing Director and Rocky Mountain Region Area Director.\nAimco has a carefully constructed and high performing board. To that end, the company has added a new director every two to six years. Prior to nominating Ms. Sperling, Aimco most recently added Nina Tran in 2016. Aimco selects nominees for director based on many factors including breadth and depth of experience, knowledge, skills, expertise, integrity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, understanding of Aimco’s business environment, and willingness to devote adequate time and effort to Board responsibilities. Ms. Sperling’s nomination followed a year of director candidate interviews, with the process led by Aimco Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chairman, Kathleen Nelson.\nAbout Aimco\nAimco is a real estate investment trust focused on the ownership and management of quality apartment communities located in selected markets in the United States.
