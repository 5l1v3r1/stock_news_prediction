That would be a 7 percent rise on the previous year.\nFor its first quarter to the end of December, when the company tends to make a loss as customers take fewer holidays in the winter season, Thomas Cook posted a 10 million pound improvement on last year’s loss, helped by its airline business.\nDisruption in the British and German aviation markets had benefited Thomas Cook in recent months, it said. Last year, rival UK carrier Monarch collapsed, while Germany’s Air Berlin went into administration, and Europe’s biggest budget airline Ryanair ( RYA.I ) scrapped flights due to pilot rostering issues.\nThomas Cook said it would boost capacity by 10 percent in its airline business for this summer in response to growing demand from holidaymakers in Germany and Britain for flights.\n($1 = 0.7189 pounds)\nReporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Kate Holton and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T15:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:32:09.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
