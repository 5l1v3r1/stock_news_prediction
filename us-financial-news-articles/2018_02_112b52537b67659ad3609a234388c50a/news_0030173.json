(NYSE:LPI) (\"Laredo\" or the \"Company\") today announced that its board of directors has authorized a $200 million share repurchase program. The Company may purchase shares in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will be at the discretion of management and the board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, business conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities available to the Company. The authorization extends through February 16, 2020.\n\"At current market prices, this program will enable the Company to repurchase approximately 10% of our outstanding shares at, what we believe, is a substantial discount to the true value of the Company,\" stated Randy A. Foutch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our balance sheet strength after the divestment of our interest in the Medallion-Midland Basin pipeline system offers several avenues to accelerate value recognition for our current shareholders. We believe this repurchase program is the most compelling and accretive avenue at this time.\"\nAbout Laredo\nLaredo Petroleum, Inc. is an independent energy company with headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
