It rose 0.5 percent in October-December, failing to make up for a 0.6 percent slump in the previous quarter.\nSome analysts say a recent spike in vegetable and grocery prices, blamed in part to bad weather, may also dent consumption.\nAnnual overall consumer inflation, which includes volatile fresh food costs, accelerated to 1.4 percent in January from 1.0 percent in December. That was the highest level since July 2014, when stripping away the effect of a 2014 sales tax hike.\nUnderscoring Japan’s sticky deflationary mindset, major supermarket chain operator Seiyu on Thursday announced plans to cut prices of roughly 500 food items by an average 7 percent.\n“There’s a strong chance the recent sharp rise in fresh food prices is hurting consumer sentiment. That’s why the momentum for demand-driven price growth remains weak,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.\nThe road ahead for the BOJ looks rocky. As other central banks head for an exit, the BOJ could struggle to persuade investors it will be in no rush to follow in the footsteps of its overseas peers.\n“As we have seen with the euro this year, it is the anticipation of monetary policy swings, not their implementation, that drives markets, and the BOJ has further to swing to achieve normalization than either the United States or the euro,” ING chief Asia economist Robert Carnell said in a research note.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T04:04:43.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
