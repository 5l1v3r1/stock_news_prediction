It did not specify where the hubs would be.\nEarlier the Financial Times reported the plan.\nThe biggest miner BHP, which like Rio has a dual structure, is under pressure from activist investor Elliott Advisors to simplify its set-up, but BHP says the evidence so far is that any gains would be less than the cost of change.\nRio CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said he regularly reviews Rio’s structure and is comfortable with it.\nReporting by Barbara Lewis; Editing by Mark Potter and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:08:35.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
