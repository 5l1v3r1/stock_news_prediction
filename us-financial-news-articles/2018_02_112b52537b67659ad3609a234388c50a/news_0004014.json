Only after the Pole’s departure for Bayern Munich did Aubameyang really shine. \nThree years earlier Lewandowski joined Dortmund as an understudy to then Dortmund top scorer Lucas Barrios. \nIt was only after the Paraguay international’s departure that the two-time Bundesliga top scorer Lewandowski carved out a name as one of Europe’s most efficient forwards. \nBelgium international Batshuayi has yet to earn any of Lewandowski’s or Aubameyang’s honours, having made 53 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions since joining from Olympique Marseille in July 2016 and scoring 19 goals. \nBut after failing to convince Chelsea coach Antonio Conte of a regular starting spot, the 24-year-old, who represented his country at Euro 2016, now hopes first-team action will help his chances of featuring more prominently at this year’s World Cup in Russia. \nWith just two victories from their last 13 league games and none in their last three, Dortmund are desperate for Batshuayi’s goals with Dortmund having dropped to sixth and travelling to bottom side Cologne on Friday. \nBundesliga leaders Bayern Munich look unstoppable as they chase a record-extending sixth consecutive Bundesliga crown. \nThey have opened up as massive 16-point lead at the top and take on lowly Mainz 05 on Saturday, with second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, on 34 points, travelling to Freiburg.
