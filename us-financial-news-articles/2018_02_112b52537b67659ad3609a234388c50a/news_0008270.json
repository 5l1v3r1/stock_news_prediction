Five sources said they were deemed surplus following a decision last year to reduce flights to the United States, and might be sold.\nThe airline has been working on a new fleet and network plan as part of a review launched in 2016, and on Jan. 24 told Reuters it had stopped using five Airbus cargo planes.
