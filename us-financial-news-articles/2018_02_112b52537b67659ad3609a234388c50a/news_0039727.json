I told him everything I think,” he said.\nA former collective farm manager, Lukashenko has run Belarus along Soviet-style command lines since 1994.\nReporting by Andrei Makhovsky; Writing by Alessandra Prentice; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:48:08.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
