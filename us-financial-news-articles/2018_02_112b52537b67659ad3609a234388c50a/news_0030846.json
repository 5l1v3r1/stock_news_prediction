(\"NSM\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: NSM) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by WMIH Corp. (\"WMIH\") (NASDAQ: WMIH). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders can elect to receive $18.00 in cash or 12.7793 shares of WMIH for each share of NSM. The latter represents consideration of $14.95 per NSM share, based on WMIH's February 13 trading price of $1.17.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether NSM's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, NSM traded for $19.45, or $1.45 above the per-share cash offer and nearly $5.00 above the per-share consideration, recently as January 9. Additionally, at least one analyst set a target price of $23.00 per share.\nMoreover, in its most recent financial release, the Company announced positive financial results. It reported originations GAAP pretax income of $45 million in the third quarter of 2017, a figure which \"exceeded [NSM's] target again [] with funded volume increasing twenty percent,\" according the Company's CEO.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether NSM's shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects.
