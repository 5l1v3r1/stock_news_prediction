Rick Scott asked the state’s law-enforcement commissioner Sunday to immediately investigate the response to the deadly school shooting last week in Parkland. \nScott’s move comes as Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said he was further investigating his officers’ handling of the shooting as criticism mounts that the agency failed to stop the gunman. The law-enforcement commissioner is Rick Swearingen, who was appointed to the post in 2014 and has more than 30 years of experience in the state and capitol-police agencies \nDetectives with the sheriff’s office are reviewing claims from officers in nearby Coral Springs Police Department that some Broward deputies failed to enter the school at the appropriate time, the sheriff’s office said late Saturday. One deputy stationed at the school resigned Thursday after an investigation found he waited outside the building during much of the attack that claimed 17 lives. \n“There is no confirmation, at this time, other deputies did not enter the school when they should have,” the office said in a news release. “Again, it’s a claim being investigated to determine if further action is warranted.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T00:03:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
