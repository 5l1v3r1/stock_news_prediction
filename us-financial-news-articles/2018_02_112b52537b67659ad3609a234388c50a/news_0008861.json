We are not expecting a no deal scenario,” he added. \nPrime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said he had not seen the specific details reported by Sky, and pointed to May’s response to the initial leak of the papers. \n“She made the point that what it doesn’t model is the deal which she is actually seeking,” the spokesman said.
