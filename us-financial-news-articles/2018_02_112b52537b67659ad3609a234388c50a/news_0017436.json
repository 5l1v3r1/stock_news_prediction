These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, the launch and completion of the secondary offering of our Class A common stock. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in the registration statement on Form S-1, including the preliminary prospectus, we have filed with the SEC. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006328/en/\nCadence Bancorporation\nMedia contact:\nDanielle Kernell, 713-871-4051\ndanielle.kernell@cadencebank.com\nor\nInvestor relations contact:\nValerie Toalson, 713-871-4103 or 800-698-7878\nvtoalson@cadencebancorporation.com\nSource: Cadence Bancorporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51755315&newsitemid=20180207006328&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&index=1&md5=8533d1f50eb5af3925bd43c014571f75", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006328/en/"], "published": "2018-02-08T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T04:05:43.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
