YouTube is one of several Google services with more than 1 billion monthly users, and YouTube Go is among nascent efforts at Google to draw another 1 billion users.\nThe app, which has already attracted millions of downloads, enables videos to be previewed and then downloaded for offline viewing and sharing. Users also see more prompts to control mobile data usage.\nSuch features aim to make YouTube more attractive to consumers who lack affordable access to high-speed Internet service and powerful smartphones.\nThe “Go” app can also operate well under those conditions because it does not include features such as commenting or channel subscriptions, and because commercials tend to be shorter than on the primary YouTube app.\nThe adjustments could result in a different culture around YouTube in some areas compared with in the United States and Western Europe, where amateur videomakers have amassed large followings. It has not been announced whether YouTube Go will make video uploading less data-intensive.\nThe company expects viewers will transition to traditional YouTube as their technology options evolve, YouTube product manager Jay Akkad said in a video interview.\nReporting by Paresh Dave; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:25:29.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
