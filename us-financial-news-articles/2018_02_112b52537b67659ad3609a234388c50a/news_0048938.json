Special Rapporteurs, said in a statement.\nThe U.N. experts added that the proposed amendments use “broad terminology and would need more precise language to meet international standards”.\nThe U.N. criticism is unlikely to carry any weight as long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen has been a long-term critic of the organization, especially over its criticism of his government and its rights record.\nThe United Nations helped bring peace to the country after more than a decade of war in the 1980s, which followed the brutal 1975-79 “Killing Fields” rule of the Khmer Rouge.\nGovernment spokesman Phay Siphan could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.\nThe lese-majeste law stipulates that those found guilty would face between one and five years in prison and a fine of between $500 and $2,500.\nKing Norodom Sihamoni is officially Cambodia’s head of state, but Hun Sen has ruled the Southeast Asian country for more than 33 years.\nHun Sen has come under criticism from Western countries and rights groups for a crackdown on government opposition ahead of elections in July, at which he is expected to extend his 33-year rule.\nA Cambodian court dissolved the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party last year, following the arrest of its leader Kem Sokha on treason charges, which he says were politically motivated.\nReporting by Prak Chan Thul; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:11:07.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
