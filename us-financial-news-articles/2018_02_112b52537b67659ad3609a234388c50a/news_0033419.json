Sucharow , an internationally recognized securities lawyer and a leader of the class action bar.\nSucharow, a 1975 graduate of the Law School, is Co-Chairman of Labaton Sucharow LLP, one of the top plaintiffs' securities and antitrust class action firms in the world. The firm was recently named for the fifth time as a Class Action Group of the Year by Law360, which also selected Sucharow as one the 10 Most Admired Securities Attorneys in the United States and as a Titan of the Plaintiffs Bar.\n\"We are thrilled to welcome Larry to the Board of Brooklyn Law School,\" said Stuart Subotnick '68, Chairman of the Board of Trustees. \"He is one of the world's true leaders in his field, yet he continually chooses to focus his vast experience and knowledge to support the Brooklyn Law School community. His perspective as a lawyer, entrepreneur, and mentor will be invaluable to our team, and I look forward to working with him.\"\nA dedicated and active member of the Brooklyn Law School community, Sucharow was honored with the Alumni of the Year award in 2012. He and his firm have been generous supporters of the Law School and have assisted numerous students through the creation of scholarships. In 2013, Sucharow also established an internship program in conjunction with Brooklyn Law School's comprehensive Clinical Education Program , giving students \"real world\" experience providing pro bono assistance to defrauded individual investors.\n\"I am delighted to join the Board of my alma mater, as I am grateful for my time at Brooklyn Law School, which equipped me to confidently enter the legal field,\" said Sucharow. \"I have remained involved with the BLS community for many years, but as a Trustee of the Law School I look forward to playing an even greater role in its continued success and investment in its students.\"\nOver the course of his career, Sucharow has prosecuted hundreds of cases and his firm has recovered billions in groundbreaking securities, antitrust, business transaction, and product liability class actions. A landmark case tried in 2002—In re Real Estate Associates Limited Partnership Litigation—was the very first securities action successfully tried to a jury verdict following the enactment of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nSucharow is also among a small group of plaintiffs' securities lawyers in the United States recognized by major legal analysts and media, including Chambers & Partners USA, The Legal 500, Benchmark Litigation, and Lawdragon, for his successes in securities litigation. Chambers described him as an \"immensely respected plaintiff advocate\" and a \"renowned figure in the securities plaintiff world...[who] has handled some of the most high-profile litigation in this field.\"\nActive in legal and professional organizations, Sucharow has served in many notable capacities, including: a two-year term as President of the National Association of Shareholder and Consumer Attorneys; Trustee of the Federal Bar Council Foundation and member of the Federal Bar Council's Committee on Second Circuit Courts; member of the Federal Courts Committee of the New York County Lawyers' Association and the Securities Law Committee of the New Jersey State Bar Association; and the Advocacy Committee of the World Federation of Investors Corporation, among others. He is also Vice Chair of the International Financial Litigation Network, a network of law firms from 15 countries seeking international solutions to cross-border financial problems.\n\"Larry Sucharow is a trailblazer of our profession. His blend of knowledge, experience and judgment, along with his unwavering dedication to the Brooklyn Law School community will enable him to have an immediate and positive impact as a Trustee,\" said Nick Allard , President and Dean of Brooklyn Law School. \"He is a generously supportive alumnus, a mentor to students and lawyers, one of the elite plaintiffs' securities and antitrust class action attorneys in the country, and a founder and effective forward-thinking leader of a highly successful and respected law firm. As a Trustee, Larry's enviable qualities will be put to good use immediately in the service of our school at a critical inflection point in its long history. He will play an important role in the work to advance Brooklyn Law School to the forefront of legal education nationally and globally.\"\nAbout Brooklyn Law School\nFounded in 1901, Brooklyn Law School offers a vibrant intellectual community emphasizing teaching excellence, leading-edge scholarship, and an innovative academic program designed to prepare students for public service, business, and private practice, nationwide and across the globe.
