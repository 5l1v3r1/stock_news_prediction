REUTERS/Jon Nazca Westwood thrived in tough conditions at Lake Karrinyup Country Club by carding a two-under-par 70 to ensure he and Rumford will play together again on Saturday.\nDane Thorbjorn Olesen carded a 67 to be at seven under alongside Briton Grant Forrest, Thailand’s Prom Meesawat and Australian Lucas Herbert.\n”We both played well,“ Westwood said. ”We haven’t given too many shots away, made a few putts and I chipped in a couple of times. It’s been fun over the first couple of days.\n”I‘m just trying to shoot as low as possible. I know if I carry on playing like I‘m playing and a few putts start to go in, because I didn’t really hole any putts today, I’ll be thereabouts on the leaderboard.\n“To be perfectly honest, match play is anybody‘s. You’re going to need a lot of luck to win it.”\nReporting by Sudipto Ganguly,; editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T14:59:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
