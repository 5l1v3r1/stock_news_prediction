The Kirkland Company represented by Kyle Chase, Neil Chrisp and Chris Yeagle brokered the deal and represented the seller, DoUnto Partners.\nThe Forest at Fenwick was a 2005-built 80-unit condo development complex located minutes from downtown Charleston. The community boasts luxurious two-bedroom condo-quality apartments as well as a remodeled clubhouse, fitness center, dog park, swimming pool and outdoor grilling area.\nDoUnto Partners acquired 72 of the 80 units of the condo community in March 2016 for $4.85 million from the original developer. With the addition of $1.3 million for property improvements inclusive of amenity additions, interior upgrades and acquisition of eight individually owned condos, DoUnto was able to convert the failing fractured condo community to a stabilized garden-style apartment community.\nCharleston market fundamentals continue to be solid and the Johns Island submarket is benefiting from renters that are being priced out. The region's continued employment and population growth leave the market primed for continued strong apartment performance.\nAbout The Kirkland Company: The Kirkland Company is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, and specializes in the sale of apartment communities in eight states across the Southeast.
