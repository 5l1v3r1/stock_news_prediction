What are the benefits and drawbacks of each format? Identify a societal issue that seldom attracts the attention of the news media. How would you cover this issue as a journalist? Which journalism associations, if any, are you affiliated with? Which professional publications (e.g. trade magazines), if any, do you subscribe to? Please describe your perspective on how recent domestic or global economic, or business news events have been covered by one or more broadcast or cable news outlets. Will you now, or in the future, need sponsorship from an employer in order to obtain, extend or renew your authorization to work in the U.S.?
