(NYSE:CNNE) (“Cannae” or the “Company”) announced that J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc. (“J. Alexander’s”) announced today that it did not receive the requisite number of votes to approve the proposed merger of J. Alexander’s and 99 Restaurants, LLC. Therefore, Cannae expects that the merger agreement will be terminated. The vote is subject to certification by the J. Alexander’s Independent Inspector of Election.\nWhile Cannae is disappointed in these voting results and believes that the merger would have created substantial value for both J. Alexander’s and Cannae’s shareholders, Cannae is extremely happy to keep 99 Restaurants as it is a terrific, well managed brand that generates substantial free cash flows and outperforms its peers.\nAbout Cannae Holdings, Inc.\nCannae holds majority and minority equity investment stakes in a number of entities, including Ceridian Holdings, LLC, American Blue Ribbon Holdings, LLC and T-System Holding LLC.
