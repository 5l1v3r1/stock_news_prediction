It then gives a risk rating, which indicates the likelihood of human rights violations.\n“The tool is meant to provide an easy starting point for thorough due diligence by those businesses,” Sara McDonald, a senior fisheries scientist with the aquarium’s Seafood Watch program, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email.\nShe said media reports of slavery in the fishing and seafood processing industries had shown the need for such a tool.\nMany of those reports focused on Thailand’s multibillion-dollar seafood sector, which came under scrutiny after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore processing facilities.\nThe military, which has held power since a 2014 coup, rolled out some reforms after the European Union in 2015 threatened to ban fish imports from Thailand unless it clean up the industry.\nHowever, a Human Rights Watch report released last month concluded Thailand had “not taken the steps necessary to end forced labor and other serious abuses on fishing boats”.\nExploitation also persists in other fisheries worldwide.\nAfter abuses at sea became public knowledge, McDonald said “business partners” of the Seafood Watch program - which helps determine if seafood has been produced in an environmentally responsible way - began asking for more information.\n“It became evident that publicly available resources to help identify the risks in supply chains weren’t available.”\nTo fill that gap, her group partnered with the Hong Kong-based anti-slavery charity Liberty Asia, the Honolulu-based Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, a non-profit group that helps to rebuild depleted fish stocks, and Seafish, a public body founded to improve standards in the Britain’s fisheries.\nOver two years, they developed the Seafood Slavery Risk Tool, with help from agencies including the United Nations International Labour Organization, the environmental activist group Greenpeace and the United States’ State Department.\nThe tool went live on Feb. 1.\nIn addition to providing information, McDonald said the website should encourage companies to ask questions of their suppliers, which could encourage them to stop abuses.\n“We hope the tool will lead to long-term changes to practices in the industry so that seafood that is free of forced labor, human trafficking, and hazardous child labor becomes the norm,” she said.\nReporting by Jared Ferrie.
