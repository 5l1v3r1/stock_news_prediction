In last year’s election, women won a record 208 seats but were still outnumbered by men more than two to one in the 650-seat House of Commons. \nMay enjoyed a honeymoon in the opinion polls when she took power after Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016. But since losing her Conservatives’ majority in parliament in an ill-judged election in June, her leadership has been questioned. \nCritics say her cautious approach has increasingly left her hostage to the deep divisions among her ministers, especially over Brexit, with some concerned the EU has now gained the upper hand in talks. On Monday, the EU said it was time for Britain to make a choice on their future ties. \nAsked earlier by the BBC what she would say to the critics: “I put a much greater focus on not what you say but on what you do, and I guess that is another difference perhaps between women sometimes and men.” \nUnder pressure, the former interior minister returned to a favoured refrain in Manchester, renewing her call for a fight against online abuse, which she says often targets women lawmakers more than men. She called for another look at laws. \nShe also announced a review into local and national media, struggling to compete with online content, to look at whether publishers were getting their fair share of digital revenue to try to reverse a decline in “trusted and credible news sources”. \n“As we remember the heroic campaigners of the past, who fought to include the voices of all citizens in our public debate, we should consider what values and principles guide our conduct of that debate today,” she said. \n($1 = 0.7136 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T00:51:24.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
