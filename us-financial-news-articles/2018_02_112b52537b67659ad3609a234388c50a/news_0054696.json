Innovation in smartphones has plateaued and now it is all about marginal gains be that screen technology, camera features and processing power,” he said.\n“This is potentially a tough sell for Samsung but the real goal of the S9 is making an already good product even better as Samsung takes the fight to Apple,” he said.\nHuawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], Samsung’s Chinese rival which ranked third globally in sales last year, launched a notebook PC and two Android tablets earlier on Sunday. It is launching its new flagship in Paris next month.\n“With the absence of any flagship smartphone announcement from any of its major competitors, Samsung had a great marketing window of opportunity to claim leadership in the high-end smartphone market, coming back in the race with Apple’s iPhone X,” said Forrester analyst Thomas Husson.\nSlideshow (2 Images) But he expected Huawei to launch a highly competitive new smartphone differentiated by the use of more advanced Artificial Intelligence technologies and more aggressive pricing.\n“To truly lead the space, I continue to believe Samsung must accelerate its transition towards more content, services, software innovation and partnerships,” he said.\nSOCIAL GENERATION Samsung’s AI-powered Bixby service allows S9 users to point its camera to translate a foreign-language sign, without having to swipe through menus or choose settings every time.\nSamsung also plans to boost smartphone accessories such as wireless chargers and mobile docking station that allows smartphone features on desktop, a senior Samsung executive said.\nYounghee Lee, head of Samsung’s Marketing for the Mobile Business, declined to provide a sales forecast for the S9.\nResearch firm Counterpoint forecasts it will sell 43 million sets in 2018, 23 percent more than the 35 million S8 models shipped last year.\nGlobal smartphone sales saw an unprecedented decline of 9 percent in the fourth quarter, averaging 2017 growth to just 1 percent, a far cry from growth of about 40 percent between 2011 and 2015, according to research provider Strategy Analytics.\nWhile Samsung kept its supremacy over Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) with about 21 percent of market share, Counterpoint says, it faces tough competition after it lost ground in markets such as India, China and Western Europe in the fourth quarter.\nChinese rivals such as Huawei and Xiaomi Inc are making major inroads in these markets, aided by strong sales of affordable products that boast many high-end features and sturdy design.\nLee said Samsung’s huge scale and its “agility to listen and learn” ensured it would continue to grow in China and India.\nThe two versions of the Galaxy S9 have 6.2-inch (15.8 cm) and 5.8-inch wrap-around screens, and will go on sale on March 16 in most countries.\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T19:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T19:31:12.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
