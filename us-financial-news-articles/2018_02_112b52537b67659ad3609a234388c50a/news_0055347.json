Many U.S. companies’ reported results have been skewed by the law’s impact.\nFILE PHOTO: Berkshire Hathaway shareholders walk by a video screen at the company's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., May 4, 2013. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo “Buffett has been quick to say that he thinks that the tax policy changes were going to help Berkshire and be positive overall,” said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, a Berkshire shareholder. “It is a bit ironic his candidate would not have any interest in this whatsoever.”\nBuffett supported Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Buffett doesn’t dwell very long on the politics,” Smead said.\nBook value per Class A share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire’s intrinsic worth, also benefited from the tax cut, rising 13 percent in the fourth quarter to $211,750.\nFor all of 2017, Berkshire’s net income rose 87 percent to $44.94 billion. Operating profit, however, fell 18 percent to $14.46 billion, hurt by a rare loss from insurance underwriting.\nBerkshire’s Class A shares closed at $304,020.01 on Friday, and its Class B shares closed at $202.76. Both are up a little over 2 percent this year, but are down nearly 7 percent from their record highs set on Jan. 29.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T15:48:06.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
