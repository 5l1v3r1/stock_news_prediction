To the northeast of the vast, remote desert region, people in the Gaza Strip said they heard explosions coming from Egyptian territory.\nA military spokesman said the operation would cover large parts of Sinai, but also parts of the Nile Delta and the Western Desert, where other militants have waged attacks, some believed to be staged out of neighboring Libya.\nThe campaign, which involves the army, navy, air force, border patrol and police, takes place ahead of a March election in which Sisi is seeking a second term. He is widely expected to win.\nSisi posted on his Facebook account on Friday: “I follow with pride the heroic actions of my sons in the armed forces and police to clear Egypt’s territory of terrorist elements.”\nSecurity sources said on Thursday the operation, which had been in planning for some time, was unprecedented in its scope, coordination and size, involving thousands of troops, but did not provide further details.\n“The armed forces calls upon the Egyptian people in all parts of the country to closely cooperate with law enforcement forces to confront terrorism, uproot it and immediately report any elements threatening the security and stability of the country,” military spokesman, Colonel Tamer al-Rifai, said in a televised address.\nRifai said in a second statement the air force had targeted militant hide-outs in north and central Sinai, while the navy tightened its maritime control to cut off supply lines.\nA security source told Reuters on Thursday that security measures had been tightened with increased patrols in North Sinai province’s capital al-Arish and checks of residents.\nSome schools in al-Arish held emergency evacuation drills on Thursday, residents said.\nDEADLINE AHEAD OF ELECTION Egypt’s 2018 presidential election will be held on March 26-28. The three-month deadline Sisi gave the military would expire at the end of February.\nThe success or failure of the military’s latest push will most likely not affect the result of the election. Sisi faces only a single, last-minute challenger who has said he supports the incumbent.\nAll opposition figures thought to pose a serious challenge to Sisi have pulled out of the race, accusing the government of underhand tactics to ensure Sisi an easy win. Sisi says there is equal opportunity for all candidates and that the election will be free and transparent\nEgypt’s military has struggled to put down the Islamic State insurgency in Sinai since the group set up a branch there in 2014. Islamist attacks against the army and police in Sinai had begun to escalate the previous year, and have killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen.\nSisi led the military overthrow of former Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in 2013, and was elected in a landslide vote the following year.\nSisi’s critics say support for the former military commander has eroded because of tough economic reforms and a crackdown on dissidents.\nHis supporters say such measures are necessary to ensure stability in a country which was rocked by unrest following a 2011 uprising that toppled former leader Hosni Mubarak.\nReporting by Cairo Bureau, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T09:13:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
