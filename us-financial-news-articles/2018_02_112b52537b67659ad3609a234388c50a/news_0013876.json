The assets could have been valued at more than $8 billion at the time. ( reut.rs/2f5y6R4 ) \n“We expected that AT&T would sell it (DirecTV Latin America stake) rather than publicly list it, this could presumably mean they weren’t able to find a buyer,” MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said, raising concerns over the valuation of the assets. \nCable service providers have been facing stiff challenges as the industry battles with cord-cutting, where people are moving toward on-demand video streaming services such as Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ) and Amazon.com Inc’s ( AMZN.O ) Amazon Prime. \nThe Latin America business, excluding Mexico, has been AT&T’s best candidate to divest, as the region is largely non-strategic and “didn’t fit very well with any of their other significant initiatives”, Moffett said. \nAT&T, which acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015, reported about 13.6 million video connections for Latin America as of Dec. 31, 2017, an addition of 1.1 million from a year earlier.
