U.S. Treasury yields, which had hit multi-year highs overnight, also dropped to 2.92 percent, 4 bps off Wednesday’s peak.\nIn addition, minutes of the European Central Bank’s last meeting are due later on Thursday.\n“The bear-steepening U.S. Treasury curve highlights the spillover risks for European government bonds,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note. “Yet Bunds should stabilise further in a 10-year yield range of 0.70-0.75 percent.”\nGerman 10-year bond yields, the benchmark for the region, initially rose up to 0.75 percent before dropping to 0.71 percent. Most other high-grade bond yields were 1 to 2 bps lower as well.\nThe “transatlantic spread” between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs widened to near a yearly high at 220 bps on Thursday, reflecting the diverging monetary policy expectations between the two countries.,\nGREEK SURPRISE Greek government bonds were in demand, with yields dropping following after Moody’s moved overnight to upgrade Greece two notches from “Caa2” to “B3” and maintained its positive outlook. The agency said it believed Greece will return to self-sufficiency and market-based funding.\nGreece has also been upgraded by S&P Global and Fitch recently, but Moody’s was not due to review Greece’s rating until later.\n“It came as a surprise in terms of the timing - but the overall rating story and economic story on Greece is on track,” said DZ Bank analyst Sebastian Fellechner.\nThe yield on Greece’s 10-year government bond was 14 basis points lower at 4.34 percent. Short-dated Greek 2-year government bond yields dropped as much as 35 basis points to a 10-day low of 1.51 percent .\nThe closely watched German IFO survey of business climate is due to be published later on Thursday. The ECB minutes are due at 12.30 GMT.
