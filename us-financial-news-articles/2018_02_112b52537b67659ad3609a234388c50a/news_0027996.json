That rare situation highlighted the extreme level of fear of further near-term losses for U.S. stocks.\n(Graphic: VIX futures signal smoother sailing - reut.rs/2C2VPPz )\nOn Wednesday the backwardation had reached its most extreme level since Aug. 11, 2011, when rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded the United States’ credit rating.\nWith Wednesday’s expiry of February VIX futures, the curve was approaching its more typical contango, where investors pay more for farther out contracts than for near-term contracts.\n“Any time the front-month contracts expire, you immediately see a big adjustment in the curve,” said Frederick.\nWall Street surged on Thursday and was on track to end higher for a fifth straight session, led by Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and other technology stocks as investors shrugged off recent inflation worries.\nReporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Daniel Bases and Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://reut.rs/2C2VPPz"], "published": "2018-02-16T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:21:23.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
