Including an unusually low win rate for the period, Crown said half-yearly net profit fell 34 percent.\nThe company declared an interim dividend of 30 Australian cents, in line with the previous corresponding period.\n$1 = 1.2822 Australian dollars Reporting by Byron Kaye in SYDNEY and Farah Master in HONG KONG; Editing by Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:49:55.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
