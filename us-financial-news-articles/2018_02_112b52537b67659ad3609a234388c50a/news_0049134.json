Goff will also be global head of CFS Solutions.\nThe changes will take effect on April 2. The Japan business will be unchanged.\nThe memo, sent by wholesale banking head Steve Ashley and co-head of wholesale Minoru Shinohara, said they expect CFS to be “a major driver of profitability” under their medium term plan. It will span traditional financing activity as well as liability side financing and liability management.\nThe bank announced several other changes as part of the restructuring.\nHenson Orser has been appointed global head of wholesale senior relationship management; Mark Cosaitis will become wholesale financial officer; and Chikashi Okabe has been appointed deputy wholesale financial officer.
