REUTERS/Toby Melville ”The game of mixed doubles the strategy is offense,“ said Morris. ”That’s why I think it is such a great sport because when you get up a few points unlike team curling where you can coast and play defensive, the best defense in mixed-doubles is a good offense you have to keep the pressure on.\n“As a result you are either going to get games that are 12-11 or games that are lopsided.”\nCURLING POWERHOUSE\nSlideshow (8 Images) For all the success Canada has had in the traditional format, winning the last three Olympic gold in the men’s competition and the women’s twice, the curling powerhouse has never won a mixed doubles world title.\nOnly three times since the International Curling Federation introduced a mixed-doubles world championship in 2008 has Canada stood on the podium.\nSwitzerland on the other hand has claimed the world title six of 10 times it has been contested.\nMixed doubles is making its debut as an Olympic event at the Pyeongchang Games.\nThe teams play a maximum eight ends as opposed to 10, and there is no shot-calling skip as in the four-player, single sex format of the sport.\nThe new event has brought pace, excitement and interesting partnerships, including brothers and sisters like Americans Becca and Matt Hamilton, and husbands and wives like Aleksandr Krushelnitckiy and Anastasia Bryzgalova who won bronze for Olympic Athletes from Russia with an 8-4 win over Norway.\n“I’ve always been a huge fan of the game (mixed-doubles), I love the fast pace, high-scoring athleticism mixed-doubles brings,” Lawes said.\n“It’s an incredible honor to represent your country on the world’s biggest stage and to be able to bring home another gold medal with John is an absolute honor.”\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T16:14:20.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
