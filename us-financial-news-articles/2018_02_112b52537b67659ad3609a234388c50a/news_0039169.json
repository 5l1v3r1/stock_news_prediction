The U.S. next play the Russians and Slovakia meet Slovenia, both on Saturday.\nThe men’s Olympic tournament is being played without NHL players for the first time since 1994 after the league and International Olympic Committee failed to agree on covering players’ travel and insurance costs.\nReporting by Dan Burns,; editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T08:11:08.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
