In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential\" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While the Company believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, including: the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases; future impairment charges; the success of management transition; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than the Company does; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; potential third-party claims and litigation, including litigation relating to the Company's restatement of previously-filed financial information; potential impacts of ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; resolution of uncertain tax positions; the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation and healthcare policy; general economic conditions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; the consummation of announced acquisitions or dispositions and the success of such transactions, and the Company's ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; and the Company's ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other initiatives. In addition, the Company may be unable to remediate one or more previously identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may incur additional tax liabilities in respect of 2016 or be found to have breached certain provisions of Irish company law in connection with the Company's restatement of previously filed financial statements, which may result in additional expenses and penalties. These and other important factors, including those discussed under \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as the Company's subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations for net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales excluding sales attributable to held-for-sale businesses, the European distribution businesses and Entocort ® , as well as adjusted operating income within this press release to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for these non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.\nThe Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation.\nNon-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income related to profit measurements are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. The Company discloses adjusted net sales, which excludes operating results attributable to held-for-sale businesses, the European distribution businesses and Entocort ® in order to provide information about sales of the Company's continuing business. In addition, the Company discloses net sales growth and adjusted net sales growth on a constant currency basis to provide information about sales of the Company's continuing business excluding the exogenous impact of foreign exchange. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past, present and future underlying operating results, and also facilitate comparison of the Company's operating performance to the operating performance of its competitors.\nA copy of this press release, including the reconciliations, is available on the Company's website at www.perrigo.com .\nTABLE I\nPERRIGO COMPANY PLC\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nSELECTED CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated\nNet\nSales\nOperating\nIncome\nReported\n$\n4,946.2\n$\n598.2\nAdjustments:\nAmortization expense related primarily to acquired intangible assets\n$\n—\n$\n355.5\nRestructuring charges\n—\n61.0\nImpairment charges\n—\n47.5\nOperating results attributable to held-for-sale business*\n(20.7)\n(1.8)\nAcquisition charges and contingent consideration adjustments\n—\n(18.9)\nUnusual litigation\n—\n(9.0)\nGain/Loss on divestitures\n—\n(23.1)\nAdjusted\n$\n4,925.5\n$\n1,009.4\n*Held-for-sale business includes the India and Israel API businesses.\nTABLE I (CONTINUED)\nPERRIGO COMPANY PLC\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nSELECTED CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nConsolidated\nNet\nSales\nReported\n$\n5,280.6\nAdjustments:\nOperating results attributable to held-for-sale businesses*\n$\n(112.8)\nAdjusted\n$\n5,167.8\n*Held-for-sale businesses include the U.S. VMS business, European sports brand, and India API business.\nTABLE II\nPERRIGO COMPANY PLC\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nSELECTED SEGMENT INFORMATION\n(in millions)\n(unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nConsumer Healthcare Americas\nNet\nSales\nNet\nSales\nReported\n$\n2,429.9\n$\n2,507.1\nAdjustments:\nOperating results attributable to held-for-sale business*\n$\n(110.2)\nAdjusted\n$\n2,396.9\n*Held-for-sale business includes the U.S. VMS business.\nTABLE II (CONTINUED)\nPERRIGO COMPANY PLC\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nSELECTED SEGMENT INFORMATION\n(in millions)\n(unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nConsumer Healthcare International\nNet\nSales\nNet\nSales\nReported\n$\n1,491.0\n$\n1,652.2\nAs a % of reported net sales\nAdjustments:\nOperating results attributable to held-for-sale business*\n$\n(0.2)\nAdjusted\n$\n1,652.0\n* Held-for-sale business includes European Sports Brand.\nTABLE III\nPERRIGO COMPANY PLC\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nCONSTANT CURRENCY\n(in millions)\n(unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nTotal\nChange\nFX\nChange\nConstant\nCurrency\nChange\nCHCI*\n$\n1,491.0\n$\n1,652.0\nLess: Belgium distribution net sales\n(10.6)\n(210.9)\n$\n1,480.4\n$\n1,441.1\n2.7%\n(0.1)%\n2.6%\nCHCA\n$\n2,429.9\n$\n2,396.9\n1.4%\n—%\n1.4%\n*2017 net sales are adjusted to exclude sales attributable to divested businesses.
