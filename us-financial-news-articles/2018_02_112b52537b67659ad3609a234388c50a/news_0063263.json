These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, assumptions (including assumptions about general economic, market, industry and operational factors), known or unknown, which could cause the actual results to vary materially from those indicated or anticipated.\nSuch risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (i) risks related to the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the pending transaction, including the risk that the transaction may not close due to one or more closing conditions to the transaction not being satisfied or waived, such as regulatory approvals not being obtained, on a timely basis or otherwise, or that a governmental entity prohibited, delayed or refused to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction or required certain conditions, limitations or restrictions in connection with such approvals, or that the required approval of the Purchase Agreement by the stockholders of Priority was not obtained; (ii) risks related to the ability of M I and Priority to successfully integrate the businesses; (iii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Purchase Agreement (including circumstances requiring a party to pay the other party a termination fee pursuant to the Purchase Agreement); (iv) the risk that there may be a material adverse change with respect to the financial position, performance, operations or prospects of Priority or M I; (v) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (vi) the risk that any announcements relating to the proposed transaction could have adverse effects on the market price of M I's common stock; (vii) the risk that the proposed transaction and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of Priority and M I to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers and customers and on their operating results and businesses generally; (viii) risks related to successfully integrating the businesses of the companies, which may result in the combined company not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected; (ix) the risk that the combined company may be unable to achieve cost-cutting synergies or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies; and (x) risks associated with the financing of the proposed transaction.\nA further list and description of risks and uncertainties can be found in M I's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC, in M I's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC subsequent thereto and in the proxy statement on Schedule 14A that will be filed with the SEC by MI in connection with the proposed transaction, and other documents that the parties may file or furnish with the SEC, which you are encouraged to read. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate only to the date they were made, and M I, Priority, and their subsidiaries undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made except as required by law or applicable regulation.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. It is a performance measure that provides supplemental information that M I and Priority believe is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate ongoing results of operations, when considered alongside GAAP measures such as net income, operating income and gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing the ongoing operating performance of M I, Priority, or the combined company, and thereby facilitates review of its operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different capital structures or different lease terms, and comparability to the results of operations of M I, Priority or the combined company may be impacted by the effects of acquisition accounting on its depreciation and amortization. As a result of the effects of these factors and factors specific to other companies, M I and Priority believe Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information to analysts and investors to facilitate a comparison of their operating performance to that of other companies. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in this press release should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nAdditional Information and Where to Find It\nIn connection with the transaction described herein, M I will file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including a proxy statement on Schedule 14A.
