Representatives for Manhattan U.S. Geoffrey Berman also did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\nIn September, federal prosecutors unveiled fraud charges against 10 people associated with some of the country’s premier college basketball programs, including four coaches and an Adidas executive.\nProsecutors said they uncovered two related schemes, including one in which apparel executives, financial advisers and others bribed assistant college coaches to steer elite players to them.\nIn the second scheme, prosecutors said James Gatto, a senior executive at Adidas, and Merl Code, a person affiliated with the company, conspired to pay high school players or their families to enroll at universities the German sportswear supplier sponsored.\nProsecutors said Augustine; money manager Munish Sood; and sports management company employee Christian Dawkins brokered and facilitated the payments in exchange for a promise that the players also would retain the services Dawkins and Sood upon turning professional.\nGatto, Code and Dawkins have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors in a filing on Friday said they are in discussions with Sood’s lawyers about a “possible disposition” of the case against him.\nOthers charged in September included Chuck Person, a former National Basketball Association star who became associate head coach at Auburn University, his alma mater.\nThe other coaches charged were Anthony “Tony” Bland, from the University of Southern California; Lamont Evans, from Oklahoma State University and formerly the University of South Carolina; and Emanuel “Book” Richardson, from the University of Arizona. They have pleaded not guilty.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T01:23:22.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
