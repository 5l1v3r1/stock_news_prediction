This can be achieved and the (EU)27 will ensure that the relationship is as close as possible but that there is a difference to (EU) membership,” Merkel said. Merkel added during a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May that she was not frustrated with the negotiations and that she wanted the EU to stick to the Brexit timetable.
