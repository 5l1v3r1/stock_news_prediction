The solution to sector issues, such as overcapacity, was joint action of all countries, not unilateral measures, it said.\nChina’s share of the EU market in corrosion resistant steel rose from 10 percent in 2013 to around 20 percent in 2016 and Chinese prices fell by more than the decline in raw material costs, the EU journal said. The value of the EU market is around 4.6 billion euros ($5.6 billion) a year.\nCompanies of China’s HBIS group, including Hesteel Co Ltd ( 000709.SZ ), will face duties of 27.8 percent, steelmakers of the Shagan Group duties of 27.9 percent and those of the Shougang Group 17.2 percent.\nEU producers are concentrated in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Poland.($1 = 0.8173 euros)\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop, additional reporting by Josephine Mason in Beijing; Editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:47:03.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
