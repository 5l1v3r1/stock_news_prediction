It’s been a great week,“ said Luiten. ”It’s always tough to win out here, all these guys are so good and keep putting pressure on you.\n“Down the stretch I hit some nice shots, I made some nice putts and it was a nice battle with my friend Woody. I need to win another couple to get into the Ryder Cup Team but it’s a great start to the year for me.”\nJulien Guerrier of France, who shared the overnight lead with Luiten, finished third after a round of 71 while fellow contender Matthew Southgate of England slipped down to eighth.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Clare Fallon\nOur ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T16:52:29.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
