If ever brought into force, the cuts could slash programs for the poor that provide housing and healthcare. \nThe proposal also calls for overhauling Medicare and Medicaid, two government-funded healthcare programs that are widely popular. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to leave them untouched, but the budget plan argues they can be made more efficient without harming recipients. \nThe proposed cuts drew a rebuke from the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Budget Committee, John Yarmuth. \n”These cuts to critical federal investments are so extreme they can only reflect a disdain for working families and a total lack of vision for a stronger society,” he said in a statement.

REUTERS/Leah Millis \nThe budget forecasts annual gross domestic product growth of at least 3 percent over the next three years, an aggressive target that is crucial to help cover the cost of the $1.5 trillion tax cuts passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in December. \nStill, given the swelling of the federal debt in the wake of the tax bill and the two-year budget agreement, Trump’s proposal notably abandons the objective of eliminating the federal budget deficit after 10 years, a longstanding goal of fiscal conservatives.

The issue has become a sticking point in talks to keep alive a federal program to spare from deportation so-called “Dreamers”-- children brought to the country by illegal immigrant parents. \nAlso on border security, Trump’s budget calls for $571 million in additional funding to hire 2,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and agents.
