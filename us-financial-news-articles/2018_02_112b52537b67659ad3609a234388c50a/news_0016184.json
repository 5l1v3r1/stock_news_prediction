Nest operated on its own as part of the establishment in 2015 of holding company Alphabet, which also explored selling the firm in 2016, Reuters reported.\nAlphabet has not taken impairment charges in the last three years on its acqusitions.\nNest device sales represented a big chunk of revenue for Alphabet’s “Other Bets” division, which brought in $1.2 billion last year. Other Bets now is left with revenue-generating units such as Access, which sells Internet services, and Verily, which licenses medical technology.\nGoogle did not immediately respond to questions about whether the restructuring had led to job cuts.\nNest and Google had already begun to collaborate on hardware development, with Google last year testing acoustics and its speakers at a Nest facility.
