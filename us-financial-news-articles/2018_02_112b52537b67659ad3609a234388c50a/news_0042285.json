Pound had voted in favor of that decision.\nHe abstained from the vote for the participation of 169 invited Russians as neutrals under the Olympic flag for Pyeongchang shortly before the start of the Games on Feb 9.\nOne Russian has so far tested positive for banned substances at the Games.\nSome 98 out of 100 IOC members voted in favor of the Executive Board’s decision on Russia’s participation as neutrals at the Games apart from two abstentions, including Pound‘s.\nFellow IOC member John Coates, another former vice president, wrote to members on Tuesday expressing his dissatisfaction at Pound’s comments, saying he was not living up to his title as the doyen of the IOC.\n“I think members talk to members and this is a matter for them to discuss,” Adams said of Coates’ letter.\n“What is clear from the letter is he wanted to remind Pound that there was a full discussion of the full process. It (vote) was unanimous apart from two abstentions.”\nAdams said there was no disciplinary procedure opened against Pound for his comments.\n“It has not been sent to the ethics commission, as far as I know,” he said.\nPound could not be immediately reached for a comment.\nThe Canadian lawyer unsuccessfully ran for the IOC presidency in 2001. He also helped set up the World Anti-Doping Agency and was its first boss.\nHe is also chairman of the boards of directors of Olympic Broadcasting Services.\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T06:47:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
