This offers some relief to investors jittery about signs that some major central banks may dial back their crisis-mode policies earlier than expected. \nKuroda’s nomination needs approval by both houses of parliament, a near certainty as premier Shinzo Abe’s ruling coalition holds comfortable majorities in the lower and upper houses of the Diet.
