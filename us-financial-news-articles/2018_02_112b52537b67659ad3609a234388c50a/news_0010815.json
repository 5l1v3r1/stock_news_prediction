Wall Street's three major indexes logged their biggest weekly losses in two years on Friday. The S&P 500 and Dow saw their worst weeks since early January 2016 while Nasdaq had its worst week since early Feb 2016. The local share price index futures fell 1.1 percent or 65 points to 6,006, a 115.4-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark rose 0.5 percent on Friday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index slipped 1.5 percent in early trade.
