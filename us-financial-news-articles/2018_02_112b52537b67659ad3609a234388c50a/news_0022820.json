It could also take longer because the bid was hostile, GKN said. \n“Having taken advice from a leading CFIUS law firm, GKN does not agree with Melrose’s assertion that it will be able to obtain CFIUS approval within the parameters permitted by the City Code timetable,” GKN said, referring to Britain’s merger and acquisition code. \nMelrose, which focuses on industrial firms, made its unsolicited offer for GKN in January after the aerospace and automotive parts business was left vulnerable by profit warnings in October and November, causing sharp falls in GKN’s shares. \nGKN, led by new chief executive Anne Stevens, rejected Melrose’s approach and outlined its own turnaround plan that would see it split into separate aerospace and car parts firms. \nMelrose responded with a firm offer, effectively making it a hostile bid that appealed directly to GKN’s shareholders. \nMelrose published its formal offer document on Feb. 1, giving GKN shareholders 60 days, or until April 2, to decide. Melrose has a further 21 days secure regulatory clearance. \nGKN must detail its first defense against the bid by Feb. 15, while Melrose has until March 19 to improve its offer should it wish to sweeten the terms. \nGKN said Melrose could decide to waive CFIUS approval as a condition of a deal but said investors accepting the offer would face “uncertainty” about any conditions CFIUS could impose. \nMelrose said it welcomed GKN’s flexibility on any extension but said it still expected to achieve any approval required within the existing timeline.
