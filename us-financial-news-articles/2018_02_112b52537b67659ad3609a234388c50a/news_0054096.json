President Donald Trump has previously emphasized federal efforts to spur private space projects.\nThe Trump administration is also pushing to get Americans back to the moon. Additionally, the administration announced plans earlier this month to have private entities take over operations in low Earth orbit from the International Space Station.\nOn Thursday, Ross said the Trump administration would try to deregulate space quickly, adding \"the pace of regulatory change has to match the pace of technological change.\"\nRoss also spoke on space pioneer and billionaire Elon Musk . The SpaceX and Tesla chief recently launched a cherry red Tesla Roadster into space on SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\"It was really quite an amazing thing,\" Ross recalled. \"At the end of it, you have that little red Tesla hurdling off to an orbit around the sun and the moon.\"\nThere will be \"rules to the road\" in Space, Ross argued. \"There needs to be. There need to be means for policing, if you will, the debris in space. That's one of the big problems. And as more and more launches occur, more and more satellites reach the end of their life, that's going to be a problem we have to deal with.\"\nâ€” CNBC's Michael Sheetz contributed to this report.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
