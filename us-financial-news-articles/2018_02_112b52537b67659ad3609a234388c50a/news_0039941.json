Brunel kept faith in scrumhalf Maxime Machenaud and flyhalf Lionel Beauxis after the 32-26 defeat by Scotland, but added fresh blood to the outside backs for the game in Marseille. Winger Remy Grosso replaced the disappointing Virimi Vakatawa and Benjamin Fall came in for Teddy Thomas, Franceâ€™s only try scorer in the championship who was left out of the squad after several players were sanctioned for going out late in Edinburgh 10 days ago. Mathieu Bastareaud was named at centre in place of Remi Lamerat and Hugo Bonneval replaced Geoffrey Palis at fullback. Geoffrey Doumayrou retained his spot at centre alongside Bastareaud. The pack was unchanged apart from Paul Gabrillagues coming in for the injured Arthur Iturria in the second row. France and Italy lost their first two matches in the tournament, the Azzurri conceding 102 points in defeats by England and Ireland.
