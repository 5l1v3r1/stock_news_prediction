(would) provide a challenge to the weak dollar consensus.”\nThe greenback has decoupled from U.S. Treasury yields since the start of the year, skidding to its lowest levels since late 2014 against a basket of major currencies despite 10-year Treasuries approaching 3 percent for the first time in four years.\nThat correlation breakdown has puzzled many investors. Economists have explained it by saying that the rise in yields has not so much been driven by expectations for higher interest rates and stronger growth, as by worries about rising inflation that have caused a selloff in both the dollar and Treasuries.\nBut on Tuesday, the dollar rose 0.6 percent against its index to 89.632, as 10-year U.S yields climbed back up to 2.92 percent.\n“I think we’re seeing some people who were short for the past month just taking some profit - I don’t think there’s any reassessment in the dollar,” said ING’s head of currency strategy, Chris Turner.\nAny positive impetus from rising U.S. interest rates has been offset by a barrage of bearish factors in recent months, including worries over the deficit, concerns that the government it pursuing a weak dollar strategy, and other central banks moving towards policy tightening.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar climbed half a percent to 107.16 yen, having bounced back from a 15-month low of 105.545 set on Friday.\nThe euro eased half a percent to $1.2342, backing down from Friday’s three-year high of $1.2556.
