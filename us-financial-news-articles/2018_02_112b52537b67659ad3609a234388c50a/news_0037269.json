In my language ‘Okuruga ahamutima gwangye, mutusaasire.’ It means “From the bottom of my heart I am asking for forgiveness.'”\nReporting by Abinaya Vijayaraghavan in Bengaluru; Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T08:42:12.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
