Clariant’s total 2016 sales were 5.8 billion francs. \nClariant releases 2017 results on Wednesday. $1 = 0.9386 Swiss francs Reporting by John Miller; Editing by Edmund Blair", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T19:44:36.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
