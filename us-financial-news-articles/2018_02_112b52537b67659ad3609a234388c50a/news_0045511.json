Despite this direct value transfer, Broadcom remains committed to delivering a value-maximizing offer to Qualcomm stockholders,\" the statement added. \nAll other terms of the deal remain, including $8 billion in proposed break-up fees , Broadcom said. \nThe new offer would return the $3 per share if Qualcomm and NXP failed to complete their deal. \nQualcomm raised its bid for NXP to $127.50 on Tuesday, partially in an effort to help fend off Broadcom's bid .\nBroadcom has nominated six members to the Qualcomm board, constituting a majority of the 11-person board, to be voted on in March when Qualcomm holds its annual meeting.\n\"Broadcom remains confident that Qualcomm's stockholders will continue to support its proposal to acquire Qualcomm, and looks forward to concluding a transaction with this Qualcomm board of directors, or the newly elected Qualcomm board following its annual meeting,\" the company said. \nQualcomm did not immediately return a CNBC request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T16:05:08.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
