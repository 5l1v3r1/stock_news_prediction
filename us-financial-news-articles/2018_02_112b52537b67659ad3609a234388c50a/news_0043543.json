Vegas improved to 22-4-2 at home, outscoring opponents 103-64.\nCharles Hudon, Nikita Scherbak and Jonathan Drouin scored for Montreal, which lost its fifth straight game and for the 11th time in its last 12 road games. The Canadiens, who defeated Vegas, 3-2, in their first meeting on Nov. 7 in Montreal, are an NHL worst 8-19-1 on the road and have won just six games since Christmas.\nThe Golden Knights scored three goals on their first six shots of the game to chase Montreal starting goalie Antti Niemi after just 9:51 while building a 3-1 lead. Smith started the scoring barrage with a power play goal at 2:16, but Montreal came to back to tie it when Hudon blew past Hunt down the right side and beat Fleury for his eighth goal of the season.\nVegas regained the lead on a Hunt blast from the left point that beat Neimi, who was screened by Nosek, on the glove side. Nosek followed with his fifth goal of the season three minutes later to make it 3-1 and send Niemi to the bench in favor of Carey Price, coming in off a 5-2 loss at Arizona on Thursday.\nScherbak, taking advantage of a Vegas defensive breakdown that left him all alone on the right side, scored his first goal of the season, skating in and deking Fleury to make to 3-2.\nBut Vegas took control in a 37-second span early in the second period. Carpenter, picked up on waivers from San Jose, scored his fifth goal in seven games when he picked up a loose puck in the slot and fired it under Priceâ€™s glove. Smith followed with his 19th goal with a back-hand rebound of a shot by defenseman Deryk Engelland.\nNate Schmidt increased the Vegas lead to 6-2 with a rebound shot that bounced off the glove of Price, who finished with 24 saves, at the 4:02 mark of the third period. Drouin ended the scoring four minutes later with a power play goal after Fleury received a penalty for interference after smashing Hudon into the net.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:11:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
