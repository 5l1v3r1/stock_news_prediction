As a result, our total portfolio occupancy increased 150 basis points during the year, to 93.6% at December 31, 2017,” stated Stephen E. Budorick, COPT’s President & Chief Executive Officer. “We exceeded our disposition goal and recycled capital through the sale of two assets located in non-core markets. Our portfolio is now essentially 100% strategic, so growth from our consistent pipeline of low-risk, accretive developments will no longer be offset by dilutive sales. Our new leasing pipeline remains strong with over one million square feet of new leasing prospects. We are confident that the continued bipartisan support in Congress to increase defense spending at a healthy pace will create an expanding set of growth opportunities on which we will capitalize.”\nFinancial Highlights\n4 th Quarter Financial Results:\nDiluted earnings per share (“EPS”) was $0.10 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.22 of 2016.
