All statements, other than statements of historical facts, regarding management's expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects should be considered forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including: the ability to realize the benefits anticipated from acquisitions, among other reasons because acquired development programs are generally subject to all the risks inherent in the drug development process and our knowledge of the risks specifically relevant to acquired programs generally improves over time; we may need to raise additional funds to finance our operations and may not be able to do so on acceptable terms; our ability to successfully market and sell Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg in the U.S., which will likely be materially adversely affected by the March 2017 court decision in our litigation against filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications to market generic versions of Ampyra in the U.S.; the risk of unfavorable results from future studies of Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) or from our other research and development programs, or any other acquired or in-licensed programs; we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully market Inbrija or any other products under development; third party payers (including governmental agencies) may not reimburse for the use of Ampyra, Inbrija or our other products at acceptable rates or at all and may impose restrictive prior authorization requirements that limit or block prescriptions; the occurrence of adverse safety events with our products; the outcome (by judgment or settlement) and costs of legal, administrative or regulatory proceedings, investigations or inspections, including, without limitation, collective, representative or class action litigation; competition; failure to protect our intellectual property, to defend against the intellectual property claims of others or to obtain third party intellectual property licenses needed for the commercialization of our products; and failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in adverse action by regulatory agencies.\nThese and other risks are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We may not actually achieve the goals or plans described in our forward-looking statements, and investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements made in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this press release.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180202005022/en/\nAcorda Therapeutics, Inc.\nFelicia Vonella, 914-326-5146\nfvonella@acorda.com\nSource: Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180202005022/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acorda.com&esheet=51752336&newsitemid=20180202005022&lan=en-US&anchor=www.acorda.com&index=1&md5=132dca87ce11d89662b732b72597a650", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acorda.com&esheet=51752336&newsitemid=20180202005022&lan=en-US&anchor=www.acorda.com&index=2&md5=6ce3462b9b9ffb03d5fd6ec69a7c6c99"], "published": "2018-02-02T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T15:36:00.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
