Schumer has called for increased gun control since a gunman in 2015 killed two women at a Lafayette, Louisiana movie house during a screening of “Trainwreck.”\nShe also said she was not pregnant.\nSchumer’s new husband, Fischer, is the author of “The Beetlebung Farm Cookbook,” which was inspired by ingredients grown on his family farm on Martha’s Vineyard.\nSchumer will appear in the upcoming film “I Feel Pretty,” about an insecure woman who wakes from a fall believing she is beautiful and capable. It is scheduled to be released in June.\nReporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:25:55.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
