Most of those gains came after businessman Cyril Ramaphosa was elected president of the ruling African National Congress in December.\nThe continent’s most industrialised economy sank into recession in the first quarter of 2017 before recovering, but investor and consumer confidence have remained subdued due to political and policy uncertainty linked to President Jacob Zuma.\nBut measures of purchasing manager activity and consumer confidence, as well as the central bank’s forward indicators have shown economic activity ticking-up as pressure on Zuma to quit has mounted.
