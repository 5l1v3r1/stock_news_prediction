However, 43 percent said there was limited impact to their business, C&W added.\nThis year, Chinese investors will likely favour projects backed by Beijing, such as the “Belt and Road” infrastructure project, logistics, business parks, and possibly senior care, that could relatively easily earn approval, C&W said.\nThey are expected to shy away from trophy office assets, hotels, completed apartment blocks and retail malls, given China is expected to maintain its tough stance on overseas real estate investment this year, C&W added.\n“As for those mainland Chinese investors who are not permitted to exercise their real estate investment prowess overseas at the current time, we are observing them biding their time and placing capital in a holding pattern onshore in the meantime,” it said in a report.\nIn terms of destinations, C&W said Hong Kong, the United States and Britain would remain the destinations of choice.
