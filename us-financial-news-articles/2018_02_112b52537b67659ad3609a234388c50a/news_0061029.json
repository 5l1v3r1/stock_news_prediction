(Nasdaq: SBGI), the \"Company\" or \"Sinclair,\" today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n\"As we begin 2018, there are many positive events we are looking forward to driving value for the Company and the industry,\" commented David Smith, Executive Chairman of Sinclair. \"Among them are the Federal Communications Commission's approval of ATSC 3.0 (the Next Generation Broadcast Platform) and certain deregulatory rulemakings relating to local market and national ownership rules, both of which are important for the broadcast industry's long-term outlook. We are confident the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation will result in a favorable effect through the many small and medium sized local businesses we support on the advertising front. Meanwhile, we continue to work with the required governmental agencies towards the successful acquisition of Tribune Media Company, expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\"\nCEO Comment:\n\"The fourth quarter 2017 performance was better than expected with results that exceeded our previously provided guidance for key financial metrics, after adjusting for transaction, legal and other one-time charges,\" commented Chris Ripley, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"While first quarter of 2018 is off to a slower than expected start due to our low percentage of NBC affiliates which is the network that aired the Super Bowl and Olympics, we are looking forward to growth drivers from the upcoming mid-term elections and the positive effects from tax reform and a growing economy.\"\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Results:\nTotal revenues decreased 8.0% to $734.0 million, versus $797.7 million in the prior year period which included $113 million of political advertising in the 2016 presidential election year. Operating income was $357.6 million, including $15 million of transaction, legal and other one-time costs, and $9 million in one-time bonuses to our employees as a result of favorable tax reform legislation, versus operating income of $233.4 million in the prior year period. Net income attributable to the Company was $443.5 million versus net income of $120.9 million in the prior year period, including a $272 million non-recurring tax benefit related to re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and a $225 million gain recognized for vacating spectrum in certain markets.

In December 2017, the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sinclair Television Group, Inc. (\"STG\"), raised $3.725 billion of new term B loans maturing 2024 and priced at LIBOR plus 2.50%. The proceeds from the term B loans, which will be drawn at closing, are expected to be used to purchase the outstanding shares of Tribune, refinance certain of Tribune's existing indebtedness, pay costs and expenses expected to be incurred in connection with the acquisition, and for general corporate purposes.\nContent and Distribution:\nIn February 2018, the Company entered into multi-year affiliation renewals with NBC in three markets. The affiliations renewed were for KSNV in Las Vegas NV, WJAC in Johnstown PA, and WTOV in Wheeling WV.

Spectrum Co's focus is on advancing the promotion of spectrum efficiency, innovation and monetization in today's multi-platform environment. In January 2018, Sinclair, Nexstar, Univision and American Tower announced the first domestic deployment of the Next Gen TV standard and a single-frequency network in Dallas, TX. The deployment will involve multiple stations, Next Gen TV program transmissions and simulcasts on 1.0 host stations using customized channel sharing agreements for mobile, customized programming and other data-use cases enabled by the ATSC 3.0 standard. In January 2018, the Company and SK Telecom entered into a MOU for the development of systems to allow the convergence of NextGen and 5G data delivery.\nCommunity:\nIn February, Sinclair opened its Broadcast Diversity Scholarship for applications.
