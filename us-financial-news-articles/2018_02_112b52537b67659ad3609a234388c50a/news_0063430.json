REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton It was a far different situation on the other sheet where Edin said his Sweden team played an almost perfect game.\nSwitzerland, who scored a dramatic tiebreak win over Britain earlier in the day to reach the last four, ran out of steam against the Edin foursome who finished at the top of the preliminary round group with a 7-2 record.\nThe Swedes broke open a close contest when they scored four in the fourth end to jump in front 6-1 and continued to pile on the pressure before the Swiss waved the white flag after eight ends.\nSlideshow (6 Images) “That was fantastic, we played close to perfect out there, we did everything we talked about doing and didn’t show any nerves,” Edin said.\n“It was so close to a perfect game and in an Olympic semi-final that is pretty terrific.”\nEdin has won just about everything in curling, skipping Sweden to world championship titles in 2013 and 2015 and a bronze at the Sochi Winter Games and now believes it is time to add Olympic gold to his resume.\n”Third time is the charm,“ Edin said. ”We’ve got one more. It’s not going to got this easy I‘m pretty sure of that.\n”I know what happened last time in the semi-final of that Olympics (Sochi) and we are going to be prepared for everything out there.\n“In my mind it is all about the Olympic Games and I want to be back for sure but being in the final now is the chance of a lifetime maybe and I‘m going to try to grab it.”\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:09:11.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
