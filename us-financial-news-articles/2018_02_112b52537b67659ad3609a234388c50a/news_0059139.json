Even if those used in testing don’t count, three engines is now a driver’s allocation for the season.\nThe documentary shows Jonathan Neale, chief executive of the McLaren Technology Group, telling it straight.\n“We’ve done that experiment about just trusting what is going to happen,” he said then. “We need to find a new way, we need to find a new plan.”\nA year on, with an engine that took former champions Red Bull to three race wins last year, there is much more hope around.\n“Red Bull is the team that everybody will compare us to and the Renault team was getting very strong and they have got a great driver line-up so they are the obvious benchmarks,” said Brown.\n“If you look where Renault finished (sixth last year), and what Red Bull did, and that’s including winning races, we have got to be there or thereabouts.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T01:08:50.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
