In most cases the probability of these actions is low but worth keeping an eye on,\" Clifton wrote. \nHere are some of the concerns, according to Strategas: \nProtectionism — This big worry has been hovering over the market since the president was still a candidate. While there have been only minor trade actions so far, markets have been concerned Trump will kill NAFTA and start a trade war with China. \"The big question is whether the US will impose tariffs on China for stealing US companies' intellectual property. The risk from NAFTA withdrawal seems to be fading,\" writes Clifton. Debt Ceiling — Congress needs to deal with both a short-term funding extension this week, and the debt ceiling in the very near future. President Trump Tuesday said he'd \"love to see a shutdown\" if there's no deal on border safety, immigration in connection with the spending authority vote. Getting a bipartisan deal could be harder after the $1.5 trillion deficit-funded tax cuts. But Clifton believes the debt ceiling will be lifted even though it will be \"the largest DC-based cloud over financial markets through mid-March.\" Mueller investigation— Clifton notes the Mueller investigation will likely end soon with a recommendation of obstruction of justice charges against Trump. The fact that the GOP lawmakers are challenging the investigation makes getting bi-partisan cooperation more difficult, including on the debt ceiling. Strategas notes Mueller cannot indict Trump, but the special prosecutor's report could be released ahead of midterm Congressional elections. Midterm elections — The years with midterm elections are very volatile for stocks, with the S&P 500 averaging an 18 percent decline. The last three midterm years had smaller, 12 percent sell-offs. Midterm corrections tend to be good buying opportunities with stocks higher one year later by an average 36 percent. Overheating economy, Too much stimulus — Strategas says the talk in Washington is that Congress is readying a $500 billion spending package over the next two years. It will raise defense, non defense and infrastructure spending, as well as provide funds for hurricane relief and the opioid crisis. Some investors are concerned the additional spending would be too much fiscal stimulus in the current environment and add to the deficit. The economy is strong unlike during other major sell offs, and investors are concerned the tax cut will spark a jump in inflation. He notes a similar period in 2003 when there were tax cuts. Rising yields \"should be viewed as a growing pain, not a disease,\" Clifton added. Deficit and debt — The markets have been nervous about the increased borrowing required by the government to handle the growing deficit. Clifton said there will be some offsetting factors to this, such as the government's tax revenue forecasts are currently based on low growth. The market sell off should also have one positive in that it will generate more capital gains tax revenue. Clifton expects concerns over deficits to continue through April 2019, but ultimately growth should alleviate some of these concerns.
