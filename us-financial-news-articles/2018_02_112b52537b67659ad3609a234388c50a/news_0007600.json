Meanwhile the CFPB has shelved plans for on-the-ground tests of how Equifax protects data, an idea backed by Cordray. \nThe CFPB also recently rebuffed bank regulators at the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency when they offered to help with on-site examinations of credit bureaus, said two sources familiar with the matter. \n“The (Trump) administration should get on the side of consumers and focus on making sure hacks like the #EquifaxBreach don’t happen again,” tweeted Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat. \nWarner and fellow Democrat Elizabeth Warren, both on the Senate Banking Committee, have proposed reforms that could have cost Equifax hundreds of millions of dollars in fines if they had been in place last year. \nThe National Consumer Law Center, an advocate for financial protections, said the CFPB should be leading the investigation into the Equifax breach. \n“With half of the U.S. population victimized, you think there’d be universal agreement that Equifax should be held accountable for its incompetence,” said Attorney Chi Chi Wu.
