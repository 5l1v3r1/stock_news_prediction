The Federal Administrative Court found that the term “Swiss Military” could be used only on watches licensed by the government. \nThe Swiss government said the ruling strengthened its ability to protect its brands such as Swiss Army, Swiss Military and Swiss Air Force, from being commercially exploited. \nThe dispute is unlikely to have any implications for the Switzerland’s even more famous multi-purpose pocket knives as the Swiss Army brand was registered by the company Victorinox decades ago, the government said. \nBut the watch fight may not be over. \nCharmex Chief Executive and co-owner Frank M. Burgin said the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property had supported his case and the latest ruling ran contrary to over a quarter of a century of practice in Switzerland. \n“To allow a very recent law to have a retroactive effect is somewhat of a novelty in our jurisdictional system,” he said. \n“We will most certainly continue to use our brand and sell watches under that brand,” he told Reuters. \nIn that case, the Swiss military, which has not fought a war since 1847, could ask the patent office to rule on whether Burgin’s watches can continue to use the name without paying for the privilege, an administrative Court spokesman said.
