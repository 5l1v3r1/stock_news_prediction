Across South Korea, the average household income was 50.1 million won in 2016.\nWorkers will also be eligible for up to 13.2 million won towards two years of university tuition. Education fees for kindergartens and junior and high schools for their children will also be covered.\nA GM Korea source said some 150 factory workers were let go last year under a similar compensation package.
