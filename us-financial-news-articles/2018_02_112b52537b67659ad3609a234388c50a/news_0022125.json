In addition, the current facilities leave local residents with few options for community gatherings (such as business meetings, weddings, receptions and memorial services) and available square footage for activities and classes is currently maxed out. Two Colorado-based companies, CSNA Architects and Bryan Construction , are serving in a pro bono capacity to advise on design and construction.\nWhile designs for the potential expansion — which could include a new gymnasium, indoor walking track, climbing wall, technology center, commercial kitchen and additional class space — are being finalized, the Recreation District Board wants to hear from local citizens about what they would like to see in an improved recreation and community center.\n“This popular regional resource is over capacity,” said Angela Kanack, SPPRD board president. “Improving and sustaining our recreation center means more community options for family gatherings like weddings and receptions. Residents who need a gymnasium for winter activities won’t have to wait for time at the high school gym, which is almost always booked with school-related activities. We can expand class offerings so people don’t have to drive far and wide for exercise classes — currently we can only hold one at a time.”\nCommunity Q&A sessions will be held at the following times and locations:\n• Alma Town Hall, Feb. 13, 6 p.m.\n• Fairplay Recreation Center, Feb. 15, 6 p.m.\n• Jefferson Community Building, Feb. 27, 6 p.m.\n• Hartsel Community Center, March 1, 6 p.m.\nFor more information, please visit southparkrec.org or contact Maggie Clark at 719.836.0747 ( maggie@SouthParkRecreation.org ).\n###\nAbout the South Park Recreation District\nIn 1998, SPCRC promoted the establishment of the South Park Parks and Recreation District (SPPRD) - a State of Colorado special district established by the vote of the community. As a special district, the SPPRD is a government entity with the authority to put tax proposals before the public. SPPRD serves approximately 6,000 residents over 1,200 square miles. The South Park Recreation Center opened its doors in 2005.\nSouth Park Recreation Center, Inc. (SPCRC) is a Colorado 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the vitality and management of our community center. A community center committee was organized in 1993 by a group of citizens who shared the belief that South Park was in need of a facility for indoor recreation and various community programs.\nAttachments:\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/aeea0d6d-4b8f-4567-8e72-244899a76a01\nAngela Kanack South Park Parks and Recreation District (SPPRD) Nate Warren SANDIA Advertising 720.244.4734 nate@sandiaadvertising.com\nSource: South Park Parks and Recreation District (SPPRD)", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/aeea0d6d-4b8f-4567-8e72-244899a76a01/en", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XFezVChfCya81yUlTiJUTMxN86ssqBHxhBjNg0JPqUv3_Bh3EwJvkI-mb8u6YFLqykshZUnNxQXfLcur7T2wTH--UpCXYSRB97WXEq0YjE0=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kr9Jwz4um8XViTOqGfPc1Dhh2C4I2YwgmWGQIfA7TfRMjUKQYV4XDgJg7kzhjUBqENser9PyYgL_WMe4dxtWaDrnDmp4uKYd_upomoCxmKk=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Bp2y5B-Eav2-ASaX-ov5BdG1QCEdaX4Pij-eVD84HEA4YhwI3h4KavOVAyMPdA33aoWkkO9hf8ysC4q9VyFvG195spG5v6zsp6xiOlaCWdc=", "http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/aeea0d6d-4b8f-4567-8e72-244899a76a01", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1C4OeaYaLdjtjGvllUVtEWhuXDafXIFV7zuxJXIicavQjo2kpPhEXboeYcMkrYMy-VbV2_IeAemSgE4C9R7YWG4A5FqpPM8W5_aDGjIpRmhgRDD7p3XetQwovqJR6ElNiA2xMbXTj0XhPVD73qUnOeINuOAUpl1JiA9EHbro4A9wZLAYjYDRRVQe5hkb8r50TPx6Bs1TNOqd8lOzUBgh3PDL5BS-o7fXi6L9M9PNnkB0lqFst5HsoHW-lv05IoO4kf1pYcUZseRmDNvFbbeOnA=="], "published": "2018-02-07T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T17:59:15.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
