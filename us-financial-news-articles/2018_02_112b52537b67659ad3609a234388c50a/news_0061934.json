REUTERS/Joshua Roberts HONEYMOON IN CONGRESS While the benign economic environment helps, analysts and experts on Fed-Congress relations say that what may be more significant is whether a Republican-led Congress gives a Republican administration’s new Fed chair a honeymoon of sorts, free of the threat of stricter congressional oversight that dogged Yellen’s years.\nDemocrats may now become the aggressors, critical of the former investment banker’s ties to the financial industry and worried he may want to roll back regulations.\nBut overall “there are a number of things going for Powell that are going to reduce the temperature,” said Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist and author of a recent book on congressional relations with the Fed.\nBinder’s co-author Mark Spindel, founder of Washington-based investment firm Potomac River Capital, said the partisan flip from Yellen to Powell was “absolutely crucial.”\n“He benefits because he is not Yellen,” Spindel said. And given the state of the economy, he has a luxury that Yellen did not and her predecessor Ben Bernanke “surely did not at all.”\nThough Bernanke was appointed by a Republican president, he was reappointed by Democrat Barack Obama and faced a difficult second confirmation because of controversy over the crisis-fighting bondbuying and bailouts he approved.\nYellen over four years waged a steady fight against Republican proposals to assert stricter oversight of monetary policy, and was often discouraged by Republican leaders against considering certain reforms such as a higher inflation target or negative interest rates.\nShe also was criticized for not moving faster to shed Fed asset holdings accumulated during the crisis, and over narrower issues such as congressional demands for documents on legal matters.\nTo Powell’s advantage, many of those issues were cleared from the table before he took over. In addition, for now at least, the Fed’s tempered approach to raising rates is in line with what would give the new Republican tax plan the best chance for the benefits Republicans contend are in store.\nA calmer mood between the Fed and Congress would also be “constructive” for markets, said Karim Basta, chief economist at Boca Raton, Florida-based III Capital Management.\nReporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T21:54:58.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
