General Mills was the biggest loser on S&P 500, falling about 4 percent.\nEquity markets came under pressure on Wednesday after minutes of the central bank’s last meeting showed policymakers grew more confident in the need to keep raising rates.\nU.S. Treasury 10-year note yields, which hit a more than four-year high at 2.9570 percent following the release of the minutes, have eased to 2.8915 percent.\nThe focus is now on New York Fed President William Dudley, Cleveland Fed’s Loretta Meister and their San Francisco counterpart, John Williams, who will be speaking later in the day. All three are members of the rate-setting committee this year.\nMarket participants are largely expecting the Fed to raise rates three times this year, beginning with its next meeting in March.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,211 to 354. On the Nasdaq, 1,801 issues rose and 487 fell.
