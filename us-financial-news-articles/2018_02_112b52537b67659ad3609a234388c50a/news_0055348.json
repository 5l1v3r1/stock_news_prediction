The model could also be used in other areas such as renewable energy and infrastructure.”\nThe fund expects to raise $200 million within the next two to three years, the source added.\nKfW’s Insuresilience Investment Fund and DFID also contributed a combined three million pounds to the set-up of Global Parametrics, Hirche said.\nThe Global Parametrics fund launch joins a number of other ILS fund launches after insurance rate rises following the fires, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes of 2017 which led to record insurance losses of $135 billion.\nGlobal Parametrics is working with World Vision’s microfinance unit to provide climate insurance for up to four million people in six countries in Africa and Asia, the two organisations said last month.
