The results illustrate how New Yorkers are struggling to find affordable homes due to the rapid rise in prices and rents over the last decade .\nRead more from New York Business Journal:\nMetLife to funnel a portion of tax savings into higher wages\nInvestment app Stash secures $37.5 million funding round\nGoldman Sachs deepens M&A bench\nThe findings also show how different generations approach the situation.\nFor example, of the millennial respondents, 45 percent say they chose a more expensive home than they'd planned, compared to 30 percent of \"Generation Xers\" — those born from the early 1960s to late 1970s — and 19 percent of baby boomers.\nDespite the lofty prices, more than one third (34 percent) of the millennial respondents are aiming to buy a home in the next year.\nThe report also found that locals, in general, are willing to overspend so long as long as the neighborhood meets specific requirements. Renters and homeowners alike rank safety (90 percent) and access to public transportation (87 percent) above all other factors when it comes to choosing a home.\nHere's a further breakdown of what the survey found:\nNew Yorkers pay 1.3 times more for housing than average Americans 46 percent say N.Y.C. is unaffordable Nearly one third (31 percent) exceeded their initial budget on their current home 37 percent of homeowners went over their initial home budget; 27 percent of renters went above initial budget More than 1 in 3 New Yorkers plan to move in the next year More than one third (39 percent) cite the high cost of living as a top reason to leave The desire for a bigger home and to buy a home also rank high — 32 percent and 29 percent, respectively Luxury amenities (i.e. doormen and gyms) rank the lowest among all requirements in choosing a home New Yorkers also tend to want to stay in their borough (71 percent); but fewer plan to stay in their neighborhood (36 percent) Not surprisingly, renters are significantly more likely to rate the cost of the city negatively. More than half of the renters who responded, 52 percent, consider New York City unaffordable, compared to 39 percent of homeowners who can buy and sell more freely.\nWATCH: A New York City-based millennial who retired with $2.25 million says this is the key to saving show chapters A New York City-based millennial who retired with $2.25 million says this is the key to saving 9:46 AM ET Fri, 2 Feb 2018 | 01:23", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T19:21:18.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
