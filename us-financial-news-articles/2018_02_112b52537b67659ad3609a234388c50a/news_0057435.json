XPO 2.37% is being sued in California for allegedly denying drivers wages and benefits by misclassifying them as independent contractors instead of employees.\nThe lawsuit, on behalf of three truck drivers, is the latest such action aimed at trucking companies that haul goods at Southern California ports. Last month the city of Los Angeles sued three other trucking firms over the practice, which over the years has prompted hundreds of wage-and-hour complaints to the California Labor Commissioner’s office.\nThe claim filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court says XPO Logistics Cartage LLC and a predecessor firm, XPO Cartage Inc., repeatedly misclassified drivers, depriving them of protections such as workers’ compensation and meal and rest breaks and violating the California state labor code. The lawsuit, a putative class action, seeks restitution of unpaid wages for nondriving work and other compensation, as well as an injunction to prevent the company from engaging in the practice in the future.\nAn XPO spokesman said the company hadn’t received a copy of the filed complaint, adding, “We know the vast majority of port drivers want to maintain their independence as contractors. We’ll continue to defend this business model.”\nSo-called drayage trucking firms like XPO Logistics Cartage move cargo short distances between seaports and nearby rail yards and warehouses, a key link in the supply chain. The independent owner-operator model is common, and theoretically allows drivers to make more money than they might as employees, depending on how many loads they move each day.\nBut driver organizers say trucking companies push operational and other expenses onto drivers and don’t pay them for nondriving work, such as hours spent waiting to pick up loads. Justice for Port Truck Drivers, a campaign to organize drayage drivers at U.S. ports, is backed by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, whose membership could grow if port drivers are classified as employees rather than independent contractors.\nThe lawsuit filed Monday alleges that XPO functions as an employer, controlling when drivers work and which loads they haul. Drivers are required to do daily truck inspections and are also subjected to mandatory drug and alcohol tests, according to the suit, which said the company has “willfully misclassified drivers as independent contractors in order to minimize costs and unduly maximize profits at the expense of their primary workforce.”\nA separate 2016 lawsuit over alleged employee misclassification at three XPO trucking subsidiaries in California is still ongoing.\nSimilar lawsuits have been filed by drivers for long-haul trucking companies and transportation firms such as FedEx Corp. and Uber Technologies Inc.\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T02:18:05.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
