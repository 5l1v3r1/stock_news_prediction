Ukita then made a kicking motion at Svedin’s lower body.\nThe IIHF’s disciplinary panel determined the kicking motion was a clear leg movement made toward Svedin. The panel did not believe there was intent to injure but the action remains a rule violation subject to suspension.\nAs a result Ukita will miss Monday’s preliminary-round game against Switzerland.\nUkita scored late in the second period in the tournament’s opening game, tying the score at 1-1. Sweden got the winner early in the third period.\nReporting By Dan Burns; Editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:42:11.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
