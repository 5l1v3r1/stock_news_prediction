We were using it more as a simulation.”\nUpset by the color of their Sochi medal, the Canadian skaters returned home and embarked on a four-year plan.\nFigure Skating – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Team Event Ice Dance Free Dance competition final – Gangneung Ice Arena - Gangneung, South Korea – February 12, 2018 - Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada compete.

We really wanted to make sure we got this gold.”\nMoir said one of the problems in Sochi had been the absence of a specific goal for the event.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “None of us knew what we wanted out of that event,” he said. “This time it was completely different. So I tried to reach out as much as I can, remind the team that our goal was to win.”\nCanada moved into first place after a stunning free skate by Gabrielle Daleman, with Moir and his partner Tessa Virtue still to compete.\nThe Olympic Athletes from Russia took silver after a spectacular performance by 15-year-old Alina Zagitova, the European champion, and the United States came away with the bronze.\nMoir said Canada had won thanks to the support team members had showed each other going into the Olympics.\n“In a sport where you feel so alone usually, it’s super important (to have team support),” Moir says. “That kind of became our motto: being there for each other.”\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:44:31.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
