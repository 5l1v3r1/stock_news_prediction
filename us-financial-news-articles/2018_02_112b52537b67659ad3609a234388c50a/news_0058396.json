Davidson, former CEO of Noble Energy Inc., will assume the role of Chairman. Both appointments will take effect on the date of Mr. Jaggers' retirement.\nThe Company also announced today that Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer J. Jay Stratton, Jr. has departed the Company. Craig Walters has been elected by the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") to serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.\nIt is anticipated that Mr. Jaggers will remain full time with the Company until his retirement and on a consulting basis thereafter to assist with the transition.\nMr. Kleckner will remain on the Board, but will resign his positions on the audit and compensation committees effective upon being named President and Chief Executive Officer.

However, I will turn 65 later this year and the time has come for me to shift my focus from full-time professional duties to personal priorities. I have known Jim Kleckner for decades and have tremendous respect for his leadership qualities and character, along with the utmost confidence in his ability to lead the Company to continued success.\"\n\"I am honored to succeed Joe as President and CEO of Jagged Peak Energy and am grateful to the Board for their confidence in me to lead this organization,\" said Mr. Kleckner. \"It is a privilege to serve Jagged Peak's stockholders and employees and to join a peer-leading pure play Delaware Basin company with an impressive asset base, enviable balance sheet and proven record of strong performance. I look forward to capitalizing on the Company's operational capabilities, technical expertise and superior acreage to support the Company's growth objectives and enhance stockholder value.
