Though a double-bogey at the 15th ended any outside chance of victory at PGA National, Woods took confidence from his performance in just his third official start since undergoing a spinal fusion last April. An apparently healthy Woods seems increasingly likely to head to April’s Masters, the first major of 2018, as a contender, rather than just one of the players invited back as a former champion. ”I feel like each time out I’ve gotten better and I’ve gotten more of a feel for playing tournament golf,“ he told reporters. ”The last couple days, it felt easy to play tournament golf. ”The warm up felt good. I get into the flow of the round. I could find the rhythm of the rounds faster. The more golf I‘m playing tournament-wise, the faster I‘m able to click into the feel of the round. “I feel very happy the way I played the entire week.” Feb 25, 2018; Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA; Tiger Woods tees off on the 18th during the final round of The Honda Classic golf tournament at PGA National (Champion).

Four weeks ago, Woods was equal 23rd in his official comeback at Torrey Pines, while he missed the cut last week at Riviera, where one bad round of 76 cost him.

I can hit the same shots but I just have to do it in a different way. “I didn’t really know what to expect. My expectations have gone up.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Adelaide, South Australia; Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T08:02:55.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
