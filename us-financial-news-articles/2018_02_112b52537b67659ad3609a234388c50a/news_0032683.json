I just hope people don’t think that what I‘m doing at 36 they can start doing at 25. I played full schedule from 1998 or 1999 to 2016. Until I was injured,” .\n“My philosophy is I play when I‘m ready... What I did last year – and what Rafa (Nadal) is doing also – is maybe a bit of a lighter schedule, and it shows to others by working or practising a bit more... you become a different or better player.”\nWorld number one Nadal, who evenly split the four grand slam titles with Federer last season, also had a similar lay-off in 2016 with a wrist problem and came back stronger to take his major title tally to 16.\n“Say I go out for six months and I only work on my serve-and-volley game. I feel like I’d be a different player six months later but everybody’s scared to do it...,” Federer added.\n”I hope I take that fear away a little bit, that sometimes it’s OK to take time. That would be a wish for me: that players would read something into that – not that they just start doing it because the top guys are doing it.\n“We’re doing it because we’re older and we have thousands of matches in our bodies. That’s why we have to do it this way.”\nFederer is set to play Belgian Ruben Bemelmans in the opening round of the ABN Amro World Tennis event in Rotterdam on Wednesday and is in contention to reclaim the top spot in rankings.\nReporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:53:25.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
