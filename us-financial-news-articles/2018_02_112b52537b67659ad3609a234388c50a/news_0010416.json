The reform deal seeks to strike a balance between being ambitious and avoiding energy-intensive industries moving abroad to avoid regulation.\nIt will double the rate at which the scheme’s Market Stability Reserve (MSR) soaks up excess allowances, as a short-term measure to beef up prices.\nIn 2023, a new mechanism to limit the validity of allowances in the MSR will be put in place.\nThe overall cap on the total volume of emissions, known as the linear reduction factor (LRF), will be reduced annually by 2.2 percent.\nThe European Union aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030, as part of the overall Paris Agreement to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T14:04:21.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
