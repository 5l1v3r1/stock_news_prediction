The dual opportunity to lead our executive team and board over the coming years is truly exciting.”\n“Maven’s growing publisher coalition deserves the most brilliant, experienced leadership possible, and Josh is certainly all those things,” said Maven CEO and Founder James Heckman. “We will be working side-by-side with our veteran product and executive team, to execute the vision of this impressive coalition.”\nJacobs is a pioneer in digital advertising, on the demand and supply sides, and a major media veteran with senior executive roles at Glam, Yahoo! and Omnicom.\n“What I love about this company is that every executive has direct experience in architecting global-scale digital platforms,” said Heckman. “This is an engineering-based company, first and foremost, and we understand the role we play in leading this coalition.
