The drones will land on roofs of stations, where a robotic arm will retrieve a package and place it in an individual locker. Customers can then pick up their package at any hour from the lockers.\nCNBC attended the initial flight demonstration at the National University of Singapore campus where the drone appeared quite large and carried a packaged shirt inside.\nThe drone can carry between 2 to 4 kilograms, under 9 pounds. The machine weighs approximately 25 kilograms, which is about 55 pounds.\nA representative from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore said the eventual plan is to roll out the drone parcel delivery system across the city-state, so long as it's done in phases.\nAirbus is joining the race to dominate the highways of the sky against competition from tech giants Google and Amazon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T11:32:49.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
