Skaters are given a technical and a presentation score. \nThe rules vary for the ice dance, where there is an additional music interpretation and timing component in the presentation, among other differences. \nIt was not only the ice dancers who were surprised by the scores on Sunday. \n“When I finished my performance -- well, I sort of wanted more points,” said Japan’s Satoko Miyahara after her routine in the team event. \n“I was surprised. But that’s the measure of my ability, so the next time I want to try harder.” Additional reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Clare Fallon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T11:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T12:00:43.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
