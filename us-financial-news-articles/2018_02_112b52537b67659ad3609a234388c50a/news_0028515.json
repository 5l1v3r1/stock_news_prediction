It gave no date for a final decision.\nAurizon’s shares have fallen 15 percent in two months since the mid-December draft decision, but on Monday closed up 2 percent in a weaker broader market.\nThe company’s underlying profit fell to A$281.5 million ($219.7 million) for the six months to Dec. 31 from A$295 million a year ago when it was boosted by one-off gains from a previous rail network ruling.\nAurizon maintained a forecast for full year earnings before interest and tax to grow by around 11 percent to between A$900 million and A$960 million.\nReporting by Sonali Paul; Additional reporting by Ambar Warrick and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:28:12.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
