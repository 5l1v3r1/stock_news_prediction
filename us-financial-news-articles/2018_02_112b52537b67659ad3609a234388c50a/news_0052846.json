Carmelo Anthony matched his season high of seven 3-pointers while scoring 23 points.\nZach Randolph had 29 points and 12 rebounds for the Kings, who lost for the sixth time in the past eight games. Buddy Hield had 19 points and a career-best 10 rebounds, and Vince Carter and Garrett Temple added 13 points apiece.\nSacramento finished the third quarter with a 16-0 burst to take a 90-85 lead into the final quarter.\nCarter drained a 3-pointer with 1:10 left to make it 86-85 and give the Kings their first lead of the contest.\nThe game remained close throughout the fourth quarter. The Kings tied the score with one second left on a put-back by Justin Jackson before Westbrook knocked down the decisive shot.\nOklahoma City shot a torrid 16 of 23 in the first quarter while building a 44-21 advantage.\nGeorge had 13 points and seven assists in the quarter, and Anthony was 4 of 4 from 3-point range while scoring 12.\nA basket by Adams gave the Thunder a 23-8 lead midway through the quarter. George’s three-point play pushed the lead to 35-13 with 3:46 left.\nSacramento showed life by scoring the first eight points of the second quarter and eventually moved within 49-40 on Skal Labissiere’s layup with 7:28 left. A 3-pointer by Garrett Temple cut the Kings’ deficit to four with 2:50 left before Oklahoma City took a 67-60 lead into the break.\nAdams’ layup gave the Thunder an 85-74 lead with 4:56 left in the third -- Oklahoma City’s final points of the quarter.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:15:43.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
