He said just like him in 2007, Tsvangirai was cheated of victory in presidential elections a year later.\nPallbearers carry the coffin of Movement For Democratic Change (MDC) leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, during his funeral in Buhera, Zimbabwe, February 20, 2018. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo “I have come to mourn a dear brother and a friend, a great African and Zimbabwean. Zimbabwe and Africa have lost a torchbearer of the second liberation of Africa,” Odinga said.\nOppah Muchinguri, a cabinet minister and national chairperson of the ruling ZANU-PF said she had known Tsvangirai since his days as union leader and worked with him during the “difficult times” of the unity government.\n“Tsvangirai’s work speaks for itself. He valued others before he thought of himself. He was a unifier for the children of Zimbabwe,” said Muchinguri, who was initially booed by the MDC crowd.\nBut before his body was even lowered into the grave, there were visible signs of the deep divisions that will confront a post-Tsvangirai MDC, less than six months before presidential, parliamentary and council elections.\nParty youths mobbed and threatened to beat up MDC vice president Thokozani Khupe and secretary general Douglas Mwonzora as they arrived for the burial, but quick intervention by the party’s acting president, Nelson Chamisa, calmed the situation.\nThe election of 40-year-old Chamisa as acting president last week is being challenged by a faction of the party led by Khupe, Mwonzora and another vice president Elias Mudzuri.\nWhile the MDC is consumed by internal squabbles, under new Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa, political analysts say ZANU-PF looks relatively stronger and more cohesive with the help of the military.\nArmy generals now occupy strategic posts in government and ZANU-PF, which has access to state financial resources is already campaigning in rural Zimbabwe, where the majority of voters reside.\nWriting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by James Macharia and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T00:00:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
