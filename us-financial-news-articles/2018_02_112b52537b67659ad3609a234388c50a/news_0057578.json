Initially, it has two clinics in the county. \nDevelopment appears to be well underway. \nA job listing for the \"network\" posted on Indeed.com details \"multiple, stunning state-of-the-art medical centers,\" in Santa Clara, a few miles north of its headquarters in Cupertino. One of the centers is at the new Apple Park campus, another job listing states. \nAnd a LinkedIn search reveals that former Stanford Health Care employees have been affiliated with AC Wellness for at least five months, although there's no mention of Apple on the people's profiles. Several of the job listings on Apple's site as of Tuesday, however, describe AC Wellness as a \"subsidiary of Apple, Inc.\" A medical group can contract out to nonmedical administrators through a subsidiary. \nAn Apple spokesperson declined to be quoted for this story. \nThe news comes as Amazon , Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan announced a joint effort to improve health care for their employees. \nDelivering better primary care is key to the success of all of these employee-led efforts because it's far cheaper to prevent disease than treat people who are already sick. \nHealth problems result in 69 million workers reporting missed days each year, reducing economic output by $260 billion per year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nAside from the typical roles involved with a primary care clinic, Apple is also looking to hire \"designers\" who will help implement a program focused on preventing disease and promoting healthy behavior. It's looking for a population health designer and clinical program design lead, listings show. \nThese designers will work with operations and technology teams. \nSources said the company will leverage its medical clinics as a way to test its growing range of health services and products, which it is starting to roll out to consumers at large. \nIt is currently working with Stanford to study whether its Apple Watch can detect irregularities with the heart's rhythm, an effort that would benefit from a huge population of healthy and sick patients. \nApple CEO Tim Cook recently told shareholders that it could make a \"significant contribution\" in health care. \nApple recently scaled back its contract with its current in-house clinic via a start-up called Crossover Health, which CNBC reported that it had considered buying . \nSources said that it started notifying third-party vendors about the shift to its own network of health clinics this week. \nAdditional AC Wellness jobs are also listed on Glassdoor and Indeed.com. \nHere's a screenshot of the job listing describing AC Wellness as an Apple subsidiary: Christina Farr Reporter for CNBC.com Related Securities", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T07:57:37.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
