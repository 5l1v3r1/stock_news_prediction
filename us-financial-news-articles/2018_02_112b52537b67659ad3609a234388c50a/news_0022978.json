British January data (due Tuesday) will be in focus after the Bank of England’s recent hawkish comments. Finally, we get German numbers (Wednesday). These should show price growth still subdued, though wage deals and a new coalition government will likely lift future inflation. \nInflation data for big economies may test nervy markets again \nBank of England raises prospect of higher rates as global economy booms \nFed’s Bullard says job market strength may not augur higher inflation \nChina’s January inflation eases even as global price anxiety grows \n2/VOLATILITY DON‘T PULL YOU THROUGH \nMarket volatility is back. With a bang. After months anchored at historically low levels, U.S. stock market volatility exploded this week. The rise in the VIX index on Tuesday was the biggest in its history. Trillions of dollars were wiped off of global equity market cap and, according to Goldman Sachs, Wall Street’s near 10 percent drawdown was steeper and faster than the historical average of all corrections and bear markets going back to the Second World War. \nHave we now moved to a “high vol” regime from a “low vol” regime, and will equity volatility serious infect other markets? Investors will be seeking clues next week. Above 30, the VIX is on track for its highest weekly close in over six years. Investors will want to see that come down to 20 or lower, while so far at least, contagion to FX, rates and credit markets has been limited. That may change if the VIX stays where it is. \nCOLUMN-Carnage, but no crisis as long as FX and rates volatility stays low: McGeever \nCOLUMN-The biggest risk to the market? The market itself: McGeever \n*ANALYSIS-Trillion-dollar risk lurks if market volatility doesn’t abate \n*GRAPHIC-World markets: Volatility uncorked 3/CAN EUROPEAN EARNINGS TEMPT BACK THE BULLS \nAnother heavy week coming up on the European earnings front and with the recent vol jitters wiping 0.8 trillion euros from the region’s stocks, company updates are going to be key if there is any chance of the bulls coming back. \nSo will the results will stem a downward trend in forecasts? Recent weeks have seen analysts’ predictions for fourth-quarter STOXX 600 earnings downgraded to 11 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, from 18 percent a few weeks ago. \nWhat’s more, the earnings “beats” in Europe are currently 48.2 percent - compare that to 78 percent for the S&P500 index. Even in Europe, “beat” levels in an average quarter run at 50 percent. \nCompanies due to report next week include Heineken , Kering, Credit Suisse, Enel , Airbus, Nestle, Allianz, Renault and Eni. \nOne saving grace is that recent selloff has cheapened share valuations. So, in theory at least, that takes some pressure off those who fall short of expectations. In the end though it might just be the moves of the might S&P 500 and Dow across the pond that have the most influence on proceedings. 4/HAPPY (LUNAR) NEW YEAR \nIt’s a tradition Chinese authorities are keeping alive even at a time when they are cracking down heavily to try and wean the economy off debt: keeping the money markets amply supplied and stable during the week-long Chinese new year holidays. \nEven though the People’s Bank of China has refrained from injecting cash through money market operations for nearly two weeks, repo rates are soft and interbank funding has been smooth. \nIt is expected to stay that way next week even as consumers and companies withdraw huge amounts of cash to spend and distribute over Chinese New Year - and banks fund their books for the Feb 15 - 21 holiday week. \nThat is partly because of some longer tenor repos the central bank did at the beginning of the year and a generous cut made to some banks’ cash reserve ratios which has given them more room to play with. \nLonger term Chinese government bond yields are down too since January and haven’t kept pace with the rise in yields elsewhere in the Western world. Analysts suspect that is deliberate from Beijing to keep Chinese markets insulated from a global bout of monetary tightening. \nRed packets are traditionally given at Chinese new year to symbolise good luck and ward off evil spirits. This could be the PBOC’s gift. \nChina central bank reaffirms prudent, neutral monetary policy in 2018 \nChina’s money rates fall as cash conditions stay loose 5/SUBMERGING MARKETS? \nEmerging market shares may have shared the pain, but bonds and currencies have outperformed for the most past during the global February freak out leaving investors wondering how long this traditional volatile asset class can keep it up. \nEM dollar debt spreads -- the premiums investors demand to hold these bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries -- have been rising but it hasn’t been earthshaking and they are still lower on average than at any point in 2015, 2016 and 2017. \nThat is probably due to the sleepy dollar as much as anything, but if it gets shaken awake or global markets take another serious lurch the resistance could be broken. \nOne of the long-running EM issues - Jacob Zuma’s departure from South Africa’s Presidency could also come to a head, while another hotspot, Turkey, will publish its latest inflation numbers. It has been rising fast and the central bank wants it down. The catch is the government doesn’t want interest rates to go up. \nErdogan calls on Turkish cenbank, watchdog to take active role in lowering rates \nSouth Africa’s rand firmer as bulls hang in despite Zuma impasse \nMarkets carnage sees EM stocks set for worst week in 6-1/2 years Reporting by Marc Jones, London markets team; Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore and Jennifer Ablan in New York; Editing by Toby Chopra", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T20:04:59.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
