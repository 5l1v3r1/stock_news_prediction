Maduro has accused Washington of seeking to oust him to improve access to the OPEC nation’s oil wealth.\nChina and Venezuela have a close diplomatic and business relationship, especially in energy. China has repeatedly brushed off widespread condemnation from the United States, Europe and others about the situation in the country.\nChina has said it is confident in Venezuela’s ability to properly handle its debts. Venezuela has borrowed billions of dollars from Russia and China, primarily through oil-for-loan deals that have crimped the country’s hard currency revenue by requiring oil shipments to be used to service those loans.\nSince 2007, China has loaned more than $50 billion to Venezuela through an oil-for-loans arrangement that helped Caracas reduce reliance on U.S. energy markets. But the flow of funds from Beijing has slowed since 2014, when abundant crude oil led to a crash in oil markets and made China less interested in maintaining its alliance with Venezuela.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T13:01:47.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
