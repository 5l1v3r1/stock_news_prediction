However, the actual median house price was 313,000 ringgit, beyond the means of many households, where the median national household income is only 5,228 ringgit, it added.\nThe central bank raised a few policy propositions, including establishing a single entity to spearhead affordable housing initiatives, setting up an integrated database to assist matching demand and supply, and reducing costs. To manage demand, it suggested rehabilitating the balance sheet of households and improving the rental market.\n$1 = 3.9140 ringgit Reporting by Liz Lee; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:47:22.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
