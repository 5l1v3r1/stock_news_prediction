These include statements regarding our strategy, prospects, customer demand, application adoption and our financial outlook for the first quarter of, and full year, 2018.

All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of the date hereof, and we undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share, and free cash flow. In computing these measures, with the exception of free cash flow, we exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense. We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities, less the purchases of property and equipment. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when analyzing historical performance and liquidity and planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods.\nFor a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures, please see the tables captioned \"Results of Operations GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\" included at the end of this release. We have not reconciled guidance for non-GAAP metrics to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because such items that impact these measures are not within our control or cannot be reasonably predicted.\nApptio, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember
