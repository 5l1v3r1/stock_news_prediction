They complain about that and report me, but they don’t investigate insults towards my family. That is disrespectful. Telling them to be quiet was the least I could do.” Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Espanyol vs FC Barcelona - RCDE Stadium, Barcelona, Spain - February 4, 2018 Barcelona’s Luis Suarez in action with Espanyol’s David Lopez REUTERS/Albert Gea \nEspanyol supporters had hurled abuse at the defender and his pop star partner Shakira during the King’s Cup first leg at Cornella, which the hosts won 1-0. \nAfter Pique scored on Sunday he ran off in celebration before approaching a stand packed with Espanyol supporters and putting his finger to his lips.

I know a lot of Espanyol fans that are good people but those at the top don’t report those insulting chants. \n“We are people and we have a limit. It’s a derby game and it is what it is.” \nEspanyol midfielder Esteban Granero was not impressed with Pique’s celebration. \n“When you provoke people you can’t later ask for respect,” Granero told reporters. “Before the gesture it was a model game. Later it was more wild. Everybody must take responsibility for their actions.” Editing by Clare Fallon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T02:05:05.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
