(OTCQB:CLSH) (CLS) (\"the Company\"), today announced an interview with Everett Jolly on Uptick Newswire’s “Stock Day” podcast.\nCLS Holdings is a science-based cannabis company, which intends to diversify geographically and through strategic acquisitions. The company recently received its first patent allowance and intends to license its proprietary, patented conversion and extraction process to major growers and extractors globally. Additionally, the company is in the process of developing a complete line of branded products.\nCLS will obtain four new licenses in Nevada upon the completion of its acquisition of Alternative Solutions (dba Oasis Cannabis).\n“CLS Holdings is seeking to be one of the dominant players in the cannabis industry in the next five years,” said Jolly. “CLS Co-Founder Ray Keller, a nuclear chemist, has contributed his cannabis related IP to CLS. It is believed that this expertise will provide CLS with a distinct competitive advantage in the extraction and conversion of the cannabis plant.\"\n“When the acquisition of Oasis Cannabis is complete – which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018 – based upon the Oasis projections, we believe we can achieve 2018 revenue of $12 million and 2019 revenue of $23 million,” said Binder. “The acquisition provides a platform for us to deploy our corporate marketing expertise and a facility to build out our proprietary conversion and extraction lab. It is our goal to produce consistent high quality product at a fair price.”\nTo listen to the full interview please click here to the following link: https://upticknewswire.com/featured-interview-ceo-jeffrey-binder-of-cls-holdings-usa-inc-otcqb-clsh/\nAbout CLS Holdings USA\nCLS Holdings USA, Inc.
