Sales were up 17 percent at constant exchange rates.\nMoncler, which sells signature puffer jackets for as much as 1,000 euros ($1,230) proposed to pay a dividend of 0.28 euros per share on 2017 results, up from the 0.18 euros per share paid the previous year.\n“...We have decided to start a new exciting and challenging chapter for our business, which I strongly believe, will drive us to new heights with greater determination,” Chairman and Chief Executive Remo Ruffini said in a statement.\nThe group will be holding a capital markets day on Tuesday.
