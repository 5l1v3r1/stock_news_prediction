Those typically block all advertisements, which cuts off revenue for both those websites and Google. This built-in version is like the middle path. \nChrome's new ad filtering works in conjunction with a program that Google is testing called Funding Choices , where people using third-party ad blockers will be prompted to either turn them off or \"pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T15:52:55.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
