In June, the health ministry launched a contest on how to “prevent” homosexuality and transgenderism, though it dropped it after pressure from LGBT groups.\nA “gay moment” in the Walt Disney cartoon movie “Beauty and the Beast” almost led to a ban on it being screened in Malaysia last year.\nIn 2015, Malaysia’s highest court upheld a ruling that banned cross-dressing.\nNeighboring Indonesia, the country with the largest Muslim population, is on the cusp of revising its national criminal code to impose restrictions on same-sex relations and consensual sex between men and women outside marriage.\nReporting by Joseph Sipalan; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T07:45:18.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
