The team’s medical staff did not prescribe the drug to the athlete,” the federation said in a post on its official Facebook page.\n“The Bobsleigh Federation of Russia and the athlete herself understand the extent of their responsibility and understand how what has happened can have an impact on the fate of the whole team.”\nEarlier this week, Russian curling medalist Alexander Krushelnitsky agreed to hand back his mixed-team bronze medal after testing positive for meldonium, which can aid in endurance.\nFeb 21, 2018; Pyeongchang, South Korea; Nadezhda Sergeeva and Anastasia Kocherzhova (OAR) during the third run of the women's bobsleigh during the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Olympic Sliding Centre. Mandatory Credit: Eric Seals-USA TODAY Sports Krushelnitsky’s case shocked the Russian athletes, who are competing at the Games as neutral athletes as punishment over allegations that the sporting powerhouse ran a systematic, state-backed doping program. Moscow denies this.\nBut his case also raised doubts about whether the violation was intentional because meldonium would offer few benefits in curling, which does not involve intense physical exertion.\nAt that point, there were still Russian hopes that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would go ahead and lift its suspension of Russia’s Olympic committee and allow them to march with the Russian flag at Sunday’s closing ceremony.\nThat prospect is now severely complicated by the second positive test of a Russian athlete. Russia now accounts for two out of four positive tests during the Games.\nThe IOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe news came a few hours after hundreds of Russian fans roared in celebration when teenage figure skater Alina Zagitova delivered their team’s first gold medal.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber and Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T12:37:30.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
