During his nearly 60-year career, he sold more than 100 million records, building up a valuable but dispersed estate. He is buried on the Caribbean island of Saint Barthelemy.\nIn a statement issued by her lawyers, Laura said she was “stunned and pained” to discover she had been excluded from the inheritance.\n“If this were to be, her father will have left her nothing: no material goods, no stake in his artistic legacy, no souvenir, no guitar, no motorbike - not even a signed cover from the song he dedicated to her,” the statement said.\nThe document, Laura Smet’s lawyers said, seemingly runs counter to French law, which specifically protects children from being disenfranchised in a will.\nCast member Johnny Hallyday poses during a photocall for the film \"Vengeance\" by director Johnnie To at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival May 17, 2009. REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissie/Files While the details of the document and the size of his estate have not been made public, the lawyers said it appeared to leave everything to Laeticia, who Hallyday married in 1996, when she was 21.\nFrench media estimates of his wealth vary wildly, with some saying it may be as much as 100 million euros ($122.40 million) but others saying it could be far lower because of debts.\nHallyday, famed for a rockstar lifestyle that involved a lot of hard drugs and whisky, spent much of his later years in Los Angeles, indulging his love of motorbikes and sports cars.\nHe was married five times, including twice to the same woman, Adeline Blondiau.\nTo add to the complications of his estate, Hallyday was never married to Smet’s mother, actress Nathalie Baye.\nHallyday married Laeticia Boudou in 1996. They adopted two girls born in Vietnam, the first in 2004 and the second in 2008, who in theory will be in line to inherit via their mother.\n($1 = 0.8170 euros)\nReporting by Brian Love and Emmanuel Jarry; Editing by Luke Baker and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T17:47:13.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
