Braydon Coburn tied the game before the first intermission, and Killorn collected his first of the night early in the second frame to make it a 2-1 Tampa Bay lead.\nCalgary responded with three consecutive goals to take a 4-2 edge. Mikael Backlund tied it with a fantastic tally, a top-corner snipe after he slickly eluded a diving defender, before Sean Monahan snapped a shot past Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy. Then Matt Stajan added another to give the hosts a two-goal edge at 14:27 of the second period.\nThat set the stage for Tampa Bay to respond with five consecutive goals. Peca started the comeback when he beat Flames goalie Mike Smith with a short-side shot off the rush just 22 seconds after his team fell behind by two goals, and Killorn’s second of the night came 12 seconds into the third period for a 4-4 tie.\nConacher scored a pair of goals that bookended a Steven Stamkos marker in the final frame to put away the game. Vasilevskiy made 42 saves in the victory. Curiously, Tampa Bay’s leading scorer, Nikita Kucherov, was held off the scoresheet.\nSmith surrendered six goals on 27 shots before he was hooked in favor of David Rittich, who stopped three of four shots in the Calgary cage.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:19:28.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
