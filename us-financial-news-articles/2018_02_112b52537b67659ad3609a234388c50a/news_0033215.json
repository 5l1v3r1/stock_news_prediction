Sisi’s allies that he is unable to control security in areas under his control,” a commentary article said.\nSome local residents have raised concerns over food and medicine shortages in the peninsula after the army blocked all access to the area.\nRifai said the armed forces has cooperated closely with local authorities to coordinate the delivery of food, medical assistance and other supplies in compliance with local and international laws and human rights norms.\nReporting by Nadine Awadalla and Ahmed Tolba; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T18:11:09.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
