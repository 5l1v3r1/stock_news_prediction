The growth rate was higher in the second quarter, at 1.4 percent.\nThat was despite price deflation for food and liquor of 1.6 percent during the half, as a result of “lower fresh produce prices driven by seasonal factors”, Wesfarmers said.\nThe Coles (main Wesfarmers brand) logo is seen on a facade of a Coles supermarket in Sydney, February 20, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Munoz Wesfarmers shares closed up 3 percent, their biggest gain in two years, while the broader market was flat. The shares were however still below their last close before the company’s Feb. 2 warning that it would take a roughly $1 billion writedown on Homebase.\n“Many analysts have been bagging Coles and jumping on the Woolworths bandwagon so today’s result was a reminder that Coles is turning around,” said Daniel Mueller, a portfolio manager at Vertium Asset Management.\nIncluding the Homebase writedown and several one-off items for food and liquor, Wesfarmers said net profit fell to A$212 million for the six-month period.\nThe Homebase investment, which is now under review, reported a A$165 million loss. The company said it would update the market on Homebase in June.\nElsewhere in the conglomerate, a buoyant coal price lifted industrials division earnings by 19.1 percent to A$449 million, and earnings rose in the domestic hardware, discount department store and office supplies businesses.\nHowever, having agreed to sell its largest coal mine, Curragh, for A$700 million in December, the company will be even more reliant on Australia’s competitive retail landscape, where sluggish wage growth has subdued consumer spending.\nThe company maintained its interim dividend at A$1.03 a share and expects to book an A$100 million post-tax gain on the sale of the Curragh mine.\n($1 = 1.2690 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Byron Kaye and Tom Westbrook in Sydney; Additional reporting by Shashwat Pradhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T08:02:39.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
