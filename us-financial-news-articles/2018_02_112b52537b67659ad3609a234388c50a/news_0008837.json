Hamza al-Nimr, an Algerian who joined al Qaeda in 2003, was dispatched to lead a cell in Tunisia but was killed with Kobi in the same operation, Tunisian security sources say. \nBeefed up by Western countries, Tunisia’s security forces have managed to pre-empt any major attack since an IS militant shot dead 39 foreigners on a Mediterranean beach in June 2015, but authorities remain on alert. \nIn December the United Arab Emirates briefly banned Tunisian women from boarding flights to Dubai over a perceived Islamist threat. \nHundreds of Tunisians have joined jihadist groups abroad but it is unclear how many have returned as significant numbers of them were killed in Syria combat and elsewhere, officials say. LIBYA \nAQIM has remained active in North Africa’s largely desert and often scarcely governed Sahel region, such as in Mali where it focused its activities after Islamic State emerged in force to the north in Libya and Tunisia. \nAQIM’s Tunisian branch, called Okba Ibn Nafaa, is fractured into four groups based in the remote, northwestern Kasserine and Kef mountains region near Algeria. \nTheir command structure is dominated by Algerians while a rival group loosely associated with Islamic State based in the same region is run by Tunisians, Tunisian security sources say. \nKobi, among others before, had been sent to bring the al Qaeda spinoff groupings back together, they said. \n“Okba has dozens of fighters; each group is comprised of up to 20 terrorists,” one Tunisian source said. \nOkba had targeted police and army forces, he said, unlike the IS focus on killing civilians, such as on the Sousse beach. \nTunisia is monitoring the border in close cooperation with Algeria, which prides itself in having prevented any attack since a veteran AQIM commander, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, claimed a strike on a desert natural gas plant in 2013. \nThere are indications of AQIM fighters trying to cross into Tunisia as Algeria’s army has cracked down on AQIM in the past two weeks, killing eight militants east of the capital Algiers and then the group’s media chief a few days later. \n“AQIM is in decline (in Algeria), it can’t restructure or redeploy here,” an Algerian security source said. \nBut a Tunisian security source said a regional AQIM commander remained in eastern Algeria intent on revamping the organization across North Africa, not just in Tunisia.
