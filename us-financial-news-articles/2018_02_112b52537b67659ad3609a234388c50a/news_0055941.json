( reut.rs/2omRwGc )\nFunds recent buying streak in CBOT soybeans is even more impressive. Over the last five weeks, money managers have bought 202,508 futures and options contracts, which is a record by a very comfortable margin. ( reut.rs/2BOmiQ1 )\nThrough Feb. 20, money managers’ net long in soybean futures and options exploded to 99,111 contracts from 42,869 in the previous week.\nSpeculators also stepped up bullish bets in CBOT soybean meal, as Argentina is the world’s leading supplier. As of Feb. 20, the managed money net meal long reached 85,089 futures and options contracts from 70,991 in the previous week, and the new stance is the most optimistic since May 2012.\nBut funds are much less enthusiastic about CBOT soybean oil, extending their net short to 27,135 futures and options contracts from 13,630 a week earlier.\nThe buying of meal and selling of soyoil has sent bets in the CBOT oilshare, which measures soybean oil’s share of value in soy products, out of whack. The net short of 112,224 futures and options contracts is funds’ most bearish oilshare view in four years. ( reut.rs/2olLuFQ )\nIn the days since, trade sources suggest that commodity funds have mostly continued the buying trend in soybeans as the Argentine forecast remains dry, and the most-actively traded May contract nearly hit a one-year high on Friday.\nThis came despite the fact that on the same day, Brazilian consultancy Agroconsult raised its estimate for the ongoing Brazilian soybean harvest to a record 117.5 million tonnes. Also on Friday, weekly U.S. export sales data showed net soybean cancellations for the first time during the current marketing year.\nFunds may have also been slight net buyers of corn over the last three sessions as the drought is also set to impact Argentina’s corn crop. The Rosario and Buenos Aires grain exchanges both significantly reduced their estimates of the country’s corn and soybean crops late last week.\nSoybean meal has traded in over-bought territory for two weeks now, and some traders spent the last couple sessions locking in profits. Sources indicate that commodity funds were net sellers of soybean meal and outright buyers of soybean oil between Wednesday and Friday.\nWHEAT MOVED TO BACK BURNER Robust world wheat supplies and the fact that corn, soybeans, and soybean meal are the main event in the market right now rendered speculators’ general attitude toward the wheat contracts largely unchanged last week.\nIn Chicago wheat, funds extended their net short to 67,039 futures and options contracts from 56,831 in the prior week. They slightly shaved their net long in K.C. wheat futures and options to 13,141 contracts from 14,726 in the week before.\nThe managed money net short in Minneapolis wheat increased to 827 futures and options contracts from 318 in the previous week.\nIn the days since, trade sources suggest that funds were slight net sellers of wheat futures.\nEditing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://reut.rs/2olLuFQ", "http://reut.rs/2BOmiQ1", "http://reut.rs/2omRwGc", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T15:06:13.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
