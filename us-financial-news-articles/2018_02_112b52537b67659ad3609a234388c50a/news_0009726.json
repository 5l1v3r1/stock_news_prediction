( reut.rs/2sjee6K ) \nThe reported quarter included a $764 million gain related to deferred tax benefits, as part of the tax code overhaul. \nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned $433 million or 73 cents per share, above average analysts’ estimate of 72 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nICE said it expects adjusted expenses for full year 2018 to range between $2.00 billion and $2.05 billion as it plans to invest in the company and its employees. \nChief Financial Officer Scott Hill said on a post-earnings call that the company would invest $35 million to $40 million on its employees in 2018 and $30 million to $35 million to further strengthen its technological capabilities. \nDeutsche Bank analysts said in a note on Wednesday that ICE’s 2018 expense forecast is above their current estimates, which may pressure the stock. \nShares were down marginally at $71.82 in morning trading. \nTotal revenue, excluding transaction-based expenses, was flat at $1.14 billion, while total operating expenses fell 4.8 percent.
