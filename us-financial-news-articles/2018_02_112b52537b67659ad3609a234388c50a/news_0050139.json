Shetty described his move to ban people from several Muslim-majority countries in January last year as “transparently hateful”.\nLast year’s report accused Trump of “poisonous” rhetoric.\nFree speech will be a key issue for those concerned about human rights this year, the report said.\nAmnesty said its staff were arrested at an unprecedented rate in Turkey in 2017, which along with Egypt and China was also among the biggest jailors of journalists.\nTwo Reuters reporters in Myanmar were arrested while investigating the killing of Rohingya Muslims. Court proceedings are ongoing.\n“In 2018, we cannot take for granted that we will be free to gather together in protest or to criticise our governments. In fact, speaking out is becoming more dangerous,” Shetty said.\nReporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T07:27:21.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
