This appears to be another adjustment currently happening to pharma stocks,” Shin Hyun-joon, analyst at Hanwha Securities, said.\nThe Korea SE Pharmaceutical Index, which tracks South Korean pharma stocks, became volatile in January after jumping 63 percent in 2017. It dipped as much as 11 percent last week before rebounding.\nCelltrion shares fell 5 percent on Thursday, compared to a 0.2 percent gain in the wider market.\nThe FDA letter to Celltrion raised issues about its pharmaceutical manufacturing process, Celltrion said in a statement on its website.\nThe request was part of a routine process for the pharmaceutical industry and the response would be supplied in 15 business days as required, a Celltrion spokeswoman said.\nThe European regulator had verified in early January that the quality of its copies of rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, cancer drug Rituxan and breast cancer drug Herceptin were up to standard, the company said.\n“Celltrion remains confident in the safety and efficacy of its products” manufactured at its site in Incheon, South Korea, the company said.\nCelltrion has received approval for its Remicade biosimilar in the United States and Europe, and for its Rituxan biosimilar in Europe.\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Additional reporting by Dahee Kim; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:15:28.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
