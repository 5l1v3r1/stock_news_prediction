That goal now looks set to be achieved.\nWhile Macron’s commitment to meeting NATO’s 2-percent target will be cheered at NATO headquarters and in Washington, it remains unclear whether other major contributors in Europe will step up to the same extent.\nThe coalition agreement reached on Wednesday between German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats made no explicit commitments on meeting the NATO-agreed target.\nReporting by Sophie Louet; Writing by Luke Baker; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:06:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
