But the index of 30 large U.S. companies was recovering some of that decline as the day headed toward the closing bell at 4 p.m. in New York.\nThe previous record drop during trading hours was 1,089 points on Aug. 24, 2015, a 6.6 percent drop. But in percentage terms, the worst sell-off in recent years was the \"flash crash\" of May 6, 2010, when the Dow temporarily plunged 998 points, or more than 9 percent. Trading would recover both days, but the Dow would still close down more than 3 percent on each of them.\n\nThese more recent events challenge the sharp market downdrafts seen during the worst days of the late-2008 financial crisis. On Oct. 6 that year, the market fell 800 points during trading hours, or 7.7 percent, before recovering to close down 3.5 percent.\nThe worst point drop for a single day was the 777 decline on Sept. 29, 2008, when Congress first failed to approve the government's bank bailout plan. It would later go on to pass that plan.\nWATCH: These are stock market safe havens during a sell-off show chapters These are stock market safe havens during a sell-off      45 Mins Ago | 00:54", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T22:56:34.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
