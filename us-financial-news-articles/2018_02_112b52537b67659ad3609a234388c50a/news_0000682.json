For the year ending December 31, 2017, Net Earnings was $1.11 per diluted share, compared to $1.03 per diluted share, reported for the year ending December 31, 2016, a 7.8 percent increase.\nFunds from operations (“FFO”), as adjusted, attributable to common stockholders and unitholders for Q4 2017 was $0.63 per diluted share, compared with $0.59 per diluted share for Q4 2016, a 6.8 percent increase. For the year ending December 31, 2017, FFO, as adjusted, was $2.45 per diluted share, compared with $2.27 per diluted share, for the year ending December 31, 2016, a 7.9 percent increase.\nProperty Results and Leasing Activity\nAs of December 31, 2017, DCT Industrial owned 398 consolidated operating properties, totaling 65.1 million square feet, with occupancy of 97.8 percent, a decrease of 20 basis points compared to both Q3 2017 and Q4 2016. In addition, approximately 374,000 square feet, or 0.6 percent, of DCT Industrial’s total consolidated operating portfolio was leased but not occupied as of December 31, 2017, which does not take into consideration 731,000 square feet of leased space in developments under construction or in pre-development. During the fourth quarter, the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and placing developments and redevelopments into operations decreased consolidated operating occupancy by 20 basis points. This does not include the impact of the sale of 1.9 million square feet of 100 percent occupied buildings in January 2018, which further reduces consolidated operating occupancy by 10 basis points.\nIn Q4 2017, the Company signed leases totaling 2.3 million square feet with rental rates increasing 21.5 percent on a straight-line basis and 5.9 percent on a cash basis, compared to the corresponding expiring leases.

Additionally, NOI from the Annual Same-Store Portfolio for the full-year 2017 increased 8.0 percent on a cash basis and 4.0 percent on a straight-line basis when compared to the full-year 2016. All same-store NOI amounts exclude revenue from lease terminations.\nQuarterly Same-Store Portfolio occupancy averaged 98.0 percent in Q4 2017, an increase of 30 basis points from Q4 2016. Quarterly Same-Store Portfolio occupancy as of December 31, 2017 was 98.0 percent.\nFor definitions of Financial Measures, including Quarterly Same-Store Portfolio and Annual Same-Store Portfolio, see page 9 of this release and page 22 in DCT Industrial’s Fourth Quarter 2017 Supplemental Reporting Package.\nInvestment Activity\nAcquisitions\nSince DCT Industrial’s Q3 2017 Earnings Release, the Company acquired a 787,000 square foot building in the I-55 submarket of Chicago for $47.3 million.

DCT Industrial considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure because NOI reflects the operating performance of DCT Industrial’s properties and excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties such as amortization, depreciation, impairment, interest expense, interest and other income, income tax benefit (expense) and other taxes and general and administrative expenses. We also present NOI excluding lease termination revenue as it is not considered to be indicative of recurring operating performance. However, NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of DCT Industrial’s overall financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations. Further, DCT Industrial’s NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI. Therefore, DCT Industrial believes net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most appropriate measure to evaluate DCT Industrial’s overall financial performance.\nWe calculate Cash NOI as NOI excluding non-cash amounts recorded for straight-line rents including related bad debt expense and the amortization of above and below market rents. DCT Industrial considers Cash NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure because Cash NOI reflects the operating performance of DCT Industrial’s properties and excludes certain non-cash items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the property such as accounting adjustments for straight-line rent and the amortization of above or below market rent. Additionally, DCT Industrial presents Cash NOI, excluding revenue from lease terminations, as such revenue is not considered indicative of recurring operating performance.\nThe Quarterly Same-Store Portfolio includes all consolidated stabilized acquisitions acquired before October 1, 2016 and all consolidated Value-Add Acquisitions, developments and Redevelopments stabilized prior to October 1, 2016. Once a property is included in the Quarterly Portfolio, it remains until it is subsequently disposed or placed into redevelopment. We consider NOI and Cash NOI from our Quarterly Same-Store Portfolio to be a useful measure in evaluating our financial performance and to improve comparability between periods by including only properties owned for comparable periods.\nThe Annual Same-Store Portfolio includes all consolidated stabilized acquisitions acquired before January 1, 2016 and all consolidated Value-Add Acquisitions, developments and Redevelopments stabilized prior to January 1, 2016. Once a property is included in the Annual Same-Store Portfolio, it remains until it is subsequently disposed or placed into redevelopment. We consider NOI from our Annual Same-Store Portfolio to be a useful measure in evaluating our financial performance and to improve comparability between periods by including only properties owned for those comparable periods.\nDCT Industrial believes that net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, DCT Industrial considers funds from operations (“FFO”), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), to be a useful supplemental, non-GAAP measure of DCT Industrial’s operating performance.\nNAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP.\nFFO is generally defined as net income attributable to common stockholders, calculated in accordance with GAAP with the following adjustments:\nAdd real estate-related depreciation and amortization; Subtract gains from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes; Add impairment losses on depreciable real estate and impairments of in substance real estate investments in investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of the depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures; and Adjustments for the preceding items to derive DCT Industrial’s proportionate share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe also present FFO, as adjusted, which excludes hedge ineffectiveness, certain severance costs, acquisition costs, debt modification costs, impairment losses on properties which are not depreciable and charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 impact. We believe that FFO, as adjusted, excluding hedge ineffectiveness, certain severance costs, acquisition costs, debt modification costs, impairment losses on non-depreciable real estate and charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 impact is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a more meaningful and consistent comparison of our operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results.\nReaders should note that FFO or FFO, as adjusted, captures neither the changes in the value of DCT Industrial’s properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of DCT Industrial’s properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact DCT Industrial’s results from operations. NAREIT’s definition of FFO is subject to interpretation, and modifications to the NAREIT definition of FFO are common. Accordingly, DCT Industrial’s FFO, as adjusted, may not be comparable to other REITs’ FFO or FFO, as adjusted, should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of DCT Industrial’s performance.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe make statements in this report that are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which are usually identified by the use of words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “will,” and variations of such words or similar expressions and includes statements regarding our anticipated yields. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe harbor provisions. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to us and on assumptions we have made. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved. Furthermore, actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and will be affected by a variety of risks and factors that are beyond our control including, without limitation: national, international, regional and local economic conditions, the general level of interest rates and the availability of capital; the competitive environment in which we operate; real estate risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in local markets and competition for tenants in such markets; decreased rental rates or increasing vacancy rates; defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants; acquisition and development risks, including failure of such acquisitions and development projects to perform in accordance with projections; the timing of acquisitions, dispositions and development; natural disasters such as fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes; energy costs; the terms of governmental regulations that affect us and interpretations of those regulations, including the cost of compliance with those regulations, changes in real estate and zoning laws and increases in real property tax rates; financing risks, including the risk that our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal, interest and other commitments; lack of or insufficient amounts of insurance; litigation, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; the consequences of future terrorist attacks or civil unrest; environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by us; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in the section of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and updated on Form 10-Q entitled “Risk Factors.” In addition, our current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, and depends on our ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Code through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. We assume no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180201006510/en/\nDCT Industrial Trust\nMelissa Sachs, 303-597-2400\ninvestorrelations@dctindustrial.com\nSource: DCT Industrial Trust", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dctindustrial.com&esheet=51752533&newsitemid=20180201006510&lan=en-US&anchor=www.dctindustrial.com&index=4&md5=9813637be20133488b0c8218371a933a", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51752533&newsitemid=20180201006510&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=3&md5=20a20afbfd6f5383887dc64a52f81203", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dctindustrial.com&esheet=51752533&newsitemid=20180201006510&lan=en-US&anchor=www.dctindustrial.com&index=2&md5=1f858b6a221d32b70d4863898fdb92e6", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dctindustrial.com&esheet=51752533&newsitemid=20180201006510&lan=en-US&anchor=www.dctindustrial.com&index=1&md5=b1a44c8d713cfa19e58e5186fddb3243", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Falerts.businesswire.com%2Fsubscribe%2Fdct_industrial&esheet=51752533&newsitemid=20180201006510&lan=en-US&anchor=Click+here&index=5&md5=54651d693cb67606e1b041638a938766", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180201006510/en/"], "published": "2018-02-02T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T01:00:52.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
