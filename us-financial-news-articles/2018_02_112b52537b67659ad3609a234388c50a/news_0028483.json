An exchange of fiery words between Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump also ratcheted up unease on the Korean peninsula.\nIn Tuesday’s report, Kim Jong Un gave “important instructions” for possible measures to maintain the atmosphere of conciliation and dialogue without offering more details.\nSeoul said on Monday it would push ahead with its plans for reunions of family members separated by the 1950-53 Korean War in order to sustain the dialogue prompted by the North Korean delegation’s visit.
