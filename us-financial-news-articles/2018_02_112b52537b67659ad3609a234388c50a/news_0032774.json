We are using maximum pressure on North Korea in various ways.”\nThe warning came despite an easing of tensions on the Korean peninsular after talks resumed between North and South Korea, and as the North participated in the Winter Olympics hosted by the South.\nWhile the Trump administration has stressed its preference for a diplomatic solution to the crisis over North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons that are capable of hitting the United States, it has warned that all options on are on the table, including military ones, to prevent this.\nLast month, CIA Director Mike Pompeo said North Korea could be only “a handful of months” away from being able to make a nuclear attack on the United States.\nDirector of National Intelligence Dan Coats is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/Files Pompeo told Tuesday’s hearing that despite the North-South talks, there was “no indication there’s any strategic change” in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s desire to remain a nuclear threat to the United States.\nTalk of preventative military strikes has eased since the Koreas resumed dialogue last month and Washington has appeared to endorse deeper post-Olympics engagement between the two Koreas that could lead to U.S.-North Korean talks.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Mike Pompeo; Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Dan Coats; Defense Intelligence Agency Director Robert Ashley; National Security Agency (NSA) Director Michael Rogers; and National Geospatial Intelligence Agency Director Robert Cardillo testify before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on \"World Wide Threats\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis But it has also stressed the need to ramp up sanctions to force North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.\nLast year, North Korea conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test, in defiance of U.N. sanctions. However, it has now been more than two months since its last missile test in late November.\nCoats said North Korea’s repeated statements that nuclear weapons were the basis for its survival suggest government leaders there “do not intend to negotiate them away.”\n“In the wake of accelerated missile testing since 2016, North Korea is likely to press ahead with more tests in 2018, and its Foreign Minister said that Kim (Jong Un) may be considering conducting an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean,” he said.\nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein asked whether U.S. intelligence has looked into what it might take to bring North Korea to the negotiating table, but Pompeo declined to discuss the subject during a public hearing.\nFeinstein said she had participated in a classified briefing recently on North Korea and described it as “difficult and harsh.”\nReporting by Doina Chiacu, Patricia Zengerle and David Brunnstrom; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T18:58:35.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
