But if they have, it’s at least two years away isn’t it?,” he said.\nThe Malaysian Grand Prix dropped off the calendar after last year’s race but Formula One bosses have talked about expanding in China.\nThere have also been talks with Thailand, which came to nothing, but Vietnam is already an important emerging market for some of the sport’s global sponsors such as Dutch brewer Heineken.\nEcclestone told Reuters last year that he had talks with the Vietnamese while he was running Formula One but decided, despite the money on offer, against taking the sport there because he felt there were enough races in that part of the world.\nHe also recalled Liberty’s criticism subsequent to their takeover of his decision to go to Azerbaijan, a country without a racing history but willing to pay handsomely and whose race was rated the most exciting of last season.\nThe Briton warned, however, that uncertainty over the sport’s future was something any local promoter should consider.\nThe current agreements between teams and Formula One mostly expire at the end of 2020, with glamor team Ferrari already threatening to leave if they do not like the direction things are headed.\nThere is also plenty of debate about what kind of engine to use after 2020, with the current V6 turbo hybrids criticized as too expensive, complicated and quiet.\nWhile some see Ferrari’s threats as empty ones, with Formula One central to their image and history, Ecclestone repeated his view that the president Sergio Marchionne was to be taken seriously.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T00:54:19.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
