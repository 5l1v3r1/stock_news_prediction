The Bruins had posted at least one point in 18 straight games before a Tuesday loss to the Anaheim Ducks.\nRask has been a big reason for the team’s success. This victory helped the goalie earn a point for the Bruins for the 19th straight start -- he is 17-0-2 in that time.\nSt. Louis goalie Jake Allen remained busy, making 43 saves but slipping to 0-5-0 in his past five starts.\nThe Blues now are 5-2-0 in their past seven games, and they did not give Allen much offensive help in this contest as the Bruins outshot them, 46-33.\nKrejci gave Boston a 1-0 lead with 7:28 left in the first period. After Allen made two stops, the puck squirted loose near the crease, and Krejci backhanded it into the net.\nIt was the first time in nine games that Boston scored first -- despite all of the Bruins’ recent success.\nThe Bruins had plenty of chances in the first two periods, compiling 22 shots in the second period and 31 overall but still only holding that 1-0 lead heading into the third.\nBergeron gave Boston some insurance with his goal at 9:05 of the third period.\nJaden Schwartz made it interesting for St. Louis by scoring with 1:32 left in the game, cutting the deficit to 2-1.\nHowever, Backes got his empty-net goal with one second left to seal the victory.\nAlso for the Bruins, the Boston Herald reported that Charlie McAvoy took part in an optional morning skate Thursday and now has been cleared to take part in practice. McAvoy had a heart ablation procedure last week but could return to the lineup as early as this weekend.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:19:35.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
