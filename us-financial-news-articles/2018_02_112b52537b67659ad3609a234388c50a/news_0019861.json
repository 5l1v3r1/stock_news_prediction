The deal did not give a timescale.\nThe first part of the plan involves raising the size and scope of an existing co-investment partnership, known as FEF, which was launched in 2014 by Mubadala and CDC International Capital, a subsidiary of French state-owned Caisse des Dépôts Group aimed at investing alongside sovereign wealth funds.\nThe second part of the agreement, dedicated to technology and innovation in France, will involve Bpifrance, co-owned by Caisse des Dépôts and the French government, and Mubadala investing up to 500 million euros in startups and more mature technology companies through both direct investments and venture capital funds.\nPhilippe will meet investors in Abu Dhabi on Saturday before attending the World Government Summit in Dubai a day later.\n($1 = 0.8157 euros)\nReporting by Marine Pennetier; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T13:54:26.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
