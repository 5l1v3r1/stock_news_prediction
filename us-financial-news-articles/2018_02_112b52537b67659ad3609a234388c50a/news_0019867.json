We do have reserve days and if it’s more windy than today, the gondola’s not going to run so then we have a major problem and (the race) is not going to happen. \n“If that happens, I hope they give good consideration before running it because if there are tail-winds, it will have a huge impact on the race.” Alpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics –Men’s Downhill Training – Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 9, 2018 - Kjetil Jansrud of Norway trains. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann \nInternational Ski Federation (FIS) chief race director Markus Waldner said on Thursday that organizers were considering their options in case the gondola was unable to ship the skiers to the top of the downhill run. \nThe option of shifting it forward to Saturday has already been ruled out by the International Olympic Committee so it looks like the program, which has races on 11 of the 12 days of competition, will have to be rejigged. \nWeather disruptions are commonplace in Alpine skiing both on the World Cup circuit and at the Olympics, and organizers always give themselves plenty of room for adjustments. \n“The wind is always stupid for us because firstly it makes the race a bit unfair and secondly it also makes it dangerous,” said Germany’s Thomas Dressen. \n“But I am certain we will not start if it is dangerous and I think they will stage a fair race.” \nCanada’s Manuel Osborne-Paradis said dealing with the weather went part and parcel with competing in an outdoor sport. \n“The weather happens - in and out of clouds, the wind, snow picks up, whatever,” he said. \n“You push out of the gate, you do your best for two minutes and all the stars have to align anyway... The only factor you’re in charge of is how you ski.” Additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan; editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T08:22:45.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
