It pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstructing an examination by the OCC.\nThe bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In January, it said it had taken a 310 million euro ($373 million) provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 ahead of an expected settlement with the U.S. government.
