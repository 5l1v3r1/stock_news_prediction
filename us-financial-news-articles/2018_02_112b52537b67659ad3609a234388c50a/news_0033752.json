Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world. Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion. And on Utah’s Capitol Hill, people treat one another with respect.”\nTrump has called for building a wall on the country’s border with Mexico and limiting legal migration.\nRomney, the son of former Michigan Governor George Romney, served as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. Before that, he helped found the buyout firm Bain Capital and gained prominence after stepping in to lead the organizing committee for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics after a bribery scandal.\nRomney first sought the presidency in 2008 but lost the Republican nomination to Arizona Senator John McCain. Four years later, Romney won the party’s nomination but was defeated by incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama.\nRomney is the front-runner in the November election in Republican-dominated Utah. According to the Federal Election Commission, the field includes five other people, including a Salt Lake City councilwoman and a Marine Corps veteran.\nFormer Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney speaks after a dinner meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at Jean-Georges inside of the Trump International Hotel & Tower in New York, U.S., November 29, 2016. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/Files The race will be Romney’s second for the Senate. In 1994, he failed to oust Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy from his seat in Massachusetts.\nHatch, 83, the most senior Republican in the Senate, said last month he would not seek an eighth term. Trump had urged Hatch to run again in an apparent attempt to head off Romney.\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Romney excoriated Trump as a “fraud” who was “playing the American public for suckers.” Trump responded that Romney had “choked like a dog” in his race against Obama.\nHowever, after Trump won the presidency in November 2016, he briefly considered whether to pick Romney as his secretary of state.\nTrump had lobbied Hatch to run for re-election in 2018 in what was viewed as an effort to prevent Romney from getting into the Senate. Trump and Romney spoke in January after Hatch announced his retirement, a White House official said.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who had been Romney’s vice presidential running mate in 2012, said in a statement on Friday that he was thrilled with Romney’s decision to run for Senate.\n“His campaign has my unwavering support and the people of Utah will be getting an accomplished and decent man when they make him their next Senator,” Ryan said.\nRepublicans hold 52 of the Senate’s 100 seats but that majority is not always big enough to pass the Trump agenda.\nRomney had successful treatment for prostate cancer in 2017, a source close to him said in January.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert, Makini Brice and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:08:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
