Pena Nieto canceled an earlier scheduled meeting after Trump threatened to impose a tax on Mexican imports to pay for his border wall. Trump also met the Mexican leader once during the 2016 U.S. election campaign.\nU.S. officials, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, met at the White House on Wednesday with a Mexican delegation led by Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray.\n“The meeting furthered the work of both governments over the past year to establish comprehensive agreements on several issues, including economic cooperation and trade, security and law enforcement, energy, regional initiatives, and immigration,” the White House statement said.\nIt said the U.S. and Mexican delegations “look forward to arranging a meeting, in the near future, which will provide President Donald J. Trump and President Enrique Pena Nieto with an opportunity to review the progress that has been made and to discuss various open issues to advance relations between the United States and Mexico.”\nPena Nieto is serving his last year in office. He is constitutionally barred from seeking another term in the July presidential election.\nReporting by Eric Beech; Editing by David Alexander and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T00:17:01.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
