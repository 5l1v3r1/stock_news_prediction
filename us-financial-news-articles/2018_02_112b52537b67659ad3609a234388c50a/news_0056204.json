LCL is doing well, this (last) year net profit is more than 500 million euros,” a spokeswoman for LCL said.\n“There are no economic problems. It is a technical process of capital increase”.\nCredit Agricole said earlier in February that its French retail bank unit had reached a turning point and that revenues should grow from the levels seen in the fourth quarter last year, as it reported higher overall profits.\n$1 = 0.8133 euros Reporting by Yann Le Guernigou and Maya Nikolaeva, Editing by Leigh Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:15:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
