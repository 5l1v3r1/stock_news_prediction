Only when the (M&A) tide goes out do you discover who has been swimming naked,” Pan said.\n“The intangible assets on these companies’ books are landmines. Once they explode, damage can be stunning.”\nMoreover, despite the ChiNext’s nearly 60 percent slump from its 2015 peak, “risk has not yet been fully exposed,” Pan said.\nIn the searing selloff this week, Toread was among the firms that took a battering with its stock price dramatically sliced by over 15 percent.\nIn its preliminary earnings statement, the company said it had swung to a loss in 2017, after writing off over 200 million yuan worth of assets including goodwill.\nIntangible asset write-downs also contributed to an expected loss of 11.6 billion yuan flagged by Leshi Internet, the struggling Chinese video-streaming firm which was once seen as a ChiNext bellwether.\nOther companies which disclosed goodwill impairment this week include Sumavision Technologies, Hybio Pharmaceutical and All Winner Technology, and the list is expected to grow as China heads into the earnings season.\n“Goodwill was created on the basis of many assumptions,” said Lin Xiaofan, Shanghai-based partner at accounting firm PwC.\n“As time goes by, whether those assumptions still stand, is a big question mark.”\nReporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T13:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:17:50.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
