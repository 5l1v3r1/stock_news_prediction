Building on the success of names like Birchbox, Dollar Shave Club, and Trunk Club, established brands like Gap and Under Armour hope they can create their own box model to woo shoppers. \nIf nothing else, subscription boxes offer companies a treasure trove of data — retailers learn what items customers are responding well to, or what inventory should be phased out. \nA subscription service becomes attractive when companies can forecast revenue, but standalone businesses (like Blue Apron) have also struggled to balance sales against the steep marketing costs required to keep membership up. For Target and Walmart, though, the boxes are only a sliver of their overarching businesses. \nHere are 7 traditional retailers that have launched their own subscription boxes: Target \nTarget already has a Beauty Box and Baby Box, and just this past week it revealed plans to roll out a Cat & Jack Outfit Box , which includes clothing from its own wildly popular kids line. The clothing box, which retails for $40, will include six to seven Cat & Jack items with every shipment. The box can either be ordered on a quarterly basis or one time only. The boxes will be available at the start of each season, in sizes newborn to 24 months. They will also include items in the next size up to keep pace with a growing baby.

Four times per year, shoppers will receive a box filled with name-brand products such as Maybelline eyeliner or Tresemme hair spray. While unlikely to contain the high-end banners one would find tucked inside Birchbox, Walmart's box will have essential products that women are bound to use as a part of their beauty routine. And at $5, that's a bargain that's hard to beat.

Items can be ordered via the NY&C Closet , where shoppers will pay $50 to have 3 garments sent to them for unlimited wear. Then, a shopper will return those items when she is ready for a new box. However, she always has the option to purchase a garment permanently, if there's a top, a pair of work pants or a dress in her box that she really loves.
