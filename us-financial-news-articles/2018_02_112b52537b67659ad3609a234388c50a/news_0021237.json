Instead, the narrative of a \"synchronized global growth\" still rings true underneath the sea of red, they said. \nBut this week's sudden pullback is a reminder of the importance of portfolio diversification, and a number of Asian names have emerged as \"defensive\" stocks that could withstand the current volatility. \n\"While for the time being we remain cautious, we will be ready to actively exploit opportunities which could be brought by this wave of volatility resurgence,\" Amundi Asset Management said in a note. \nSome have even drawn up their shopping lists, here's what they contain: Southeast Asia \nStrategists at Morgan Stanley tapped Southeast Asian stocks — in particular Thailand and Singapore — for a defensive play, they wrote in a note this week. \nThe region's markets have appeared more resilient in the global blood bath this week compared to their North Asian peers such as Japan and Greater China. \nSingapore and Thailand, for instance, dipped 2 to 3 percent between the close of last Friday and Thursday, while North Asian markets fell around 6 percent during the same period. \n\"It may seem somewhat late to be talking about a defensive stance. But we would continue to emphasise our preference for (Southeast Asia) ... over North Asia (technology stocks) and in particular Korea,\" according to the note. Japan \nFor investors who would like greater exposure to North Asia, Japan appeared to be one favorite. \nAmundi, for one, said in a note that Japan is a market where stocks are backed by solid earnings-per-share growth. That's a sentiment shared by Peter Boardman, managing director of NWQ Investment Management. \n\"The overall economy remains quite stable, it's growing, earnings are recovering,\" Boardman told CNBC on Friday, noting that when looking at earnings reports that have come out of Japan, around 80 percent of companies surpassed or met expectations. Financials \nIn an environment where interest rates are rising, banks stand to benefit from a boost to lending profitability. \nAsian financials have had a solid start to 2018, noted Morgan Stanley, with banking sectors in major economies such as China and India becoming stronger on domestic restructuring and improving asset quality. \nAs multiple countries in the region press on with reforms, their economies should be on more solid footing this year and that would also help their finance industry. \nWithin Asian financials, Morgan Stanley has an \"overweight\" view on South Korean and Indian banks. It also likes insurance firms in Hong Kong and China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T06:36:42.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
