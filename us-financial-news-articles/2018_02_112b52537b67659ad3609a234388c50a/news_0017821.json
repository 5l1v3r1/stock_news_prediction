It said it had won a large 3D sensing deal from a large Asia smartphone maker and was working on similar projects at other Asian firms.\nResults are being driven not just by higher unit volumes for its chips in smartphones, but by the increasing amount of AMS semiconductor content within its customers’ products in markets for autos and industrial equipment, its chief executive said.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “We are less dependent on phone shipments as a number; we increase content significantly and on top of that we are getting more design wins in other customers, so this is clearly a very, very strong growth story,” Alexander Everke said.\nCUSTOMER FUNDING CAPEX AMS said it was undertaking a massive production ramp-up at its Singapore facilities, where it is making hefty capital spending (capex) investments and hiring around 8,000 employees to support its rapid growth in 3D image and optical sensing.\nIt said it planned to invest $600 million in capex during 2018. “In this context, AMS expects to receive funding from a third party for around 25 percent of these planned investments,” it said in a statement, without naming the investor.\n“The partner you could read as a customer rather than a financial partner,” Chief Financial Officer Michael Wachsler-Markowitsch told an investor conference call.\nShares in AMS, which trade in Zurich, tripled in value last year, making them the best performer on the broad Stoxx600 index of European equities. Tuesday’s rise made it one of only a handful of gainers amid a global stock sell-off.\nThe company also said it had acquired Swiss facial recognition software maker KeyLemon for an undisclosed sum, the latest in a string of sensor-related technology deals.\nAMS proposed to increase the 2017 dividend to 0.33 euros per share from 0.30 euros in 2016 and said it was considering a secondary listing in Hong Kong within 12 months.\nLast week, it reported fourth-quarter revenue jumped 252 percent and raised its sales outlook.\nRelated Coverage 'Any size of deal is possible,' says chipmaker AMS Additonal reporting by John Revill in Zurich; Editing by Eric Auchard and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:40:48.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
