The new subsidiaries will be renamed as Ferroglobe Mangan Norge and Ferroglobe Manganèse France. Ferroglobe has completed the acquisition through its wholly-owned subsidiary Grupo FerroAtlántica.\nSimultaneously with the acquisition, Glencore and Ferroglobe have entered into exclusive agency arrangements for the marketing of Ferroglobe's manganese alloys worldwide and the procurement of manganese ores to supply Ferroglobe's plants, in both cases for a period of ten years.\nFerroglobe Executive Chairman, Javier López Madrid, commented “The acquisition of the Glencore plants in France and Norway represents a unique opportunity for Ferroglobe to become one of the world's largest producers with over half a million tons of sales of manganese alloys. The transaction will deliver solid growth to our existing platform and will provide significant advantages to our customers as Ferroglobe will be better positioned to serve multiple locations in a more agile manner.”\nThe acquisition price for the two facilities included an up-front payment satisfied on closing plus an earn-out payment, payable over eight and a half years, based on the annual performance of each of the acquired plants. Ferroglobe CEO, Pedro Larrea, added, “The structure of the deal is such that it is immediately accretive for Ferroglobe and mutually beneficial in the marketing and procurement agreements.”\nAbout Ferroglobe\nFerroglobe PLC is one of the world's largest producers of silicon metal and silicon- and manganese-based alloys, serving a customer base across the globe in dynamic and fast-growing end markets, such as solar, automotive, consumer products, construction and energy.
