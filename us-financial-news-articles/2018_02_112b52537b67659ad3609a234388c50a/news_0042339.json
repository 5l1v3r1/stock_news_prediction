Great Plains Energy also announced a full-year 2017 loss of $143.5 million or $0.67 per share, compared to earnings of $273.5 million or $1.61 per share in 2016.\nThe decrease in earnings was largely driven by a number of non-recurring impacts due to the anticipated merger with Westar Energy and the impacts of U.S. federal income tax reform.\nGreat Plains Energy’s adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) exclude certain costs, expenses, gains, losses and the per share dilutive effect of equity issuances resulting from the anticipated merger with Westar Energy and the previous plan to acquire Westar as well as the impact of U.S. federal income tax reform. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) were $19.6 million and $0.13, respectively, in 2017 compared with $20.2 million and $0.13, respectively, in 2016. For the full-year of 2017, Great Plains Energy’s adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) were $269.4 million or $1.74 per share, compared with adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) of $286.0 million or $1.85 per share for the full-year of 2016. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) are reconciled to GAAP earnings (loss) in the financial tables included in this release.\n“In 2017, we saw the strongest customer growth our service territory has experienced in over a decade, leading to solid performance for the year,” said Terry Bassham, chairman and chief executive officer of Great Plains Energy.\nBassham continued, “Our proposed merger with Westar Energy remains on track to close in the second quarter of this year. Through integration planning efforts, we remain focused on delivering on the unique opportunities this combination creates for our region. The combined company is expected to have a highly attractive earnings and dividend growth profile and will be positioned to deliver exceptional value to our customers and the communities we serve.”\nGreat Plains Energy Fourth Quarter:\nGREAT PLAINS ENERGY INCORPORATED Consolidated Earnings (Loss) and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share Three Months Ended December 31 (Unaudited) Earnings (Loss) per Great Earnings (Loss) Plains Energy Share 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Earnings (millions) Electric Utility $ 9.5 $ 13.7 $ 0.04 $ 0.06 Other (109.6 ) 84.3 (0.50 ) 0.40 Net income (loss) (100.1 ) 98.0 (0.46 ) 0.46 Preferred dividends - (14.8 ) - (0.07 ) Earnings (loss) available for common shareholders $ (100.1 ) $ 83.2 $ (0.46 ) $ 0.39 Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings (loss) available for common shareholders $ (100.1 ) $ 83.2 $ (0.46 ) $ 0.39 Costs to achieve the anticipated merger with Westar: Operating expenses, pre-tax (a) 7.4 14.8 0.05 0.10 Financing, pre-tax (b) - 16.9 - 0.10 Mark-to-market impacts of interest rate swaps, pre-tax (c) (14.0 ) (158.1 ) (0.09 ) (1.02 ) Interest income, pre-tax (d) (2.7 ) (3.2 ) (0.02 ) (0.02 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (e) (1.3 ) 51.8 (0.01 ) 0.33 Preferred stock (f) - 14.8 - 0.10 Impact of October 2016 share issuance (g) n/a n/a (0.18 ) 0.15 Impact of U.S. federal income tax reform: Income tax expense (h) 130.3 - 0.84 - Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) $ 19.6 $ 20.2 $ 0.13 $ 0.13 Average Shares Outstanding (millions) Shares used in calculating diluted earnings (loss) per share 215.6 214.2 Adjustment for October 2016 share issuance (g) (60.5 ) (59.2 ) Shares used in calculating adjusted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) 155.1 155.0 (a)\nReflects legal, advisory and consulting fees and certain severance expenses and are included in Costs to achieve the anticipated merger with Westar on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

GAAP Earnings\nOn a per-share basis, drivers for the decrease in full-year 2017 GAAP earnings per share compared to the same period in 2016 include $1.33 of additional costs to achieve the anticipated merger with Westar Energy and $0.84 of income tax expense from U.S. federal income tax reform as detailed in the table above as well as the following items under the heading Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP).\nAdjusted Earnings (non-GAAP)\nOn a per-share basis, drivers for the decrease in full-year 2017 adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) per share compared to the same period in 2016 included the following:\nAn approximate $0.21 decrease from milder weather driven by a 16 percent decrease in cooling degree days; and $0.10 of higher depreciation and amortization.\nThese drivers were partially offset by the following:\nAn estimated $0.13 impact from an increase in weather-normalized retail demand; An approximate $0.03 increase in other margin items; and A $0.04 decrease in other operating and maintenance expense.\nOverall retail megawatt hour sales were down 1.6 percent compared to the 2016 period, with the decrease primarily driven by weather. The unfavorable weather impact for the full year of 2017, when compared to normal, was approximately $0.19 per share.\nOn a weather-normalized basis, full-year 2017, retail megawatt sales increased 0.8 percent, net of an estimated 0.9 percent impact from the Company’s energy efficiency programs, compared to the 2016 period.\nAdjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP)\nIn addition to earnings (loss) available for common shareholders, Great Plains Energy's management uses adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) to evaluate earnings and earnings per share without the impact of the anticipated merger with Westar Energy and the initial impact of U.S. federal income tax reform. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) exclude certain costs, expenses, gains, losses and the per share dilutive effect of equity issuances resulting from the anticipated merger and the previous plan to acquire Westar Energy and the income tax expense associated with the revaluation of deferred income taxes and other initial impacts resulting from the enactment of U.S. federal income tax reform in December 2017.
