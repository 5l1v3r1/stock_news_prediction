REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque “I would say they were more on the cautious side of getting me out there right away with the bye week and everything in between which definitely helped out big time,” said Gronkowski.\n“But just did every step by step every day and everything went smooth and I officially got the word today that I was cleared so it was super nice to hear.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) Gronkowski, who missed last year’s Super Bowl win against the Atlanta Falcons because of a back injury, said he had been progressing well all week and that he had no doubt that he would be cleared in time to play in the Super Bowl.\n”I knew I was going to be playing the whole time but I was just obviously being cautious too,“ said Gronkowski. ”I didn’t want to jump right into right away, the team didn’t want to do it.\n“We did the process very well with the training staff here and the doctors that we have I think they did a great job in preparing me to get back on the field.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T01:58:36.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
