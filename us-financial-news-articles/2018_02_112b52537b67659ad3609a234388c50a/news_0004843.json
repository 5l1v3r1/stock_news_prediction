(Nasdaq: IVAC) today reported financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended December 30, 2017.\n2017 Highlights\nThird straight year of growth in total revenues and orders Total revenues up 41% from 2016 New orders of $108 million, up 11% from 2016 Significant growth in Thin-film Equipment (TFE) business Revenues up 75% year-over-year, with significant growth in both new TFE growth initiatives, as well as Hard Disk Drive (HDD) systems and upgrades Year-end backlog up for the 5 th straight year, to $52 million Revenues recognized on multiple new product platforms: INTEVAC VERTEX® in the display cover panel market INTEVAC MATRIX® in the solar market ENERGi® ion implant in the solar market Third straight year of improving operating results Return to profitability, with EPS of $0.18 per diluted share for 2017\n“As expected, strong growth in our Thin-film Equipment business led to overall revenues increasing 41% year-over-year, and a return to profitability in 2017,” commented Wendell Blonigan, president and chief executive officer of Intevac. “The continued technology investments by our HDD customers helped drive favorable results in TFE revenues, gross margins and profitability, both for the fourth quarter and for the full year. 2017 was also a pivotal year for our TFE growth initiatives, with revenues recognized on the VERTEX and MATRIX, our newest high-productivity, substrate-independent platforms serving multiple new end markets outside of the HDD industry. These platforms are gaining traction and represent significant future revenue growth opportunities for the Company.\n“In our Photonics business, we were successful in capturing new development programs during 2017. Importantly, we secured funding for our next-generation night-vision sensor, the ISIE-19. We were pleased to report the approval of the DELTA-I program under the Department of Defense’s Coalition Warfare Program funded by the DoD, SOCOM and several foreign nation coalition partners. The DELTA-I program includes a $12 million funding commitment to complete the design of our ISIE-19 sensor as well as the development of a digitally-fused infrared/night vision goggle. We were also placed on contract for our integrated night vision camera on the Striker II helmet for Europe’s Typhoon aircraft. Accordingly, we expect our Photonics revenue profile in the near term to transition from a product-driven one to a funded R&D profile.\n“Year-end backlog in our TFE business is up for five straight years, as we continue to execute against our TFE growth initiatives. 2018 will be another important year, as we continue to work toward new market opportunities for both the VERTEX and the MATRIX. Our customers in the display cover panel market continue to evaluate the VERTEX, and our oDLC™ coating has now been adopted for a top-5 cell phone application. We also are working with multiple outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) vendors in advanced wafer-level and panel-level packaging to adapt our MATRIX for fan-out applications. In total, we believe we are on a path to continue to drive revenue growth and profitability for the Company.”\n($ Millions, except per share amounts) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 GAAP Results Non-GAAP\nResults\nGAAP Results Non-GAAP Results Net Revenues $ 24.8 $ 24.8 $ 29.0 $ 29.0 Operating Income $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 2.9 $ 2.9 Net Income (Loss) $ — $ (0.1 ) $ 2.8 $ 2.8 Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share $ — $ — $ 0.13 $ 0.13\nYear Ended Year Ended December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 GAAP Results Non-GAAP\nResults\nGAAP Results Non-GAAP Results Net Revenues $ 112.8 $ 112.8 $ 80.1 $ 80.1 Operating Income (Loss) $ 4.8 $ 4.6 $ (7.6 ) $ (7.7 ) Net Income (Loss) $ 4.1 $ 3.9 $ (7.4 ) $ (7.5 ) Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share $ 0.18 $ 0.17 $ (0.36 ) $ (0.36 ) Intevac’s non-GAAP adjusted results exclude the impact of changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with business combinations.

See also “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Summary\nThe net loss for the quarter was $41,000, or $0.00 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The non-GAAP net loss was $83,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRevenues were $24.8 million, including $17.9 million of TFE revenues and Photonics revenues of $6.9 million. TFE revenues consisted of two 200 Lean HDD systems, upgrades, spares and service. Photonics revenues included $2.7 million of research and development contracts. In the fourth quarter of 2016, revenues were $29.0 million, including $19.3 million of TFE revenues which consisted of two 200 Lean HDD systems, one MATRIX PVD solar system, upgrades, spares and service and Photonics revenues of $9.7 million, which included $2.0 million of research and development contracts.\nTFE gross margin was 45.0% compared to 38.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 45.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The improvement from the fourth quarter of 2016 reflected a higher mix of higher-margin upgrades versus systems shipments and improved factory absorption. The decline from the third quarter of 2017 reflected lower factory absorption.\nPhotonics gross margin was 26.0% compared to 45.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 36.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The decline from the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 was due to lower margins on products and a higher-mix of lower margin research and development contracts. Consolidated gross margin was 39.8%, compared to 41.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 42.3% in the third quarter of 2017.\nR&D and SG&A expenses were $9.7 million, compared to $9.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and to $10.3 million in the third quarter of 2017. Higher year-over-year expenses reflected increased variable compensation program accruals. The decrease from the third quarter of 2017 resulted from lower spending on R&D programs.\nOrder backlog totaled $64.0 million on December 30, 2017, compared to $72.8 million on September 30, 2017 and $68.5 million on December 31, 2016.

Non-GAAP net income was $3.9 million or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to the non-GAAP net loss of $7.5 million or $0.36 per diluted share for fiscal 2016.\nRevenues were $112.8 million, including $79.0 million of TFE revenues and Photonics revenues of $33.8 million, of which $8.0 million was contract R&D revenues, compared to 2016 revenues of $80.1 million, including $45.3 million of TFE revenues and Photonics revenues of $34.9 million for 2016, of which $5.8 million was contract R&D revenues.\nTFE gross margin was 42.7%, compared to 32.8% in 2016. The improvement from 2016 reflected a higher level of revenue, a higher mix of higher-margin upgrades versus systems shipments and improved factory absorption. Photonics gross margin was 35.2% compared to 44.6% in 2016, reflecting a higher mix of lower-margin research and development contracts versus product sales. Consolidated gross margin was 40.5% compared to 38.0% in 2016.\nTotal R&D and SG&A expenses were $41.0 million compared to $38.1 million in 2016. The higher level of SG&A expenses reflects increased accruals for variable compensation programs as a result of the Company’s profitability for the year.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIntevac's non-GAAP results exclude the impact of changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with business combinations. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the financial tables included in this release.\nManagement uses non-GAAP results to evaluate the company’s operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Intevac believes these measures enhance investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will discuss its financial results and outlook in a conference call today at 1:30 p.m. PST (4:30 p.m. EST).
