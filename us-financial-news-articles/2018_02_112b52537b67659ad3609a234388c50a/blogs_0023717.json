It came as stocks were breaking record after record — until last Friday's tumble. \nHickey contends the markets were ripe for a sell-off, which was sparked by converging factors including worries that rising wages will spur higher interest rates, pension fund re-balancing and short volatility ETFs blowing up. \nHe doesn't buy the notion that the markets are broken. Hickey, who views the sell-off as a buying opportunity, also blames the plunge on a volatility shock sparked by a long period of calmness. \n\"It seemed abnormal,\" he said. \"But compared to other periods, we've seen these types of pullbacks and big spikes in volatility before.\" \nAs violent as it became, he sees the volatility jump as a short-term challenge. \n\"It's more of just a reality check for investors,\" Hickey said. \"[They] almost feel like 5 percent monthly gains are a God-given right.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T15:54:19.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
