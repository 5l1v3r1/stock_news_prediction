In that case, now's the time to develop one, he said. \nWithin that broader framework, there are a few points of action to consider. \nMarkets going down (or up) is a reminder to rebalance , said certified financial planner Carolyn McClanahan, director of financial planning for Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. \"Making changes to a portfolio based on short-term action in the market doesn't typically provide for good long-term results.\" -Diahann Lassus, President, Lassus Wherley \n\"People should always have an asset allocation that reflects their ability to take risk,\" she said. \nRebalancing can help you take some of the profits out of investments that have performed well, Lassus of Lassus Wherley said, providing opportunities to build cash reserves or diversify your portfolio with other investments. \nThe drop could also be an opportunity for strategic purchases, \"to buy something that may have run away from you earlier,\" said Johnson of Delancey Wealth Management. \nMore from Personal Finance:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T16:50:45.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
