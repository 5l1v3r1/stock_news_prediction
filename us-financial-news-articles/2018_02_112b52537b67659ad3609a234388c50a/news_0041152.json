They added that the expectation Goldman Sachs and Macquarie would win put off some prospective bidders.\nThe sources, both in the infrastructure investing industry, said the growth projections provided by the company were too aggressive. Final bids and a winner were expected in mid-March.\nAnother source said “less than a handful” of bidders remain, but none had emerged as a clear favorite.\nFILE PHOTO: A pedestrian walks past the logo of Australia's biggest investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd which adorns a wall on the outside of their Sydney office headquarters in central Sydney, Australia, July 18, 2017. REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo HES, owned by energy and power-focused private investment firm Riverstone and private equity firm Carlyle ( CG.O ), delivers around 100 million euros in earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the two sources said, estimating it would achieve an enterprise multiple in the 20s times EBITDA.\nRiverstone, Carlyle, Morgan Stanley, Macquarie and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.\nHES provides transshipment, storage, blending and processing services of dry bulk and liquid bulk products at 19 sites across eight countries, with more than 1,350 staff. A spokeswoman for the company could not immediately comment.\nSeparately, Brookfield Asset Management, Antin Infrastructure Partners and Arcus Infrastructure Partners are selling container port operator Euroports.\n($1 = 0.8007 euros)\nEditing by Kirsten Donovan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:33:37.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
