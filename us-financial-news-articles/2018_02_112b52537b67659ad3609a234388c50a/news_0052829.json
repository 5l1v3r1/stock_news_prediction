Since then some very small lenders were forced to file for bankruptcy, and major banks have paid for clients’ deposits via the BFG.\nIn 2016, ruling party Law and Justice (PiS) which remains at odds with the European Union, introduced a bank tax, that significantly cut banks’ profits, in a move that was aimed to increase budget revenues to secure money for huge social transfers aimed at supporting poorer parts of the society.\n$1 = 3.3911 zlotys Reporting by Marcin Goclowski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:30:58.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
