A Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to try to restore its president to power has conducted frequent air strikes targeting Iran-aligned Houthi rebels and has often hit civilians, although denies ever doing so intentionally. Medics and a Reuters photographer who saw the wreckage in Saada said an initial air strike destroyed a house in the outlying Sohar district of the city, the main stronghold of the Houthis who control much of northern Yemen.

A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition could not immediately be reached for comment. The coalition entered Yemen’s conflict three years ago against the Houthis after they ousted the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and driven the country - already the poorest on the Arabian Peninsula - to the verge of widespread famine.
