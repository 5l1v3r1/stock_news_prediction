Reuters is not naming the four former Deutsche Bank employees for legal reasons.\nDeutsche Bank, Barclays ( BARC.L ) and Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) admitted their involvement in a Euribor cartel in 2013 in a European Commission investigation.\nThe Commission fined Deutsche and SocGen a total of $1 billion, and two years later U.S. and British authorities fined the German bank another $2.5 billion and its London subsidiary pleaded guilty to rate-rigging.\nBarclays received immunity for revealing the alleged cartel in the Brussels investigation but paid $453 million to U.S. and British authorities to settle rate-rigging allegations in 2012.\nReporting by Tom Sims; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:27:17.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
