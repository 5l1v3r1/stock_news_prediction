Levashov was scheduled to appear in court in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the Justice Department said.\nReporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T00:21:58.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
