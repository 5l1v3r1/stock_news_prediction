In December, Caracas managed to pump 1.7 million barrels a day, according to S&P Global Platts.\nAnalysts expect the production losses to continue to deteriorate throughout 2018, with RBC Capital Markets projecting a fall of at least 700,000 to 800,000 barrels per day this year.\n\"Against this bleak backdrop, the recently scheduled April elections could prove to be the catalyst for more civil strife and economic sanctions that would further erode output,\" Croft said.\nLast month, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro — labeled a \"dictator\" by the U.S. — said he was ready to seek another term in office. The new presidential elections are due to be held before April 30.\nThe move was branded by observers as an attempt by the ruling socialist party to exploit an opposition in disarray and strengthen its position in government before the economic crisis becomes even more acute.\nThe oil-dependent state is struggling to cope with hyperinflation — estimated by Venezuela's opposition party to hit 1,400 percent in 2018. This has put the South American nation's entire economy, including its nationalized oil industry that accounts for most of the country's export revenues, in jeopardy.\nProspect of US-imposed oil sanctions The decline in oil production is also deepening the turmoil for approximately 30 million Venezuelan citizens, as they continue to suffer from food shortages and a lack of basic medicines.\nSpeaking to reporters in Argentina on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said banning exports of oil or refined oil products to Venezuela was on the table.\nCarlos Becerra | Bloomberg | Getty Images Nicolas Maduro, president of Venezuela, speaks during a swearing in ceremony for the new board of directors of Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), Venezuela's state oil company, in Caracas, Venezuela, on Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017. Oil sanctions are seen as one of the few options President Donald Trump has to really hurt Maduro's government. Meantime, Tillerson said the U.S. administration would also consider the impact of oil sanctions on Venezuelan citizens.\n\"Even if the U.S. does not opt for the nuclear option of oil sanctions, Venezuela has already migrated from being a mere risk story to being a material disruption reality,\" Croft said.\nBrent crude traded at $66.80 a barrel on Wednesday afternoon, down 0.1 percent, while U.S. crude was seen at $63.05, down 0.5 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T16:13:09.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
