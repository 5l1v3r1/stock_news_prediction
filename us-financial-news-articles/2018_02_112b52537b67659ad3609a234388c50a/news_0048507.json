(NASDAQ: MDXG), a leading developer and marketer of regenerative and therapeutic biologics, today announced that it will postpone the release of its financial results, as well as the filing of its Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Audit Committee of MiMedx's Board of Directors has engaged independent legal and accounting advisors to conduct an internal investigation into current and prior-period matters relating to allegations regarding certain sales and distribution practices at the Company. Company executives are also reviewing, among other items, the accounting treatment of certain distributor contracts.\nThe Audit Committee is working closely with its advisors to complete this investigation in as timely a manner as possible. The Company will not be in a position to release its financial results until the Audit Committee's internal investigation is completed.\nThe Company believes, based on information available to date, that the outcome of such investigation should not have a material impact on revenue guidance for 2018. The Company's unaudited cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 were approximately $33 million, after giving effect to the use of approximately $24 million for share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2017 as part of the Company's Share Repurchase Program. The Company had no debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The Company also does not expect this delay to affect its operational performance and clinical research activities.\n\"Our Board of Directors and executives believe it is in the best interests of our Company and shareholders for our Audit Committee to address these allegations in an internal investigation with the support of independent legal and accounting advisors.
