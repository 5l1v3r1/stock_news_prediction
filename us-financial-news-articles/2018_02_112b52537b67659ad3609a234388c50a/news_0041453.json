We always have close matches,” Anderson said after bringing his career head-to-head record against Querrey to 8-8.\n“I’ve been in quite a few finals,” Anderson continued. “It really means a lot to me to get through today.”\nThe Florida-based 31-year-old has been in 15 career finals but won just four. His most significant finals loss came last September some 25 kilometres (16 miles) away at Flushing Meadows when he was beaten by Rafa Nada at the U.S. Open.\n“One of the big goals I had for this year was to try to be a bit more successful in that final stage,” Anderson said.\n“It feels great to come through and get today’s win. It gives me a lot of confidence for the year.”\nReporting by Andrew Both in Adelaide, South Australia; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T01:34:38.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
