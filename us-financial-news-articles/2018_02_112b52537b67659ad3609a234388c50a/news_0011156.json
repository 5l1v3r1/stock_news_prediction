Critics, however, suspect Beijing of buying time to consolidate its maritime power. \nMalaysia, Taiwan, Brunei, Vietnam and the Philippines claim some or all of the South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest sea routes. China claims most of the waterway and has been aggressively building and militarizing artificial islands. \nBalakrishnan said resolution of the South China Sea dispute would not be easy, even with the talks for a code of conduct under way. \n“It’s going to be a very complicated negotiation,” he told a news conference. “Territorial claims are not resolved just because you have a COC,” he said.
