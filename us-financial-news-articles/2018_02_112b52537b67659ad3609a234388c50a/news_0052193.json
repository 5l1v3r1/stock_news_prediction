While weight loss was observed for the two smaller doses, they did not reach statistical significance.\nThe company’s shares rose on the news and traded 3.9 percent higher at 1032 GMT.\nNovo Nordisk said it aims to provide data from the remaining nine trials this year and expects to submit the drug for regulatory approval in 2019.\nRivals, especially Eli Lilly, are watching Novo’s final-stage oral semaglutide trials closely, ahead of the drug’s potential 2020 launch.\nThe once-daily pill belongs to a blockbuster class of treatments known as GLP-1s that stimulate insulin production, the first of which were derived from the venomous bite of North America’s Gila monster lizard. So far, all have been injections.\nReporting by Stine Jacobsen; Editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:05:33.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
