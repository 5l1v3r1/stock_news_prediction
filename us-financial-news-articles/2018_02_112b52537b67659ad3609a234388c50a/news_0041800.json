Barkindo said compliance last year stood at 107 percent and that OPEC and non-OPEC producers would hold a technical meeting in June. The OPEC Secretary-General made the comments while speaking at a conference in Nigeria’s capital Abuja. Commercial oil stocks for the OECD rose in January 2018 and were about 74 million barrels over the latest five-year average, he said. Global oil demand for 2018 is estimated to grow 1.6 million barrels per day due to an “encouraging environment”, Barkindo added.
