Economists had expected the growth rate to edge up to 8.4 percent, from 8.2 percent in December.\nOther data last week had painted a somewhat mixed view of the economy at the start of the year, with inflationary pressures easing -- possibly pointing to softening activity â€” but better-than-expected import and export growth.\nTaken together, the stronger credit and trade data would appear to still support the consensus view that China will see only a modest pullback in GDP growth to around 6.5 percent this year, after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent in 2017.\nHowever, analysts warn that investors will likely not get a clearer picture of the health of China's economy until March, because January and February month data are distorted by the timing of the lengthy Lunar New Year holidays.\nCredit is still ample Outstanding yuan loans grew 13.2 percent in January from a year earlier, also faster than an expected 12.5 percent rise and compared with an increase of 12.7 percent in December.\nLast year, China's total new loans hit a record 13.53 trillion yuan, 7 percent more than the previous record in 2016.\nThe credit boom has been fueled by strong economic growth, a robust property market and a crackdown on riskier shadow lending, which has forced banks to shift some loans back onto their balance sheets.\nSince the start of 2017, Chinese regulators have announced a slew of steps to coax financial institutions to reduce riskier activity and leverage, targeting everything from interbank lending levels to bond trading , negotiable certificates of deposit and entrusted loans.\nIn addition, the People's Bank of China has been gingerly nudging up money market interest rates, most recently in December. However, rates have also been slowly creeping higher on their own, as regulators look set to persist with the current \"de-risking\" campaign taking much longer than policy crackdowns in the past.\nThose efforts appear to be bearing fruit. The outstanding amount of banking wealth management products (WMPs) grew just 1.7 percent last year, compared with a near 24 percent rise in 2016. Many of these products had strong links with the less-regulated shadow banking sector.\nshow chapters China's debt issue is overblown, academic says 4:58 AM ET Thu, 7 Dec 2017 | 02:15 Analysts expect authorities to step up their efforts this year, focusing on local government debt, rising corporate and household debt levels and dealing with \"zombie\" companies.\nOn Monday, the state planner issued new rules for companies which are planning to issue bonds to put more pressure on debt-laden local governments to get their finances in order.\nBut analysts say more still needs to be done on structural reforms to rein in ballooning corporate debt, which has reached levels that the IMF and others have warned sharply raises the risks of a financial crisis.\nChina's total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, surged to 3.06 trillion yuan in January from 1.14 trillion yuan in December, additional data showed on Monday.\nTSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.\nThat can provide hints on activity in China's vast and unregulated shadow banking sector, which authorities have also been targeting in their campaign to reduce systemic risks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T07:22:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
