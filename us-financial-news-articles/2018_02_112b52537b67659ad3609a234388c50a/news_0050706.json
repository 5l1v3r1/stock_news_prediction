The maker of Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarettes said full-year revenue rose 37.6 percent to 20.29 billion pounds, shy of analysts average estimate of 20.55 billion, according to analysts at RBC Capital Markets. Excluding the impact of last year’s acquisition of Reynolds American and the weakness of the British currency, adjusted organic revenue rose 2.9 percent, also below estimates of 3.4 percent growth, according to the analysts. Adjusted earnings per share rose about 10 percent to 284.4 pence, excluding the impact of a gain related to the deal and a deferred tax credit. That was ahead of estimates. Excluding the Reynolds acquisition, volume of cigarettes and “tobacco heating products” which heat but do not burn tobacco fell 2.6 percent, which was less than the decline seen by the industry, BAT said. Global cigarette sales volumes are in decline as more people cut back or quit smoking. BAT shares were down 4.4 percent to 4,254 pence at 0839 GMT.
