The Beijing-based company reported more than 60 billion yuan in sales last year. \nAlibaba has been making sizable investments in the country’s retail sector since 2015, when it took a 20 percent stake in local electronics retailer Suning.com Co for $4.6 billion. \nIn November, Alibaba agreed to take a $2.9 billion stake in China’s top hypermarket operator, Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. \n“Physical stores serve an indispensable role during the consumer journey, and should be enhanced through data-driven technology and personalized services in the digital economy,” Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said at the time. \nLast year, Alibaba also led the $2.6 billion privatisation of Intime Retail Group Co as part of its move into bricks and mortar activities.
