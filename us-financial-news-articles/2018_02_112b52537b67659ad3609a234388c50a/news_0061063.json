To skirt the alternate days regulation, many families buy a used car with a different number plate.\nApart from health issues, pollution from combustion engines causes severe damage to Rome’s many ancient outdoor monuments.\nAccording to a study last year by a branch of the culture ministry, 3,600 stone monuments and 60 bronze sculptures risk serious deterioration because of air pollution.\nAhead of celebrations marking the start of the new millennium in 2000, the darkened facade of St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican was cleaned as part of a project that lasted several years.\nBut fresh signs of pollution-related stains are visible again.\nBefore the German court’s ruling on Tuesday, officials in highly industrialized Milan, in northern Italy, had already announced plans to make the city diesel free by 2030.\nReporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:51:03.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
