Separatists waged a 40-year militant campaign, blowing up police stations and mansions owned by mainlanders and carrying out assassinations, before laying down arms in 2014.\nSince then, the same dissatisfaction with mainstream parties that has spurred secessionist ambitions elsewhere in Europe, such as Catalonia, has bolstered the nationalists’ political support. In December, the two-party “Pe a Corsica” (For Corsica) nationalist alliance won nearly two-thirds of seats in the regional assembly.\nIts leaders demand a special status for Corsica in the constitution and greater autonomy, as well as equal status for the French and Corsican languages and amnesty for Corsicans jailed for pro-independence violence.\nMacron has said he is open to some changes but has ruled out recognizing Corsican alongside French, and on Tuesday reiterated his refusal to pardon Corsican militants.\n“Corsica, a proud and dignified land, was dirtied by this crime,” Macron, on his first visit to the island, said in reference to the 1998 shooting of Erignac.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron places a wreath of flowers during a ceremony in tribute to the slain French prefect Claude Erignac, who was shot dead on the island 20 years ago by pro-independence activists, at the prefecture in Ajaccio, on the French island of Corsica, France, February 6, 2018 as part of his two-day visit in Corsica.

Support for outright independence, however, remains low.\nWithin the Pe a Corsica alliance, the moderately autonomist Femu a Corsica party holds power in numbers over the committed Separatist Corsica Libera party. Even so, Femu politician Gilles Simeoni, who heads the regional executive, last week told Reuters that Macron risked violence if he did not take talks seriously.\n“In the 1980s and 1990s, when the nationalist movement only represented a minority and was violent, governments of the left and right held talks with men in balaclavas,” he said in the interview. “But today, when we represent a majority and say there is no other path than democracy, the government does not want to budge on anything.”\nReporting by Paul Ortoli; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T15:25:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
