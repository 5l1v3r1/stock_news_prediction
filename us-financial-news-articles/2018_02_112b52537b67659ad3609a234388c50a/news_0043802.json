The Detroit automaker announced last week that it would shut its plant in the city of Gunsan, southwest of Seoul, by May and decide the future of the remaining three plants in the country within weeks. GM has asked for financial support for its money-losing South Korean unit. Meanwhile, GM’s South Korean labour union on Thursday has decided not to go on a strike for the time being, a union source told Reuters. It plans to ask the government to participate in the due diligence of GM Korea, the source added.
