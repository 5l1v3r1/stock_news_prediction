He then highlighted stocks such as Exxon Mobil and Bank of America as potential upside plays over the next few years.\nBank of America has outperformed the market over the past week, posting a 2.8 percent gain versus the S&P 500's 0.3 percent climb. Exxon Mobil, though down week over week, was up 1.1 percent Monday.\nTweet. \nStill, Acampora acknowledged, last week's sell-off was reason enough to spark \"major investor concern\" and spelled out some of the reasons for worry.\n\"The market's recent decline has been accelerated by concern over: rising interest rates, renewed inflationary fears and the 'uncontrolled' trading activity of algorithmic program,\" he explained. \"Since its peak on January 26th, the market has experienced its most volatile decline in many years.\"\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T20:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T20:16:44.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
