That was the plan Reuters reported last year, citing sources.\nInvestcorp, which acquired a 25 percent stake in the firm in 2013, is expected to be one of the sellers of shares, the sources said.\nLeejam did not respond to a phone call requesting a comment. Investcorp, the Bahrain-based private equity firm, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n$1 = 3.7502 riyals Additional reporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:29:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
