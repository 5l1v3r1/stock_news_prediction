The North and the United States were also holding a series of high-level talks on Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes.\nSECOND SUMMIT, PYONGYANG (Oct 2-4, 2007)\nRoh Moo-hyun, a liberal South Korean president who carried on with Kim Dae-jung’s engagement policy, crossed the border to the North to meet Kim Jong Il in 2007.\nThe meeting came amid brisk diplomacy among the members of six-party denuclearisation talks - the United States, China, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas.\nThe six nations were working to implement a framework deal they reached in September 2005 under which Pyongyang was to give up its nuclear programme in return for massive economic and energy aid and an end to its diplomatic isolation.\nThe summit culminated in an eight-point agreement, built on the 2000 declaration. The two leaders vowed to resolve the nuclear issues by implementing the 2005 deal; end military hostilities through dialogue; replace the current armistice signed after the Korean War with a permanent peace regime; and expand business cooperation by building new joint economic zones, among others.\nBut the agreement made little headway after the North carried out a series of nuclear and missile tests, and after conservative presidents took office in the South, adopting a harder line on Pyongyang.\nReporting by Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T13:56:22.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
