Televisa, the biggest producer of content in Spanish, said it plans to sell certain operations that are no longer strategic to focus on content and distribution, a decision made after a thorough review of its portfolio. Grupo Televisa said the transaction is subject to the meeting of certain conditions, which it expects to take place in the next few months. Shares of Televisa rose more than 3 percent in morning trading before paring gains to 2.39 percent at 72.4 pesos per share.
