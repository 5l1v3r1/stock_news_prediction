The sector was up 0.62 percent Friday, with Apple , Microsoft and Alphabet leading.\n“There are certainly parts of the market that are not hurt by higher rates and I imagine those stocks to move along. Particularly, technology stocks that not only don’t have exposure to interest rates but have cash balances,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.\nEconomic data also pained a rosy picture. Homebuilding increased to more than a one-year high in January, boosted by strong increases in the construction of single- and multi-family housing units. A different report showed import prices jumped last month.\nAt 13:16 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.31 percent at 25,278.45 and the S&P 500 rose 0.38 percent to 2,741.69. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.22 percent to 7,272.08.\nThe S&P and the Nasdaq are set for their best week since December 2011, while the Dow is on track for its best week since November 2016.\nThe CBOE volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, eased to 18.91 points on Friday, way off the 50-point level it hit during the peak of sell-off.\nOn the earnings front, nearly 77 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter results so far have topped profit estimates, above the 72 percent average of the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nCoca-Cola rose more than 1 percent after the company reported better-than-expected profit and sales as it sold more teas, coffees and vitamin water.\nAmong the big decliners was Kraft Heinz, which dropped 3.7 percent after the company’s quarterly profit and sales missed analysts’ estimates.\nVF Corp fell nearly 10 percent after the apparel and footwear maker reported quarterly profit and revenue slightly below analysts’ estimates.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,938 to 952. On the Nasdaq, 1,829 issues rose and 1,054 fell.
