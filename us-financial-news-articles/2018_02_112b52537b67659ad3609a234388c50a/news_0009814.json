The sector was already struggling with thin margins, stiff competition and falling prices. \nA big question for the industry has been whether the run of catastrophes would allow them to achieve higher prices for their coverage, which have been in decline for years. \nMunich Re said that the January renewals season for reinsurance showed prices up by about 0.8 percent, compared with drops of 0.5 percent in 2017 and 1 percent in 2016. \nA turnaround in prices would be the first major reversal since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \nMunich Re is scheduled to release detailed earnings for the fourth quarter and full year on March 15. \nThe company announced its dividend would remain stable at 8.60 euros per share for 2017, unchanged from 2016. “Our dividend is reliable,” Schneider said. $1 = 0.8081 euros Reporting by Tom Sims; editing by Maria Sheahan and Jason Neely", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T09:55:01.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
