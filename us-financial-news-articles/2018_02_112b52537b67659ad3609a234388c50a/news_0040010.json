Chaos after Canada-Germany dead-heat James Pearson 3 Min Read PYEONGCHANG,   It was one of the closest sliding races in Olympic history, but when Canada’s Justin Kripps and Alexander Kopacz rocketed over the finish line in the two-man bobsleigh final on Monday, they knew they had secured gold. Trouble was, Germany’s Francesco Friedrich and Thorsten Margis had also won the race. Kripps had put together three good runs, consistently placing first or second, and he needed to pull out another one to secure his first Olympic gold medal. Friedrich set the fastest time but Kripps, in the final run of the competition, exactly matched his mark of three minutes 16.86 seconds. “It took me a couple of minutes. We were in the changing room and I asked Thorsten and I said I‘m not sure I understood what just happened, did we tie?,” Canadian brakeman Kopacz said. Knowing that it had been a tie - the first in the two-man bobsleigh event since Nagano in 1998 - an overjoyed Friedrich and Margis had rushed over to Kripps and Kopacz to celebrate as they finished their final run. “At first I thought we had won outright but then these guys jumped over and were super excited and I thought ‘Wow these guys are really happy for us!',” said Kripps, who thought the Germans had been ecstatic about winning silver.
