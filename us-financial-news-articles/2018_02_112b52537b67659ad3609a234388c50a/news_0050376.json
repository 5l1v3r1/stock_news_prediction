REUTERS/Massimo Pinca Support for Forza Italia has almost halved since 2001, but regained some ground in the last year and was ahead of its main coalition partner the League in most polls before a two-week blackout period kicked in.\nNumerous legal cases, sex scandals, and a ban from office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction have not reduced his personal appeal among die-hard fans.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “He just gets better, he’s always so endearing,” said Vincenza Mattiello, a 43 year-old school worker from near Naples, in southern Italy, who attended Sunday’s event with her son. “Even if we don’t see much of him, we believe in him.”\nBerlusconi has yet to formally announce who would be his prime minister candidate if Forza Italia gets more votes than its allies, but he said on Sunday that the work of government should be undertaken by people with experience outside politics.\n“We need to have protagonists of so-called real life in the cabinet,” he said. “Protagonists of business, management, the professions, culture.”\nA coalition plan to introduce a flat tax for individuals and firms - a suggestion Berlusconi made while in power but never realized - has been one of the most discussed of the campaign.\nSuch economic considerations are the main reason to vote Forza Italia, said Alberto Giovenco, a 34-year-old from Sicily who runs an agricultural company, and watched Sunday’s event on a screen in the lobby of the theater when seats ran out.\n“If you cut taxes you can hire young people,” Giovenco said. “Berlusconi is the only one who can really do something. He has experience, he’s a businessman.”\nReporting by Isla Binnie, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T18:49:48.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
