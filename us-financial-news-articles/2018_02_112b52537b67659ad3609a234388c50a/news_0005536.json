Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura.\n“If the constitutional committee is set up... within the U.N. process in Geneva, strictly consistent with U.N. resolution 2254, yes we will continue to work with the U.N. process in this regard,” he told a news conference.\nDamascus welcomed the results of the Sochi meeting.\n“The final statement of the conference confirmed the consensus of Syrians on ... preserving the sovereignty and unity of Syrian territory and people, and the exclusive right of the Syrian people to choose their own political and economic system,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\nIt made no mention of the decision to set up a committee to rewrite the constitution or the call for democratic elections.\nFour years of on-off United Nations-mediated peace talks have yielded little progress toward ending the seven-year war, but De Mistura has pressed ahead with efforts for a political solution.\nHe said on Tuesday the constitutional committee agreed in Sochi “will become a reality in Geneva”, where most of the U.N.-led Syria peace talks have been held. De Mistura also said he would decide the criteria for committee members and select about 50 people - from government, opposition and independent groups.\nReporting by Dominic Evans, additional reporting by Angus McDowall in Beirut; Editing by Gareth Jones and Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:52:18.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
