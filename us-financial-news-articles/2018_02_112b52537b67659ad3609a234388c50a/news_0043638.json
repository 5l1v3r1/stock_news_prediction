Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: julien.ponthus.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES EDGE UP (0806 GMT) European shares have opened slightly higher but gains among main national indexes remain limited as investors await for Wall Street to reopen after Monday's holiday break. The STOXX 600 is edging up 0.15 percent, as you can see in the snapshot, while top movers on the pan-European benchmark included HSBC and BHP, both down nearly 3 percent after disappointing updates. Strong results boosted Edenred, up more than 10 percent to a record high, and Simcorp, while Temenos dropped 6 percent after news it's in advance talks to buy UK rival Fidessa Group for about 1.4 billion pounds. (Danilo Masoni) WHAT'S ON OUR RADAR (0750) \"Hey ho, and back to 'real' markets we go today\", writes Rabobank this morning as we get back into a 'normal' day of trading with Asia and Wall Street back from holiday. Futures point to a slightly positive open in Europe, which ended a three-day winning streak on Monday with consumer staples continuing to fuel doubts on their valuation as Reckitt results showed yesterday. It's a major earnings day for Britain with BHP and HSBC both reporting results. For the banking sector, Labour’s Corbyn’s pledge to make banks work for the “real economy” and not the other way around could worry some shareholders who are getting more sweat from the possibility of a snap election than Brexit. Still in the UK, bookmaker William Hill was fined for money laundering failures. Other possible movers today include HeidelbergCement raising its synergy target from Italcementi takeover, staffing company Adecco buying U.S.-based online recruitment platform Vettery. Still on the M&A front Temenos said it is in advanced talks to make cash offer for Fidessa. Corporate governance: LVMH named a new chairman and CEO for Fendi and drugmaker Hikma appointed a new CEO.
