(OTCBB:SODI) (“Solitron” or the “Company”) today announced an update on recent financial results, the signing of an employment agreement with its COO, and an update on its inventory adjustment.\nFor the nine-month period ended November 30, 2017 (unaudited) (first nine months of fiscal 2018):\nSales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased by 26% to approximately $7.3 million versus approximately $5.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Bookings for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 decreased by 11% to approximately $4.2 million versus $4.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Backlog at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 11% to approximately $5.2 million versus approximately $4.7 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFor the quarter ended November 30, 2017 (unaudited) (third quarter of fiscal 2018):\nSales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased by 10% to approximately $1.9 million versus approximately $2.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Bookings in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased by 39% to approximately $1.4 million versus approximately $2.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Total cash and securities was approximately $2.6 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 versus approximately $3.1 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Accounts receivable at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was approximately $1.4 million versus approximately $1.4 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe decrease in sales in the fiscal 2018 third quarter versus the prior fiscal quarter was due to two factors: 1) difficulties encountered in manufacturing products that the Company has not manufactured in recent years, and 2) a delay in delivery by a supplier of raw materials used in one of our larger contracts. We expect to be able to ship the items in Q1 of fiscal 2019. Regarding the manufacturing issues, management is aggressively addressing the issue by adding additional highly qualified personnel. We are very excited about the wealth of experience they bring to Solitron. We believe the additions will help not only with our current backlog but with future products as well.\nThe difficulty in manufacturing products that the Company has not produced in recent years has a secondary impact. Not only are revenues lower due to the delay in shipment, but it prevents follow-on orders from the distributor, impacting bookings. While the delay is frustrating, we are committed to expanding the capabilities of the Company since we believe it is in the best long term interest of shareholders.\nWe believe it is important for shareholders to understand how we are approaching the business. Unlike companies that have more stable sales cycles, Solitron’s sales are difficult to predict. We believe it is a lumpy business. While some of the Company’s customers schedule orders at regular intervals, most do not. This will result in volatility in both backlog and quarterly revenue. While we are going to balance our production levels in relation to our backlog, and delivery dates, we are also going to try and ship on time and as expeditiously as possible.\nThese preliminary, unaudited results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 are based on management's review of operations for those periods and the information available to the Company as of the date of this press release and remain subject to the completion of the Company's review procedures. Final adjustments and other material developments may arise between the date of this press release and the dates the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended November 30, 2017. The preliminary financial information presented herein has not been reviewed or audited.\nThe information presented in this press release should not be considered a substitute for the financial information to be filed with the SEC in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended November 30, 2017 once it becomes available. The Company has no intention or obligation to update the preliminary estimated unaudited financial results in this release prior to filing its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended November 30, 2017.\nEmployment Agreement with President and COO\nThe Company is pleased to announce that it has entered into an employment agreement with its President and COO, Mark Matson. As part of that agreement, and subject to shareholder approval at its next annual meeting, Mr. Matson is being granted stock options on shares of the Company’s common stock equal to approximately 10% of the Company’s outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis with half of the options having an exercise price of $4.25, and the remaining half having an exercise price of $5.00. Tim Eriksen, CEO of the Company noted, “We are very pleased with the agreement we have reached with Mark. He has been doing a tremendous job in turning around the Company. We are thrilled that he requested and agreed to a compensation package that is tied in with shareholders and look forward to working with him to increase shareholder value.”\nUpdate on Inventory Adjustment for the Year Ended February 28, 2017 and Related Investigation\nThe Audit Committee has determined it is appropriate to conduct an investigation pertaining to certain matters relating to the Company’s historical inventory reserves. Depending on the results of the investigation, the Audit Committee will determine whether a restatement of previously issued financial statements is necessary. The results of the investigation may also impact management’s review of the Company’s inventory policies and assessment to date regarding the extent to which inventory will be written down for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 and result in changes to management’s prior review and assessments. The Company intends to take the appropriate measures to correct any gaps or deficiencies in internal controls that may be discovered in the investigation to ensure that the financial statements are complete and accurate in all material respects.\nAbout Solitron Devices, Inc.\nSolitron Devices, Inc., a Delaware corporation, designs, develops, manufactures and markets solid state semiconductor components and related devices primarily for the military and aerospace markets.
