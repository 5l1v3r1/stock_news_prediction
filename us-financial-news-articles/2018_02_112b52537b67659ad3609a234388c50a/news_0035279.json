With interest rates globally currently at low levels, equities paying higher dividend rates could be an attractive option to meet ongoing income requirements within portfolios,” said Fiona Bassett, Global Co-Head of Passive Asset Management. “Relatively high equity market dividends, especially in today’s low rate environment, suggest our suite of dividend-focused ETFs can act as cost-effective supplements or alternatives to income strategies.”\nFor more information about the Deutsche AM ETFs available in the US, visit: www.Xtrackers.com .\nDeutsche Asset Management\nWith USD 842.4 billion of assets under management (as of December 31, 2017), Deutsche AM is one of the world’s leading investment management organizations.

Stocks may decline in value. Foreign investing involves greater and different risks than investing in US companies, including currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive company information, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards. Emerging markets tend to be more volatile and less liquid than the markets of more mature economies, and generally have less diverse and less mature economic structures and less stable political systems than those of developed countries. Funds investing in a single industry, country or in a limited geographic region generally are more volatile than more diversified funds. Dividends are not guaranteed. If the dividend-paying stocks held by a fund reduce or stop paying dividends, a fund’s ability to generate income may be adversely affected. This fund is non-diversified and can take larger positions in fewer issues, increasing its potential risk. Performance of a fund may diverge from that of an Underlying Index due to operating expenses, transaction costs, cash flows, use of sampling strategies or operational inefficiencies. An investment in any fund should be considered only as a supplement to a complete investment program for those investors willing to accept the risks associated with that fund.
