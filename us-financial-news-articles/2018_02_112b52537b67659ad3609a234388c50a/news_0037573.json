Johnson was responding to a question in parliament about why he failed mention Northern Ireland once in a major speech he gave on Brexit last week. “There is no reason whatsoever why we should not be able to exit both the customs union and the single market, whilst maintaining frictionless trade not only north-south in Northern Ireland, but with the rest of continental Europe as well,” Johnson said. “That is exactly what this government will be spelling out in the course of the coming negotiations,” he added.
