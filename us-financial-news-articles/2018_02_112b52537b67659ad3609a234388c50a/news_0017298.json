More cities are to follow. \nThe U.S. firm will eventually roll this out to other businesses with Amazon planning to undercut UPS and FedEx on price, according to the WSJ. \nShares of FedEx and UPS were sharply lower in pre-market trade on Friday morning. \nUPS said it is still a partner of Amazon. \n\"UPS continues to support Amazon and many other customers and we don't make comments about their business strategies or decisions regarding their utilization of UPS services,\" a spokesperson for the company told CNBC in an emailed statement.
