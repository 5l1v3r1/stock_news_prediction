British Prime Minister Theresa May last year accused Moscow of military aggression and said there was evidence of Russia’s meddling in foreign elections.\nThe Kremlin, which under Vladimir Putin has clawed back some of the global influence lost when the Soviet Union collapsed, has denied meddling in elections in the West.
