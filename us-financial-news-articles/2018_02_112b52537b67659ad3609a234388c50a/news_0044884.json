I raised the issue of Khalistan, because that is our primary issue,” Singh said, adding he had received a categorical assurance from Trudeau.\n“His words are a big relief to all of us here in India and we look forward to his government’s support in tackling fringe separatist elements,” he said in a Tweet.\nFormer Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi sent the military to the Golden Temple to flush out separatists at the height of the revolt in 1984. A few months later, Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards at her home in Delhi.\nIndian media reports suggested that Trudeau, who is on an extended tour of India along with wife and children, had received a lukewarm reception because of concerns that he was a bit soft on Sikh extremist groups in his country.\nEditing by Sanjeev Miglani and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T15:28:24.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
