The full year 2017 earnings equates to a return on average assets of 1.12% and a return on average equity of 9.66% compared to an ROA of 1.22% and an ROE of 10.58% for the full year 2016.\nTotal assets increased $13.2 million or 4.4% to $314.2 million at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 assets of $301.0 million.

Earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $825,000 ($0.69 per diluted common share).

Zahn stated, \"I'm very pleased with our financial performance in 2017. Our earnings remain strong, our loan growth continues at a steady pace and our ability to reward our shareholders with increased and special dividends remained intact. Although the fourth quarter 2017 was negatively impacted by the impairment to our DTA's, we are optimistic that tax reform will have a significantly positive impact on earnings moving forward.\"\nThe Company paid out cash dividends of $1.7 million to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2017 including roughly $607,000 from a Special Cash Dividend ($0.50 per common share) that was paid to shareholders in December 2017 for the 3 rd year in a row.
