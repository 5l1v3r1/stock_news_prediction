Preliminary 2017 revenue was $159.2 million. Revenue in 2016 was $81.3 million.\nPreliminary cash and investments increased $27.4 million in the fourth quarter, to $104.0 million. This balance does not include $12.9 million in cash from Corcept receivables remitted to Corcept in January 2018 pursuant to settlement of litigation with the company’s former specialty pharmacy.\nCorcept expects 2018 revenue of $275 – 300 million.\n“Our Cushing’s syndrome franchise had an outstanding year,” said Joseph K. Belanoff, MD, Corcept’s Chief Executive Officer. “More and more physicians realize that hypercortisolism frequently goes undiagnosed and as a consequence are screening more patients for the disease. There is also a growing realization that for many patients cortisol modulation with Korlym ® is the best medical treatment. Our 2017 growth reflected the simple fact that more physicians are prescribing Korlym for more patients – a shift in medical practice we expect to continue in 2018 and beyond.”\nAbout Hypercortisolism\nHypercortisolism, often referred to as Cushing’s syndrome, is caused by excessive activity of the stress hormone cortisol. Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is an orphan disease that most often affects adults aged 20 – 50. In the United States, an estimated 20,000 patients have Cushing’s syndrome, with about 3,000 new patients being diagnosed each year. Symptoms include high blood sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure, upper-body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, thinning arms and legs, severe fatigue and weak muscles. Irritability, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and depression are also common. Cushing’s syndrome can affect every organ system in the body and can be lethal if not treated effectively.\nAbout Korlym ®\nKorlym inhibits the effects of excess cortisol in patients with hypercortisolism by modulating activity at the glucocorticoid receptor, one of the two receptors to which cortisol binds. Korlym was the first FDA-approved treatment for patients with Cushing’s syndrome. The FDA has designated it an Orphan Drug for that disorder.\nAbout Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated\nCorcept is a pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs that treat severe metabolic, oncologic and psychiatric disorders by modulating the effects of cortisol. Korlym is the company’s first FDA-approved medication. Corcept has a large portfolio of proprietary compounds that modulate the effects of cortisol but not progesterone. Corcept owns extensive United States and foreign intellectual property covering the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of a wide variety of serious disorders, including Cushing’s syndrome. It also holds composition of matter patents covering its selective cortisol modulators.\nForward -Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements.
