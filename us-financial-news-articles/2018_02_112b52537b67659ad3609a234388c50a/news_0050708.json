(NASDAQ: ELGX), a developer and marketer of innovative treatments for aortic disorders, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\n“While our top-line performance during the fourth quarter finished at the low end of our guidance, we were pleased to have achieved expanded gross margins and to have further lowered our operating expenses,” said John McDermott, Chief Executive Officer of Endologix, Inc. “Subsequent to the quarter end, we completed patient enrollment in the ELEVATE IDE clinical study. We plan to file regulatory submissions in the third quarter of 2018 and currently anticipate potential approval of the Alto device in both the U.S. and European markets in 2019. The Alto device incorporates several design enhancements that are intended to simplify the procedure and enable the system to treat a wider range of AAA anatomies than Ovation iX. We also welcomed Greg Morrow as our Chief Marketing Officer, and we believe that under his leadership our team will be able to further strengthen our brand value proposition and maximize the impact of our innovative new product pipeline. Looking forward, we are confident that we have sufficient resources to drive innovation and position the Company for future growth in its addressable markets.”\nFinancial Results\nGlobal revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $44.0 million, a 7.3% decrease from $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
