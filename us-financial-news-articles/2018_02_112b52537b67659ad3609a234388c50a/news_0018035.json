The joint ventures together accounted for a third of IQE’s earnings in 2015 and 2016, it added.\nIQE dismissed the ShadowFall report as being “without merit” and providing a “misleading analysis of company’s financial position.”\nThe company also said then that it continues to expect full- year revenue ahead of market expectations.\nShares of the company were down 10 percent at 101.4 pence at 1629 GMT and were among the top 10 losers on the London Stock Exchange.
