They are firing the tear gas,” Pastor Kamanzi, 50, told Reuters from the town of Karongi.\nThe refugees had left their camp in Kiziba, 15 km (10 miles) from Karongi, in western Rwanda, to protest against a 25 percent cut implemented last month in rations provided by the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). The camp houses 17,000 Congolese.\nRwanda hosts about 174,000 refugees, including 57,000 people from neighboring Burundi who fled violence in 2015. Most of the rest fled the Democratic Republic of Congo during bouts of instability there over the past 20 years.\nIn January, UNHCR said it was cutting rations due to funding shortages.\nIt said in a statement on Thursday that its funding appeal of 2018 for Rwanda of $98.8 million was only 2 percent funded, and the World Food Program had warned of more cuts if its monthly requirements of $2.5 million were not met.\n“UNHCR urges the refugees to respect local laws and express grievances through dialogue, while calling on authorities to handle the situation with calm and restraint,” it said in a statement.\nJeanne d‘Arc DeBonheur, the minister for Disaster Management and Refugees Affairs, said police had to act for security reasons.\n“They must leave that place and go to the camp. Even we agreed with UNHCR that they cannot get any support while they are still camped there,” she said.\n“The fact that they are refusing to leave gives a task to the security organs to execute their mandate. Using tear gas, I think is one of the ways to minimize the risks to health, but you can ask the security organs for details.”\nReporting by Clement Uwiringiyimana; Writing by George Obulutsa; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:12:21.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
