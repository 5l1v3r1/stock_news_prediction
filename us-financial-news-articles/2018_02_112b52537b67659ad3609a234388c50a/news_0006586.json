Net sales increased $43.1 million, or 16.4%, up from proforma net sales (including the TOKIN acquisition) of $263.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nU.S. GAAP net income was $18.6 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to U.S. GAAP net income of $12.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported a U.S. GAAP net income of $12.3 million or $0.22 per diluted share. The company completed its acquisition of TOKIN on April 19, 2017, and as such, TOKIN’s results are included in our results for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017. However, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 our results only included our 34% equity investment in TOKIN.\nNon-U.S. GAAP adjusted net income was $30.6 million or $0.52 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to non-U.S. GAAP adjusted net income of $26.5 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported non-U.S. GAAP adjusted net income of $5.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share.\n“What a difference a year makes. The December quarter ended much stronger than we had predicted as customers continued to request product after the Christmas holiday. Sales compared to one year ago on a proforma basis were up 16.4% in a market that continues to be vibrant,” stated Per Loof, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe we have a digital platform in place that will help us manage the growth in the market and we are employing additional capital as quickly as possible to provide needed additional capacity beginning later this summer which will generate further revenue in the back half of our next fiscal year,” continued Loof.\nGAAP net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 included TOKIN acquisition gains totaling $135.6 million and equity method investment income of $75.4 million, primarily related to KEMET's thirty-four percent interest in TOKIN's gain on the sale of its electro-mechanical devices (“EMD”) business. In the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company increased the gain on acquisition by $1.3 million. In the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company increased the gain on acquisition by $0.3 million. The Company continues to evaluate the calculation of acquisition related gains and, as such, these preliminary numbers may change in the future.\nNet income (loss) for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include various items affecting comparability as denoted in the U.S. GAAP to Non-U.S. GAAP reconciliation table included hereafter.\nAbout KEMET\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “KEM” (NYSE:KEM).

Management believes that investors may find it useful to review the Company’s financial results as adjusted to exclude items as determined by management as further described below.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin represents net sales less cost of sales excluding adjustments which are outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below. Management uses adjusted gross margin to facilitate our analysis and understanding of our business operations by excluding the items outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below which might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. The Company believes that adjusted gross margin is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company. Adjusted gross margin should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table provides reconciliation from U.S. GAAP Gross margin to Non-U.S. GAAP adjusted gross margin (amounts in thousands, except percentages):\nQuarters Ended (Unaudited) December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (1) Net sales $ 306,408 $ 301,471 $ 188,029 Cost of sales 213,947 216,395 140,551 Gross margin (U.S. GAAP) 92,461 85,076 47,478 Gross margin as a % of net sales 30.2 % 28.2 % 25.3 % Non-U.S. GAAP adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense 402 342 308 Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) $ 92,863 $ 85,418 $ 47,786 Adjusted gross margin as a % of net sales (non-GAAP) 30.3 % 28.3 % 25.4 %\n(1) Quarter ended December 31, 2016 adjusted due to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss)\nAdjusted operating income (loss) represents operating income (loss), excluding adjustments which are outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below. Management uses adjusted operating income (loss) to facilitate our analysis and understanding of our business operations by excluding the items outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided earlier in this presentation which might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. The Company believes that adjusted operating income (loss) is useful to investors to provide a supplemental way to understand our underlying operating performance and allows investors to monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.

The Company believes that these Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company and allows investors to monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.
