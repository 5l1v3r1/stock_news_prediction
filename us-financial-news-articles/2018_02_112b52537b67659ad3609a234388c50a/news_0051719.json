His lawyer Calvin Rosemond declined to comment when reached by phone on Friday.\nToronto police have been criticized by some in the gay community for taking years to solve disappearances dating back to at least 2010.\nNavaratnam’s remains were among those found in large planters at a north Toronto home where McArthur did landscaping work, Idsinga said at a press conference.\nPolice have yet to identify three other individuals whose remains were found in the planters, Idsinga said.\nMcArthur has also been charged with killing five other men: Selim Esen, Andrew Kinsman, Majeed Kayhan, Soroush Marmudi and Dean Lisowick.\nPolice have said they will continue to search for evidence of more killings as they believe there are more victims.\nWhen the ground warms up, authorities intend to use police dogs to search for more evidence on the grounds of the home where the remains have been found, Idsinga said.\nReporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; editing by Jim Finkle, G Crosse\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:24:57.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
