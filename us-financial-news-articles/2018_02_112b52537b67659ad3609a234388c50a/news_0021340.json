He has been in financial services since 1981.\nThe proposed class-action complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco seeks unspecified damages for roughly 200 brokers.\nCredit Suisse spokeswoman Karina Byrne the lawsuit had no merit and that it is “standard industry practice” for Wells Fargo and other brokerages to pay the deferred compensation at issue to new hires.\n“Simply put, the plaintiff here is looking to be paid the same money twice,” she said.\nWells Fargo is not a defendant and was not accused of wrongdoing.\nCredit Suisse awarded Wells Fargo the exclusive right to recruit its brokers on Oct. 20, 2015. It told its roughly 275 brokers in 13 U.S. offices that the business was too small to compete without significant investment or acquisitions.\nIn addition, “they were told if you went to Wells you could keep your deferred compensation, and if not you were out of luck,” Robert Nelson, a lawyer for Laver, said in an interview.\nWells Fargo is based in San Francisco. Its retail brokerage recently had 14,544 financial advisers and $1.7 trillion of client assets, and its wealth management business recently had $248 billion of client assets.\nThe case is Laver v Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-00828.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi in Zurich; Editing by Susan Thomas and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T18:22:51.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
