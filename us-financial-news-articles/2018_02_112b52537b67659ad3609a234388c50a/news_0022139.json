The Yoruba people, whose homeland is in the southwest, were mostly on the opposing side in the war.\nEnwonwu painted three versions of the portrait. The other two remain lost, although prints first made in the 1970s have been in circulation ever since and the images are familiar to many Nigerians. Enwonwu died in 1994.\nOliver Enwonwu, the artist’s son, is president of the Society of Nigerian Artists.\nA worker at Bonhams auctioneers poses next to Tutu,\" by Nigeria's best-known modern artist Ben Enwonwu, ahead of its sale, in London, Britain February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls “This is a very significant discovery, given my father’s contribution to Nigerian art and African art, more broadly,” he told Reuters in Lagos.\nPeppiatt said it had come as a shock to him to find the painting hanging in a north London home where he was called to examine it, because he had been on several wild goose chases in the past in search of the originals.\nThe owners did not wish to be identified, he said.\nThe work will be sold on Feb. 28 in an auction at Bonhams in London that will be shown live at the Wheatbaker, a boutique hotel popular with artists in Ikoyi, a wealthy neighborhood of Lagos.\nThe price estimate is between 200,000 and 300,000 pounds ($277,600-$416,400).\n“We are quite hopeful about it because the market for Nigerian modern art is really strong at the moment. I’ve been in the market for 12 years and it’s as strong as I’ve ever known it,” Peppiatt told Reuters.\nOne of the challenges in organising a live auction connecting London and Lagos could be the Nigerian city’s unreliable power supplies. Despite the widespread use of back-up generators, electricity blackouts are a frequent feature of Lagos life, often affecting internet connections.\n“It’s the first time anyone has done it so that will be rather exciting,” said Peppiatt. “Assuming the IT works.”\nWriting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T20:31:37.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
