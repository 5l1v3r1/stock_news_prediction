(\"IPCC\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: IPCC) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Kemper Corporation (\"KMPR\") (NYSE: KMPR). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $51.60 in cash and 1.2019 shares of KMPR for each share of IPCC they own. This represents consideration of $119.38 per IPCC share, based on KMPR's February 13 trading price of $56.40.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether IPCC's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, according to KMPR's President and CEO,\"[ t]his [is a] compelling transaction [that]combines two well-known brands with complementary strengths and cultures to form a leader in nonstandard auto insurance, and enhances [KMPR]'s overall growth opportunities, diversification, financial strength, and ability to serve policyholders.\" KMPR expects the acquisition of IPCC to broaden its product offerings and capabilities, and enhance its financial position.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether IPCC's shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects.
