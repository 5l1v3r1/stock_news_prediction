Chevron recorded a $2 billion noncash benefit in the period related to the recent U.S. tax overhaul.\nExcluding the tax change and other one-time items, Chevron earned 72 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nProduction rose 3 percent to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Its international refining division recorded a 77 percent drop in profit due to lower margins on gasoline and other products.\nMike Wirth became Chevronâ€™s chairman and chief executive officer on Thursday, replacing the retiring John Watson.\nThe company is slated to hold a conference call with investors on Friday morning.\nChevron boosted its quarterly dividend this week by 4 percent.\nShares fell 1.8 percent to $123.25 in early trading.\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:35:23.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
