The Philippine Senate began an inquiry on Wednesday into deaths and abuse of Filipino workers.\nMore than 2 million Filipinos are working in Kuwait and other Middle East countries, including Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, but many cases of abuse have also been reported elsewhere.\nThey often work as domestic helpers, construction workers, engineers and nurses.\nKuwait has sought to mend diplomatic ties by inviting Duterte to visit, its state news agency KUNA said on Monday. The Philippine labour ministry wants Kuwait to be able to assure safety of Filipinos before the ban can be lifted.\nDuterte said a list of both reported and unreported cases of mistreatment of Filipino migrant workers would be prepared, which he described as “a long, long task”, without mentioning any timetable. He said he would not speculate on the countries to which the worker ban could be extended.\nFilipinos abroad sent home last year a record high $28.1 billion in cash remittances, money that helped fuel spending and sustain robust expansion in one of the world’s fast-growing economies.\nDuterte has said his long-term aim is to slow the exodus abroad by boosting the domestic economy and creating jobs that provide workers with sufficient income.\nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Martin Petty, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T13:40:16.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
