Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports \nWorld number eight Rory McIlroy (68) and five-times major winner Phil Mickelson (69) went off together at Spyglass Hill, and while they finished a stroke apart they could not have arrived at their scores in much different fashion. \nNorthern Irishman McIlroy was more steady with three birdies and a bogey on both his front and back nine while Mickelson overcame a rough start that included three bogeys and a birdie on his first seven holes with a strong finish in which he birdied five of his final eight holes. \nWorld number two Jon Rahm, playing at Monterey Peninsula, capped his round in style with three consecutive birdies for a four-under 67. Australian world number 10 Jason Day was also in the mix after carding a three-under-par 69 at Spyglass Hill. \nThe event, which features a 54-hole cut before the final round is contested at Pebble Beach, is wildly popular given the celebrities that compete alongside some of golf’s biggest names. \nAmong the non-golf celebrities competing this week are actor Bill Murray, Justin Verlander of the World Series champion Houston Astros, Canadian ice hockey great Wayne Gretzky and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
