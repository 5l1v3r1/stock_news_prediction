Be prepared for snow covered roads and limited visibilities,” the service said in an advisory for southern Wisconsin.\nWind chill temperatures were expected to drop below 0 Fahrenheit (-18 C) in many areas across the region on Thursday night and into Friday morning.\nUnited Airlines said on Twitter the storm was expected to impact operations this week and that travel waivers were in effect for areas affected by the snow.\nWinter weather across the United States over the last several days has killed several people in accidents in the Midwest since Monday, including six in Iowa, two in Missouri and one in Montana, local media in those states reported.
