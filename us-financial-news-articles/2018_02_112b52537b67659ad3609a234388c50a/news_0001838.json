Some of the overseas equity holdings are now worth less in sterling terms,” he added.\nReporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:09:00.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
