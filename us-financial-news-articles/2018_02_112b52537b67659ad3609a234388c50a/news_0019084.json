People in the U.S. are slightly more positive, with 23 percent of people agreeing.\nChina is heavily investing in a technological future. Its government said that it wants to be a 1 trillion yuan ($147.7 billion) world leader in AI by 2030, it announced last July , and said in January that it will build a state-backed $2.1 billion AI research and development park to house 400 tech businesses .\nshow chapters China's great AI race      5:04 PM ET Fri, 5 Jan 2018 | 01:32 Meanwhile, academics in the U.S. have called for greater collective efforts by the government, companies and society when it comes to making automated technology available.\nChinese people also rate their employers' ability to tap into their tech knowhow, with 62 percent of those with average or above average digital abilities saying their bosses make it possible for them to use those skills. Only 32 percent of those in the U.S. and 26 percent in the U.K. feel the same, against a global average of 33 percent.\nBut those in China also feel pessimistic about technology in other ways, with 38 percent saying it has had a negative impact on their personal wellbeing, the highest of the countries surveyed.\nPersonal data When it comes to the use of personal information by companies, people around the world are skeptical, according to the research. Forty-seven percent of those surveyed in China believe that businesses are clear about use of their data, the highest proportion of the countries surveyed, but only 23 percent in the U.S. and 22 percent in the U.K. feel the same.\nTackling this means businesses must be more open in an era of fake news, the research suggests. \"Transparency is emerging as a key differentiator as people realize there is a risk that you can trust something that isn't true,\" said report author Tim Cooper, global head of strategic communications at Dentsu Aegis Network.\nshow chapters Don't worry so much about robots taking your job      9:38 PM ET Mon, 18 Dec 2017 | 02:53 The report, called the \"Digital Society Index,\" includes an overall ranking of how countries are doing in the \"digital economy.\" It looks at how fast each country's information and communications technology industry is growing, how much people have access to technology and the extent to which they trust businesses and governments with their personal data.\nThe U.K. comes out top of the list overall, with the U.S. and China following. The U.K. does particularly well when it comes to giving people access to tech, while the U.S. has the fastest growth in the sector. China ranks highest for trust.\nDentsu Aegis surveyed 20,000 people online in Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, the U.S. and the U.K. in summer 2017.
