In December, a window fell from a U.S. helicopter onto a school sports field, fanning safety concerns.\nThe Nago result could bode ill for Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga, another base opponent who is up for re-election later this year.\nReporting by Kaori Kaneko and Linda Sieg; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T03:37:31.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
