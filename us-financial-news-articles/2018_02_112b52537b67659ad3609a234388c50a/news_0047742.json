Actor Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the European premiere of \"Red Sparrow\" in London, Britain February 19, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson “True equality means either Jennifer Lawrence getting a coat, or Jeremy Irons having to pose for a photo call in assless chaps,” tweeted London journalist Helen Lewis. Australian journalist Stephanie Peatling remarked on Twitter that it was “cold enough that the bloke actors have to wear coats and scarves to their press call and yet poor Jennifer Lawrence is wearing a small amount of fabric some might call a dress.” Lawrence, one of the most sought-after actresses in Hollywood, was having none of it. “That Versace dress was fabulous, you think I‘m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for 5 minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice,” she wrote on Facebook. “This is sexist, this is ridiculous, this is not feminism,” she added. “It’s creating silly distractions from real issues. Get a grip people” “Red Sparrow,” a thriller in which Lawrence plays a Russian spy, opens worldwide next week.
