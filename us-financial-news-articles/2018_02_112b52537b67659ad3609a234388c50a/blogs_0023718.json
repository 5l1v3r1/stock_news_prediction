Revenue from its digital-only subscription products, including news as well as crossword and NYT Cooking Recipes, increased 51.2 percent to $96.3 million. \n“The New York Times, for its digital subscriptions, is night and day ahead of its peers in the publishing industry,” said Craig Huber, analyst at Huber Research Partners. \nSubscriptions in the quarter also got a boost from the newspaper’s coverage of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual harassment story, helping the company post the highest-ever annual subscription revenue of $1 billion. \nThis success comes amid a change of guard at the newspaper. \nThe newspaper, known as “The Gray Lady” said in December that long-time publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. was passing the reins to his son, Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, who was long-groomed to take over the business his family has owned since 1896. \nNYT has faced frequent criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump who has called it “failing @nytimes” on Twitter and accused it of bias. \nThis has, however, resulted in a bump in subscriptions at the publisher, which is building on the online readership it gained during the 2016 presidential election by marketing unbiased reporting as a sales strategy. \nChief Executive Mark Thompson told Reuters that the newspaper will also benefit from Facebook Inc’s ( FB.O ) initiative to prioritize high-quality news outlets in its social media posts to counter fake news and sensationalism. \nStill, New York Times’ print business continued to decline in the fourth quarter. \nPrint advertising revenue fell 8.4 percent even as digital advertising revenue rose 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter. \nDespite falling revenue from print advertising, Thompson said he had no plans of shutting their print operations. \n“We will go on printing the newspapers as long as it makes economic sense,” he said. \nTotal revenue rose 10 percent to $484.1 million. \nThe company posted a net loss of $57.8 million, compared with a year-ago profit of $37.6 million, mostly due to higher costs and pension settlements. \nExcluding one-time items, the company earned 39 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 29 cents per share on revenue of $467.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
