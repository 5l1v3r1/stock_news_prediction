It’s really dry,” said Rabobank senior grains analyst Cheryl Kalisch Gordon.\nA February report by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture, Resource Economics and Rural Sciences found rainfall in the crop regions of northern New South Wales and Queensland had been well below average over the past three months, with some areas suffering a severe deficiency.\nConditions have been better in Western Australia, the country’s biggest wheat exporting state.\nThere has already been a recent run-up in wheat prices driven by U.S. crop concerns, although overall global supplies remained ample.\nGrainCorp said on Thursday it expected underlying profit after tax for the 12 months to September to be between A$50 million ($40 million) and A$70 million, well below the A$142 million recorded in fiscal 2017.\nGrainCorp shares were up 4 percent on Thursday afternoon, although still down 10 percent lower from early January levels.\nAustralian retail stockbroker Morgans said in a client note that many investors had already written off fiscal 2018 given the small east coast grain crop and reduced exports.
