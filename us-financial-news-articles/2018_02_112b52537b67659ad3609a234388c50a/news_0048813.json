After that it will be another decision to go or stay,” Evrard said.\n“The supply chain will certainly be able to cope with more ramping up. It is a decision you take with the supply chain and we will make sure it is ready,” he said.\nHe was speaking on the sidelines of the inaugural delivery of the largest version of the jet, the A350-1000, to launch customer Qatar Airways.\nChief Executive Tom Enders said last week a decision would be taken this year on whether to increase production of the A350, which competes with Boeing’s 787 and 777.\nAt the same time, Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing ( BA.N ) are considering raising output of their workhorse narrowbody jets to about 70 a month from planned levels of between 57 and 60.\nBut Airbus is wrestling with the latest in a series of snags at one of two engine suppliers for this category of aircraft, United Technologies ( UTX.N ) unit Pratt & Whitney.\nLast week, it halted deliveries of A320neo aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney engines.\nThe move came after the European Aviation Safety Agency effectively grounded some recently delivered A320neo-family jets, a decision mirrored by U.S. authorities.\nAsked about efforts to resolve the problem, Evrard said: “We are making good progress with Pratt & Whitney on the solution to this issue, which is at the scale of the fleet a small issue.”\nHe said it was “a little bit too early” to say how quickly a fix could be identified and introduced.\nAirbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said last week deliveries might resume in April.\nAircraft using alternative LEAP engines from CFM International ( GE.N )( SAF.PA ) are not affected, although deliveries of those engines have been delayed by several weeks.\nEvrard said Airbus aimed to secure new buyers for the A380, the world’s largest airliner which has been placed on life support due to slack demand. Emirates recently confirmed an order for up to 36 planes, enough to maintain output at half an airplane a month in the 2020s while Airbus seeks other buyers.\nEvrard said much had been learned about how to arrange the cabin to make the aircraft as efficient as possible to operate.\n“We will now relaunch our marketing,” he said.\nThe head of Qatar Airways said it had no plans to order more A380s.\nReporting by Alexander Cornwell; Writing by Tim Hepher; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:34:50.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
