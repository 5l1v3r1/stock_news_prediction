Wilhelmsen ASA confirmed at the time the raids at its 50 percent-owned Wallenius Wilhelmsen unit and EUKOR, in which it has a 40 percent stake.\nOther shippers involved in the case include K Line (Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd) and Mitsui O.S.K Lines, the people said.\nThe Commission, which can penalize companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaching EU antitrust rules, said at the time that the services under investigation included shipping cars, construction materials and agricultural machinery. It did not name the companies.\nJapan No. 1 container shipper NYK, K Line and Mitsui in their 2017 annual reports said they were being investigated by competition authorities in Europe.\nThe EU competition authority and WWL declined to comment. European subsidiaries of the Japanese shippers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Their parent companies were not immediately available to comment outside office hours.\nWWL took a $200 million provision for all its antitrust cases in the third quarter of 2015, of which $98.5 million was for a U.S. fine, $34 million for a Japanese sanction and $7 million for a Chinese penalty. EUKOR was fined $44 million in the Chinese case.\nAustralia fined and convicted NYK last year for operating a cartel over vehicle transport to the country.\nThe Japan Fair Trade Commission in March 2014 handed down fines to NYK, K Line, WWL and Nissan Motor Car Carrier for fixing prices of auto shipments from Japan to North America, Europe and the Middle East while Mitsui escaped a sanction.\nAdditional reporting by Ole Petter Skonnord in Oslo, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T18:18:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
