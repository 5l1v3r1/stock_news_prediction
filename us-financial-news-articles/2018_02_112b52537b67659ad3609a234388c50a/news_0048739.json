Inflation, he projected, will firm this year, making progress toward the Fed's two percent goal.\nWhile the corporate tax cuts and other reforms may boost productivity and lift economic potential, most of the stimulative effects will fade in 2019 and 2020, leaving behind an economy with a higher debt burden than before.\n\"This projected increase in government debt to GDP comes at a point in the economic cycle when it would be preferable to be moderating the rate of debt growth at the government level,\" Kaplan said.\nA higher debt burden will make it less likely the federal government will be able to deliver fiscal stimulus to offset any future economic downturn, he said, and unwinding it could slow economic growth.\n\"While addressing this issue involves difficult political considerations and policy choices, the U.S. may need to more actively consider policy actions that would moderate the path of projected U.S. government debt growth,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T18:06:44.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
