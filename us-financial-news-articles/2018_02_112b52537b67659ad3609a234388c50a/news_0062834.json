Still, \"inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. In the (FOMC's) view, further gradual rate increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives.\"\nThe testimony sent Powell's first signal as Fed chief that the massive tax overhaul and government spending plan launched by the Trump administration will not prompt any immediate shift to a faster pace of rate increases. \"Gradual\" has been the operative word since the Fed began raising rates under Powell's predecessor, Janet Yellen, in late 2015.\nThe Fed is expected to approve its first rate increase of 2018 at the next policy meeting in March, when it will also provide fresh economic projections and Powell will hold his first press conference.\n\"This is a continuation of where this Fed was under Chair Yellen,\" said Robert Albertson, principal and chief strategist at Sandler O'Neill & Partners in New York.\n\"They are normalizing, they are not tightening ... The surprises, if we are going to see them, are going to be after more data comes out in the next month or two,\" and accounts for things like the tax cuts and whether business investment spending continues higher, he said.\nMarket reaction was muted. U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower while the dollar was stronger against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were mixed.\nVALUATION PRESSURES\nPowell's appearance before the House panel is his first as Fed chief. He used his prepared remarks to strike notes likely to be welcomed by the Republican majority on the panel - including promises of \"transparency\" and a nod to the monetary policy rules some of them favor.\n\"I am committed to clearly explaining what we are doing and why we are doing it,\" Powell said.\nBut in his remarks and in a monetary policy report issued to Congress by the Fed last week he also stuck close to a safe script, mentioning none of the new initiatives that some of his colleagues have pushed for, such as a review of the Fed's system for managing inflation.\nThat report acknowledged \"valuation pressures\" in parts of the economy, and noted the recent return of volatility in stock markets.\nThough rising long-term interest rates and recent equity market volatility have tightened financial conditions, Powell said, \"we do not see these developments as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market and inflation.\"\nRather, \"the robust job market should continue to support growth in household incomes and consumer spending, solid economic growth among our trading partners should lead to further gains in U.S. exports, and upbeat business sentiment and strong sales growth will likely continue to boost business investment,\" he said.
