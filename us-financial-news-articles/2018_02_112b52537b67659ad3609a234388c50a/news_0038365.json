The 2008 quake in Market Rasen, north-east England, was magnitude 5.2 - 16 times more powerful than Saturday’s quake.\nHowever, Saturday’s earthquake in Wales was felt as far away as Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, over 200 km (125 miles) away.\nVideos on social media showed people gathered outside Swansea University, which was holding an open day, after an apparent evacuation.\n“Thank you to everyone who attended our visit day. We hoped that you had a surprisingly ‘earth moving’ experience!” Swansea University said on Twitter.\nReporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Alison Williams and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T18:30:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
