After an analysis of all the conditions, a decision will be taken in the defense of the best interests of the Foundation,” it said.\nLocal media said private conglomerate CEFC China Energy, which last year bought the insurance business of small Portuguese bank Montepio, is the potential buyer and the deal could be worth around 500 million euros.\nNoone was immediately available for comment at the company’s Shanghai headquarters.\nThe latest available Partex financial data for 2016 put its oil and gas properties at $472 million and total assets at $720 million, with oil and gas revenues at $252 million on an output of 6.4 million barrels of oil equivalent for the year, the bulk of it coming from Oman.\nPartex was founded in 1938 by Portugal-based oil magnate of Armenian origin, Calouste Gulbenkian, who later left the company to the foundation started at his bequest.
