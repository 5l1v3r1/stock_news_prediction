Slideshow (13 Images) \nKyle Naughton, Wayne Routledge, Tom Carroll and Daniel James were also on target for the Swans, who drew 1-1 at Meadow Lane in the first game and now face Carvalhal’s old club, second-tier Sheffield Wednesday who the Portuguese left on Christmas Eve. \nBirmingham took the lead through Che Adams early in the second half, but Huddersfield drew level with an own goal from Marc Roberts after Tom Ince’s shot was parried by the keeper. \nTown pulled clear in extra time with Steve Mounie heading the visitors into the lead before Rajiv van La Parra slotted in a rebound and Ince added a fourth with a fierce drive. \nSpurs play their fourth round replay against fourth-tier Newport County at Wembley on Wednesday after a 1-1 draw away.
