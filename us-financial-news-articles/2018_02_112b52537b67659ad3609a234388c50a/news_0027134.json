The U.S. are currently third overall.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber, Elaine Lies and Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:48:09.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
