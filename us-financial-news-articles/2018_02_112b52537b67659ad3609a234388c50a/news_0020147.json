A court ordered them to be allowed to resume transmissions a week ago, and the two other stations resumed broadcasting on Monday. \nThe reason for the delay for Citizen was not immediately clear but the station tweeted “CITIZEN TV is now BACK ON AIR!” \nGovernment officials did not return calls seeking comment. \nThe media shutdown provoked criticism of the government within Kenya and from the United States, United Nations and former colonial power Britain. \nOdinga wanted his symbolic inauguration to be a direct challenge to President Uhuru Kenyatta, whom he accuses of stealing the election. But more than a week after he declared himself president, Odinga has yet to give any hint of his next move. \nThe government has briefly arrested three opposition figures who took part in the ceremony. Two were released on bail the same day and one was deported to Canada.
