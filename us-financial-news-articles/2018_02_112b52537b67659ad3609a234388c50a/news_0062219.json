(NASDAQ:BURG) (“Chanticleer” or the “Company”), owner, operator, and franchisor of multiple nationally recognized restaurant brands in the U.S. and abroad, today announced the grand opening of its Little Big Burger (“LBB”), located in the Starwood owned Parkway Plaza Mall in El Cajon California. A second location is currently under construction in Mission Viejo, California with an anticipated April 1st opening. Both sites are in the San Diego market. Several additional sites are currently in final lease review.\nThe franchisee LBBIG LLC, is owned and managed by Larry Spitcaufsky, an experienced restaurant operator of more than ten restaurants in the San Diego and Los Angeles markets. Spitcaufsky also serves on the board of directors of Chanticleer and is currently a 6% beneficial owner of Chanticleer’s common stock.\nLarry Spitcausky stated, “It’s exciting to see our hard work come to fruition with the opening of our first Southern California based Little Big Burger. We have a great brand, team and opportunity. My continuing commitment and belief in the value proposition of both Chanticleer Holdings and our Little Big Burger brand is no better evidenced than by not only my sizeable personal investment in Chanticleer, but also my multi-location commitment involving the ultimate opening of an additional seven locations.”\nMike Pruitt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chanticleer Holdings, commented, “We are excited to expand Little Big Burger’s presence on the West Coast with a partner like Larry who is not only an experienced restaurant owner, but who is also both a board member, as well as large investor in Chanticleer. We look forward to cultivating our partnership, focusing on building shareholder value through introducing our iconic brand to future additional local communities in Southern California.”\nPruitt continued, “We continue to expect that 2018 has the potential to be a transformational year for our Company. Currently we have 12 LBB stores and previously stated that we expected to add 8-12 new locations in 2018, this location being included. With our current pipeline, remaining JV locations and new potential franchise partners we remain confident we can exceed our previous guidance.”\nThe Company recently provided an update which may be found here: Chanticleer Holdings Provides Update for its Little Big Burger and Burgers Grilled Right Brands\nThe value proposition of the Little Big Burger brand is unique and highly scalable.
