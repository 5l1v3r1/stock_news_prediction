The two employees—Bruce Williams and Jane Buchanan—both worked at Disney under Schumacher, who has been at the company for three decades as a producer and is currently at work on Disney’s upcoming Broadway adaptation of the animated movie Frozen . Both Williams and Buchanan eventually left Disney. \nSeveral former Disney employees backed up the claims from Williams and Buchanan, which span the 1990s and early 2000s, WSJ reported. Through an associate, Schumacher denied the allegations against him, according to WSJ , while a Disney spokesperson told the newspaper that “complaints are thoroughly investigated and appropriate action is taken” at the company.
