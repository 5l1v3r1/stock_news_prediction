He then transmitted the image in a way to allow it to be accessible by computer, the indictment said.\nGreitens has admitted to having the affair with a woman before his election in November 2016, but denied he tried to blackmail her to keep it a secret.\nHe was booked and released on Thursday, and maintained his innocence in a statement, saying he did not commit a crime.\nGreitens said the case is politically motivated and called St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner, who brought the indictment, a “reckless liberal prosecutor.”\nA spokeswoman for Gardner said in a statement on Friday that the prosecutor will not “litigate this case in the media.”\n“These personal attacks, while disappointing, will not distract her from her duty to serve justice and the citizens of this community,” the statement said. “Both the governor and the victim deserve their day in court.”\nGreitens, a former U.S. Navy SEAL, was once considered a rising star in Republican politics, and is now feeling heat from his own party.\nLeaders in the Republican-controlled Missouri House of Representatives said they will launch their own investigation into the allegations.\n“We will carefully review the facts contained in the indictment and answer the question as to whether or not the governor can lead our state while a felony case moves forward,” House Speaker Todd Richardson said in a statement.\nIf convicted, Greitens faces a maximum four years in prison and up to $5,000 in fines.\nReporting by Keith Coffman in Denver; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T22:43:19.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
