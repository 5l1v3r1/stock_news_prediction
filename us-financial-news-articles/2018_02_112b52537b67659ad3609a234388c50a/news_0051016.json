People are actually looking at that and reading into it.\" \nTo avoid outside distractions, Shiffrin said, \"I actually just stepped away from my social media for the entire time I was competing.\" \n\"So I wasn't seeing comments. I wasn't reading anything,\" she said. \"Because for me, that does add a certain amount of stress.\" Srdjan Zivulovic | Reuters US Alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin. \nShiffrin won the silver on Thursday in the Alpine downhill-slalom combined, adding to her gold last week in the giant slalom. She missed a bronze by eight-hundredths of a second in the slalom, an event in which she won gold at the 2014 games. \n\"Basically, for the last three weeks, I haven't even gone on [social media] until yesterday after winning the silver,\" she said. \"[I] went on my Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook and started to catch up on things that I've been missing and posts. I started posting like wild so people were probably like what, we haven't heard from her in three weeks.\" \nShiffrin said she did make exceptions during her self-imposed social media blackout to make sure she kept up her commitments to her sponsors. \n\"So when I wanted to make a post or if I had any sort of sponsor post that I was supposed to make, I chose a picture I wanted; I wrote my caption; and sent it to my manager to post this for me,\" she said. \nâ€” Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics.
