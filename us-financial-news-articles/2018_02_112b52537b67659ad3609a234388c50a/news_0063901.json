He recommended investors stay in equities due to the negative impact from inflation on the purchasing power of fixed-income holdings.\n\"I want to quickly acknowledge that in any upcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier — far riskier — than short-term U.S. bonds,\" he wrote. \"As an investor's investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.\"\n\"It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons – among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals — to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.\"\nBuffett also spoke on these topics in the CNBC interview:\n— I don't think Berkshire should avoid doing business with people who own guns\n— The new GOP tax law benefits Berkshire and acts as a 'huge tailwind' for businesses\n— 'We've bought more Apple than anything else' in the last year\n_ There are three ways to go broke: 'liquor, ladies and leverage'", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T14:17:35.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
