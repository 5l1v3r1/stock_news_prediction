None of the other companies immediately responded to requests for comment.\nThe issue of gun control, and the NRA’s role in opposing it, became the focus of renewed national debate on Feb. 14, when a former student killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, with an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally.\nThe U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to bear arms. The NRA, which has long used campaign donations and effective lobbying to command political influence, argues that stricter gun control would erode individual rights. The group has not commented on companies cutting ties.\nAngry student survivors of the shooting have confronted politicians from state lawmakers to U.S. President Donald Trump himself, demanding stricter gun control laws.\nIn response, the NRA and Trump have suggested arming teachers who have received training to deter attackers, a proposal that has been met with skepticism by teachers unions and gun violence experts.\nTRENDING ON TWITTER Before the corporate defections, nearly two dozen companies nationwide had offered incentives to NRA members, according to ThinkProgress.com, a news site owned by the Center for American Progress Action Fund.\nThe attrition started late Thursday when three rental car brands owned by Enterprise Holdings Inc said they were ending discount programs, and First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew the NRA’s contract to issue a co-branded Visa card.\nBy Friday, the list of defectors expanded to include Symantec Corp ( SYMC.O ), which ended an discount program for its LifeLock identity theft product. Home security company SimpliSafe and Hertz Corp also terminated discount programs.\nChubb Ltd ( CB.N ) said it would stop underwriting a NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defense shootings. Another insurer, MetLife Inc ( MET.N ), also said it had ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members. And North American Van Lines said it was scrapping its an affiliate relationship with the NRA.\nDavid Hogg, one of the student survivors of last week’s attack who launched the #NeverAgain anti-gun violence movement, said the students would target any company with ties to the NRA, in addition to lawmakers who accept donations.\nAbout a dozen other companies with marketing ties to the NRA, including FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ) and Hertz ( HTZ.N ), which offer discount programs, did not respond to requests for comment.\nSOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS Activists have also called on public pension funds to divest from gun maker stocks, which were broadly lower on Friday.\nMeanwhile, an online campaign using the Twitter hashtag #StopNRAmazon picked up steam, putting pressure on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to drop the channel. Many of those tweeting are in the entertainment industry.\n“Ironic how the @NRA likes to point a finger at what kids watch on TV ... while they spew vile rhetoric on NRAtv, streamed on @Amazon and aimed solely at boosting gun sales,” wrote screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer.\nMoms Demand Action, which sent the letters to the streaming platform, also posted an online petition using the hashtag #DumpNRATV.\n“To be affiliated with them, whether you are a company or a lawmaker, it is not going to pay off in the long run,” said Watts, the group’s founder, signaling the start of a broader campaign. “Doing business with the NRA is clearly bad business.”\nThe target of its ire is NRATV, which describes itself as “America’s Most Patriotic Team on a Mission to Take Back The Truth.” The channel features programming that leans heavily on speeches by NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre and spokeswoman Dana Loesch.\nYet another campaign, using the hashtag #BoycottNRA, was the top trending topic on Twitter on Friday morning.\nThe push is the latest effort by social activists to use social media to apply economic pressure to force change.\nLast April, Fox News parted ways with television host Bill O‘Reilly when sponsors started to drop his show in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against him.\nSimilarly the National Football League announced a tougher policy on handling domestic violence accusations against players when its marketing partners applied pressure for changes.\nReporting by Barbara Goldberg and Gina Cherelus in New York; Additional reporting by Suzanne Barlyn in New York, Andrew Hay in Taos, New Mexico, and Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Writing by Joseph Ax; Editing by Frank McGurty and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T00:11:59.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
