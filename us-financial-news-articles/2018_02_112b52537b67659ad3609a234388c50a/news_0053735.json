Countries including the U.S. have imposed sanctions on Venezuela, with the U.S., at least, dubbing Maduro a “ dictator. ” That comes as the Venezuelan bolívar fuerte has been in free fall partly due to excessive printing of money, while the country still owes its creditors some $141 billion. \nMaduro has said that he hopes the Petro will help the country skirt Western sanctions , though the U.S. Treasury has warned that it won’t be that easy. In mid-January, the department told potential Petro investors that they could be subject to sanctions against Venezuela. \n“Available information indicates that, once issued, the Petro digital currency would appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government,” the Treasury department said in a statement to Reuters . \nIf Maduro’s plans pan out, the fund raise will indeed attract a much higher figure than the initial $735 million. Maduro has said that he plans to offer a total of 100 million Petros, with a starting price of $60 each—roughly the price of a barrel of oil, for a total of about $6 billion. Some 824 million tokens have so far been made available. \nAnd he doesn’t plan to stop there. Following on the sale of the Petro, Maduro has said that he plans to launch a cryptocurrency backed by gold next week, Reuters reports. A grandes problemas, ¡grandes soluciones!
