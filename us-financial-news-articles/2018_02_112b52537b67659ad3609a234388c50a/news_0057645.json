Canada’s third biggest lender reported earnings per share of C$1.86 for the quarter, up from C$1.57 a year earlier. Analysts had on average forecast earnings of C$1.68 per share, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data showed. The bank reported net income of C$1.1 billion ($867 million), up 12 percent from a year ago, benefiting from an improved profit margin and a decline in funds set aside to cover bad loans. Net income at the bank’s international business increased by 16 percent to C$667 million. The bank has focused its international growth strategy on the Pacific Alliance, a Latin American trading bloc comprising Mexico, Peru, Chile and Columbia, where it saw loan growth of 10 percent or above during the period. $1 = 1.2684 Canadian dollars Reporting by Matt Scuffham; editing by Jason Neely and Louise Heavens", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T13:48:29.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
