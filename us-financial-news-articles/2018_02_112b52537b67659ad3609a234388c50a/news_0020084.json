It touched its lowest intraday since Aug. 29 at 14,942.75. \n* The largest percentage decliner was Sierra Wireless Inc , down 15.7 percent, after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss after the bell on Thursday. \n* The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.2 percent. \nWest Fraser Timber Co Ltd fell 2.3 percent to C$80.31 and Franco-Nevada Corp was down 1.3 percent at C$87.07. \n* Gold futures fell 0.2 percent to $1,314.3 an ounce and copper prices declined 1.3 percent to $6,754 a tonne. \n* Financials, which account for more than one-third of the weight of the TSX, declined 0.7 percent. Industrials were down 0.4 percent as railroad shares lost ground. \n* The energy group fell 0.6 percent as the price of U.S. crude oil fell below $60 for the first time since December. \n* The TSX posted no new 52-week highs and 27 new lows. Nine of the index’s 10 main groups were lower. \n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Aurora Cannabis, down 4.3 percent to $C10.67, and Klondex Mines, down 4.3 percent to $C2.03.
