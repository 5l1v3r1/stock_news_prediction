The role offers her the chance to make herself known in the party and the country.\"\nHowever, analysts argue that it is too early to say who is going to replace Merke, who has been at the helm of German politics for 12 years and has stated that she wants to serve the upcoming four-year mandate in full.\nThere are other names floating around, albeit less pronounced than Kramp-Karrenbauer, as potential replacements. These include Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn, Van Shoot from RaboResearch told CNBC, adding that the 37-year-old is set to get a ministerial position when Merkel outlines the CDU names for the next government on Monday.\nHowever, the list of candidates most likely to succeed Merkel could alter dramatically in the years ahead, Teneo Intelligence's Nickel said.\n\"Let's make no mistake. German chancellors have always struggled to organize their succession. Once Merkel retires, the game in CDU/CSU might well begin anew.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:43:54.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
