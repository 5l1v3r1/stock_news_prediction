The fighting takes place mostly in the remote interior, making it difficult to gauge its scale and casualties.\nRenamo members, who hold seats in parliament, have been calling for rights to elect its own governors in six districts where it scored a majority in the polls three years ago.\nFrelimo, a former Marxist liberation movement, fought a 16-year civil war against Renamo and there have been concerns that Mozambique could slip back into conflict after Renamo withdrew from the 1992 peace deal that ended the fighting.\nMozambique is on the verge of developing huge offshore gas reserves which could transform one of the world’s poorest countries into a middle-income state. Competition to control this newfound wealth could stir unrest, analysts have said.\nReporting by Manuel Mucari, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T01:42:12.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
