SGT, a privately held company, began operations in December 1994. Owners, Dr. Kam Ghaffarian and Harold Stinger joined forces with the objective to exceed customer expectations, provide rewarding opportunities for employees, operate with the utmost integrity and enjoy the journey.\nThe two worked hard to beat the odds and successfully graduated from the 8(a) program in 2005, then moved to full and open opportunities. For the last decade, SGT has been successfully operating and competing in the government marketplace as a large business government contractor. \"Today we embark on an exciting new chapter in the SGT journey,\" commented President and CEO, Dr. Kam Ghaffarian. \"Over the last 22 years we have relentlessly worked hard to create a company that brings value to everything we do. By joining forces with KBRwyle we will be able to offer a broader set of service offerings to our customers, give our workforce more opportunities and bring a stronger set of solutions to the marketplace. Even more importantly, the two entities have strong business synergies and culture alignment that will enable us to continue to exceed customer expectations and be very competitive in the marketplace.\"\n\"We are excited to bring SGT into the KBR family,\" said Stuart Bradie, KBR President and CEO. \"There is a strong cultural fit. Like KBR, SGT is a people company that operates with integrity and delivers strong results by putting customers and employees at the forefront of everything they do.\"\nThe transaction is expected to close around the end of the first quarter. Once closed SGT will operate as a business unit within KBR's global Government Services business, KBRwyle with Kam Ghaffarian and the SGT management team remaining intact.\nSGT provides technology solutions and services to the United States government for space programs, national security and civilian operations. For more than 20 years, our dedicated staff of nearly 2,500 employees has delivered high-value engineering, mission operations, IT and science solutions that yield high-performing and cost-effective government programs.\nContact: Shelley Johnson\nPhone: 301.489.1108\nEmail: sjohnson@sgt-inc.com\nhttp://www.sgt-inc.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sgt-announces-definitive-agreement-with-kbr-300603242.html\nSOURCE SGT, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.sgt-inc.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sgt-announces-definitive-agreement-with-kbr-300603242.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T17:17:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
