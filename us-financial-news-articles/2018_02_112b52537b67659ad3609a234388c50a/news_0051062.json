And he reiterated his view that China had stopped liberalizing its economy and was actually reversing these trends.\n“One of the challenges for the world is that as China has grown and not moved toward market orientation, that means that the misallocation of capital actually increases,” Malpass said. “They’re choosing investments in non-market ways. That is suppressing world growth.”\nChina says that its state-owned enterprises operate on free-market principles and is battling within the World Trade Organization’s dispute settlement system to be recognized as a “market economy” -- a designation that would weaken U.S. and EU trade defenses.\nMalpass said the Trump administration was “pushing back” against such policies in international forums such as the G20 and was seeking to join with “like-minded” countries to press for changes.\nBut Malpass did not provide any details on the responses that the Trump administration is considering, which include potential trade sanctions against Beijing under a “Section 301” investigation into China’s intellectual property practices and technology transfer requirements for foreign companies.\nThe administration also is considering steep global tariffs on steel and aluminum, largely aimed at curbing excess production in China, on national security grounds.\nReporting by David Lawder; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T05:34:24.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
