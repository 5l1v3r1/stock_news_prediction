Lyles completed a double-double off the bench with a game-high 10 rebounds.\nThe Nuggets won the game with big advantages in 3-point and free-throw shooting, two areas in which the Warriors led the league entering the game. Denver outscored Golden State 36-24 on 3-pointers and 25-14 at the foul line.\nDurant poured in a game-high 31 points for the Warriors, who were playing the second half of a back-to-back, having won at Sacramento on Friday night. Stephen Curry scored 24 points.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:43:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
