A corporation usually has its own balance sheet and cash flow statement,” he told journalists at Daimler’s annual press conference in Stuttgart.\nThe ultimate level of financial transparency for each division was still under discussion, he added.\nBy giving the divisions more managerial authority, each unit could seize on growth opportunities more quickly without having to escalate decisions to Daimler’s management board, the company said.\n“We will not increase the potential of the company with the structure of the company alone, we need to adapt the processes,” Uebber said.\nUebber declined to comment on whether a partial listing of the trucks or mobility services units was under consideration, but ruled out an outright divestment, because long-term shareholders believed in the synergies between the divisions.\nThere is still significant cross-selling potential between Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and trucks and vans, particularly when it comes to autonomous vehicle technology, Uebber said.\nThe group is looking into the economic, tax and organisational effects of a new structure for 700 separate companies in more than 60 countries.
