Aloysius is the son-in-law of Arjuna Mahendran, who was central bank governor at the time of the auction in question. \nThe arrests came a month after President Maithripala Sirisena said a panel had recommended legal action against the finance minister and central bank governor of the time, and the owner and officials of Perpetual Treasuries. \nSirisena said the presidential commission of inquiry had concluded that Perpetual Treasuries had profited through illegal means. \nMahendran, Aloysius, and Perpetual Treasuries have denied any wrongdoing. \nPolice Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said they had arrested Aloysius and Plaisena on Sunday “as part of ongoing investigations on the bond issue”. \n“The CID has reported the facts to the magistrate court and made the arrest. The two will be produced before the magistrate.” \nThey were later remanded in custody until Monday by a local court. \nOpposition lawmakers have alleged the bond auction cost the state more than $1 billion because of rising borrowing costs but Palisena, in a letter to parliamentarians last week, said state institutions had not lost out in the bond sale.
