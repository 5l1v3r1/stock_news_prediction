Analysts on average expected a loss of 9 cents on revenue of $340.3 million.\n\"Guidance is disappointing relative to our estimates and consensus. The press release indicates that demand for its Ionic smartwatch is strong, but isn't enough to offset the decline in demand for all of its older fitness trackers,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese said.\nThe company's net loss narrowed to $45.5 million, or 19 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $146.3 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, the San Francisco, California-based company reported a loss of 2 cents per share.
