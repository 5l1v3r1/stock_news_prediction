CFO Markus Rolle said that Telefonica Deutschland planned to distribute a large share of its free cash flow in dividends.\nThe announcement comes after investors reacted to Telefonica Deutschland’s annual results this week by selling its stock. Some analysts said it was not investing enough to ready the rollout of next-generation mobile services.
