REUTERS/Benoit Tessier Clayton repeated his position that public offerings comprising digital tokens, known as initial coin offerings (ICOs), are securities and subject to the same investor protection rules as equity market offerings.\nThe SEC will go after lawyers and firms that try to circumvent those rules, he said, although he did not clarify if the SEC would pursue ICOs that have already happened.\nThe CFTC is also working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on money laundering and terrorist financing issues, Giancarlo said.\n“As word is getting out that we will go after misconduct I think you’re starting to see that reflected in the price” of bitcoin, he added.\nFILE PHOTO: A Bitcoin logo is seen on a cryptocurrency ATM in Santa Monica, California, U.S., January 4, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo FUNDING ISSUES The regulatory chiefs questioned how their respective agencies would fund increased scrutiny of the rapidly growing virtual currency market, with Clayton saying he needed more people to staff the trading and markets division.\n“Personnel is my biggest challenge at the moment,” he added.\nCommittee members, however, did not appear to stake out a clear position on whether to pass virtual currency legislation.\nCrapo noted that the underlying distributed ledger technology offered “present significant positive potential” to increase investor access to financial markets.\nDemocratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a consumer advocate, also used the hearing as an opportunity to grill Clayton on other issues. These included reports the SEC is mulling rule changes that would block investors from being able to band together to sue companies, an idea Clayton said he personally is “not anxious” to pursue.\nOn the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin was 1.2 percent higher at $6,959.00 in afternoon trading in New York on Tuesday.
