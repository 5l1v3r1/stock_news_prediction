It was on still on track to gain 0.9 percent on the week.\nThe yen showed little reaction to data which showed Japan’s annual core consumer inflation rate was unchanged in January from the previous month, reinforcing views that the Bank of Japan remains distant from exiting its super loose monetary policy.\nJapan’s nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 0.9 percent in January. The pace remained far from the BOJ’s 2 percent inflation target.\nThe dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 106.850 yen.
