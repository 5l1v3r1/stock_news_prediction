The Ananyev brothers have to reduce their stake in Vozrozhdenie to 10 percent under the terms of a central bank bailout for another lender they controlled. \nThat Kerimov, whose family controls Russia’s top gold producer Polyus, has submitted a list of proposed candidates suggests his intentions to buy a stake in the bank are serious. \nThe list, which has to be reviewed by Vozrozhdenie’s board and later approved by shareholders, was submitted by investment firm Bonam Capital, which both sources said represented Kerimov’s interests. \nA spokesman for Kerimov did not reply to a request for comment. Bonam Capital declined to comment. \nKerimov’s list consists of 11 names, including senior management from Bonam Capital and top managers from Renaissance Capital. \nThere could be other board proposals in addition to the list submitted by Kerimov’s representatives as, according to the Russian corporate laws, owners of 2 percent or more in a bank can submit proposals for new members. \nRenaissance Capital declined to comment. \nKerimov is under investigation by French prosecutors for alleged tax fraud and planned to travel from France to Russia to finalise the deal. French prosecutors said they had no objections to the trip. Kerimov has denied the allegations against him in France, Russian media have reported. \nRussian pension fund Blagosostoyanie is another contender to buy Vozrozhdenie, sources have said. \nIt was not clear on Friday whether a final decision on the bank’s buyer had been made or whether the central bank had approved any change in ownership. \nThe Russian central bank declined to comment.
