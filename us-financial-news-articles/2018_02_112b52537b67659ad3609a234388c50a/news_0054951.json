He recently launched a vlog to give an inside look at his life off-camera.\nI talked to Serhant after his fireside chat with Gary Vaynerchuk at the first annual Agent2021 Conference , held on January 24 at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Here's what he had to say about what worked for him and how to achieve high-level success in sales.\nWake up early While most people wake up between 6 and 8 a.m., Serhant is up around 4:30 a.m. everyday, which allows him to stay as focused as possible.\n\"Routine is very important that way and between working full-time in real estate and filming two television shows, it's the only way I'm able to stay incredibly productive,\" he says. During this early morning time, he can review and respond to emails before everyone else so he's ready to go and start his day in the most productive way.\nshow chapters These 13 states have the best savers      9:53 AM ET Thu, 6 Oct 2016 | 02:24 Lead by example to inspire your team \"It's incredibly important for everyone from the newest agents to our veterans to see that I don't take anything for granted and, no matter what, I'm the hardest worker in the room,\" he says. Serhant has seen first hand that his success translates into his team's success because those watching him naturally want to rise to the occasion.\nHe stays very accessible, too, and helps them to feel like they all have the same goals and mission.\nBe candid, even when working with difficult clients \"The only way I know how to prevent uncomfortable situations with anyone, whether in professional or personal situations, is open and honest communication,\" he said. Be direct about how you feel.

Successful sales people don't separate out business relationships from personal ones: \"Great salespeople treat every single person the same, with the utmost respect, as a close friend,\" he says, and that's why his clients return to him time and time again.\nDon't be afraid to ask As Serhant puts it, \"If you don't ask, you'll never know.\" Whether you're looking for a raise or to work with a particular client, you need to ask for what you want instead of waiting for it to happen. He believes that, by asking for what you want, you will progress 50 percent faster in your career than if you just sit and wait.\nDan Schawbel is a partner and research director at FutureWorkplace and New York Times bestselling author of \"Promote Yourself\"and \"Me 2.0.\" Follow him on Twitter @DanSchawbel. \n\nDisclosure : NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC, also owns Bravo. \nLike this story?
