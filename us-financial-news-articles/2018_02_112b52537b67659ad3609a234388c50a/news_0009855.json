One bcfd of gas is enough for about 5 million U.S. homes. \nWhile drilling that first pipe, the company spilled about 2 million gallons of drilling fluid into a wetland in April. That spill led FERC in May to ban Rover from horizontal drilling temporarily. \nOfficials at ETP were not immediately available for comment. Last week, the company said it still expected to complete the Rover project by the end of the first quarter. \nAnalysts, however, said completion of the project would probably be delayed into the second quarter, at least. \nMajor producers signed up to use Rover include units of privately held Ascent Resources, Antero Resources Corp, Range Resources Corp, Southwestern Energy Co, Eclipse Resources Corp and EQT Corp.
