The field is due to come on stream in late 2019.\n$1 = 7.8854 Swedish crowns Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis, editing by Terje Solsvik and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:53:23.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
