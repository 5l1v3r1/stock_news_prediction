His lawyer, Syahredzan Johan, said the judge did not give any grounds for the ruling. \n“We are appealing the decision,” Syahredzan said, adding that they will post a 10,000 ringgit bond to release Fahmi from custody pending the appeal. \nFahmi faces a second similar charge in a separate court. \nFahmi was among anti-government and opposition leaders and activists rounded up after protests against Najib over his handling of a multi-billion dollar scandal tied to state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). \nThe government blocked several websites and news portals carrying reports critical of 1MDB and Najib, despite a longstanding government pledge not to censor the internet. \nNajib, who faced a leadership challenge following the 1MDB scandal, is preparing to call general elections that must be held by August. The fund and Najib denied all wrongdoing. \n1MDB has been the subject of money-laundering investigations in countries including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. \nIn civil lawsuits, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged that about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB. \nReporting by Joseph Sipalan; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T09:20:25.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
