The survey focuses on small and medium-sized firms which traditionally tend to have a tougher time securing funds than their larger state-owned peers. \n“Banks normally dole out more credit at the start of the year, as opposed to being restrained by the lending quota last year,” said Wendy Chen, a Shanghai-based economist at Nomura. \n“IT-related services are a big driver behind the growth in services. We expect it to continue its momentum for the remainder of the year.” \nHowever, firms’ strong optimism about the business outlook over the next year eased to a four-month low on concerns that economic conditions may soften. \nProfit margins also remained under pressure. Many companies reported a stiff rise in input costs for raw materials, transportation and salaries, but the survey suggested they were having a tough time passing higher costs on to their customers. \nThe official services PMI out last week showed activity accelerated to a four-month high in January, indicating broader economic resilience. That survey tends to focus more on larger and state-supported firms. \nRetail, information technology and insurance services all sustained high growth rates in January, the official data showed. \nDriven by strong readings in both the services and manufacturing sectors, the headline Caixin China Composite PMI rose to 53.7 in January, compared to 53.0 in December and the highest since January 2011. \n“Looking forward, we should watch for stability of demand in the manufacturing industry and the impact of growing costs on the profitability of service providers,” said Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group. \nThe world’s second-biggest economy reported forecast-beating growth of 6.9 percent last year, handily beating the government’s target of around 6.5 percent. \nEconomists polled by Reuters are pencilling in more moderate growth of 6.5 percent this year, citing the expected drag from higher borrowing costs, a crackdown on air pollution and a cooling housing market. \nSustained and robust services growth, however, could offset softer industrial growth and increase the chance of an upside surprise.
