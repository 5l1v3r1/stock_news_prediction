Finance Chief David Wehner told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday that average ad prices in the fourth quarter rose 43 percent from the prior year, with ad impressions up 4 percent. \nAdvertisers are so eager to reach Facebook's user base, which exceeds 2 billion people a month, that they're willing to pay higher prices. \n\"The increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory,\" the filing said. \nFacebook said on Wednesday that its base of users in the U.S. and Canada fell from 185 million a day in the third quarter to 184 million in the fourth, the first drop in the company's history. Still, the stock price rose more than 3 percent because Facebook reported fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted profit that topped analysts' estimates.
