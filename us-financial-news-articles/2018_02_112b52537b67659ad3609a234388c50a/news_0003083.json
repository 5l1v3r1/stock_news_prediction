Differences remain on labour law, health reforms and taxes.\nThey agreed to guarantee a pension level of 48 percent of average income, with contributions to be capped at 20 percent.\nHorst Seehofer, the combative conservative leader of Bavaria, remained sceptical about boosting additional government spending beyond a planned 46 billion euros through 2021, the basis of a blueprint agreed in exploratory talks last month.\nOn Thursday, Germany’s lower house of parliament voted to extend a ban on reunions of migrants until the end of July, agreed by would-be coalition partners just two days ago. The existing suspension, introduced in 2016, had been due to expire.\nMerkel’s Bavarian allies have dug in their heels against more generous migrant policies demanded by the SPD.\nWriting by Madeline Chambers; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T16:09:56.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
