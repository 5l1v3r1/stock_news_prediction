But in the event that inflation does accelerate, that could lead volatility to continue as the Goldilocks environment maybe under further pressure.”\nCleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, a voting member in the central bank’s rate-setting committee this year, said the recent stock market sell-off and jump in volatility will not damage the economy’s overall strong prospects.\nAfter a wildly volatile week that pushed the market into correction territory, U.S. stocks gained roughly 3 percent over Friday and Monday, their best two-day gains since June 2016.\nBy 11:09 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 96.29 points, or 0.39 percent, at 24,504.98, the S&P 500 was down 8.64 points, or 0.33 percent, at 2,647.36 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 6.63 points, or 0.09 percent, at 6,975.34.\nNine of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by losses in the healthcare and financial indexes.\nBenchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were hovering at 2.8439 percent, shy of their four-year peak of 2.9020 percent on Monday.\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, a widely-followed measure of short-term stock volatility, eased to near session-lows at 25.51, and well short of the 50-point mark it touched last week.\nThe recent pullback has wiped out all of the year’s gains for the benchmark S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow, which are now down about 0.7 percent so far in 2018.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq was still clinging to a 1.22 percent gain for the year.\nOf the 70 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings, nearly 78 percent of them topping profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is above the 72 percent average beat-rate in the past four quarters.\nShares of Under Armour rose more than 18 percent after the sportswear maker reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts’ estimates.\nAmerisourceBergen jumped about 8 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported Walgreens made a takeover approach for the drug distributor. Walgreens rose marginally.\nHenry Schein and Patterson Companies fell 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively, after a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint against the dental supply companies.\nTheir losses were the biggest among healthcare distributors weighing up the possible ramifications of the AmerisourceBergen deal and a report of Amazon’s push into the space.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,527 to 1,240. On the Nasdaq, 1,352 issues fell and 1,346 advanced.
