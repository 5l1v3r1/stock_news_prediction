He is keen to stem public spending — for example by crushing plans to build nuclear power stations in South Africa, which could cost up to $100 billion.\nRodger Bosch | AFP | Getty Images South African Minister of Finance Nhlanhla Nene delivers the 2015 budget speech at the National Assembly in Cape Town on February 25, 2015. Gordhan's new role in the Department of Public Enterprises means that he is responsible for some 300 state-owned firms, including the struggling South African Airlines and utility firm Eskom.\nGordhan is \"an iconic figure among investors due to his resistance to the state capture project and his record of sound fiscal management,\" Ben Payton, head of Africa research at consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\"Given that maladministration in state-owned companies such as Eskom threatens to generate a financial meltdown, Gordhan is now the most important official in the government, other than Ramaphosa himself.\"\nNene was cautious about the budget delivered by his predecessor Malusi Gigaba last week, in which South Africa's value added tax was hiked for the first time in 25 years , up from 14 percent to 15 percent in an attempt to address the country's deficit.\nWhen Nene was asked by local station Talk Radio 702 if the move would deter ratings downgrades, he answered, \"I wouldn't say that yet,\" Reuters reported.\nGigaba is now home affairs minister.\nWaldo Swiegers | Bloomberg via Getty Images South Africa's newly appointed Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan \"In making these changes, I have been conscious of the need to balance continuity and stability with the need for renewal, economic recovery and accelerated transformation,\" Ramaphosa said in a statement Monday night .\nNonetheless, the faction of the ANC supporting Zuma also has representation in Ramaphosa's cabinet. David Mabuza, deputy president of the ANC and a known ally of Zuma, was appointed as South Africa's deputy president.\nNkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Zuma's ex-wife, who challenged Ramaphosa to the ANC leadership in December, was given the role of minister in the presidency of planning and monitoring. Dlamini-Zuma was Zuma's choice for the ANC leadership.\nMarkets responded positively to Ramaphosa's reshuffle, with the Johannesburg Top 40 Index trading 0.73 percent higher on the news during mid-morning trade.\n\"The reshuffle is the first stage of a big clean-out,\" van Staden wrote, describing the changes as \"the largest single purge of an ineffective and significantly corrupt cabinet in post-democratic history.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/press-statements/president-ramaphosa-announces-changes-national-executive"], "published": "2018-02-27T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T18:13:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
