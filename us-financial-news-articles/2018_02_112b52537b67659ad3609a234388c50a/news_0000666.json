There were some sizable remittance flows but the demand was heavy,” said a currency dealer. \nDealers expect a 2-3 percent depreciation in the rupee and higher volatility this year on account of debt repayment by the government. \nPresident Maithripala Sirisena’s administration must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.85 billion) in 2018 - a record high - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans and a total of $5.36 billion in interest. \nForeign investors bought 5.9 billion rupees worth of government securities this year up to Jan. 30, central bank data showed. \nThe rupee fell 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016. \nSri Lanka’s stock, bond and foreign exchange markets are closed on Monday for a special holiday. Markets will resume trading on Tuesday.
