REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein Democratic Representative Barbara Lee questioned Mulvaney at a House of Representatives Budget Committee hearing about the costs. She noted, “You know the parade is very similar to those held in authoritarian countries like North Korea.”\nMulvaney said at the hearing, “We’ve actually had many military parades in this country before. I think we had one as recently as the 1990s, and maybe one more recently than that.”\nMULVANEY SAYS BACKS BUDGET Ahead of Mulvaney’s testimony, Republican committee Chairman Steve Womack asked about the deficit impact of Trump’s spending plan. Mulvaney faced similar inquiries earlier this week.\nAt a Senate panel hearing on Tuesday, he was asked if he would vote for the Trump spending plan if he were still in Congress, which he was before Trump hired him to run OMB.\n“I probably would have found enough shortcomings in this to vote against it,” Mulvaney said at the time.\nOn Wednesday, Mulvaney walked that back, telling the House panel he thought he had been asked not about Trump’s budget, but about a narrower two-year spending-caps deal.\n“I read in the newspapers this morning that someone reported that I wouldn’t support this budget if I were in Congress. That is absolutely false,” Mulvaney said. “I absolutely, without reservation, support this budget.”\nAdditional reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T01:27:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
