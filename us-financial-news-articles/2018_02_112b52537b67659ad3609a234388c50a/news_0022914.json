Both the European Union and United States have call for urgent investigations to establish what went wrong.\nThe EU has asked its own anti-fraud office to conduct a separate investigation.\nU.S. ambassador Deborah R. Malac said Uganda needed to conduct investigations urgently, ensure the restitution of any lost funds and prosecute anyone found to be involved in fraud. Failure to act would make it hard for governments to trust Uganda as a partner, she said.\n“We cannot stress enough the fierce urgency for swift and definitive action,” she said at a meeting between donors and Ugandan officials on Thursday.\n“Anything less than such actions would breach the trust bestowed on Uganda by the international community,” she said.\nThe United States alone, she said, has contributed over $500 million to the U.N.’s refugee agency, known as UNHCR, and the World Food Program over the last two years.\nReporting by Elias Biryabarema, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T03:10:06.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
