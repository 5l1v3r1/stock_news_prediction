Once that happens it becomes difficult for us to offer good protection. They have now said it publicly.”\nTrack and field athlete Yulia Stepanova and her husband Vitaly, who went public about doping in Russia back in 2014, has accused WADA of doing nothing after they had tried for years to pass on information to the anti-doping body.\nAs a result Russia’s track and field team was banned from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016 and Russia was banned from the Pyeongchang winter Olympics starting on Friday, with the athletes competing as neutrals under the Olympic flag.\nWorld Anti-Doping Agency President, Sir Craig Reedie, attends a news conference ahead of the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, February 8, 2018. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard Russia’s anti-doping agency remains suspended as is the country’s Olympic committee.\nThe Stepanovs, as well as the former head of the Russian anti-doping lab Grigory Rodchenkov, have fled to the United States for fear of their lives and have gone into hiding after they were branded traitors back home.\nSlideshow (3 Images) All three are now living in undisclosed locations while Russia has said it plans to ask the United States to extradite Rodchenkov.\n“It is our philosophy... that whistleblowers should in the great majority of cases remain anonymous,” said WADA Director General Olivier Niggli. “They should not be the face of the investigation, precisely to protect them.”\nRelated Coverage Factbox: The IOC, WADA, CAS and the Russian doping story explained “Our goal is to protect the identity of the whistleblower to the best of our extent.”\n“When a whistleblower goes public then it is the choice of the individual and neither WADA nor any organisation can protect them. We are not equipped for that and only law enforcement has those capabilities.”\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T15:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:36:14.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
