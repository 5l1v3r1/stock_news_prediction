Trump is expected to clear the way soon for the publication of a classified memo that Republicans say shows improper use of surveillance by the FBI in the initial stages of the investigation.\nThe Justice Department and Democrats have lobbied Trump to stop the release, saying it could harm national security and mislead the public.\nOn Twitter, Comey urged his former colleagues to \"take heart: American history shows that, in the long run, weasels and liars never hold the field, so long as good people stand up.\"\nHe concluded, \"Not a lot of schools or streets named for Joe McCarthy\" — a reference to the senator who, in the 1950s, conducted hearings aimed at rooting out Communists in the U.S. government.\nJames Comey tweet\nSince his firing last May, Comey has made his personal feelings about Trump known, testifying in detail about personal interactions he says troubled him.\nHe also authorized a close friend to share with reporters details from a memo he produced documenting one such encounter — a February conversation in the Oval Office in which he said Trump encouraged him to drop an FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn .
