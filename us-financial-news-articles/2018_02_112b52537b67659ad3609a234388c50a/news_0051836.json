Its chief executive said he was “totally aligned” with Sika’s founding Burkard family, who want to sell their controlling stake.\nSika on Friday said the “unknown outcome of the Saint-Gobain’s hostile takeover attempt remains an element of uncertainty for the future”.\nSika has fought the Burkards in court over their plan to sell their 16 percent stake to Saint-Gobain, an attractive deal because the holding carries nearly 53 percent of voting rights.\nThe founding family wants to extend their agreement with Saint-Gobain, although Sika’s rising share price has made Saint-Gobain’s original offer of 2.75 million francs less attractive.\nSika’s stock has gained 43 percent in the past year, massively outpacing the Stoxx 600 Chemicals Index which has risen 6.6 percent and Saint-Gobain which has lost nearly 3 percent.\nThe next court decision -- centring on the family’s voting rights -- is expected in the next few months.
