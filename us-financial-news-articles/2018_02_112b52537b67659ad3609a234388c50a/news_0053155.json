The former reality television star, who is very aware of his appearance, smirked on Friday when he saw himself on a screen as he spoke to the Conservative Political Action Conference. “What a nice picture that is. Look at that. I’d love to watch that guy speak,” said Trump, drawing friendly laughter from a crowd of cheering supporters.

He turned around and moved his hands around his elaborately dyed, comb-over coiffure, seemingly pantomiming the movements needed to assemble it each day. “Oh, boy,” he said, facing the crowd again. “I try like hell to hide that bald spot, folks. I work hard at it.” One more thing to be frustrated about. Trump listed other, weightier issues, that frustrated him in a speech lasting more than an hour, which showed him in full-on campaign mode ahead of November’s congressional elections, in which Republicans risk losing control of Congress. He lamented U.S. immigration policies and repeated a story he had used as a presidential candidate comparing unwanted immigrants to a deadly snake. The crowd applauded.
