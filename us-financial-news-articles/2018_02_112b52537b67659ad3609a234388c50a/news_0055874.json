REUTERS/Yves Herman Going digital for a telco risks cannibalising its bread-and-butter business - voice and text messaging. Digital apps, meanwhile, require a totally new skillset to analyse and profit from the customer data they yield.\nSpain’s Telefonica, whose interests span Europe and Latin America, also embarked on such an undertaking last year, announcing it would shift all its businesses onto a unified ‘fourth platform’.\nThis year, Telefonica unveiled its own digital assistant so that customers can use voice commands to administer their accounts or interact with other online helpers like Google Assistant.\nYet the assistant, called Aura, will work differently across the six markets where it is being launched, largely due to the complexity of Telefonica’s portfolio - from mobile-only in Britain to a Brazilian player created out of several takeovers.\n“That’s our reality,” Telefonica’s chief digital officer, Chema Alonso, told Reuters in Barcelona.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Given the difficulty of such a makeover, it’s not surprising that some established European companies are fighting shy.\n“We’ve seen telcos try to move in the past – but they are just not flexible and agile,” said Kester Mann, an analyst who covers the operators at CCS Insight.\n“I‘m struggling to see a Deutsche Telekom, an Orange or a Vodafone making a really radical reversal of their strategy,” he said of the big German, French and British players.\nAMAZON ALWAYS BETTER Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges doesn’t even want to compete head on with Silicon Valley giants like Amazon, the e-commerce juggernaut that has moved into online entertainment.\n“We shouldn’t try to copy Amazon, because Amazon will always be better than the copies,” Hoettges said in response to a Reuters question.\n“Deutsche Telekom’s strength is personal proximity,” he said. “I call it dialogue marketing.”\nYet shares in Deutsche Telekom are languishing near three-year lows despite solid annual results last week.\nTurkcell’s shift to digital has included bundling its fizy app for free into Turkcell subscriber packages, with no charges for data use. People who aren’t customers can download it for free from Google Play and Apple’s App Store, with subscription charges kicking in after a month.\nTerzioglu, still sporting his moustache at the Lifecell event in Barcelona, forecasts revenue growth at Turkcell of 13-15 percent and core EBITDA profit margins of 33 to 35 percent this year.\n“Today Turkcell is the fastest-growing telecom in the world,” the former Cisco executive told a packed crowd at his company’s stand. “We gained a market edge - this happened through an enormous focus on digital services.”\nReporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T17:35:29.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
