REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo Unions say those practices are exploitative and have taken court action, winning a high-profile case over workers’ rights against Uber in 2016 which the taxi app is appealing.\nPrime Minister Theresa May is keen to show she is tackling problems faced particularly by younger Britons, who deprived her ruling Conservatives of a majority in a snap election last year by overwhelmingly backing the left-wing Labour Party.\nFILE PHOTO: An UberEATS food delivery courier stands in front of his bike in London, Britain September 7, 2016. Picture taken September 7, 2016. REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo As part of the consultation, which is due to close in May, the government will consider whether new legislation is needed to make it easier to differentiate between employment categories, affecting rights and tax obligations.\nIt comes after a review by the Chief Executive of The Royal Society of Arts Matthew Taylor said last year that many Britons working for firms in the gig economy deserved more entitlements.\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which is part of legal action over workers’ rights against Uber, said Wednesday’s government response to the review did not go far enough.\n“More than anything else, it is an exercise in kicking the problem into the long grass,” said General Secretary Jason Moyer-Lee.\n“What we needed to see was a serious extension of rights to workers and a serious proposal on government enforcement of employment law, not just a consultation on the topic.”\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T12:45:30.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
