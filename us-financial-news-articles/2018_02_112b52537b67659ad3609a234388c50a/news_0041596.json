The group has since been declared a terrorist organization by the government but it maintains that its activities are peaceful.\nReporting by Mahmoud Mourad; Additional reporting by Omar Fahmy; Writing by Eric Knecht; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:39:25.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
