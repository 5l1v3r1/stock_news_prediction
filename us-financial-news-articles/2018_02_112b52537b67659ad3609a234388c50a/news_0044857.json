This contracting model allows the government flexibility to adjust its purchased capacity based on its backlog and available funding while prioritizing those features that are most important to enhancing customers’ user experience. This unique fixed price Agile model emphasizes the importance of the relationship between government and contractor where all aspects of planning, execution, and delivery are fully transparent and communications are strong between both parties. The successful software deliveries to date and the realized cost savings to the government in executing this model, make it an ideal option moving forward for NGA, the Intelligence Community, and Federal government when purchasing Agile development services.\n“The award demonstrates our commitment to innovation, and a true partnership between our government customer and Octo. This type of collaboration can generate lasting results that bolster not only agency goals, but enhance our national security,” said Mehul Sanghani, Octo’s CEO.\nAbout Octo Consulting Group\nOcto is an industry-leading, award-winning provider of technology and modernization services for the Federal government.
