They stand first in the Big 12 Conference race at 8-3.\nKansas sophomore center Udoka Azubuike added a double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds.\nTCU (16-8, 4-7) led by two at halftime and still carried a 52-50 margin with 12:06 remaining after a bucket inside from senior forward Vlad Brodziansky, who had 15 points and eight rebounds.\nThe Horned Frogs had assists on 18 of 23 buckets, including nine assists by junior guard Alex Robinson, but were unable to regain the lead after a go-ahead free throw by Azubuike with 10:22 remaining.\nFreshman reserve forward Kouat Noi led TCU with 17 points, while senior guard Kenrich Williams added nine rebounds but was limited to six points, eight below his average.\nKansas senior guard Svi Mykhailiuk managed just one point after scoring in double figures in all but two previous games and averaging 21.7 points in the past four games. He attempted only two shots despite playing 36 minutes. Jayhawks reserve guards Lagerald Vick and Marcus Garrett added 10 points apiece.\nNoi came off the bench to pace the Frogs with 13 first-half points on 4-for-6 shooting, all from 3-point range. TCU had 11 assists on 12 first-half makes.\nEach team attempted 15 treys in the first half, but TCU knocked down eight compared to four for Kansas, enabling the Frogs to lead 36-34 at the break.\nGraham countered with 13 first-half points for the Jayhawks, who survived a drought of 4:37 late in the half when they missed six straight shots and fell behind 35-28. A 6-1 run to close the half drew Kansas within two despite finishing on a 2-for-11 shooting run.\nAlthough Vick was benched as part of a move by coach Bill Self to inject some energy into his Kansas squad, the junior guard played 13 first-half minutes, partly because Azubuike drew two fouls and logged just seven minutes before halftime.\nWith the victory, Kansas completed a conference sweep of TCU after claiming an 88-84 win in Fort Worth on Jan. 6. The Jayhawks hold a 7-0 all-time advantage at home in the series.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T12:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:27:03.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
