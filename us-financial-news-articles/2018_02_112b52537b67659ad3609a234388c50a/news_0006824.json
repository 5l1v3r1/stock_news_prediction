His foot was pointing in the wrong direction after making impact with the court.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Players on both teams braced themselves during the sobering moment, and Canaan was taken off the court on a stretcher.\nIt was a similar scene to the one Hayward faced on opening night when a brutally dislocated ankle and broken tibia ended his season.\nEntering Wednesday’s play, Canaan was averaging 8.9 points and 3.9 assists for the Suns.\nWriting by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T09:44:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
