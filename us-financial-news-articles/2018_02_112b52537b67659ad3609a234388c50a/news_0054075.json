REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah She picked up the second set and went on to break Muguruza three times to claim victory in just over two and a half hours.\nIt was the 20-year-old Russian’s first victory over the Spaniard as she continued her fine run of form against top-five ranked players, winning five of her eight meetings.\nSlideshow (3 Images) ”I was just trying to fight for every ball because Garbine, she’s playing unbelievable,“ Kasatkina added. ”She’s hitting so hard, playing so fast. I was just trying to do whatever I could.\n“(Tomorrow) is a final already, so I have to put everything that’s left in my body into this match. I hope I will.”\nShe will next face world number four Svitolina, who made quick work of Kerber in a 6-3 6-3 semi-final victory.\nThe 23-year-old Ukrainian has now won her last five encounters against the twice grand slam champion.\nThe victory puts Svitolina within touching distance of becoming only the third women’s player, alongside Justine Henin and Venus Williams, to win successive Dubai titles.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:41:06.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
