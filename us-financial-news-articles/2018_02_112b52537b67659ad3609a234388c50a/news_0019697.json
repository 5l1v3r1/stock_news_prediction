Centro Fox is a non-profit organization dedicated to the development and harnessing of compassionate leaders that will help shape a better world. Under the Fox Administration and leadership, the Mexican Government introduced policies to ensure basic healthcare access for all its citizens. Mr. Fox remains active in the development of improved healthcare access for all Mexicans, including the establishment of a hospital treating patients with complex neurological disorders.\n\"We are truly honoured to welcome Former President Fox to our Board of Directors,\" said Carolyn Cross, CEO and Chairman, Ondine Biomedical Inc. \"From our earliest interactions with the Former President, his deep commitment to improving the lives of people across Mexico and Latin America – and indeed worldwide – has been abundantly evident. He is passionate in his belief that healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and that optimal healthcare means patients should never suffer from healthcare associated infections. Mr. Fox, a well-known Humanitarian, believes that helping mankind is a 'shortcut to happiness', a philosophy that aligns with Ondine corporate mission and culture.\"\n\"As President of Mexico, I worked tirelessly to improve living conditions for all Mexicans, including the establishment of health insurance coverage, modernizing hospitals as well as introducing new hospital equipment throughout Mexico,\" stated Mr. Fox. \"While we have made great strides, we are nevertheless in urgent need of scalable solutions to healthcare problems we share with other developed nations, including the problem of hospital-acquired infections and the troubling rise in antibiotic resistance. I look forward to assisting Ondine in deploying their photodisinfection technology across Mexico and Latin America, and ultimately, across the globe\".\nFormer President Fox joins the board with two new board members: The Honourable Jean Charest , Former Premier of Quebec and Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, and Mr. Joseph Sowell III, Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer of Nashville, TN-based HCA Healthcare.\nAbout Ondine Biomedical Inc.\nOndine Biomedical Inc. is dedicated to the development of non-antibiotic anti-infective therapies for a broad spectrum of bacterial, viral and fungal infections.
