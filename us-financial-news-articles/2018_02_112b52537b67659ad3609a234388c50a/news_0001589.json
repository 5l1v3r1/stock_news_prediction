REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nGuess also said it had investigated claims that Marciano behaved inappropriately towards two women in November 2017, after an entertainment website contacted them. \nIt said the investigation, aided by outside counsel, had so far been unable to corroborate the allegations and the company’s board had been unable to determine if they had merit. Marciano has denied the allegations. Shoppers walk by a Guess store in Golden, Colorado, December 3, 2014. REUTERS/Rick Wilking \nMarciano separately responded to Upton’s allegations through celebrity news website TMZ, saying he never touched Upton, and has never been alone with her. He said he would not apologize as he had done nothing wrong, TMZ reported. \n“If she has a claim, there’s one place to tell the truth and that’s in court or to the police,” he told TMZ. \nMarciano could not be reached by Reuters for comment. \nGuess shares ended down 17.7 percent at $15.11 on Thursday, wiping more than $250 million off the company’s market value.
