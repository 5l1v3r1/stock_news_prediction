REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo Prime-time scheduling of South Korea’s favoured sports will also help, he said, noting that speed skating events were set to be aired in the evenings.\nA Harim spokesman said the firm expected a jump in chicken demand this week, with some events starting ahead of Friday’s official opening ceremony, and would keep a close eye on stocks to ensure it can keep up supplies.\nSouth Korean chicken consumption is expected to rise to 14.2 kg per capita this year from 13.6 kg in 2017, thanks to the Olympics and other major sports events such as the World Cup, according to a report by the Korea Rural Economic Institute.\nKwak Sung-kwon, company director at Genesis BBQ, the country’s top fried chicken franchise, said winter weather also piqued appetites for fried chicken.\n“It’s cold so delivery orders increase a lot,” Kwak said.\nFried chicken and beer are a combination known as chimaek, a sports bar classic that came of age here in 2002 when South Korea co-hosted the World Cup with Japan.\nAdditional reporting by Dahee Kim and Cynthia Kim; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T08:30:04.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
