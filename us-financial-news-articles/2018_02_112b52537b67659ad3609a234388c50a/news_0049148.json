It said it continued to negotiate in good faith and hoped to find an amicable solution soon to the “highly regrettable” situation.\nItalian supermarket chain Conad said that AgeCore companies had reduced their purchases of Nestle products by around 20 percent, with negotiations underway over prices.\nIndustry sources from two other AgeCore members have also confirmed negotiations are in place.
