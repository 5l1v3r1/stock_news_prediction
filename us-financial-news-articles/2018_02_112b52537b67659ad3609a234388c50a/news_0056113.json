The incident took place in January. \nHis brother Salah Abdeslam was arrested in Molenbeek close to his family home in March 2016 after the November 2015 attacks in Paris which were claimed by Islamic State. \nLawyers for Salah Abdeslam, a French citizen born to and raised by Moroccan immigrant parents in Brussels, accept he was in Paris when gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 at a rock concert, near the national stadium and outside cafes. \nHowever, he has refused to speak about the attacks to investigators. \nReporting by Foo Yun Chee and Phil Blenkinsop; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T17:23:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
