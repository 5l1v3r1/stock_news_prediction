I understand the public’s concern about this issue. We all want the quality of our democracy to improve, not deteriorate,” Widodo said on Twitter late on Wednesday.\nHe did not say if he would sign it.\nRights groups and anti-corruption activists have criticized the proposed law, saying it could harm freedom of speech and slow a fight against endemic graft.\nSurveys show that Indonesians have for years perceived parliament to be among the country’s most corrupt institutions. An anti-graft watchdog has said the majority of its investigations involve members of parliament.\nLegislators say the law would protect them from “false allegations” of corruption and other criticism.\n“It is important to differentiate between criticism and insult. People should not make accusations without legal facts that they can be held accountable for,” said one member of the assembly, Firman Subagyo.\nReporting by Kanupriya Kapoor and Agustinus Beo Da Costa; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T07:47:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
