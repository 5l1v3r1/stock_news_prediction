The ship belongs to the country’s top energy explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd, she added.\nAn ONGC official said the ship was undergoing maintenance at state-run Cochin Shipyard on the country’s southwest coast.\nThe blast took place inside the water tank, said M.P. Dinesh, a senior police official in the southern state of Kerala where the shipyard is located.\n“The casualties occurred in the smoke that spilled out from the tank, according to preliminary information,” he told reporters. “All people trapped in the ship have been evacuated. The situation is under control now.”\nReporting by Arathy S. Nair in BENGALURU and Promit Mukherjee in MUMBAI and Jose Devasia in KOCHI; Writing by Krishna N.
