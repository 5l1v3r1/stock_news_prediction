Fadell would eventually leave the company later that year, and Google was reported to have moved an unspecified number of Nest developers to its own unit. \nIn an interview with CNET , Osterloh and Nest CEO Marwan Fawaz pitched the decision to move Nest to Google as the right decision because it makes it easier to build new Nest products that use Google’s artificial intelligence technologies. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \n“All of Google’s investments in machine learning and AI, they can very clearly benefit Nest products. It just makes sense to be developing them together,” Osterloh told CNET. \nIn September, Nest debuted new products including a security camera that can notify homeowners through a smartphone app whether someone is approaching their doors.
