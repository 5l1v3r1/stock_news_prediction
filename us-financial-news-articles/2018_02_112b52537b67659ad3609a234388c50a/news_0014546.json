You’d think that with rates up, the dollar would be up, but investors are focusing their interest elsewhere,” such as further evidence that the European economy is picking up, said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\nA survey released on Thursday showed eurozone manufacturing continued to boom last month, supporting expectations that the European Central Bank is on track to normalise monetary policy.\nThe euro edged down 0.1 percent on the day to $1.2499 , but remained within sight of last week’s 3-year high of $1.2538. For the week, it was up 0.6 percent.\nAgainst its Japanese counterpart, the dollar was slightly higher on the day at 109.50, holding above a four-month nadir of 108.28 hit a week ago.\nOn Friday, the BOJ offered to buy an unlimited amount of JGBs with more than five to ten years left to maturity at 2 basis points above the previous close, which is 0.110 percent -- the same level at which it has offered similar unlimited buying in the past.\nThe BOJ also increased the amount of its planned buying in five- to 10-year JGBs to 450 billion yen from the previous 410 billion, an amount it had kept since late August.\nForeign exchange markets were largely unfazed by the Japanese central bank’s move. The dollar drifted to its session low of 109.28 yen shortly afterward, before pushing higher.\n“The BOJ’s move today didn’t have much of a forex market impact, as many market participants don’t believe the BOJ wants to further expand its balance sheet,” said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.\n“So today’s announcement does not have much power to lift the dollar,” he said.\nLater on Friday, investors will be watching the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for January, for the latest clues on the strength of the U.S. labour market.\nNonfarm payrolls probably rose by 180,000 jobs in January after increasing 148,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, though many market participants expect a rate hike in March.\nThe U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year, the same as in 2017.\nReporting by Lisa Twaronite; Editing by Sam Holmes and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:11:19.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
