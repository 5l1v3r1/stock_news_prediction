JAILED OR BARRED \nOctober’s gubernatorial elections were a warning sign of how the Socialist Party can score electoral victories despite fury over the economy. \nEven though polls showed the opposition winning most of the 23 governorships, Maduro allies took 18 of them as a result of low voter turnout. Slideshow (5 Images) \nMany insisted that participating in the election was legitimizing Maduro’s government following what they said was a power grab with the creation of an all-powerful legislature called the Constitutional Assembly in a July ballot boycotted by the opposition. \nThe governors’ vote gave Maduro a political boost and left the opposition divided and squabbling. It boycotted elections for 335 mayors in December, further increasing abstentionism. \nWith the election at most three months away, the opposition still does not have a standard bearer. \nAnd the field of candidates has been heavily limited by the government’s aggressive moves to jail the best-known opposition leaders or bar them from politics. \nTwo-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles is banned from holding office. Former Mayor Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest for leading protests against Maduro while his protege, Freddy Guevara, is holed up in the residence of the Chilean ambassador, seeking to avoid arrest on similar accusations. \nHowever, former union leader Andres Velasquez has shown interest in a presidential bid, while ex-Lara state Governor Henri Falcon has called on the opposition to unite behind him. Former Congress chief Henry Ramos has also said he would run in opposition primaries. \nBoth Ramos and Falcon have done better in recent polls than Maduro, according to Datanalisis Director Luis Vicente Leon, adding that Venezuelans widely reject the president. \nBut doubts about the fairness of elections and limited motivation following the opposition’s recent ballot box fiascos may make that irrelevant. \n“The opposition is indeed the majority,” Leon said in a telephone interview, “but that won’t matter if it can’t mobilize its people in an election.”   Andreina Aponte; Editing by Alexandra Ulmer, Lisa Shumaker and Lisa Von Ahn", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T08:18:11.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
