Both tourism receipts and visitor arrivals touched record highs for the second time in two years.\nThe board expects visitor arrivals in the range of 17.6 million to 18.1 million for 2018. It also forecast tourism receipts between S$27.1 billion and S$27.6 billion for this year.\nSingapore, which relies on tourism for about 4 percent of its economic output, has built a reputation for glitzy shopping malls, street food, casinos and the Formula One night race.\n($1 = 1.3266 Singapore dollars)\nReporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T06:38:35.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
