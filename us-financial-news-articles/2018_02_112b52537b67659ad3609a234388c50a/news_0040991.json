The FCA has completely lost control of the publication process,” Morgan said on Tuesday.\n“I will be asking members to agree to publish the final, unredacted report under parliamentary privilege as soon as possible,” she said.\nThe FCA has said it cannot legally publish the report as it was compiled confidentially and individuals criticised in it had a legal right to reply before publication.
