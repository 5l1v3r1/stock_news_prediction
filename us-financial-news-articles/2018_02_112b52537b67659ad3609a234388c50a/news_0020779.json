Sales reached 5.5 billion euros for 2017 as a whole, up 9 percent at constant currencies.\nHermes, which will report full results for last year on March 21, said operating profitability should be close to the record level recorded over the first half of 2017.\n$1 = 0.8140 euros Reporting by Sarah White Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T15:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:43:01.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
