Market participants have started to edge money back into perceived riskier assets, like stocks, signaling that fears seen last week during the sell-off have dissipated, for now.\n\"The USD is in a structural, medium-term downtrend. Part of the reason for this is the U.S. fiscal account deficit, which is expanding rapidly,\" Stephen Gallo, European head of forex strategy at Bank of Montreal, told CNBC via email.\nThe dollar index has depreciated 3 percent since the start of 2018.

That virtuous circle went into reverse last week when equity markets tanked, but so far this week, risk assets have recovered and there are signs that the willingness to hold USDs is waning again,\" Gallo added.\nGlobal equity markets have been on the rise since Monday recovering from the steep losses seen last week.\nMarket players will be watching for new consumer price data due Wednesday in the U.S. If the number proves higher than analysts expect, the dollar could gain some ground during that session, as the prospect of the U.S. Federal Reserve tightening its policy at a faster pace would increase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T14:00:47.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
