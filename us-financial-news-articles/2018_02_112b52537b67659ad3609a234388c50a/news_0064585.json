DIS -1.65% and Comcast Corp. CMCSA -1.23% ? Valuation fundamentals are a poor guide when big-picture strategy meets asset scarcity.\nSky shares jumped 21% to £13.30 ($18.34) on Tuesday after the U.S. cable giant posted a £12.50 bid. It was trading at £13.45 Wednesday. Investors seem to be expecting a bump from 21st Century Fox Inc., FOX -1.94% whose longstanding offer for the 61% of Sky shares it doesn’t already own was pitched at £10.75. Fox would presumably need permission from Disney, which has its own bid for various Fox assets , including Sky.\nSky shares jumped 21% after the U.S. cable giant posted a £12.50 bid. Photo: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News It makes sense for Disney to give Fox the green light. Disney boss Bob Iger has called Sky one of Fox’s crown jewels. The European pay-television leader is essentially a media-distribution business —albeit one with a starrier brand than most—that would help Disney get closer to consumers and grow overseas. The rapid global expansion of direct-to-consumer streaming platforms such as Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s video unit have made this a pressing strategic priority.\nIf Disney does come back with a higher bid, Comcast will need to decide how much it too needs Sky. Comcast stock fell 7% Tuesday as investors registered their incomprehension of a $41 billion bet on what was historically a satellite business. The cable giant’s boss Brian Roberts has spent his career disparaging satellite technology in the U.S., but thinks Sky’s already popular streaming service points a way forward for the wider TV industry. Investors had been expecting Comcast to use excess cash to buy back its stock, which is much cheaper than that of Sky.\nYet the stock reaction may not rattle Mr. Roberts. The cable giant’s dual-share capital structure gives him a third of all votes, as son of the founder.\nMore\nChampion of Ethical Investing Owns U.S. Gun Makers February 28, 2018 Why It’s Hard to Make Cold Cash Delivering Hot Food February 28, 2018 China’s Netflix Set to Come With a Pricey Valuation February 28, 2018 Mr. Roberts seems to think a larger, trans-Atlantic customer base will give Comcast a crucial advantage in countering the power of the emerging streaming giants, though in a transitioning industry environment it isn’t clear precisely how. Sky is the only dedicated pay-TV company to serve the English-speaking markets of the U.K. and Ireland that are most attractive to U.S. media groups. And Fox’s deal with Disney makes clear that it is now up for sale in its entirety.\nBoth Disney and Comcast are giants, but the latter could probably afford to pay more if it ends up competing head-to-head. It has bigger cash flows and, crucially, could extract more cost savings, notably by sharing set-top box costs with Sky. As primarily a content owner and creator, Disney has little overlap with Sky’s business. Comcast hasn’t discussed savings, but this may partly reflect the deal’s political sensitivity in the U.K.\nSky now trades for 13 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with 10 times for Disney and 8 times for Comcast. Factor in its outsize capital spending, and Sky looks even more expensive. But given the financial muscle and strategic worries of the bidders, this is little barrier to a higher valuation. Sky investors already look lucky—but could get luckier still.\nThe cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix.
