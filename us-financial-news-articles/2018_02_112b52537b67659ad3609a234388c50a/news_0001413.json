There will then be a further three year transition period for EU countries to adapt.\nThe Commission said it envisaged 10-15 assessments could start in the first year, rising to 65 towards the end of the transition period.\nThe changes will therefore happen after Britain has exited the European Union and will have to be factored into the next EU budget covering the period after 2020.
