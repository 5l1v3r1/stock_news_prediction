REUTERS/Jorge Silva “I was loose, I put some of my good skiing from training in there but I also feel like I can go a little bit harder and there’s nothing to hold back for in the second run,” Shiffrin said.\n“That’s the nice thing about the Olympics, you don’t hold back.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) The 22-year-old, who is likely to compete in at least four events, expressed relief that she was finally competing on the snow.\n“Last night I was, like, are we ever going to race?” she said.\nNorway’s Ragnhild Mowinckel and Italy’s Marta Bassino were fourth and fifth respectively, while Germany’s Viktoria Rebensburg, the current World Cup leader, was 0.83 seconds behind Moelgg in eighth place.\nSwitzerland’s Lara Gut was among several skiers to wipe out, slamming dramatically into a group of photographers at the side of the course, but no one appeared to be hurt.\nAdditional reporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:29:44.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
