HAP will also continue to maintain its facility in Flint, Mich. The lease on its existing Southfield facility expires in December.\nApproximately 1,100 HAP employees and contractors, representing virtually all of HAP's operational units, will be based at the new facility, which is located at 1414 E. Maple Road, Troy, in Oakland County. The facility is leased by Henry Ford Health System and subleased by HAP. It will be a HAP-branded building, featuring prominent exterior HAP signage, with HAP occupying three of the five floors for a total of 180,000 square feet of space. The company currently leases 216,000 square feet in Southfield.\nHAP added significant square footage to its real estate portfolio in 2016 when it acquired a four-story, 90,000-square-foot office building in Flint following the company's merger with HealthPlus of Michigan. \"Not only do we currently have more space than we need in Southfield, but it isn't space that can be easily reconfigured to meet our needs,\" said Terri Kline, president and CEO. \"The new facility offers us greater flexibility and opportunities for better collaboration â€“ not just among internal teams, but also with our customers and business partners. In this era of non-stop change, insurers need to be nimble and able to adapt to the ever-changing needs of our members and other stakeholders. The Troy space allows us to do just that by creating efficiencies, which in turn helps position HAP for future growth and expansion. This is an exciting time for HAP.\"\nThe company expects to begin moving employees to the Troy facility in fourth quarter 2018, a process which should be completed by end of first quarter 2019.\nAbout Health Alliance Plan\nHealth Alliance Plan (HAP) is a Michigan-based, nonprofit health plan that provides health coverage to individuals and companies of all sizes.
