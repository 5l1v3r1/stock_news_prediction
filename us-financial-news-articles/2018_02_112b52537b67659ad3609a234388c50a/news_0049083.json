The bubbly 25-year-old from Bergamo clocked one minute, 39.22 seconds to take gold ahead of Norwegian Ragnhild Mowinckel, whose time of 1:39.31 won her a second silver after her second place in giant slalom last week. “I still don’t realise I‘m first, I was really focused, I moved like a samurai,” said Goggia. “Usually, I‘m really chaotic but I wanted to take in every little detail, every particular in the morning. I believed in myself - and then what counts, counts.” Mowinckel’s late run meant Vonn had to settle for third place in 1.39.69, her third Olympic podium making her the oldest female medallist in Alpine skiing at the Winter Games. “I gave it all today, skied a great race. Sofia just skied better than I did,” the 33-year-old American said. “It was tough to contemplate this being my last Olympic downhill. I struggled to try to keep the emotions together, but I left it all on the mountain like I said I would. I skied really well, but I think Sofia is untouchable today.” This was no shock in the manner of snowboarder Ester Ledecka’s win in the super-G at the weekend as Goggia leads the World Cup downhill standings, even if the Italian had finished second behind Vonn in their two most recent meetings. Looking charged with confidence as she exploded out of the start, Goggia really hit her straps in the mid-section of the run and produced a run that perfectly mixed her natural aggression with iron control. “I didn’t take any risks,” Goggia added. “I just used my brain because I have one sometimes and I use it. I just tried to focus on two points of the slope and I skied really focused.” Goggia gave a shrug after crossing the line knowing that Vonn, the most decorated female skier of all time, was going to be going out two spots behind her.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger Vonn won downhill gold in Vancouver eight years ago and, after missing the chance to defend it in Sochi because of one of the many injuries that have scarred her career, had hoped to reclaim the title in Pyeongchang. She made a strong start on the icy slope but looked a little tentative at the top of the mountain, going wide on one turn and leaving herself too much to do in the bottom part of the run. The American four-times overall World Cup champion still looked destined for a silver medal until flying Viking Mowinckel, who has never graced the podium in a World Cup downhill, threw caution to the wind to claim a surprise silver. “This is a really big surprise,” said Mowinckel. “I couldn’t have done it much better than this, this was my best downhill ever.” Slideshow (6 Images) Mowinckel’s thrilling run in bib 19 knocked Tina Weirather out of the medals and deprived the Liechtensteiner of a second bronze to add to the one she won behind Ledecka in the super-G. Weirather was fourth in 1:39.85 ahead of American Alice McKennis, who along with seventh placed team mate Breezy Johnson will give the American team hopes of a strong future in Olympic speed racing once Vonn has hung up her skis. ”It’s sad. It’s my last downhill,“ Vonn added. ”I wish I could keep going, I‘m having so much fun and I love what I do, but my body just can’t take another four years. “But I‘m proud to be competing for my country, giving it all and proud to come away with a medal.” Goggia paid tribute to the American. “Lindsey is a great skier, the greatest skier, a great person and a great woman,” she said. “Everyone is like bowing to Lindsey. It’s always an honour to take part in the same race as her. It’s fun too.” Sochi bronze medallist Lara Gut, who was pushed off the podium by Ledecka’s sensational run on Saturday, had another disappointing day and failed to finish after coming wide off a jump and missing a gate. “It is for sure disappointing to end it like that,” said the Swiss.
