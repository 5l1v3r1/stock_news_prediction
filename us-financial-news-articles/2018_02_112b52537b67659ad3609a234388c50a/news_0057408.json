Spencer, ONEOK president and chief executive officer. \"We continue to see production growth, largely driven by improved producer drilling economics and higher rig efficiencies.\n\"ONEOK is investing in our systems to grow with our customers and address their needs for additional capacity,\" Spencer added. \"We've announced approximately $4.2 billion of organic capital-growth projects with attractive returns since June 2017 that will be highly accretive, complement our existing assets and provide essential services in high-producing regions.\"\nFOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2017 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nONEOK's operating income increased 21 percent in the fourth quarter 2017 and 7 percent for the full-year 2017, compared with the same periods in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16 percent in the fourth quarter 2017 and 7 percent for the full-year 2017, compared with the same periods in 2016. Higher 2017 results were driven primarily by natural gas and natural gas liquids volume growth in ONEOK's natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments, offset partially by higher operating costs associated with the growth of ONEOK's operations and routine maintenance projects.\nEARNINGS PRESENTATION AND KEY STATISTICS:\nAdditional financial and operating information that will be discussed on the fourth-quarter and year-end 2017 conference call is accessible on ONEOK's website, www.oneok.com , or from the links below.\n> View earnings presentation\n> View earnings tables\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS:\nPaying in February 2018 a quarterly dividend of 77 cents per share, or $3.08 per share on an annualized basis, an increase of 25 percent compared with the same period in 2017; Completing equity issuances through ONEOK's \"at-the-market\" equity program in the fourth quarter 2017 generating net proceeds of $384 million and completing a public common stock offering in January 2018 resulting in total combined net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion, which were used to fund recently announced capital-growth projects and repay outstanding indebtedness. ONEOK does not expect to issue additional equity in 2018 and well into 2019; Repaying in January 2018 the remaining $500 million of the $1.0 billion term loan agreement due 2019 and short-term borrowings; and Having $2.5 billion of borrowing capacity available under its $2.5 billion credit agreement following the January 2018 equity offering.\nCAPITAL-GROWTH ACTIVITIES:\nSince June 2017, ONEOK has announced approximately $4.2 billion of organic capital-growth projects to support increasing production across ONEOK's operating footprint. These projects are expected to generate adjusted EBITDA multiples of four to six times and are backed by a combination of long-term fee-based contracts, volume commitments or acreage dedications.\nBased on recent project announcements, ONEOK's 2018 capital-growth expenditures are now expected to range from $1,950 million to $2,300 million, compared with the previously announced range of $1,270 million to $1,530 million. Maintenance capital expenditures of $140 million to $180 million are expected to remain unchanged from ONEOK's original 2018 financial guidance announced on Jan. 22, 2018.\nSince June 2017, the natural gas liquids segment has announced more than $3.6 billion of capital-growth projects, which include the following:\nProject\nScope\nApproximate Cost\n(Millions of dollars)\nExpected\nCompletion\nWest Texas LPG\nPipeline expansion\n120-mile pipeline lateral extension with 110,000 barrels\nper day (bpd) of capacity in the Delaware Basin\n$160\nThird quarter\n2018\nSterling III expansion\n60,000 bpd pipeline extension from the Mid-Continent to\nthe Gulf Coast which increases capacity to 250,000 bpd\n$130\nFourth quarter\n2018\nElk Creek Pipeline\nproject\n900-mile pipeline from the Williston Basin to the Mid-\nContinent with initial capacity up to 240,000 bpd\n$1,400\nYear-end 2019\nArbuckle II Pipeline\n530-mile pipeline from the Mid-Continent to the Gulf\nCoast with initial capacity of 400,000 bpd\n$1,360\nFirst quarter\n2020\nMB-4 fractionator\n125,000 bpd fractionator and related infrastructure in Mont\nBelvieu, Texas\n$575\nFirst quarter\n2020\nSince June 2017, the natural gas gathering and processing segment has announced approximately $560 million of capital-growth projects, which include the following:\nProject\nScope\nApproximate Cost\n(Millions of\ndollars)\nExpected\nCompletion\nCanadian Valley\nexpansion\n200 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) processing\nplant expansion in the STACK which increases capacity\nto 400 MMcf/d\n$160\nFourth quarter\n2018\nDemicks Lake plant\nand infrastructure\n200 MMcf/d processing plant and related infrastructure\nin the core of the Williston Basin\n$400\nFourth quarter\n2019\nIn December 2017, the segment completed a 30-mile natural gas gathering pipeline and related infrastructure to connect with an existing third-party natural gas processing plant in Oklahoma, providing ONEOK access to 200 MMcf/d of additional processing capacity.\nBUSINESS-SEGMENT RESULTS:\nKey financial and operating statistics are listed in the tables.\nNatural Gas Liquids Segment\nThe natural gas liquids segment's fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 22 and 7 percent, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016. Volume growth across ONEOK's system from increased supply and increased ethane recovery contributed to higher NGL volumes gathered during the fourth quarter and full year 2017, compared with 2016. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 NGLs fractionated increased 18 percent and 6 percent respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016.\nAs total NGL production increased in 2017, ethane rejection levels on ONEOK's system decreased to an average of more than 150,000 bpd in 2017, compared with approximately 175,000 bpd in 2016. ONEOK expects ethane rejection levels on its system to decrease to approximately 70,000 bpd by the end of 2018 as world-scale petrochemical facilities come online and NGL exporters increase volumes.\nThree Months Ended\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nNatural Gas Liquids Segment\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Millions of dollars)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n309.4\n$\n253.6\n$\n1,154.9\n$\n1,079.6\nCapital expenditures\n$\n54.5\n$\n20.4\n$\n114.3\n$\n105.9\nThe increase in fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA, compared with the fourth quarter 2016, primarily reflects:\nA $51.7 million increase in exchange services due to increased supply in the STACK and SCOOP areas and the Williston Basin from recently connected natural gas processing plants, increased ethane recovery in the STACK and SCOOP areas, and the impact of weather in December 2016, offset partially by lower volumes in the Granite Wash and Barnett Shale; and An $11.7 million increase in optimization and marketing due primarily to higher optimization volumes and wider location price differentials, offset partially by narrower product price differentials; offset partially by A $12.6 million increase in operating costs due primarily to the timing of routine maintenance projects and higher labor and employee-related costs.\nThe increase in adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017, compared with 2016, primarily reflects:\nAn $81.5 million increase in exchange services due primarily to increased supply and ethane recovery volumes in the Williston Basin, the STACK and SCOOP areas and the Powder River Basin; offset partially by lower volumes in the Granite Wash and Barnett Shale, and reduced volumes related to Hurricane Harvey; A $13.5 million increase in optimization and marketing due primarily to higher optimization volumes and wider location price differentials; and A $5.4 million increase in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher volumes delivered to the Overland Pass Pipeline from the Bakken NGL Pipeline and higher volumes and increased ethane recovery from plants connected to the Overland Pass Pipeline; offset partially by A $32.2 million increase in operating costs due primarily to the timing of routine maintenance projects, higher property taxes, higher labor and employee-related costs and additional operating costs related to Hurricane Harvey.\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing Segment\nThe natural gas gathering and processing segment's fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 14 and 16 percent, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016.\nVolume growth due to increased drilling activity, enhanced producer efficiencies and the completion of growth projects contributed to increases in natural gas volumes processed of 20 percent and 9 percent in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016. Volume growth for the full year 2017 was offset partially by natural production declines on existing wells and the impact of severe winter weather in the first quarter 2017.\nThis segment also continues to benefit from higher fee-based earnings, with an average fee rate of 86 cents per MMBtu in 2017, compared with 76 cents per MMBtu in 2016, a 13 percent increase.\nThree Months Ended\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing Segment\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Millions of dollars)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n144.3\n$\n126.6\n$\n518.5\n$\n446.8\nCapital expenditures\n$\n98.5\n$\n84.7\n$\n284.2\n$\n410.5\nFourth-quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased, compared with the fourth quarter 2016, which primarily reflects:\nA $37.8 million increase due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas, offset partially by natural production declines; offset partially by An $8.0 million decrease due to contract settlements in 2016; A $7.2 million increase in operating costs due primarily to higher materials and supplies expenses, and increased employee-related costs; and A $4.4 million decrease due primarily to lower realized natural gas and condensate prices.\nThe increase in adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017, compared with 2016, primarily reflects:\nA $66.0 million increase due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas, offset partially by natural production declines and the impact of severe winter weather in the first quarter 2017; and A $44.0 million increase due primarily to restructured contracts resulting in higher average fee rates, offset partially by a lower percentage of proceeds (POP) retained from the sale of commodities purchased under POP with fee contracts; offset partially by A $23.9 million increase in operating costs due primarily to increased labor and employee-related costs and the growth of ONEOK's operations; An $11.9 million decrease due primarily to lower realized natural gas and condensate prices; and An $8.0 million decrease due to contract settlements in 2016.\nNatural Gas Pipelines Segment\nThe natural gas pipelines segment's full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 9 percent, compared with the same period in 2016.

Adjusted EBITDA, ONEOK distributable cash flow and coverage ratio should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and coverage ratio are included in the tables.\nONEOK, Inc.
