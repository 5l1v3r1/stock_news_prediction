Also noteworthy for the Panthers was the appearance of defenseman Keith Yandle, who played career game No. 800. Yandle has also played 690 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NHL.\nThe Panthers, who had been 10-for-22 on their power play over the past six games, went 0-for-2 with the man advantage. The Leafs also failed to convert their two power plays.\nToronto collected the night’s only goal with 29 seconds left in the first period. Tyler Bozak got the puck to van Riemsdyk, who scored from the high slot, beating Luongo through the five-hole.\nThe Panthers were kept off the board in the period despite having the only power play of the opening 20 minutes, producing six shots with the man advantage.\nPerhaps the best opportunity of the second period came short-handed when Florida’s Colton Sceviour got loose on a breakaway -- only to be stoned by Andersen.\nLuongo and Andersen each had 25 saves headed into the third period.\nFlorida applied the pressure in the third period, but it was Toronto’s Leo Komarov who nearly scored with 2:40 left. His point-blank shot struck the left post.\nWith 1:30 left, Florida pulled Luongo for an extra skater, but the Panthers failed to get the tying goal.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:35:26.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
