None of those interviewed heard the words alleged to have been said by Firmino, the FA added.\n“As part of the investigation, The FA sought the assistance of a Brazilian/Portuguese linguistic specialist on the words alleged,” the FA statement said.\n“In addition to this, we also obtained multiple angles of video footage, including broadcast and unseen footage showing the incident, which was assessed by two independent Portuguese speaking lip-reading experts.”\nLiverpool won the game 2-1.\nReporting by Toby Davis; Editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T18:16:57.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
