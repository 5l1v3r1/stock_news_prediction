Iraq declared victory in December.\nAli said thousands of people had been ostracized by their communities even though they never supported the militants.\n“You have a family of 50, with just one man who joined ISIS, but the whole family, despite reporting that individual, is now stigmatized - and they are scared to return,” he said.\nAli warned that there was also potential for land and property disputes as families return home because so few people have papers to prove ownership.\nHe said ISIS had confiscated people’s identity papers, creating a “massive problem”.\n“There are huge issues with civilian ID - many people have no birth certificates, marriage certificates or property ownership certificates,” Ali said.\n“This means people can’t access assistance from the government and they can’t go back to their houses because they can’t prove ownership.”\nAli said the war had left many women as head of their household, but many were illiterate and did not know how to obtain identity documents to access government help or food aid.\nHuman Appeal and the United Nations refugee agency have opened centers staffed by lawyers to address such problems.\nCHILDREN IN CHARGE The war has also left many households headed by children.\n“You get eight or nine children being looked after by a 14- or 15-year-old boy or girl who is at the complete mercy of whoever has taken control of their guardianship,” Ali said.\nHe said the challenges in Iraq were enormous but aid agencies were “working their socks off” and the government was supportive.\n“Western Mosul is complete and utter devastation, everything is destroyed, everything is rubble,” he added.\n“Hospitals are decimated and lack medicines, and many children have been out of school for three years.”\nAlthough the government has promised people compensation to rebuild homes, Ali said it was “not coming any time soon”.\nDespite the militants’ defeat, he said violence continued in the northern city due to ISIS sleeper cells.\nIraq’s allies promised Baghdad $30 billion this month to recover from the war ahead of elections in May. Baghdad has said it needs $88 billion.\nA report by three major aid groups on Wednesday said that the majority of displaced Iraqis in the western province of Anbar also feared returning home.\nIt found that 84 percent of Iraqis in the Amriyat Al-Fallujah and Bezabize camps reported feeling safer in the camps than in their area of origin.\n“People are afraid of retribution, unexploded bombs, or simply have nowhere to return to,” said Petr Kostohryz, Iraq country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the aid groups behind the report.\nAdditional Reporting by Ana Ionova, Editing by Katy Migiro.
