It is just a compensation requested not by the SPLA-IO but by the families of the deceased and the owners of the properties. All we did as SPLM-IO is just to facilitate the exchange and provide security for the pilots.”\nA South Sudan army spokesman declined to comment. A Kenyan foreign ministry spokesman said they would issue a statement.\nOil-rich South Sudan has been in the throes of civil war since 2013 months after President Salva Kiir fired his then deputy Riek Machar.\nThe conflict has displaced a third of the population, shut down most of the oil production and strangled the economy.\nMachar, who fled to Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 after fierce fighting broke out in Juba, is now being held in South Africa to stop him fomenting trouble, diplomatic and political sources say.\nReporting by Denis Dumo; Additional reporting by George Obulutsa in Nairobi; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T17:55:00.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
