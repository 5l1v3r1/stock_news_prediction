She won with the Canadian women in Sochi in 2014 and he won with the men in Vancouver in 2010, and neither had previously lost in Olympic competition.\nMixed-doubles curling is making its debut as an Olympic event here at the Pyeongchang Games. A faster-paced game than traditional single-sex curling, teams of two - a female and male - complete up to just eight “ends” as opposed to 10, and there is no shot-calling “skip” as in the four-player version.\nCalled the “roaring game” from the rumbling sound the 20kg (44-pound) polished-granite stones make as they slide over the pebbled ice sheet, curling is believed to have its origins on frozen ponds in medieval Scotland.\nCurling – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Mixed Doubles Round Robin Canada v South Korea - Gangneung Curling Center - Gangneung, South Korea – February 11, 2018 - Kaitlyn Lawes of Canada sweeps.
