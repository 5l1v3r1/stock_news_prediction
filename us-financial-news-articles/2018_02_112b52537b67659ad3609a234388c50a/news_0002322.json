Earlier in the year, it had set a total investment cap of 250,000 yuan per person for the fund.\nAnt Financial is the payment affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\nEstablished in 2013, Yu‘e Bao is integrated with Ant Financial’s payment app Alipay.\nThe latest restrictions come as members of the National Institution for Finance and Development (NIFD) called for tighter regulation of money market funds in a commentary published Thursday.\n“Against the current background of risk prevention and deleveraging, not putting money market funds into the framework of macro-prudential management could create space for regulatory arbitrage, may weaken the effectiveness of deleveraging policy and could cause market distortions,” Zeng Gang and Luan Xi of the NIFD’s Banking Research Institute said in the 21st Century Business Herald.\n($1 = 6.2960 Chinese yuan)\nReporting by Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:10:07.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
