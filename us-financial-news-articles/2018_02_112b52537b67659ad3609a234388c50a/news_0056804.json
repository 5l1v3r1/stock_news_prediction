While German government debt yields have risen by 38 basis points since early December, the rise has been slower than in the United States, where yields are up more than 50 bps.\nBenchmark Treasury 10-year note yields US10YT=RR rose to a four-year high of 2.957 percent on Wednesday before falling back to 2.904 percent on Thursday.\nThe prospect of the U.S. government boosting debt issuance to fund expanded stimulus and the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates steadily this year are some of the factors that have contributed to the rise in yields.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies rose 0.2 percent to 89.873 .DXY.\nThe index reached a 10-day high of 90.235 on Thursday, from a three-year trough of 88.253 late last week, before its rally lost a bit of steam. It was on still on track to gain 0.9 percent on the week.\nThe yen showed little reaction to data which showed Japan’s annual core consumer inflation rate was unchanged in January from the previous month, reinforcing views that the Bank of Japan remains far from exiting its super loose monetary policy.\nJapan’s nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 0.9 percent in January. The pace remained far from the BOJ’s 2 percent inflation target.\nThe dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 106.850 yen JPY=EBS .\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in TOKYO\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T04:05:40.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
