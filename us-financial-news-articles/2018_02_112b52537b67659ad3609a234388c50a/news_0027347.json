The MSZ device does not have any direct connection with the vehicle’s mechanics or electronics. Therefore, the device is usable in any moving vehicle regardless of the manufacturer.\nVerify Smart Corporation will incorporate this solution into its existing technologies to prevent or limit cell phone use in the workplace environment depending on user defined levels set by the employer. The product can also be used in schools, hospitals and public areas (e.g. crosswalks, train stations).\nLou Pingitore, CEO of Verify Smart, said, “Imagine how many lives will be saved using the MSZ software. Not to mention the savings realized in insurance premiums and claims as well as hospital and doctor expenses. With the incorporation of MSZ software into Verify Smart’s workplace technologies we expect employers to see a substantial increase in employee productivity, customer service, and improved public safety.”\nSteve Mahar, Founder/Owner of Cbros Technologies, LLC, said, “Cbros Technologies is thrilled to partner with Verify Smart to bring innovative products to market that provide safer travel and workplace environments by eliminating cell phone induced distractions.”\nABOUT VERIFY SMART CORPORATION\nVerify Smart Corp is an international technology company that develops and markets innovative solutions for the global digital market.
