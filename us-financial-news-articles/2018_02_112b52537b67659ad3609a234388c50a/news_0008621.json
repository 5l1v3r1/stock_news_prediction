However, concerns about disruptions to Taiwan’s semiconductor production, a major driver of economic growth, hit shares in the sector with the semiconductor subindex down about 3 percent.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple supplier, has not seen any impact to their facilities or operations after initial assessments on Monday morning, a spokesperson for the company told Reuters.\nA representative for Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co and the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, told Reuters the company had not suffered any damages so far.\nNevertheless, Hon Hai’s stocks were down 2.21 percent, its biggest daily drop since mid-December, while TSMC fell 3.3 percent.\nThe selloff also tracks a wider decline in global markets, which stumbled on Monday as fears of resurgent inflation sparked speculation central banks globally might be forced to tighten more aggressively, toppling shares in the region from recent highs.\nReporting by Jess Macy Yu and Jeanny Kao; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T04:50:59.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
