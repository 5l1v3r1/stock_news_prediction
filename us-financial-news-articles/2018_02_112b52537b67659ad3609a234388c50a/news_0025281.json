If the House acts before daybreak to approve the package from the Senate, there would be no practical interruption in federal government business.\nIf it does not, the result would be an actual shutdown, the second of 2018, after a three-day shutdown in January.\nPaul said during his marathon speech, which strained fellow senators’ patience, that the two-year budget deal would “loot the Treasury.”\nThe bill would raise military and domestic spending by almost $300 billion over the next two years. With no offsets in the form of other spending cuts or new tax revenues, that additional spending would be financed by borrowed money.\nAdditional reporting by Eric Beech, Makini Brice, Katanga Johnson and Doina Chiacu; Writing by Kevin Drawbaugh; Editing by Paul Tait and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:34:10.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
