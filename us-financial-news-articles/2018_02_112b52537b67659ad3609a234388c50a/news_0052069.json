He took a slow lap of the track, with compatriot Chung Jae-won holding the newly crowned champion’s arm aloft.\n”I felt like crying,“ Lee said, before breaking into tears in the mixed zone. ”It was so overwhelming and I’ve always dreamed of this moment of crossing the finish line first here at the Pyeongchang Olympics and in the mass start.\n“I‘m so happy that this became real.”\nHis victory handed Korea a record 15th medal at their home Winter Olympics, one more than the previous record of 14 the country achieved at the Vancouver Winter Games in 2010.\nLee got his tactics spot on in both the final and in his semi-final, which was also held on Saturday.\nIn the earlier race, he broke away to win the second intermediate sprint and claim five points, all but ensuring his progression and allowing him to coast through the rest of the race and save his legs.\nSpeed Skating - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's Mass Start competition finals - Gangneung Oval - Gangneung, South Korea - February 24, 2018 - Seung-Hoon Lee of South Korea, Bart Swings of Belgium and Koen Verweij of the Netherlands in action.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Kramer, a surprise inclusion in the event due to a lack of exposure at the international level, was doing the hard work to give compatriot Verweij a shot at the gold medal but it was Lee who capitalized as Kramer faded.\nThe 29-year-old, who won gold in the 10,000m at the Vancouver Games in 2010, made his move on the second-last corner and stormed down the back straight before holding off both Swings and Verweij for victory.\nHe has no plans to stop just yet.\n“I’ve been doing this because it’s fun,” Lee said. “From now on I would like to set my goal to the Beijing Olympics and keep enjoying what I do.”\nSwings won Belgium’s sixth medal at a Winter Olympics and the country’s first since 1998, when speed skater Bart Veldkamp took bronze in the men’s 5,000m in Nagano.\n”It’s an incredible feeling,“ he said. ”I’ve worked a long time for this. It was the last week so I was nervous.\n“In the final everything came good for me but at 700 meters I couldn’t wait anymore. I had to go for it and one guy was faster than me.”\nEditing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T15:49:03.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
