If the House acts before daybreak to approve the package from the Senate, there would be no practical interruption in federal government business.\nIf it does not, the result would be an actual shutdown, the second of 2018, after a three-day shutdown in January.\nPaul said during his marathon speech, which strained fellow senators' patience, that the two-year budget deal would \"loot the Treasury.\"\nThe bill would raise military and domestic spending by almost $300 billion over the next two years. With no offsets in the form of other spending cuts or new tax revenues, that additional spending would be financed by borrowed money.\nMORE RED INK\nThe budget part of the package was a bipartisan attempt by Senate leaders to end for many months, at least beyond November's midterm congressional elections, the fiscal policy quarrels that increasingly consume Congress.\nBut the deficit spending in the bill would add more red ink to Washington's balance sheet and further underscore a shift in Republican thinking that Paul was trying to draw attention to.\nOnce known as the party of fiscal conservatism, the Republicans and Trump approved a sweeping tax overhaul bill in December that will add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years.\n\"I ran for office because I was very critical of President Obama's trillion-dollar deficits,\" Paul said.\n\"Now we have Republicans hand in hand with Democrats offering us trillion-dollar deficits. I can't ... in good faith, just look the other way because my party is now complicit in the deficits. Really who is to blame? Both parties,\" he said.\nPaul voted for the deficit-financed tax bill in December.\nMARKETS UNEASY\nThe shutdown in Washington came at a sensitive time for financial markets. Stocks plunged on Thursday in New York on heavy volume, throwing off course a nearly nine-year bull run. The S&P 500 slumped 3.8 percent.\nMarkets barely flinched at the last shutdown in January, but that was before a dizzying selloff that started on Jan. 30 amid concerns about inflation and higher interest rates.\nUneasiness in the markets could be partially reduced by another part of the Senate bill, which would extend the federal debt ceiling to March 2019, preventing further confrontations over that volatile issue in Congress for more than a year.\nBut final passage of the bill was still uncertain, with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others in her party opposing it because Republican House leaders will not guarantee her that they will allow a debate later on about taking steps to protect about 700,000 \"Dreamer\" immigrants from deportation.\nThe young people were brought illegally to the country as children years ago, mostly from Mexico.\nTrump said last September he would end by March 5 a program set up by former Democratic President Barack Obama to protect the Dreamers from deportation, and urged Congress to act before then. Senate Republicans have pledged to hold a separate immigration debate this month.\nEven without Pelosi, the House could pass the budget bill because it includes more money for disaster relief, infrastructure and healthcare, which many Democrats favor.\nBut some House Republican conservatives, like Paul, have criticized the bill's deficit spending.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who backs the bill, predicted the Republican-controlled House would pass it. \"I think we will,\" he said in a radio interview. \"It's going to need bipartisan support. We are going to deliver our share of support.\"\n(Additional reporting by Eric Beech, Makini Brice, Katanga Johnson and Doina Chiacu; Writing by Kevin Drawbaugh; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:03:54.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
