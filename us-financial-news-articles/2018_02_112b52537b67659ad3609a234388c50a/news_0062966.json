The company’s US investigation results, Milner said, “comport with the recent indictments” Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller issued against Russian individuals and entities.\nFollowing its Washington hearing, committee chairman Damian Collins MP said his committee expected to finish a report on its inquiry into Social Media and Fake News in late March and that the report is likely to include recommendations for new British laws or regulations regarding social media content.\nThese could include measures to clarify the companies’ legal liability for material they distribute and their obligations to address social problems the companies content could engender, he said.\nReporting By Mark Hosenball; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T22:07:18.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
