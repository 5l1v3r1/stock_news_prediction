The Norwegians, who scored 1,098.5 points in total, were dominant throughout en route to their second ski jumping gold of the Games. Germany finished 22.8 points behind to take silver and Poland claimed the bronze. The Norwegians took a slender lead into the final round, two points ahead of the Germans and five clear of the Poles. The three leaders illustrated the gulf in class to the rest, leap-frogging ahead of each other in a tense final that provided a superb showcase for the sport.

The see-saw battle continued as Andreas Wellinger put Germany back in front before a surprisingly tame jump from World Cup leader and individual large hill gold medallist Kamil Stoch left the Germans ahead of Poland in the race for silver. The stage was set for Johansson, his trademark handlebar moustache visible beneath his goggles, and the 27 year-old, who won bronze in both the normal and large hill individual events, soared through the crisp night air to claim a well-deserved Olympic gold medal.
