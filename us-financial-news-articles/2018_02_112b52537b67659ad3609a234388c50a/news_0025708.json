Sergio Aguero is playing outstanding right now and Lionel Messi is always at the top of his game,” Tapia told Argentine network TYC Sports.\n“That’s vital for the directors and the coaching staff. We have spoken to Messi about taking care of himself and about playing less for Barcelona.”\nTapia also said Argentina are planning to play a friendly against Catalonia in June as part of their preparations for the World Cup in Russia, where they will hope to better their runners-up finish four years ago in Brazil.\nA game against Catalonia could theoretically see Messi come up against Barca team mates Sergio Busquets, Sergi Roberto and Gerard Pique among others. However, such a fixture could prove controversial in Spain after increased tensions between the central government and the region over its independence drive.\n“(Argentina coach) Jorge (Sampaoli) told me it would be good for us from a football point of view and it’s important for us from a financial point of view, but we haven’t closed the deal yet,” added Tapia.\nReporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T14:42:57.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
