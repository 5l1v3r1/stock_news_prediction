The company resubmitted the drug’s marketing application for review in September after appealing against a rejection by the drug regulator in 2016 on concerns of opioid abuse. KemPharm said Apadaz is likely to be scheduled as a C-II product - a drug with a high potential for abuse. The company, prior to rejection by the regulator in 2016, had tried for an abuse-deterrent label for the drug but an advisory committee to the FDA voted against the move. “It’s a product that has differentiation, but not the traditional abuse-deterrent claims,” KemPharm’s Chief Executive Officer Travis Mickle told Reuters. Mickle said the company would try new ways to sell the drug without an abuse-deterrent label. The company, which expects to produce close to 5 billion tablets a year, said it would try to establish either a non-traditional pact with a pharmacy benefit manager or a tie-up with a generic pharmaceutical company. “We are in active discussions on both approaches,” Chief Operating Officer Gordon Johnson said on a conference call. KemPharm is planning to price Apadaz close to low-cost generic products as many drugmakers such as Egalet Corp and Collegium Pharmaceuticals have opioid-based branded drugs with an abuse-deterrent label. “The generics are cheap and people are going to continue using them over some sort of branded molecule that’s going to cost a lot more,” Oppenheimer analyst Derek Archila told Reuters. The company shares touched a more than 18-month high at $7.15 and were trading up about 15 percent at $6.
