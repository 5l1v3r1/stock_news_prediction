Catastrophe losses, where applicable, include the impact of accelerated earned catastrophe premiums and earned reinstatement premiums. Net incurred losses attributable to prior years is defined as incurred losses attributable to prior years (including prior year losses related to catastrophes and prior year catastrophe reinstatement premium) including earned premium attributable to prior years. Re-estimation of the current accident year loss reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The combined ratio, expressed as a percentage, is a measure of underwriting profitability. This measure should only be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, underwriting income and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company's competitors. The combined ratio is computed as the sum of the following property and casualty ratios: the ratio of claims and claim adjustment expense less managed care income to earned premium; the ratio of insurance operating costs plus amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs less third-party administration income and fee income (primarily related to the Company's involuntary market servicing carrier operations) and installment charges to earned premium; and the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium. Provisions for uncollectible premium and reinsurance are not included in the combined ratio unless related to an asbestos and environmental commutation and certain other run off. Restructuring and Ironshore acquisition and integration costs are not included in the combined ratio.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/liberty-mutual-insurance-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300604524.html\nSOURCE Liberty Mutual Insurance", "external_links": ["https://attglobal.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1180708&tp_key=c4ce09ddfc", "http://www.libertymutualgroup.com/investors", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/liberty-mutual-insurance-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300604524.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T04:10:27.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
