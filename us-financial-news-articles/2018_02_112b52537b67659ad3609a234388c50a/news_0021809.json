Holderness told the Daily Mail she shared photos of her injuries with the FBI. \nIn the Daily Mail's first story Tuesday, Porter's boss, White House chief of staff John Kelly, strongly defended him. \nPorter, whom the newspaper says is dating White House communications chief Hope Hicks, will stay with the White House for the moment to help oversee a transition period, according to press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders . Porter's job responsibilities included vetting documents and other information that Trump sees. \n\"I don't know,\" Sanders told reporters Wednesday when asked whether Trump had concerns about Porter's alleged conduct and the photos of his bruised ex-wife. \nA Business Insider article in September called Porter \"a little-known White House aide who has avoided getting caught up in any of the West Wing drama that has plagued the administration for the better part of seven months.\" \nA former aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Porter went to Harvard University with Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior advisor to Trump. \n\"It's incredibly discouraging to see such a vile attack on such a decent man,\" Hatch told the Washington Post on Tuesday . \n\"Shame on any publication that would print this â€” and shame on the politically motivated, morally bankrupt character assassins that would attempt to sully a man's good name,\" Hatch said. \nHowever, Hatch sharply changed his tune after Porter announced his resignation Wednesday. In a tweeted statement, Hatch said he was \"heartbroken by the allegations\" against Porter. \nPorter's resignation makes him the last of five Trump aides seen together in an iconic, \"Reservoir Dogs\"-like photo to leave his administration or presidential campaign before they would have preferred. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski (C) says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors Sebastian Gorka (from L), Omarosa Manigault and Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, and staff secretary Rob Porter accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Struthers, Ohio, U.S., July 25, 2017. \nThe others were former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, former security advisor Sebastian Gorka, \"Apprentice\" villain and former communications director for the White House public liaison Omarosa Manigault Newman, and Anthony Scarumucci, the foul-mouthed financier who had a short-lived tenure as White House communications director. \n\"These outrageous allegations are simply false. I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described. I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign.\" \n\"My commitment to public service speaks for itself,\" Porter said. \"I have always put duty to country first and treated others with respect. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have served in the Trump Administration and will seek to ensure a smooth transition when I leave the White House.\" \nIn her own prepared statement, Sanders said the White House, as a matter of policy, does not comment on staffers' security clearances. \n\"Rob Porter has been effective in his role as staff secretary. The president and chief of staff have full confidence in his abilities and his performance,\" Sanders said. \nBefore Porter resigned, Kelly told the Daily Mail that Porter \"is a man of true integrity and honor and I can't say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him.\" \nIn an October press briefing, Kelly lamented that, in his view, women were no longer held to be \"sacred\" in the U.S. \n\"You know, when I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country. Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor,\" he said then. \"That's obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:19:54.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
