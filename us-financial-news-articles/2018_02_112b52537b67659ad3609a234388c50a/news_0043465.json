Of the 430 open, many are offering only limited menu choices, according to the BBC. \nThe issue is thought to be costing the fast food chain £1 million ($1.4 million) a day. \nIn a light-hearted statement on its website informing customers of the issue on Saturday, KFC joked: “The chicken crossed the road, just not to our restaurants.” \nIn the statement, the fast food giant added that DHL had “had a couple of teething problems — getting fresh chicken out to 900 restaurants across the country is pretty complex!” The Colonel is working on it. pic.twitter.com/VvvnDLvlyq \n— KFC UK & Ireland (@KFC_UKI) February 17, 2018 \nThe chain also thanked its U.K. staff “working flat out to get us back up and running again.” The website now has a dedicated page that updates the list of open restaurants in the U.K. \nKFC’s chicken deliveries were up until Feb. 13 managed by Bidvest, a specialist food distribution group. \nU.K. customers have taken to social media to vent their frustrations, with one Twitter user writing: “How can you be out of the one thing you are known for selling?” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AurieStyla/status/965622079545540608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesun.co.uk%2Fmoney%2F5616751%2Fkfc-chicken-shops-shut-memes-twitter%2F", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43124259", "https://www.kfc.co.uk/crossed-the-road", "https://t.co/VvvnDLvlyq", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/KFC_UKI/status/964838797841190912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-02-20T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T18:58:34.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
