(NASDAQ:FLIR) announced today that it has completed the sale of its Canadian security products subsidiary Lorex, Inc. in a transaction that also included its Toronto-headquartered small and medium-sized (SMB) security products business. Together, these businesses generated $140 million of revenue in 2017, focusing on visible spectrum security systems that are sold globally to consumers and SMBs through various distribution channels. Under the terms of the transaction, FLIR will receive approximately $29 million in cash and expects to record a GAAP non-cash charge of approximately $23.6 million related to the divestiture.\n“This divestiture will focus our Security business on critical infrastructure and enterprise segments of the broader security market, which are attractive customer bases for our differentiating technologies,” said Jim Cannon, President and CEO of FLIR. “As we assessed our position and opportunities in the security and surveillance space, we determined that this business no longer fits our strategy to build intelligent, turn-key security solutions that are based on multiple wavelengths.”\nAbout FLIR Systems\nFounded in 1978 and headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon, FLIR Systems is a world-leading maker of sensor systems that enhance perception and heighten awareness, helping to save lives, improve productivity, and protect the environment. Through its nearly 3,500 employees, FLIR’s vision is to be “The World’s Sixth Sense” by leveraging thermal imaging and adjacent technologies to provide innovative, intelligent solutions for security and surveillance, environmental and condition monitoring, outdoor recreation, machine vision, navigation, and advanced threat detection.
