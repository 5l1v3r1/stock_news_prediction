The full-year revenue growth resulted primarily from the success of the company’s pricing strategy and international licensing program, as well as an increase in the number of guests visiting Six Flags parks. Attendance at Six Flags properties in 2017 grew by 1 percent or 0.3 million to 30.4 million guests, driven by the opening of two new waterparks and the continued success of selling season passes and memberships, whose holders accounted for 63 percent of total visitation.\nNet income for the year increased by $156 million or 131 percent, driven by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense, an upward adjustment of $85 million as a result of tax reform, and continued operating earnings growth. Diluted earnings per share for 2017 was $3.09, representing an increase of $1.84 or 147 percent compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA 1 for the full year grew to a new high of $519 million, up $13 million or 2 percent over the prior year, while Modified EBITDA 2 for the year was $558 million. Six Flags 2017 Modified EBITDA margin of 41.1 percent continues to lead the industry.\n“I am very proud that we have achieved our eighth consecutive year of record performance in the face of unprecedented natural events,” said Jim Reid-Anderson, Chairman, President and CEO. “With our growing Active Pass Base, ongoing price increases, higher penetration of culinary programs, and new international licensing agreements and waterparks, we are very well-positioned to deliver another record year in 2018. We are laser-focused on overachieving $600 million of Modified EBITDA in 2018 and continue to work toward our long-term aspirational goal of $750 million of Modified EBITDA by 2020.”\nFourth quarter 2017 revenue grew $17 million or 7 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016 to a new record of $257 million. The strong revenue growth was primarily driven by a $9 million increase in international licensing revenue and a 7 percent increase in guest spending per capita. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $98 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $87 million represented an increase of $12 million or 16 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe company’s Active Pass Base, which represents the total number of guests who have purchased a season pass or who are enrolled in the company’s membership program, increased 10 percent to a new all-time high as of December 31, 2017. Increasing season pass and membership penetration is a key tenet of the company’s growth strategy, providing a recurring revenue stream and a platform to further grow attendance as the company expands its network of parks. Season pass holders and members are the company’s most valuable guests, generating more than double the revenue and cash flow of a single-day guest over the course of a season. They are also the company’s most loyal guests, serving as an excellent hedge against inclement weather throughout the season.\nDeferred revenue increased by $18 million or 15 percent over prior year to $142 million as of December 31, 2017, primarily due to a higher level of season pass, membership and all season dining pass sales for the 2018 season.\nTotal guest spending per capita in 2017 was $41.61, an increase of $0.54 or 1 percent compared to 2016, as ticket price gains were partially offset by lower in-park spending per capita. Admissions revenue per capita increased $0.61 to $24.37 and in-park spending per capita decreased $0.07 to $17.24. For the fourth quarter of 2017, guest spending per capita was $37.90, an increase of $2.51 or 7 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by both higher realized ticket prices and higher in-park spending.\nIn 2017, the company generated $275 million of Adjusted Free Cash Flow 3 after investing $135 million in new capital projects, net of insurance proceeds. Capital expenditures included the remaining half of the incremental $18 million investment into the company’s new waterpark in Oaxtepec, Mexico. The company also paid $227 million in dividends, or $2.62 per common share for the year, and repurchased $499 million or 8.4 million shares of its common stock, leaving 84.5 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The authorized share repurchase amount available as of December 31, 2017, was $343 million.\nNet Debt 4 as of December 31, 2017, calculated as total reported debt of $2.02 billion less cash and cash equivalents of $77 million, was $1.94 billion, representing a net leverage ratio of 3.7 times Adjusted EBITDA.\nConference Call\nAt 8:00 a.m. Central Time today, February 20, 2018, the company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial performance.

In our press release, we make reference to non-GAAP financial measures including Modified EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. The definition for each of these non-GAAP financial measures is set forth below in the notes to the reconciliation tables. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide important and useful information for investors to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies in our industry. We use these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes, to evaluate ongoing operations and our performance generally, and in our annual and long-term incentive plans. By providing these measures, we provide our investors with the ability to review our performance in the same manner as our management.\nHowever, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, they are susceptible to varying calculations, and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures as presented may not be directly comparable to a similarly titled non-GAAP financial measure presented by another company. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented as supplemental information and not as alternatives to any GAAP financial measures. When reviewing a non-GAAP financial measure, we encourage our investors to fully review and consider the related reconciliation as detailed below.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended (Amounts in thousands) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net income $ 98,013 $ 1,868 $ 313,026 $ 156,727 Income tax (benefit) expense (81,102 ) 3,689 16,026 76,539 Other expense (income), net 231 (325 ) 271 1,684 Loss on debt extinguishment 7 558 37,116 2,935 Interest expense, net 25,132 21,058 99,010 81,872 (Gain) loss on disposal of assets (378 ) 1,055 3,959 1,968 Amortization 595 649 2,465 2,603 Depreciation 28,430 26,899 109,206 104,290 Stock-based compensation 16,358 20,095 (22,697 ) 116,339 Impact of Fresh Start valuation adjustments (2) 11 23 40 89 Modified EBITDA (3) 87,297 75,569 558,422 545,046 Third party interest in EBITDA of certain operations (4) — — (39,210 ) (38,425 ) Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 87,297 $ 75,569 $ 519,212 $ 506,621 Weighted-average common shares outstanding — basic: 84,209 91,785 86,802 92,349 SIX FLAGS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended (Amounts in thousands) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 65,411 $ 88,481 $ 445,067 $ 463,235 Changes in working capital (2,716 ) (35,814 ) 4,470 (11,147 ) Interest expense, net 25,132 21,058 99,010 81,872 Income tax (benefit) expense (81,102 ) 3,689 16,026 76,539 Amortization of debt issuance costs (960 ) (1,172 ) (4,061 ) (4,503 ) Other (income) expense, net (4,999 ) 2,457 (2,645 ) 2,660 Interest accretion on notes payable (333 ) (91 ) (1,056 ) (413 ) Changes in deferred income taxes 86,853 (3,062 ) 1,571 (63,286 ) Impact of Fresh Start valuation adjustments (2) 11 23 40 89 Third party interest in EBITDA of certain operations (4) — — (39,210 ) (38,425 ) Capital expenditures, net of property insurance recoveries (18,148 ) (28,024 ) (134,696 ) (128,938 ) Cash paid for interest, net (18,613 ) (5,414 ) (95,289 ) (68,815 ) Cash taxes (5) (3,294 ) (3,267 ) (14,473 ) (17,267 ) Adjusted Free Cash Flow (6) $ 47,242 $ 38,864 $ 274,754 $ 291,601 Weighted-average common shares outstanding — basic: 84,209 91,785 86,802 92,349 (1) Revenues and expenses of international operations are converted into U.S. dollars on an average basis as provided by GAAP. (2) Amounts recorded as valuation adjustments and included in reorganization items for the month of April 2010 that would have been included in Modified EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, had fresh start accounting not been applied. Balance consists primarily of discounted insurance reserves that will be accreted through the statement of operations each quarter through 2018. (3) “Modified EBITDA”, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as our consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations: excluding the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, discontinued operations gains or losses, income tax expense or benefit, restructure costs or recoveries, reorganization items (net), other income or expense, gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, equity in income or loss of investees, interest expense (net), gain or loss on disposal of assets, gain or loss on the sale of investees, amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation, and fresh start accounting valuation adjustments. Modified EBITDA as defined herein may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Management uses non-GAAP measures for budgeting purposes, measuring actual results, allocating resources and in determining employee incentive compensation. We believe that Modified EBITDA provides relevant and useful information for investors because it assists in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis, makes it easier to compare our results with those of other companies in our industry as it most closely ties our performance to that of our competitors from a park level perspective and allows investors to review performance in the same manner as our management. “Adjusted EBITDA”, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Modified EBITDA minus the interests of third parties in the Adjusted EBITDA of properties that are less than wholly owned (consisting of Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags White Water Atlanta and Six Flags Over Texas). Adjusted EBITDA is approximately equal to “Parent Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” as defined in our secured credit agreement, except that Parent Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA excludes Adjusted EBITDA from equity investees that is not distributed to us in cash on a net basis and has limitations on the amounts of certain expenses that are excluded from the calculation. Adjusted EBITDA as defined herein may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Our board of directors and management use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance and our current management incentive compensation plans are based largely on Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by all our sell-side analysts and most investors as their primary measure of our performance in the evaluation of companies in our industry. In addition, the instruments governing our indebtedness use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with certain covenants and, in certain circumstances, our ability to make certain borrowings. Adjusted EBITDA, as computed by us, may not be comparable to similar metrics used by other companies in our industry. (4) Represents interests of third parties in the Adjusted EBITDA of Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags White Water Atlanta. (5) Based on our current federal net operating loss carryforwards, we believe we will continue to pay minimal amounts for cash taxes for the next two years. Cash taxes paid represents statutory taxes paid, primarily driven by Mexico and state level obligations. (6) Management uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, in its financial and operational decision making processes, for internal reporting, and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes as it provides additional transparency of our operations. Management believes that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful information to investors regarding the amount of cash that we estimate that we will generate from operations over a certain period. Management believes the presentation of this measure will enhance the investors' ability to analyze trends in the business and evaluate the Company's underlying performance relative to other companies in the industry. A reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow is presented in the table above. Adjusted Free Cash Flow as presented herein may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220005512/en/\nSix Flags Entertainment Corporation\nStephen Purtell\nSenior Vice President\nInvestor Relations and Treasurer\n+1-972-595-5180\nspurtell@sftp.com\nSource: Six Flags Entertainment Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220005512/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51760987&newsitemid=20180220005512&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=2&md5=4f67a165bca52bf64b414414c5d7ef21", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sixflags.com&esheet=51760987&newsitemid=20180220005512&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sixflags.com&index=1&md5=383a16dcabcfd6d4ff10483655995a21"], "published": "2018-02-20T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T18:05:20.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
