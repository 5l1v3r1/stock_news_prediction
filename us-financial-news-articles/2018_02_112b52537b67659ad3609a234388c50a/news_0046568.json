Everything will be evaluated,” he said, adding that President Joko Widodo had requested the action.\nWhen Widodo came to power in 2014 he outlined a need for $450 billion investment in infrastructure by 2019 to help cut high logistics costs holding back Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.\nUnder the drive, a series of projects ranging from a subway in traffic-clogged Jakarta to seven new airports and thousands of kilometers of roads are being built, often by state-owned enterprises.\n“We hope with such supervision, any negligence, errors in erecting such components that support the constructions are fully supervised one by one,” Widodo said on Tuesday.\nA man stands near a collapsed girder pole on the construction site of the Bekasi-Cawang toll overpass in Jakarta, Indonesia February 20, 2018 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/Aprillio Akbar/ via REUTERS There have been 14 accidents in the past six months, Hadimuljono said.\nIn the latest, a girder collapsed at a toll-road construction site in Jakarta on Tuesday injuring seven workers, media reported.\nThis month, a crane collapsed at an elevated railway project in another part of Jakarta, killing four people and injuring five.\nArie Setiadi Moerwanto, a director general at the ministry, said “a lot” of infrastructure would be suspended although he said it should not disrupt government infrastructure development targets.\nMoerwanto said the length of suspensions would depend on the result of evaluations, but it could range up to a month.\nThe opposition Gerindra party criticized Widodo’s infrastructure push, likening it to forced-labor in colonial times.\n“People’s lives are not being respected because what is most important is that the project must be completed on time. If in colonial times, workers were slow, they were whipped. In today’s era, slow workers are fired,” Gerindra said on Twitter.\n“Gerindra urges workers working on these projects to be careful so they don’t become the next victims. And the public using these infrastructure projects should also be careful.”\nReporting by Cindy Silviana and Maikel Jefriando; Additional reporting Kanupriya Kapoor; Writing by Fransiska Nangoy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:15:38.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
