The implied volatility, an options-based measure of how much the securities are expected to move in the future, slumped sharply on Tuesday.\n“I think they caught anybody holding these things, in particular options holders, completely flat-footed,” said Lincoln Edwards, principal at Austin-based Houndstooth Capital Management.\nOn Wednesday, the 30-day implied volatility on SVXY was at 42.47 down from 75 percent on Monday, before the change to the fund’s investment approach.\nSVXY and UVXY options will not be adjusted for the ProShares fund changes, equity derivatives clearing organization, the OCC, said in a memo on Tuesday.\n“If you were long options on SVXY or UVXY, you lost money,” said Chintawongvanich.\nThe sharp losses also raised questions about the advisability of trading in options on these products, market participants said.\n“We were not holding options on these things two days ago and that’s purely a miracle, because we trade them routinely,” said Houndstooth’s Edwards.\n“It makes the options on these things borderline untradable,” he said.\nIt is likely that retail players took the worst hit, said Stuart John Barton, portfolio manager at Invest In Vol, a volatility-focused registered investment advisor in Stamford, Connecticut.\n“I think retail players are generally long options. It’s the long options positions that got hurt,” he said.\nReporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Daniel Bases and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T23:30:00.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
