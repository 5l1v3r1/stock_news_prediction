In fact, call them “portraits”, not badges.\nThat is some of the advice Kim Young-soo, a professor at Sogang University in Seoul, gave staff at the hotel.\n“The two Koreas may have the same ethnic background, but have gone totally separate ways for such a long time without barely any interaction, so there can be misunderstandings over trivial things,” he told Reuters.\nA separate one-page cheat sheet provided by Inje Speedium to its staff points out that North Koreans don’t use English words like shampoo and conditioner, which are used in the South.\nThe North also has words for food and everyday necessities that sound completely different to those used in the South.\nThe sheet included word comparisons for commonly used goods and services, a hotel official said. For example, vegetable is called “chaeso” in the South and “namsae” in the North.\n“Our training, which included the lecture as well as our one-page guidelines, was aimed at preventing any potential conflicts that could arise from cultural differences,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nLOST IN TRANSLATION Ahead of the Games, which formally opened on Friday, South Korea’s government distributed guidelines to organisers, listing do’s and don‘t’s when they meet North Koreans, an official at the Pyeongchang organizing committee told Reuters.\nNorth and South Korea speak the same language based on the Hangeul alphabet, but differences have emerged since the 1950-53 conflict which left the two sides at a technical state of war.\nThe differences are particularly challenging for women ice hockey players from the two Koreas who were asked just a few weeks ago to compete as one nation, the Canadian head coach of the joint team, Sarah Murray, told a news conference on Sunday.\nThere are “three” languages in one team, she said, referring to English, South Korean and North Korean. South Koreans frequently used English words not understood by the northerners.\n“For our team meetings it is going through to English to South Korean to North Korean. So the meetings take three times as long,” Murray said.\nThe team has compiled its own “dictionary” of different ice hockey terms to better communicate with each other, she said.\nChoi Bok-mu, a fitness club manager at the Olympics athletes village in Gangneung, said he had not experienced any problems communicating with North Korean athletes, despite them speaking in a markedly different accent.\n“Is it really that different from speaking to someone from another region in South Korea? I don’t think so,” said Choi, a volunteer who normally works as a fire station official.\nChoi and other volunteer helpers at the Games were urged to avoid the topic that another Olympics guest, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, has been eager to address in his public remarks ahead of the opening ceremony: North Korea’s arms programme.\n“We’ve been told not to talk about nukes or missiles before we came here,” Choi said.\nAdditional reporting by Hyonhee Shin in SEOUL; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T08:23:52.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
