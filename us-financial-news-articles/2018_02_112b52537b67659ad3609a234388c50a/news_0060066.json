Among its recent divestments are a Sydney office tower and two plots of land in Hong Kong.\nGROWING BILL State-run CNAF supplies fuel at about 215 airports in China, and 46 airports globally.\nThe fuel supplier became acutely of HNA’s problems in late September when HNA’s liquidity problems “started to erupt”, said one of the executives.\nThe sources estimated HNA’s outstanding bill to CNAF now amounted to about 3 billion yuan. That represented about four months worth of total billing to the group, one of the sources added.\nCNAF has responded by setting up a task force to explore repayment options, the two executives said.\n“CNAF has initiated many exchanges with HNA, verbally and in writing, but that has been barely fruitful,” the executive said.\nSolutions proposed by the fuel supplier have included swapping the debt for a stake in Meilan Haikou Airport, which is controlled by HNA, the first executive said.\nCNAF has continued to supply fuel to HNA airlines, concerned about the impact of suspending sales for airlines that make hundreds of international and domestic flights every day.\n“(Ironically) it’s now CNAF’s social responsibility to keep its flights running, because if fuel is suspended, passengers will be hurt and then it becomes a social problem,” said the first executive.\nChina’s central government state assets regulator and the Civil Aviation Administration have been briefed on the matter, but neither has given clear guidance over how to sort out the situation, the executives said.\nThe two bodies did not immediately responded to requests for comment.\nA CNAF spokesperson, contacted by Reuters, acknowledged the company has amassed a “sizeable” outstanding bill since the second half of last year, but declined to elaborate.\n“Communications with HNA are under way,” the spokesperson said. “It’s hard to predict results, but we’re hoping for a solution.”\nReporting by Aizhu Chen and Matthew Miller in BEIJING; Editing by Lincoln Feast\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T10:53:48.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
