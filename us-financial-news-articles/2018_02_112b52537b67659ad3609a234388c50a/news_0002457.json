As he watched the Republican National Convention and scanned intelligence reports and news stories, he made clear how he felt about his new target: “f-ck the cheating motherf—ing Russians,” he texted in late July. “Bastards. I hate them.” \n“I think they’re probably the worst,” texted Strzok, who had spent years tracking Russian spies and was familiar with their tactics. “F—ing conniving cheating savages. At statecraft, athletics, you name it. I’m glad I’m on Team USA.” \nTrump Today: President Trump rips FBI as biased before declassifying Nunes memo \nThe messages were sent to FBI lawyer Lisa Page, one of thousands turned over by the Justice Department to Congress on Jan. 19 as part of an internal inquiry into how the Federal Bureau of Investigation handled its investigation into Clinton. Strzok and Page, who were in an extramarital affair at the time, have been accused of bias against President Donald Trump after some previously released emails showed their disdain for the president. Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview last month that he interpreted Strzok’s messages to Page as ‘treason.’ Strzok’s attorney said at the time the president’s accusation was ‘beyond reckless.’ \nIn the texts, provided to Congress and reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, the pair’s distaste for Trump re-emerges. After the 2016 election, Strzok wrote, “OMG I am so depressed.” Page replied, “I don’t know if I can eat. I am very nauseous.” \nRepublicans have said the FBI’s handling of the Clinton probe and the Russia investigation, as well as the criticism of Trump in the couple’s exchanges, indicate bias against the president and have suggested a conspiracy to undermine him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T19:30:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
