But, having received Santander’s offer, it decided to spare Popular’s senior creditors. \nQuinn Emanuel, which has challenged the SRB’s decision in the European Union’s General Court, is now considering further steps to obtain the redacted parts of the SRB documents. \nThe law firm is representing bondholders including asset manager Pimco and hedge funds Anchorage Capital Group, Algebris Investments and Cairn Capital.
