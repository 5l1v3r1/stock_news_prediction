Mehmet Altan, an economics professor and journalist, and his journalist brother Ahmet, were charged with giving coded messages in a television talk show a day before the abortive July 15 military coup. Nazli Ilicak, another veteran journalist, was also handed life imprisonment.\nThree other defendants were also sentenced to life for trying to abolish the constitution and overthrow the government.
