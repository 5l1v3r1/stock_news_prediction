Two years later at the Rio Olympics they added to it.\nTheir efforts this time, though, are for a different project.\n“We are knitting a blanket for our president’s child,” Koskinen said. “Everyone is knitting a little square, and then we will join them together... I got a bit carried away, so... a rectangle,” he laughed, holding it up.\nAnother to have got carried away was 20-year-old ski jumper Eetu Nousiainen, who worked away at a long strip of scarf.\n“Maybe mine can be for the president’s dog,” he chuckled.
