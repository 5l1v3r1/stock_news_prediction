But Brottes said he would be in favour of changing RTE’s ITO status to be able to take part in any EU-wide power grid consolidation.\n“I personally think we should get out of it,” he said.\nBrottes, who met energy sector reporters, said that he agreed that not much could happen in terms of major grid operator consolidation in Europe as long as a key player like RTE remains an ITO.\n“We can only court other ITOs, we cannot try to seduce other companies,” he said.\nBrottes said the European grid industry is consolidating right now and that therefore RTE needs to reconsider its business model.\nIn 2016, RTE had prepared a bid for Greek grid operator ADMIE, one of the few other European grid operators with the ITO status, but it was outbid by the State Grid Corporation of China of China Corporation (SGCC), which paid 320 million euros for a 24 percent stake. SGCC also bought stakes in grid operators in Portugal and Italy in recent years.\n“The Chinese are already in Portugal and Italy, and in Germany they are negotiating now. ... The Chinese want to buy everything that is for sale,” Brottes said.\nBrottes said its status as a regulated company charging state-set tariffs also made it harder to bid for foreign peers.\n“We are not an investment fund, we cannot put a bag of dollars on the table, our regulator would challenge that,” he said.
