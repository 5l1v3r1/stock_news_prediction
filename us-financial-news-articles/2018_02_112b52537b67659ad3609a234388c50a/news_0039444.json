It’s been a very special night,” Bailey told Reuters after the show. “The company has got such incredible things ahead and I‘m excited now to be able to watch Burberry continue to flourish and fly.”\nModel Cara Delevingne displays a creation during the Burberry show at London Fashion Week, in London, Britain February 17, 2018. REUTERS/Paul Hackett Bailey is stepping down from Burberry’s board at the end of March and will lend support to the brand’s management until the end of 2018. He said he would be spending time out with his family but was also open to other moves.\n“I‘m just speaking to lots of people, there’s lots of fun exciting projects out there. So we’ll see, I‘m not in any rush at all,” Bailey said.\nSlideshow (5 Images) British model and actress Cara Delevingne, one of the faces of Burberry campaigns, closed the runway show in a flowing striped rainbow cape.\nModel Kate Moss and actresses Keira Knightley and Naomi Watts were also among celebrities hogging the front row for Bailey’s swansong.\nAngela Ahrendts, who was Burberry chief executive between 2006 and 2014 and is now a senior executive at Apple, said she had been “honored” to work with Bailey, and returning to see his final show had been a “bitter-sweet” experience.\n“He is one of the greatest visionaries in the world,” Ahrendts said, wearing a white Burberry shirt with a safety pin neck fastening.\nBailey’s replacement has yet to be announced. Burberry is in the midst of a strategy overhaul under CEO Marco Gobbetti aimed at taking the brand more upmarket.\nReporting by Sarah White and Paul Sandle; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T00:03:15.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
