(Tomorrow) the weather forecast is a little bit colder than today, so safety first.” \nLoch, who also won a relay gold in Sochi, had expected his main threats to come from Austrian wunderkind Wolfgang Kindl, or Russians Roman Repilov and Semen Pavlichenko. \nInstead it was the unheralded Gleirscher, a 23-year-old police officer, making a big early statement before a couple of minor bumps knocked him off pace in his second run. \n“It was absolutely a top feeling (to lead),” the burly Austrian laughed. \n“The first run is great for the confidence, with such great speed. I hope I bring that back tomorrow.” \nRepilov will return in the bronze-medal position with American surprise package Chris Mazdzer only 0.001 seconds off the podium positions. \nWorld champion Kindl was ninth after a disappointing night, while Pavlichenko lies nearly a second off the pace in 17th, his medal hopes appearing all but shot. \nWith a bone-chilling wind blowing through the venue, a raft of lugers came to grief in the session, including Ukraine’s Andriy Mandziy, who finished the last of the 40 sledders after flying off his sled at the track’s perilous turn nine. \nAs part of a format change, the field will be shaved down to the fastest 20 for the fourth and final run on Sunday.
