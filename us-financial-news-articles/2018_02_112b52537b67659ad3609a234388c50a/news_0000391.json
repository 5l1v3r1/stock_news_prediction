Kaidanow holds that role with the title principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. \nThe U.S. exported $49.5 billion of aerospace and defence products to Asia-Pacific in 2016, compared to European demand of $49.8 billion, according to U.S. Department of Commerce data. \nThe official said of the “Buy America” initiative, “I would expect with all of the energy the U.S. government is putting behind this, as well as all of the energy the companies are putting behind this, that I would hope to see very good numbers” for foreign military sales. \nThe State Department said in a statement that Kaidanow “will hold consultations on defence trade issues and promote more than 150 U.S. companies and trade organizations exhibiting the latest aerospace technologies.” \nDemand for U.S.-made arms is high and foreign military sales in fiscal 2017, comprising the final months of Obama’s term and much of Trump’s first year in office, climbed to $42 billion, compared to $31 billion in the prior year, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency. \nRemy Nathan, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association aid, “The Asia-Pacific region was our industry’s largest regional export destination for several years before Europe overtook it in 2016.” Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington; Editing by Cynthia Osterman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T03:34:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
