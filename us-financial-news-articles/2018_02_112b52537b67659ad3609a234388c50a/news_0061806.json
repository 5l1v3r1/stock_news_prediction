There are no penalties for false accusations.\nAsia Bibi’s case drew international attention after the murder of two politicians who tried to intervene on her behalf.\nAt the Rome gathering, her husband Ashiq Masih said his wife was innocent of blasphemy. “This is just hate against Christians, who are considered impure,” he said.\nThe husband and daughter, who broke down in tears as she addressed the group, were earlier received by Pope Francis, who told her: “I think often of your mother and I pray for her”.\nEuropean Parliament President Antonio Tajani, who has been tipped as a possible Italian prime minister after next week’s election, said that persecution of Christians was “a genocide”.\n“A message must be sent from this place. It is the duty of Europe to defend these values (of religious liberty) wherever on earth they are trampled on,” Tajani said.\nRebecca Bitrus, a Nigerian Christian woman who was held for two years after she was abducted by Boko Haram Islamist militants, told of how she was repeatedly beaten and raped.\nDuring the event, organised by the Catholic group “Aid to the Church in Need,” there were live link-ups with Aleppo, Syria and Mosul, Iraq, both of whose minority Christian populations have been hit hard by wars.\nReporting by Philip Pullella; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T21:39:46.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
