The green light followed decades of government indecision, but airlines including British Airways want the cost of a new runway to be minimized to keep a lid on their fares.\nBritish Airways is Heathrow’s biggest airline customer, accounting for more than 50 percent of its take-off and landing slots, and IAG has previously said it would look to expand elsewhere if a new runway at Heathrow resulted in higher fees.\nA 10-week public consultation on Heathrow’s expansion is under way, allowing for views on a plan that has generated fierce debate over both its cost and the impact on air quality and noise levels in the local community.\nIAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh said in a statement on Monday that the government should ensure the CAA is able to introduce competition to the running of the airport.\n“Most major U.S. airports have terminals owned or leased by airlines and there are European examples at Frankfurt and Munich airports. There’s absolutely no reason why this cannot happen at Heathrow,” he said.\nHeathrow dismissed the idea.\n“Anyone who has had the misfortune of connecting through JFK airport will know this is not a passenger experience we should seek to replicate at Heathrow,” the airport said.\nIAG leases terminal 7 at New York’s JFK airport while at Germany’s Munich airport, Terminal 2 is operated jointly by the airport operator and Lufthansa. Lufthansa also owns an 8.4 percent stake in Fraport, which operates its main hub in Frankfurt.\nHeathrow has pledged to keep down costs during the expansion and said it had identified options to deliver the new airport for 2.5 billion pounds less than previous plans, including an option for a shorter runway.\nHeathrow Airport Holdings owns and runs all terminals at the airport. The company is in turn owned by Ferrovial, Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corporation among other shareholders.\n($1 = 0.7093 pounds)\nReporting by Sarah Young; Additional reporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Stephen Addison and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:04:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
