Slideshow (5 Images) \nLevinsohn took an unpaid leave of absence last month following disclosure of sexual harassment allegations against him while he worked at other companies. Tronc said an independent investigation did not find any wrongdoing. \nSoon-Shiong, a major shareholder in Tronc and chief executive of NantHealth Inc ( NH.O ), will buy the publications through his private investment vehicle Nant Capital LLC. \nNant Capital will also assume $90 million in pension liabilities as part of the deal, which is expected to close in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2018. \nThe divested publications brought in about $470 million in net revenue for the twelve-month period ended Sept. 30, 2017. \nIn a separate statement, Tronc said it acquired a majority ownership stake in BestReviews, an online product review company based in San Francisco. \nThe Times, acquired by Tronc’s predecessor Tribune Co in 2000, has undergone several management changes and rounds of layoffs, reflecting a struggle by newspapers in general to adapt to digital media.
