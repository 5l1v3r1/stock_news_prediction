REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo \nThe IOC has banned Russia from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics starting later this week over “systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system in Sochi but 169 athletes with no history of doping have been invited to compete as neutrals. \nOswald said CAS arbitrators had applied criminal standards of proof that made it far more complicated to prove wrongdoing. The IOC is considering whether to appeal the CAS decision at the Swiss Federal Tribunal. \n“They applied criminal standards where the first doubt you have does not allow you to sanction,” he said. \nAfter the CAS decision, Russia’s Olympic Committee requested that 13 active athletes and two who had become coaches should be allowed to participate in the Feb. 9-25 Games but the IOC has refused to extend invitations to them.
