The real strategic winner, however, is the South Korean government, which has shrewdly used the games to reshape the diplomatic landscape.\nFor all the talk of reconciliation, neither North nor South Korea has much appetite for the compromises – or the catastrophic war – that reunification would take. What both countries have been desperate to do, however, is to blunt the potential threat of a major unilateral U.S. strike on Pyongyang’s nuclear facilities.\nThe potential for renewed dialogue puts Washington in a distinctly difficult position. This year, President Donald Trump’s administration had intended to ramp up military pressure on Pyongyang, reinforcing the Kim regime’s fears that further nuclear progress might lead to U.S. action. The Olympic rapprochement with the South, however, has compelled Washington to abort some of its plans, at Seoul’s request.\nDistrust clearly remains high. The Washington Post reported this week that North Korea canceled a meeting with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence after he used his trip to condemn Kim’s nuclear ambitions and to pledge further sanctions. The fact that a meeting was even considered, however, was arguably a breakthrough in its own right.\nIt would be a mistake to view the Olympic rapprochement as a true game changer on the peninsula; the fundamental drivers of the conflict have not gone away. What the Pyeongchang Games have offered, however, is a break from the cycle of ever-rising escalation. Where that will ultimately lead remains far from clear. But it does make an imminent war somewhat less likely.\nIf the U.S. was to strike now, while communication between North and South is improving, it might look like an unjustified aggressor, risking regional disaster just as peace seemed possible.\nKim, however, must also face some tough decisions. He clearly wishes to continue his nuclear program, so as to remove all doubt about North Korea’s ability to deliver nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles to the U.S. mainland; most analysts agree that he views this capacity as vital to protecting his power and deterring Iraq-style “regime change.”\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and his wife, Kim Jung-sook, watch the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony with Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

Doing so would likely torpedo the regional dialogue, and could even be viewed as justification for a limited U.S. strike.\nAt the very least, any resumption of the North Korean test program while talks are ongoing would likely result in much tougher international sanctions, particularly from China. These have already had a considerable impact on the North Korean economy, and any further reduction of Beijing’s support might genuinely imperil Kim’s rule.\nKim’s current quandary nicely suits South Korea’s purposes. President Moon Jae-in’s government has little genuine affection for the brutal Kim dynasty, and if there were a way of ousting it without disaster, it would probably take it. In the absence of such options, however, it is trying to manage the situation as best it can.\nEven if Kim resumes his tests and tensions with the U.S. rise again after the Games, the temporary detente will still be seen as a success. Had Pyongyang been unable to take part, there were genuine concerns the North might try to disrupt the games, perhaps through cyber or guerrilla attacks. If nothing else, Kim would probably have staged high-profile missile, and perhaps even warhead, tests simultaneously, wrecking any Olympic spirit and dominating news coverage.\nThe Games have provided the best hope in several years that all sides will step back from what had been an ongoing cycle of escalation. Unfortunately, this progress may prove temporary.\nKim may have successfully used the games to increase his regime’s credibility, in particular by sending his sister as a powerful political proxy. But he may conclude that this achievement was equally a result of his recent saber-rattling, and of having exceeding outsiders’ expectations for his nuclear progress.\nKim’s regime still faces ongoing internal and external danger. North Korea is arguably the world’s most insular society, but technology is still making quiet inroads. There remains the medium- to long-term risk that domestic discontent could bring it down.\nThe risk of U.S.-led military action has not gone away either. Despite the relative harmony of the Olympics, many in Washington suspect that Trump and other top administration officials – particularly National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster – still favor military action. Kim may conclude that advancing his weapons program remains the best way to safeguard his long-term rule.\nThe Winter Olympics have opened a slim but real chance that further North Korean tests and the continued rise in tensions can be averted – or at the very least, slowed. It’s not exactly “peace in our time” – not least because neither side has made any real concessions. But it’s not a terrible outcome for a sports competition that could easily have become another flashpoint.\nAbout the Author Peter Apps is Reuters global affairs columnist, writing on international affairs, globalization, conflict and other issues.
