Ms. Fitzgerald teaches courses on social justice, U.S. history, and gender studies, and also studies second-wave feminism.\n“I am excited for the opportunity to serve the families of California,” said Professor Fitzgerald. “I have spent my entire adult life working on policies that will improve the lives of women, children, and families. The commission will be a vehicle to bring these policy ideas to reality.”\nProfessor Fitzgerald was appointed to fill the position previously occupied by Joyce Iseri and will be sworn in at the April Commission meeting.\nFirst 5 California was established in 1998 when voters passed Proposition 10, which taxes tobacco products to fund services for children ages 0 to 5 and their families. First 5 California programs and resources are designed to educate and support teachers, parents, and caregivers in the critical role they play during a child's first five years – to help California kids receive the best possible start in life and thrive.
