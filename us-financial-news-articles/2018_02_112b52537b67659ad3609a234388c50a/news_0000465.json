He enjoys a substantial following among young Muslims and has challenged French restrictions on wearing veils.\nPolice arrested him and took him into custody earlier this week in France.\nReporting by Emmanuel Jarry; Writing by Brian Love; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T02:12:07.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
