So if someone wants to buy us it is also fine.”\nHe said Moneta’s primary growth strategy was still organic but the market may be ready for consolidation now that the central bank is raising interest rates.\nThe Czech banking sector has remained strong and avoided the problems others in Europe saw in the global financial crisis. Most lenders are foreign owned, with the three biggest controlled by Belgian group KBC, France’s Societe Generale and Austria’s Erste Group Bank .\nA shakeout in the smaller end of the market is possible in the next one to three years, Spurny said, after a number of new entrants emerged in the last half decade, often offering free services to build client bases.\n“I think there is a layer of banks that have not made really any money or sustainable returns for the last five years,” Spurny said.\n“I firmly believe that the market does have to consolidate.”\n$1 = 20.3870 Czech crowns Reporting by Jason Hovet, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T06:09:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
