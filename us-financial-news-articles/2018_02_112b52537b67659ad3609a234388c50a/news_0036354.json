The number of non-binding offers from last year, mostly from foreign firms, bodes well for the ongoing binding tender,” Francic said.\nHe said land and construction permits are expected in April and June, respectively, pending confirmation by the energy minister that the project poses no threat for the environment.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS An expert commission is likely to give its opinion on the terminal’s environmental impact next month. Francic said an environmental study, provided by LNG Hrvatska, had properly addressed all concerns about protection of the environment.\nHowever, environmentalists and local communities on Krk island have raised concerns about the impact on sea life and tourism and suggest the terminal be built on land instead, which is more expensive.\n“The problem for us is the use of sea water in the process of converting liquefied gas which will cool the water and is damaging in a small bay, as well as the plan to use chlorine for protection of the pipes from algae and shells,” said Vjeran Pirsic from Krk-based environmentalist group Eko Kvarner.\nThe government has recently announced a special law to speed up the construction of the terminal which Pirsic also finds inappropriate.\n“It’s a restriction of democracy if the government goes against the will of the local communities by imposing a special law,” said Pirsic, adding that the project does not have to be scrapped but rather substantially improved.\nEnvironmentalists and Krk local municipalities have announced a protest against the terminal for March 3 in the nearby port of Rijeka.\nPirsic said all legal means and methods of civil disobedience will be used to stop the terminal as it is currently planned.\nMarija Mileta from ecology group Zelena Akcija said Croatia should scrap the LNG terminal altogether and focus on renewables as non-carbon emitting energy sources.\nReporting by Igor Ilic; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:24:21.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
