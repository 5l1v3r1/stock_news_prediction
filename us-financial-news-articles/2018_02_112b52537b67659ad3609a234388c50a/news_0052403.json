The multiple world champion, who won gold in the two-man bobsleigh on Monday, steered his sled to a 0.29 seconds lead over Won Yun-jong’s South Korean team, which enjoyed the support of a raucous hometown crowd at the Olympic Sliding Centre. Slideshow (3 Images) Germany’s Nico Walther finished in third, 0.35 seconds behind his countryman and a slim 0.06 seconds behind the South Koreans. Justin Kripps, who tied with Friedrich for gold in the two-man, carried his Canadian team to fourth, 0.58 seconds off the lead, with Germany’s Johannes Lochner lurking in fifth, 0.66 seconds back. It was a good day for Codie Bascue’s American team, who saw their sled jump from 12th to ninth position, 0.88 seconds behind Friedrich ahead of Sunday’s final.
