It lapsed for the fifth time at the end of 2016.\nThe $1 rebate can be the difference between profiting and losing money for some biodiesel producers who in the United States make the biofuel largely using soybean oil.\n“Candidly, we are disappointed that some of the negotiators prevented the extension from covering 2018,” Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs at the NBB, said in a statement.\nPrices of the biomass-based diesel (D4) Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits traded at 84 cents a piece, up from lows of 72 cents on Wednesday, traders said.\nWith no credit in place for 2018, higher RINs prices might be needed to encourage producers to ramp up production. Oil refiners use the credits to meet government requirements for use of renewable fuels including ethanol. Fuel companies can either meet the requirements by blending biodiesel with petroleum-based biodiesel, or buy RINs credits.\n“The one-year deal means RINs have to provide the margin for the loss of the $1-per-gallon,” a fuel credits trader said.\nPrices for soyoil fell about 1 percent to a two-week low of 32.21 cents per pound, easing in part on worries demand for the vegetable oil could ebb without the tax incentive to make the biofuel.
