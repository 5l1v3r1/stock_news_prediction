The company\nbelieves this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company's operational performance.\nIn the second quarter of 2016, the company settled its foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of the RONA acquisition. The net impact of the foreign currency\nhedge on fiscal 2016 was a net realized gain of $76 million or $0.05 per share.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the company recognized $462 million or $0.45 per share of non-cash pre-tax charges which included the following:\n- $290 million or $0.33 per share resulting from the wind down of Hydrox, a joint venture in which Lowe's held a one-third ownership interest. Hydrox operated Masters Home\nImprovement stores and Home Timber and Hardware Group's retail stores in Australia.\n- $96 million or $0.07 per share related to a write-off for projects that were canceled as part of the company's ongoing review of strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on\ncritical projects that will drive desired outcomes.\n- $76 million or $0.05 per share related to goodwill and long-lived asset impairments associated with the company's Orchard Supply Hardware operations as part of a strategic\nreassessment of this business.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the company recognized the following charges:\n- $84 million or $0.06 per share for severance-related costs associated with the company's productivity efforts.\n- $32 million or $0.04 per share resulting from a tax charge primarily related to the issuance of final Internal Revenue Code Section 987 regulations in December 2016.\n- $18 million or $0.02 per share resulting from premium paid to acquire the outstanding RONA preferred shares.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, the company recognized a $464 million or $0.34 per share loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with a $1.6 billion cash tender offer.\nIn the second quarter of 2017, the company recognized a $96 million or $0.11 per share gain from the sale of the company's interest in its Australian joint venture.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recognized the following charges:\n- $20 million or $0.02 per share tax charge associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n- $66 million or $0.05 per share related to the one-time cash bonus to eligible hourly U.S. employees.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful indicator of, the company's diluted earnings per share as prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe company's methods of determining this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies for this or similar non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, this\nnon-GAAP measure may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies.\nDetailed reconciliations between the company's GAAP and non-GAAP financial results are shown below and available on the company's website at www.lowes.com/investor .\nThree Months Ended\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nFebruary 2, 2018\nFebruary 3, 2017\nPre-Tax\nEarnings\nTax\nNet Earnings\nPre-Tax\nEarnings\nTax\nNet Earnings\nDiluted earnings per share, as reported\n$ 0.67\n$ 0.74\nNon-GAAP Adjustments\nSeverance-related costs\n-\n-\n-\n0.10\n(0.04)\n0.06\nIRC Section 987 charge\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.04\n0.04\nPremium on RONA Preferred Shares 1\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.02\nImpact of tax reform\n-\n0.02\n0.02\n-\n-\n-\nOne-time cash bonus attributable to tax reform\n0.08\n(0.03)\n0.05\n-\n-\n-\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\n$ 0.74\n$ 0.86\nYear Ended\n(Unaudited)\nFebruary 2, 2018\nFebruary 3, 2017\nPre-Tax\nEarnings\nTax\nNet Earnings\nPre-Tax\nEarnings\nTax\nNet Earnings\nDiluted earnings per share, as reported\n$ 4.09\n$ 3.47\nNon-GAAP Adjustments\nNet gain on foreign currency hedge\n-\n-\n-\n(0.09)\n0.04\n(0.05)\nAustralian joint venture impairment\n-\n-\n-\n0.33\n-\n0.33\nProject write-offs\n-\n-\n-\n0.11\n(0.04)\n0.07\nOrchard Supply Hardware goodwill and long-lived asset impairment\n-\n-\n-\n0.08\n(0.03)\n0.05\nSeverance-related costs\n-\n-\n-\n0.09\n(0.03)\n0.06\nIRC Section 987 charge\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.04\n0.04\nPremium on RONA Preferred Shares 1\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.02\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n0.55\n(0.21)\n0.34\n-\n-\n-\nGain on sale of interest in Australian joint venture\n(0.11)\n-\n(0.11)\n-\n-\n-\nImpact of tax reform\n-\n0.02\n0.02\n-\n-\n-\nOne-time cash bonus attributable to tax reform\n0.08\n(0.03)\n0.05\n-\n-\n-\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\n$ 4.39\n$ 3.99\n1 Under the two-class method, the premium paid to redeem the RONA preferred shares was deducted from net earnings to compute net earnings allocable to common shareholders.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lowes-reports-fourth-quarter-sales-and-earnings-results-300605449.html\nSOURCE Lowe's Companies, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lowes-reports-fourth-quarter-sales-and-earnings-results-300605449.html", "http://www.lowes.com/investor", "http://www.lowes.com/"], "published": "2018-02-28T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:17:37.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
