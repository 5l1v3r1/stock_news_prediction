At the time, the news sent the value of oil and gas firm worldwide lower.\nThe proposal is under review at the finance ministry and will be voted on by the Norwegian parliament at a later stage.\nReporting by Gwladys Fouche; Editing by Alister Doyle and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T19:51:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
