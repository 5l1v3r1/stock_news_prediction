If not warehoused in prison, Martin could literally save lives.\"\nThe filings say Shkreli had devoted significant amounts of time and money to researching treatments for rare diseases, personally helped \"strangers and friends with necessary funds for medical procedures,\" and mentored others.\nThe filing contends that Shkreli's \"problem\" that led to his conviction was not greed for himself, but the fact that he was \"so driven to make\" investors money \"that he could not bring himself to admit failure\" when his stock trading strategies failed.\n\"Although Martin was convicted of fraud, he was not looking to hurt or damage his investors like many other investors,\" the lawyers wrote. \"He sincerely believed he could make them money if he worked hard enough.'\nThe attorneys acknowledged Shkreli's \"sometimes poor judgment\" — the examples of which are legion — but argued that \"the answer to these concerns\" is not a long prison sentence, but rather \"therapy and counseling.\" \nMany sections of the filing are blacked out from public view and seem to refer to personal details about Shkreli and other people.\nShkreli was convicted in August of three counts of securities fraud related to his operation of two hedge funds and a drug company he founded, Retrophin .\nProsecutors in their case at trial detailed how he had repeatedly misled investors about details and the performance of those funds, and then used assets from Retrophin to pay them back for what they had invested — and then some.\nShkreli's conviction in August came after two years of inflammatory and abrasive public conduct.\nThat included raising the price of a drug used by AIDS patients by more than 5,000 percent, making a churlish appearance before a congressional committee, trolling various people with insulting social media posts and getting into a high-profile feud with a member of the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan.\nWhile free on a $5 million release bond after his trial, Shkreli offered, in what he later said was an ill-conceived stunt, his Facebook followers $5,000 for each strand of hair they managed to \nobtain from Hillary Clinton .\nJudge Kiyo Matsumoto revoked his bond for that offer, finding that Shkreli's actions represented a danger to the public. \nEarlier this week, Matsumoto ruled that for the purposes of sentencing, at least, the amount of loss from Shkreli's crimes was $10.4 million. The judge has yet to rule on how much money Shkreli should forfeit to the federal government.\nDefense lawyers have argued that there was effectively no loss because the investors actually ended up making more than what they had originally invested. But Matsumoto said Shkreli should get no credit for that because he only started making investors whole after red flags were raised about his suspected fraud.\nUnder federal sentencing guidelines, monetary loss plays a major role in calculating a recommended term of incarceration.\nMatsumoto's ruling about the loss in the case means that those guidelines will recommend a very long prison term for Shkreli, much longer than the 18-month maximum requested by his legal team.\nFederal prosecutors are due to make their own recommendations for Shkreli's sentence early next week.\nWATCH: Co-worker says Shkreli 'mentally unstable' show chapters Martin Shkreli worker called him 'mentally unstable,' and a 'scam artist' as she threatened to expose his lies to investors      4:48 PM ET Fri, 7 July 2017 | 00:53", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T20:57:23.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
