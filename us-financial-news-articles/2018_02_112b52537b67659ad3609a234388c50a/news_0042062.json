He said it could come back during 2018.\nHEALTH BOOST ON CARDS? Reckitt said it expects foreign exchange rates to reduce sales by 10 percent in the current first quarter and 7 percent for the full year, at current spot rates. Analysts were expecting only a 2.9 percent hit for the full year.\nFor 2018, the company forecast revenue up 13 to 14 percent, with like-for-like sales up 2 to 3 percent. That is an improvement from like-for-like sales that were flat in 2017.\nReckitt faced a costly cyber attack in 2017 and dealt will ongoing fallout from a number of one-time items, such as a tax change in India, a failed product launch and a safety scandal in South Korea. These showed up less in the fourth quarter, helping sales grow just below analysts’ 2.1 percent forecast.\nSince January, Reckitt has operated as two units. Consumer health, which grew 7 percent a year over the past six years, and hygiene and home products, which grew by 1 percent.\nAnalysts have speculated it could eventually sell or spin off slower-growing units, as it has done with food and pharmaceuticals, but Kapoor said the split was intended to free them to focus and pursue their own objectives.\nReckitt has not confirmed its interest in the consumer health businesses being sold by Pfizer and Merck, but sources say it is more keen on Pfizer’s which includes brands like Centrum vitamins and Advil tablets and could fetch up to $20 billion.\nKapoor declined to comment on Pfizer, although in a presentation to analysts he stressed the success of the five-year-old acquisition of Schiff, which gave Reckitt vitamin supplements like MegaRed, which some interpreted as setting the stage for a further push in the field.\nHowever, Kapoor said it was simply designed to give a snapshot of the business five years on, and to dispel some people’s view that it was not a good deal.\n“It obviously sounds very coincidental but I don’t think it should be taken as that,” Kapoor said.
