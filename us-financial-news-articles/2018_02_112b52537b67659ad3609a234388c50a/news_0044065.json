Most European bourses and sectors were falling and at 0834 GMT on Thursday, the pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.7 percent. Barclays was the best performing stock among blue-chips, rising 5.8 percent after it pledged to restore its full dividend with a payout of 6.5 pence per share in 2018. The British bank’s earnings come a day after Lloyds’ results boosted optimism for the sector. In the currently unpopular utilities sectors, France’s Veolia ( VIE.PA ) jumped 3.3 percent after reporting an acceleration of growth in early 2018. Double-digit international growth and a recovery in France boosted 2017 core earnings. Top UK energy supplier Centrica ( CNA.L ), which issued a profit warning in November, rose 3.1 percent after it raised its cost saving target by 500 million pounds and said it would cut about 4,000 jobs by 2020. Other blue-chip companies made gains after publishing their results, such as Belgian pharmaceutical group UCB ( UCB.BR ) up 4.4 percent and French chemical group Arkema ( AKE.PA ), which rose 3.6 percent. In sharp contrast to the positive share price reaction to Glencore’s ( GLEN.L ) upbeat results on Wednesday, Anglo American AAL. fell 3.3 percent after presenting its 2007 results.
