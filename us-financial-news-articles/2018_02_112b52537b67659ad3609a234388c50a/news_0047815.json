The SEC decision is not executory and Rappler has described it as ludicrous.\nIt continues to operate pending appeal.\n“I am now invoking executive action based on the SEC ruling,” Duterte said in justifying his order to bar Rappler from covering his official events.\nDuterte has sparred frequently during news events with Rappler’s presidential palace reporter, Pia Ranada, and has repeatedly shown his irritation with the organization’s scrutiny of his war on drugs.\nRappler is known for stories that have questioned the accuracy of Duterte’s public statements and highlighted his office’s ties to bloggers whose posts have stirred online hate against the president’s opponents.\nHowever, one article carrying a headline that said Duterte’s closest aide, Christopher Go, had “intervened” in a navy frigate procurement last month appeared to be the final straw.\nThat led to an angry outburst in which Duterte said it had been “throwing trash” and was a “fake news outlet”.\nReporting by Karen Lema; Editing by Martin Petty, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T13:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T13:27:50.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
