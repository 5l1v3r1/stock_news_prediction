It did not elaborate.\nThe source close to the matter said the licence applied to FAB, which has participated in Saudi deals since its creation. Last month, it was one of eight international banks to provide a $2.6 billion bridge syndicated loan to state-controlled utility Saudi Electricity Co. The bank does not currently have a branch or representative office in Saudi Arabia.\nOther international banks to raise their presence in the kingdom in recent months include Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, with the latter last month winning formal approval from the CMA to begin investment banking business there.
