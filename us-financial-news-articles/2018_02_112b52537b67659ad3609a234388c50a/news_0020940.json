Levandowski left in January 2016 to found a startup, Otto, which Uber bought a few months later.\nWaymo alleges that Kalanick and Levandowski conspired to create Otto as a storehouse for trade secrets from Google's self-driving car project.\nKalanick acknowledged meeting with Levandowski to discuss ways to improve Uber's own self-driving car program before Levandowski left Google.\nBut Kalanick said he simply wanted to hire Levandowski for his expertise and his connections with other talented engineers.\n12:14 p.m.\nFormer Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is poised to testify Tuesday in a high-stakes trial focused on charges that his company stole self-driving car technology from Waymo, a Google spinoff.\nBarring delays, Kalanick will take the witness stand toward the end of the second day of testimony in the case. Waymo alleges that Uber used data purloined by former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski to build its own fleet of self-driving cars.\nWaymo lawyers are expected to confront the combative Kalanick about his relationship with Levandowski, and whether the two plotted to rip off Waymo to help Uber's ride-hailing catch up in autonomous vehicles.\nKalanick engineered Uber's deal to buy a startup founded by Levandowski for $680 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T01:52:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
