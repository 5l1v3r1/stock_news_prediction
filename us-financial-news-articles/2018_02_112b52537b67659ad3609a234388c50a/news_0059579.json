Beijing, for its part, wants Tsai to acknowledge that Taiwan and China are part of the same country.\nIn a speech to foreign diplomats in Taipei on Tuesday evening, Tsai said she would not change her position of maintaining the current status quo in the Taiwan Strait, a reference to Taiwan not seeking independence and China not seeking to force unification.\n“But I also want to remind people, maintaining the status quo is not the responsibility of one country. Maintaining the status quo needs the joint efforts of all countries in the whole region,” she said.\nReporting by Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T11:54:38.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
