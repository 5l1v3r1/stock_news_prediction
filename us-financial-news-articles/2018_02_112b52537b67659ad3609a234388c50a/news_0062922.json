But they are likely to be overshadowed by Fed chair Jerome Powell.\nU.S. stock markets calmed on Friday after the Fed said it saw steady economic growth continuing and no serious risks on the horizon.\nInvestors also seem to be wagering that Powell will stick to that script at his first appearance before the House on Tuesday, followed by testimony to the Senate on Thursday.\n“Given he’s speaking on behalf of the committee it would be a big surprise to see much deviation from recent Fed commentary, but much will probably be made of how he handles the scrutiny,” said Jim Reid, a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank.\nSTERLING, EURO GAIN The expected lack of policy surprises from Powell saw yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries back off to 2.86 percent and away from a four-year top of 2.957 percent, dragging down the dollar.\nThe currency surrendered early gains to dip 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies to 89.66. That followed a 0.8 percent bounce last week.\nSterling was up 0.5 percent on Monday after Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden said the bank might need to raise interest rates somewhat sooner than he had expected if wage growth picked up early this year.\nThe pound also benefited from hopes that Britain’s exit from the European Union might be less disruptive than feared, with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn set to give a speech on Monday backing a new customs union with the bloc.\nThe euro was 0.3 percent firmer on the back of dollar weakness, though investors largely held back from taking big positions ahead of a national election in Italy and the conclusion of coalition talks in Germany.\nECB President Mario Draghi is also set to appear before the European Parliament later in the day, while BoE governor Mark Carney speaks in Edinburgh on Friday.\nIn commodities, oil prices steadied after hitting their highest level in nearly three weeks, supported by comments from top exporter Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb shipments in line with the OPEC-led effort to cut global supplies.\nReporting by Alasdair Pal, Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:50:40.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
