The heavy snow is forecast to move into upstate New York and New England by early Saturday.\nCity officials announced school closures in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee because of the weather.\nAbout 1,250 U.S. flights were canceled, with about one in five flights into or out of Chicago and Detroit airports called off, according to FlightAware.com, which tracks airline traffic.\nUnited Airlines said on Twitter that waivers were in effect for snow-hit areas this week, allowing travelers to change flights without charges. Delta Air Lines offered to re-book flights on Friday for 18 Midwest cities.\nWind chill temperatures were expected to drop below 0 Fahrenheit (-18 C) in many areas across the region, and officials warned of limited visibility on roads. The central and northern Rockies also will see heavy snow, the weather service said.\nWinter weather this week killed people in accidents in the Midwest, including six in Iowa, two in Missouri and one in Montana, local media in those states reported.\nAdditional reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington and Frank McGurty and Jonathan Allen in New York; Editing by Peter Graff and Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T11:58:54.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
