SFR declined to comment on the matter. \nTurrini was part of the team of former Altice chief executive Michel Combes, who was ousted last year by Altice’s founder and main shareholder Patrick Drahi, following a set of disappointing results and a share price slump. \nDrahi has since unveiled plans to cut debt and improve Altice’s performance, including spinning off the cable and telecom company’s U.S. arm and prioritising efforts to turn around its European operations including SFR. \nLast month, Sprint Corp appointed former Altice CEO Combes as its chief financial officer, replacing Tarek Robbiati who had chalked out a turnaround plan for the telecom company that involved sweeping cost cuts.
