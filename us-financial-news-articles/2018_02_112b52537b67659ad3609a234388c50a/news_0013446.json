Gilead projected a 2018 tax rate of 21 percent to 23 percent. \nThe company’s forecast implies 2018 earnings per share of $6.15, according to Mizuho Securities. Wall Street analysts, on average, expected 2018 earnings per share of $6.73, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nGilead, which last year paid nearly $12 billion for cancer immunotherapy company Kite Pharma, said it earned $1.78 a share in the fourth quarter excluding one-time items, which beat the average Wall Street estimate of $1.67 a share. \nThe quarterly results were “generally in line,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note. “Most notable news was Gilead’s 2018 guidance, where competitive dynamics (plus some market shrinkage) are expected to reduce HCV (hepatitis C virus) sales.” \nIncluding a $6 billion charge related to U.S. corporate tax changes, Gilead posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $3.87 billion. \nQuarterly sales of hepatitis C drugs totaled $1.5 billion, down from $3.2 billion a year earlier but in line with analysts’ forecasts. Sales of antiviral and HIV drug rose to $3.7 billion from $3.4 billion. \nShares of Gilead, which rose 2.5 percent to close at $80.38 in regular trading on the Nasdaq, were down 1 percent at $79.55 after-hours.
