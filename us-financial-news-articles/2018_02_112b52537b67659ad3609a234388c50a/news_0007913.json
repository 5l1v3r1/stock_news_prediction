It killed two people. \n“Hasan Aden Isak was sentenced to death and Abdullahi Hassan Absuge was sentenced to life imprisonment,” said the Somali military court chairman, Hassan Ali Nur, according to the Somali News Agency. Reporters were not permitted to cover the trial. \nThe part played by Absuge, who was sentenced in absentia, in the attacks was not clear. \nThe Oct. 14 bombing sparked angry street protests against al Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group that carries out most of the bombings in Somalia. Al Shabaab never claimed responsibility for the attack. \nThe militant group wants to overthrow the weak, U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law. It has steadily been losing territory since African Union peacekeepers arrived in Somalia a decade ago, but still carries out frequent bombings in the capital.
