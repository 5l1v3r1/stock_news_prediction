Elite specializes in oral sustained and controlled release drug products which have high barriers to entry. Elite owns generic and OTC products which have been licensed to TAGI Pharma, Epic Pharma, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Elite currently has nine commercial products being sold, five products filed with the FDA, additional approved products pending manufacturing site transfer and the NDA filing for SequestOx™.
