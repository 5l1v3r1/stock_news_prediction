No one is shielded from this type of situation,” said Lespinasse, the former coordinator for the Support Group for Refugees and Repatriated Persons (GARR).\n“These are problems that we encounter in private institutions, in public institutions and in humanitarian circles,” she said.\nThe scandal over Oxfam, one of the best-known international charities with aid programs around the globe, erupted following sexual misconduct allegations first reported by the Times newspaper last week.\nThe Times said some Oxfam staff in Haiti after the earthquake had paid for sex with prostitutes. Oxfam has not confirmed nor denied the specific account but has said an internal investigation in 2011 confirmed sexual misconduct occurred.\nWomen’s rights group Solidarité Fanm Ayisyen, based in Port-au-Prince, in the past cut ties with groups when it disapproved of their handling of sexual misconduct rumors, said its head Sabine Lamour.\nAmong them was MINUSTAH, a United Nations-backed mission that left Haiti last year dogged by controversies, including allegations of sexual abuse, she said.\n“In the humanitarian world, this (behavior) happens,” she said.\nThis focus should prompt aid groups to look at their hiring practices and weed out workers with records of misconduct, said Nene Mathurin, spokesman for the Research and Support Group to the Rural Environment, a Haitian anti-poverty nonprofit.\n“It is a great injustice when people, Haitians or foreigners, use their position of power to sexual harass or assault someone,” Mathurin told the Foundation.\n“Relations between nonprofits and Haiti must change.”\nBritain will stop funding overseas aid agencies if they fail to learn the lessons from Oxfam’s scandal, and the government will discuss possible prosecutions with law enforcement, the British development minister said on Wednesday.\nOxfam receives around 32 million pounds ($44 million) of British government funding a year.\nThe deputy head of Oxfam resigned on Monday, saying it had failed to respond adequately to past allegations of sexual misconduct by some staff in Haiti and in Chad.\nReporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.
