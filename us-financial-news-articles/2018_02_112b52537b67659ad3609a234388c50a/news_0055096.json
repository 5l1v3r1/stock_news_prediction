Those are the issues that will be discussed at the supervisory board’s upcoming meeting,” Innogy said.\nIberdrola declined to comment. Its chairman this week ruled out big deals over the next five years unless there was a good target without the need for cash or a capital increase.\nEnel Chief Executive Francesco Starace in November said it was not interested in doing large M&A deals and was also not interested in Innogy.\nA spokeswoman for RWE confirmed previous comments saying that it, too, called for greater cost discipline at Innogy while welcoming, in general, the group’s strategy. She declined to comment on M&A speculation raised in the Spiegel article.\nRWE Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz has said that the company was considering all options with regard to its Innogy stake. The group has repeatedly said that is under no pressure to sell.\nReporting by Christoph Steitz and Jose Elias Rodriguez; Editing by Douglas Busvine and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:33:33.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
