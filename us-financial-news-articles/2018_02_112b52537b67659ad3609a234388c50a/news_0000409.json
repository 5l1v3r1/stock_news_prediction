Additional information regarding these Non-GAAP financial measures is set forth under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\n“Our third quarter results, which meaningfully exceeded expectations, underscore the progress we have made developing a stronger foundation to support profitable growth,” said Dave Powers, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our refined product strategies, enhanced consumer messaging and wholesale account optimization efforts resulted in much stronger full price selling for our brand portfolio during the key holiday season. While more favorable weather also contributed to our year-over-year improvement, hard work by the entire organization enabled us to capitalize on additional upside opportunities. Looking ahead, I am confident that the successful execution of our profit improvement plan, combined with the recently passed tax reform, has Deckers in a great position to deliver increased value to our shareholders in the years ahead.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Review\nNet sales increased 6.6% to $810.5 million compared to $760.3 million for the same period last year. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 6.3%. Gross margin was 52.2% compared to 50.5% for the same period last year. SG&A expenses were $230.3 million compared to $330.3 million for the same period last year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $220.4 million this year compared to $201.4 million last year. Operating income was $193.2 million compared to $53.3 million for the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $203.1 million this year compared to $182.2 million last year. Diluted earnings per share was $2.69 compared to $1.27 for the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.97 this year compared to $4.11 last year. For this year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was largely effected by the recently enacted tax reform act.\nBrand Summary\nUGG® brand net sales for the third quarter increased 4.3% to $734.7 million compared to $704.0 million for the same period last year. HOKA ONE ONE® brand net sales for the third quarter increased 65.7% to $31.8 million compared to $19.2 million for the same period last year.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $375.6 million remaining under its $400.0 million in stock repurchase authorizations. The Company still intends to repurchase approximately $75 million worth of stock prior to the end of fiscal year 2018.\nThe Company intends to repatriate $250.0 million by fiscal year end 2018. This preliminary estimate may be impacted by a number of additional considerations, including but not limited to clarifications or changes to the recently passed tax reform act, the issuance of the final regulations, our ongoing analysis of the new law and our actual earnings for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 Outlook for the Twelve Month Period Ending March 31, 2018\nDeckers now expects fiscal year 2018 results to be:\nNet sales are expected to be in the range of $1,873 million to $1,878 million. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 49%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales are projected to be approximately 37%. Effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $5.37 to $5.42. This excludes any charges that may occur from additional store closures, restructuring and other charges. The earnings per share guidance does not assume any impact of additional share repurchases.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook for the Three Month Period Ending March 31, 2018\nNet sales are expected to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million. Effective tax rate of approximately 32%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20. This excludes any charges that may occur from additional store closures, restructuring and other charges. The earnings per share guidance does not assume any impact of additional share repurchases.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present certain Non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including constant currency, Non-GAAP SG&A expenses, Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, to provide information that may assist investors in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. We believe these Non-GAAP financial measures are important indicators of our operating performance because they exclude items that are unrelated to, and may not be indicative of, our core operating results, such as restructuring charges relating to retail store closures and office consolidations, and other charges relating to inventory write-downs, severance and asset impairments. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of certain costs and charges allows for a more meaningful comparison of our results from period to period. These Non-GAAP measures, as we calculate them, may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for comparing the performance of other companies relative to Deckers. For example, in order to calculate our constant currency information, we calculate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period, excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate hedges and re-measurements in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. These Non-GAAP financial results are not intended to represent, and should not be considered to be more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. To the extent we utilize such Non-GAAP financial measures in the future, we expect to calculate them using a consistent method from period to period. A reconciliation of each of the financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided under the heading “Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in the financial statement tables included below.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company’s conference call to review the results for the third quarter 2018 will be broadcast live today, Thursday, February 1, 2018 at 4:30 pm Eastern Time and hosted at www.deckers.com .
