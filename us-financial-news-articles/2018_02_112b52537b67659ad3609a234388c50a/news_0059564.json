Its shares jumped 11 percent.\nFitbit slumped more than 10 percent after the wearable device maker forecast current-quarter results below estimates.\nLuxury builder Toll Brothers’ shares rose 1.2 percent after it reported quarterly profit that beat analysts’ estimates as it sold more homes at higher prices.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,595 to 990.
