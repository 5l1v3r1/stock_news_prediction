It later traded slightly higher at $1.4005 at 1630 GMT even as the dollar extended its rally against other currencies.\nAgainst the euro, the pound rallied half a percent to 88.115 pence per euro and held on to those gains in later European trading.\nPatel at ING said the pound was changing hands in a “new Brexit trading environment”, rising on the back of positive surprises more than falling when talks seemed very strained, as they did last year.\nEARNINGS DATA Growing expectations that the Bank of England is at the start of a long interest rate hiking cycle also mean that the pound is increasingly impacted by factors other than Brexit talks.\nTraders are looking to important British earnings data due on Wednesday that could help cement bets that the central bank will hike rates in May.\nBoE Governor Mark Carney said this month that rates needed to rise a bit faster and more than previously expected, and the market now prices in a roughly 80 percent chance of a May hike.\n“We would need to see a significant negative miss to see the market re-price the chances of a May hike,” said Morten Helt, a strategist at Danske Bank in Copenhagan, referring to the earnings data released on Wednesday.\nThe level at which British workers are being paid is crucial, given that the BoE has said it wants to see evidence of rising wage pressures before it embarks on further rate increases.
