[FRX/] \nA stronger dollar makes dollar-priced gold costlier for non-U.S. investors. \nGold, seen as a safe haven asset, has failed to capitalise this week from the biggest selloff in six years in global equities, but the precious metal, still driven largely by dollar movement, is not poised to unwind. \n“The general scenario for gold is still positive. What we are seeing now (on the stock markets) is just a correction, and the dollar is still weakening (longer term),” said Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at Activtrades. \n“I‘m expecting gold to remain above $1,300 in the next few months. The problem for gold would be four (U.S.) rate hikes, but I don’t believe (that will happen). At this stage inflation is still under control,” he added. \nSpot gold dipped 0.2 percent to $1,322.74 per ounce, as of 1314 GMT. Prices fell over 1 percent to hit their lowest since Jan. 11 at $1,319.96 on Tuesday. U.S. gold futures for April delivery fell 0.3 percent to $1,325.30 per ounce. \nWorld stocks clawed their way back from two-month lows on Wednesday, though momentum was weak and U.S. futures suggested Wall Street could lapse back into losses after rebounding from a rout that wiped $4 trillion off world equities. [MKTS/GLOB] \nTraders dialled back bets the U.S. central bank would ratchet up the pace of rate increases on Monday to between two and three hikes from three to four hikes last week, according to interest rates futures. \nSPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 1.4 percent to 829.27 tonnes on Tuesday from Monday. [GOL/ETF] \nHoldings saw their worst one-day fall since December 2016. \nSpot gold may test a support at $1,316 per ounce, as suggested by a retracement analysis and a head-and-shoulders, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. \nSpot silver dipped 0.2 percent to $16.58 per ounce. \nPlatinum fell 0.9 percent to $981 per ounce after touching its lowest since Dec. 11 earlier. \nPalladium fell 1.3 percent to $997.20 per ounce, having touched its lowest since Dec. 7.
