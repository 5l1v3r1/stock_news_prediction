A billboard reads: 'Soros wants to transplant millions from Africa and the Middle East'. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo Organizations that support migration will have to pay tax on the foreign funding or assets they receive, the bill says, with a possible exemption on funding that serves humanitarian goals. \nActivists who organize or support migration could also face restraining orders preventing them from approaching the EU’s external borders in Hungary. \nOrban has been embroiled in an escalating “Stop Soros” feud with the 87-year-old Hungarian-born Jew, waging a billboard and media campaign asserting that he would “settle millions from Africa and the Middle East”. \nSoros has rejected the campaign against him as “distortions and lies” meant to create a false external enemy. \nPro-government media reported earlier that the new legislation could lead to a ban on Soros, who has U.S. and Hungarian citizenship, entering the country. \nThe Hungarian Helsinki Committee, an NGO that has been providing support for the legal and human rights of various groups including asylum seekers and prisoners since 1994, said the bill was unacceptable and served political goals. \n“(Its goal) is to stigmatize certain civil organizations that the government does not like... and to distance them from society, and in the end make their operation impossible,” the committee, which receives a major chunk of its funding from Soros, said in a statement. \nPoland, Hungary and other ex-communist eastern member states of the EU have all pushed a strong anti-immigrant stance, even though the number of asylum seekers who want to stay in these countries are very few compared to western European countries. \nLast year, the Orban government introduced a measure requiring NGOs that get money from abroad to register with the state, raising alarm in the EU and United States. \nThe European Commission said last year it was taking Budapest to the EU’s top court over its NGO laws as well as a higher education law that targets the Central European University in Budapest founded by Soros. \nReporting by Krisztina Than; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T13:56:12.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
