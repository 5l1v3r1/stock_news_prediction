(Nasdaq: ACAD), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“Our 2017 results reflect the robust uptake of NUPLAZID (pimavanserin) in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease psychosis,” said Steve Davis, ACADIA’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We were also very pleased to receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA as we explore the utility of pimavanserin in dementia-related psychosis, where no drug is currently approved. This is the second Breakthrough Therapy Designation for pimavanserin.”\n“As we look to 2018, we anticipate continued strong volume growth for NUPLAZID. In addition, we look forward to advancing our late-stage clinical programs in dementia-related psychosis, schizophrenia inadequate response and schizophrenia negative symptoms, as well as sharing the top-line results of our CLARITY study in major depressive disorder in the second half of 2018.”\nRecent Highlights\nInitiated a national direct-to-consumer disease awareness TV ad campaign to educate patients and caregivers about Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PD Psychosis) in November 2017. Initiated pivotal Phase 3 HARMONY Study with pimavanserin in dementia-related psychosis in October 2017. Received a second Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for pimavanserin in October 2017. This designation is for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis. Presented Phase 2 data with pimavanserin in Alzheimer’s disease psychosis at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) meeting in Boston in November 2017. Appointed Damien McDevitt, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Corporate Development.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue\nNet product sales of NUPLAZID, which was first made available for prescription starting in May 2016, were $43.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 263% as compared to $12.0 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, ACADIA reported NUPLAZID net product sales of $124.9 million, an increase of $107.6 million, or 622% from the $17.3 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $43.2 million, compared to $30.2 million for the same period of 2016.

The increase in research and development expenses during the 2017 periods as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased clinical costs related to the clinical studies initiated in the fourth quarter of each of 2016 and 2017. The company also incurred additional personnel and related costs associated with its expanded research and development organization during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $66.7 million, compared to $57.7 million for the same period of 2016.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses during the 2017 periods as compared to 2016 was primarily due to costs incurred to support ACADIA’s commercial activities for NUPLAZID, including additional personnel and related costs, together with increased contributions to third-party charitable foundations that support Parkinson’s disease patients.\nNet Loss\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, ACADIA reported a net loss of $68.9 million, or $0.55 per common share, compared to a net loss of $78.7 million, or $0.65 per common share, for the same period in 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, ACADIA reported a net loss of $289.4 million, or $2.36 per common share, compared to a net loss of $271.4 million, or $2.34 per common share, for the same period in 2016.

The company expects to end 2018 with more than $200 million of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities on its balance sheet.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nACADIA management will review its fourth quarter financial results and operations via conference call and webcast later today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

NUPLAZID is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis unrelated to the hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis.\nNUPLAZID is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis.\nContraindication: NUPLAZID is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to pimavanserin or any of its components. Rash, urticaria, and reactions consistent with angioedema (e.g., tongue swelling, circumoral edema, throat tightness, and dyspnea) have been reported.\nQT Interval Prolongation: NUPLAZID prolongs the QT interval. The use of NUPLAZID should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics or Class 3 antiarrhythmics, certain antipsychotic medications, and certain antibiotics. NUPLAZID should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.\nAdverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (≥2% for NUPLAZID and greater than placebo) were peripheral edema (7% vs 2%), nausea (7% vs 4%), confusional state (6% vs 3%), hallucination (5% vs 3%), constipation (4% vs 3%), and gait disturbance (2% vs <1%).\nDrug Interactions: Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole) increase NUPLAZID concentrations. Reduce the NUPLAZID dose by one-half. Strong CYP3A4 inducers may reduce NUPLAZID exposure, monitor for reduced efficacy. Increase in NUPLAZID dosage may be needed.\nRenal Impairment: No dosage adjustment for NUPLAZID is needed in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Use of NUPLAZID is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.\nHepatic Impairment: Use of NUPLAZID is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. NUPLAZID has not been evaluated in this patient population.\nPregnancy: Use of NUPLAZID in pregnant women has not been evaluated and should therefore be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus.\nPediatric Use: Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.\nDosage and Administration: Recommended dose: 34 mg per day, taken orally as two 17-mg tablets once daily, without titration.\nFor additional Important Safety Information, including boxed warning, please see the full Prescribing Information for NUPLAZID at https://www.nuplazid.com/pdf/NUPLAZID_Prescribing_Information.pdf .\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180227006509/en/\nInvestor Contact:\nACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nLisa Barthelemy, (858) 558-2871\nir@acadia-pharm.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\nTaft Communications\nBob Laverty, (609) 558-5570\nbob@taftcommunications.com\nSource: ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acadia-pharm.com&esheet=51764960&newsitemid=20180227006509&lan=en-US&anchor=www.acadia-pharm.com&index=1&md5=f825b4991b7310045312a353c5fefd49", "https://www.nuplazid.com/pdf/NUPLAZID_Prescribing_Information.pdf", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acadia-pharm.com&esheet=51764960&newsitemid=20180227006509&lan=en-US&anchor=www.acadia-pharm.com&index=2&md5=cbfa0755c90bfb7c7cbf58254ddd2972", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nuplazid.com%2Fpdf%2FNUPLAZID_Prescribing_Information.pdf&esheet=51764960&newsitemid=20180227006509&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nuplazid.com%2Fpdf%2FNUPLAZID_Prescribing_Information.pdf&index=3&md5=1b02932a4ad12df53dfcaae5f1dfddf0", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180227006509/en/"], "published": "2018-02-28T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T02:12:09.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
