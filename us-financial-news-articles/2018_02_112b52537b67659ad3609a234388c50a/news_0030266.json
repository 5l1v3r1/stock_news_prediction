On Thursday night, popular game show app HQ Trivia posted a straightforward question to the nearly 900,000 participants left playing the game: \"What is the official currency of China?\" \nThe multiple-choice format offered three potential answers: \"renminbi,\" \"yen\" and \"Chinese dollar,\" Bloomberg reports . Participants choked. Nearly 720,000 people incorrectly guessed the yen, which is the national currency of Japan. \nThe correct answer is the renminbi, which is often referred to as the yuan. Only 71,000 players got it right. \nThe question was expected to be tough or, as the game puts it, 'savage.' But while HQ expected a third of participants to get the question wrong, it tripped up a full 85 percent of players. show chapters 7:13 PM ET Tue, 15 Nov 2016 | 01:13 \n\"The Savage Question is the particular moment where almost everyone was wrong and we take a little moment there to learn and appreciate what it reveals about how people think,\" Rus Yusupov, HQ's chief executive officer, said in a statement to Bloomberg. \nThe question highlights how much millennials, the age group that generally flocks to HQ, still need to learn about money .

When financial services company Financial Engines gave survey respondents an 11-question financial literacy quiz in 2017, only 6 percent passed. Although the same respondents reported feeling as though they're making responsible financial decisions, they weren't doing as stellar a job as they believed they were. \n\"When it comes to your finances, poor decisions you make today can cost you for the rest of your life,\" says Andy Smith, certified financial planner and senior vice president of financial planning at Financial Engines. \nHere are the four questions that tripped people up the most. How many can you answer correctly? \n1.
