On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading down by 0.2% at $65.30 a barrel.\n“The price slide is due to a general worsening of sentiment,” Commerzbank said in a research note. “Stock markets around the world are under pressure, which confirms that the steep price rise in the previous weeks was for the most part sentiment-driven.”\nA selloff in world stocks continued Monday as expectations of rising inflation and climbing government bond yields interrupt equity’s bull run.\nOil prices had hovered near three-year highs of more than $70 a barrel last month. But rising U.S. shale production, evidenced by increased drilling activity, has started to weigh on crude, analysts say.\nBaker Hughes on Friday said the number of active rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. had risen by six the preceding week, in the second consecutive weekly rise.\nAn electric oil pump jack in Texas.

ICE gasoil, a benchmark for diesel fuel, changed hands at $606.25 a metric ton, down 0.70% from the previous settlement.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T16:08:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
