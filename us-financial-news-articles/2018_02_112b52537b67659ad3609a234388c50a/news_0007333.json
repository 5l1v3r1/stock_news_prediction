We announced seven acquisitions and exited the year exceeding our $1.3 billion goal of cumulative run rate Invigorate savings.\n\"In 2018 our guidance for the full year is aligned with our long term outlook even before the meaningful benefit of tax reform. We expect to deliver continued acceleration of top-line growth of 4-5% and more than 20% adjusted earnings growth, driven in part by solid mid to high single digit earnings growth from operations.\"\nMr. Rusckowski continued, \"Quest is a beneficiary of recent tax legislation, which enables us to further grow earnings per share and invest in our business and our people. The benefits of tax reform will also help offset new Medicare reimbursement reductions under PAMA, which represent a headwind to our company and industry.\"\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\n(dollars in millions, except per share data)\nReported:\nNet revenues (a) (c)\n$\n1,936\n$\n1,861\n4.1\n%\n$\n7,709\n$\n7,515\n2.6\n%\nDIS revenues\n$\n1,853\n$\n1,773\n4.5\n%\n$\n7,370\n$\n7,138\n3.3\n%\nRevenue per requisition\n2.1\n%\n1.0\n%\nRequisition volume\n2.4\n%\n2.3\n%\nOperating income (b) (c)\n$\n269\n$\n276\n(2.5)\n%\n$\n1,165\n$\n1,277\n(8.8)\n%\nOperating income as a percentage of net\nrevenues (c)\n13.9\n%\n14.8\n%\n(90) bps\n15.1\n%\n17.0\n%\n(190) bps\nNet income attributable to Quest Diagnostics (c) (d)\n$\n254\n$\n155\n64.0\n%\n$\n772\n$\n645\n19.8\n%\nDiluted earnings per share (c) (d)\n$\n1.82\n$\n1.09\n67.0\n%\n$\n5.50\n$\n4.51\n22.0\n%\nCash provided by operations (e)\n$\n323\n$\n304\n6.0\n%\n$\n1,175\n$\n1,069\n9.9\n%\nCapital expenditures\n$\n82\n$\n128\n(35.6)\n%\n$\n252\n$\n293\n(14.0)\n%\nAdjusted:\nRevenues on an equivalent basis\n$\n1,936\n$\n1,861\n4.1\n%\n$\n7,709\n$\n7,489\n2.9\n%\nOperating income (f)\n$\n317\n$\n305\n4.0\n%\n$\n1,282\n$\n1,230\n4.2\n%\nOperating income as a percentage of net revenues\n16.4\n%\n16.4\n%\n0 bps\n16.6\n%\n16.4\n%\n20 bps\nNet income attributable to Quest Diagnostics (d)\n$\n180\n$\n173\n4.3\n%\n$\n740\n$\n682\n8.6\n%\nDiluted earnings per share excluding amortization (d)\n$\n1.40\n$\n1.31\n6.9\n%\n$\n5.67\n$\n5.15\n10.1\n%\n(a)\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, net revenues include $26 million related to the Focus Diagnostics products business, which was sold on May 13, 2016.\n(b)\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, reported operating income includes a gain on escrow recovery associated with an acquisition and $129 million related to the Focus Diagnostics products business and the gain from sale of the Focus Diagnostics products business on May 13, 2016.\n(c)\nFor further details impacting the year-over-year comparisons related to net revenues, operating income, operating income as a percentage of net revenues, net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, and diluted EPS, see note 2 of the financial tables attached below.\n(d)\nFor 2017 and 2016, ETB impacted income tax expense and diluted EPS as follows:\nFirst\nQuarter\nSecond\nQuarter\nThird\nQuarter\nFourth\nQuarter\nTotal\nYear\n(dollars in millions, except per share data)\n2017\nIncome tax benefit\n$\n16\n$\n13\n$\n7\n$\n1\n$\n37\nDiluted EPS\n$\n0.11\n$\n0.10\n$\n0.04\n$\n0.02\n$\n0.27\n2016\nIncome tax benefit\n$\n2\n$\n2\n$\n3\n$\n2\n$\n9\nDiluted EPS\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.02\n$\n0.02\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.06\n(e)\nFor details impacting the year-over-year comparisons related to cash provided by operations, see note 6 of the financial tables attached below.\n(f)\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, adjusted operating income includes $12 million related to the Focus Diagnostics products business.\nDividend Increased\nQuest Diagnostics' Board of Directors authorized an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.45 to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share annually, payable on April 18, 2018 to shareholders of record of Quest Diagnostics common stock on April 4, 2018. This dividend increase is the company's seventh since 2011.\nTax Reform Benefit\nIn 2018 the company expects to realize approximately $180 million in tax savings on an adjusted basis. Of this amount, the company plans to reinvest roughly $75 million before tax back into the business and its employees, resulting in a benefit of approximately $120 million to net earnings. Investment initiatives include:\nAdvanced diagnostics innovation through new tests and high-touch concierge services; Investments to deliver a consistently excellent consumer experience both online through the MyQuest mobile patient application and patient service centers; and A bonus of up to $500 for nearly 40,000 employees to be paid based on the company's performance in 2018.\nGuidance for Full Year 2018\nBeginning in 2018, the company will change how it presents adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to additionally exclude ETB. The company believes this presentation provides investors with additional insight into the company's operational performance as well as the impact of TCJA. As a result, the company's presentation of 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance described below excludes the impact of special items, amortization expense and ETB. For the full year 2017, adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense and ETB was $5.40.\nThe company estimates full year 2018 results as follows:\nLow\nHigh\nRevenues (a)\n$7.70 billion\n$7.77 billion\nRevenue increase (a)\n4%\n5%\nReported diluted EPS\n$5.42\n$5.62\nAdjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense and ETB\n$6.50\n$6.70\nCash provided by operations\nApproximately $1.3 billion\nCapital expenditures\n$350 million\n$400 million\n(a)\nThe outlook for 4% to 5% revenue growth in 2018 represents management's estimates for 2018 versus 2017 reported revenues adjusted to reflect the impact of new revenue recognition rules that are effective January 1, 2018. Full year 2017 revenues adjusted to reflect the new rules were $7,402 million. Under the new rules, the company will report uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction in net revenues; historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not expect the new rules to impact net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics or diluted EPS.\nNote on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs used in this press release the term \"reported\" refers to measures under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The term \"adjusted\" refers to non-GAAP measures as follows: (i) for the purpose of income measures the term \"adjusted\" refers to operating performance measures that exclude special items such as the gain on sale of the Focus Diagnostics products business, the effect of changes in tax law on our deferred tax assets (liabilities) and reserves, the retirement of debt and related refinancing charges, restructuring and integration charges, and other items; (ii) the term \"adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense\" represents the company's diluted EPS before the impact of special items (described above) and amortization expense; (iii) the term \"adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense and ETB\" represents the company's diluted EPS before the impact of special items (described above), amortization expense, and ETB, (iv) reference to \"revenues on an equivalent basis\" when comparing 2017 to 2016 represents 2016 reported revenues excluding all Focus Diagnostics products revenues.\nNon-GAAP adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. Non-GAAP adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. Management may use these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, as well as to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess our performance. The additional tables attached below include reconciliations of adjusted measures to GAAP measures.\nConference Call Information\nQuest Diagnostics will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss financial results beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of these other items on the company's consolidated statement of operations:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(dollars in millions)\nCost of Sales\n$\n2\n$\n—\n$\n5\n$\n—\nSelling, general and administrative\n4\n—\n7\n6\nOther operating expense (income), net\n—\n6\n—\n(13)\nOperating income\n$\n6\n$\n6\n$\n12\n$\n(7)\nOther non-operating (income) expense, net\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n(2)\n$\n7\n(d)\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, represents charges associated with the March 2016 cash tender offer where the company purchased $200 million of its 6.95% Senior Notes due July 2037 and 5.75% Senior Notes due January 2040. The pre-tax charges associated with the retirement of debt and related refinancing charges are recorded in other income (expense), net on the company's consolidated statement of operations.\n(e)\nFor gain on disposition of business, income tax expense resulted in a combined tax rate of 71.4%, which was significantly in excess of the statutory rate primarily due to a lower tax basis in the assets sold, specifically the goodwill associated with the disposition. For the retirement of debt and related refinancing charges, income tax benefits were calculated such that the combined tax rate was 38.9% for 2016. For the restructuring and integration charges and other items, income tax impacts, where recorded, were primarily calculated using combined tax rates of 38.7% for both 2017 and 2016. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, other items also includes the impact of recording a valuation allowance against certain net operating loss carryforwards in a geography impacted by hurricanes. The following table summarizes the income tax (benefit) expense associated with the special items:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(dollars in millions)\nGain on disposition of business\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n84\nRetirement of debt and related refinancing charges\n—\n—\n—\n(18)\nRestructuring and integration charges\n(16)\n(9)\n(41)\n(32)\nOther\n—\n(3)\n(1)\n(9)\nCertain income tax benefits (1)\n(106)\n—\n(106)\n—\n$\n(122)\n$\n(12)\n$\n(148)\n$\n25\n(1) - For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, certain income tax benefits represents the net tax benefit associated with the TCJA. The company recorded an estimated net income tax benefit of $106 million associated with the TCJA, including a deferred income tax benefit of $115 million primarily due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities and reserves at the new combined tax rate of 25.5%, partially offset by $9 million of current tax expense primarily due to the mandatory repatriation toll charge on undistributed foreign earnings and profits.\n(f)\nRepresents the impact of amortization expense on diluted earnings per common share, net of the income tax benefit. The income tax benefit was primarily calculated using a combined tax rate of 38.7% for both 2017 and 2016. The pre-tax amortization expense that is excluded from the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense is recorded in the company's statements of operations as follows:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(dollars in millions)\nAmortization of intangible assets\n$\n20\n$\n18\n$\n74\n$\n72\nEquity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes\n4\n4\n16\n16\n$\n24\n$\n22\n$\n90\n$\n88\n(g)\nRepresents the impact of ETB recorded in income tax expense.\n(h)\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, excluded revenue represents reported revenue for the Focus Diagnostics products business, which was sold on May 13, 2016.\n3)\nOther operating expense (income), net includes miscellaneous income and expense items related to operating activities. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, other operating expense (income), net principally consists of non-cash asset impairment charges. Other operating expense (income), net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, principally consists of a gain on an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, partially offset by non-cash asset impairment charges.\n4)\nOther income (expense), net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to non-operating activities, such as gains and losses associated with investments, other non-operating assets and early retirement of debt. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, other income (expense), net includes a $7 million gain on the sale of an interest in an equity method investment, which is partially offset by non-cash asset impairment charges associated with certain investments of $6 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, other income (expense), net includes $48 million of charges on the retirement of debt associated with the March 2016 cash tender offer and non-cash asset impairment charges associated with certain investments of $7 million.\n5)\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the company repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock for $100 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the company repurchased 4.6 million shares of its common stock for $465 million. At December 31, 2017, $917 million remained available under the company's share repurchase authorizations.\n6)\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operations benefited from a $62 million decrease in 2017 tax payments associated with the realization of a deferred tax benefit and improved operating performance. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operations included $91 million of income taxes paid associated with the sale of Focus Diagnostics products and $47 million of pre-tax cash charges, or $30 million after the related cash tax benefit, related to the retirement of debt, which were partially offset by $54 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swap agreements.\n7)\nThe outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense and ETB represents management's estimates for the full year 2018 before the impact of special items, amortization expense and ETB. Further impacts to earnings related to special items may be incurred throughout 2018. Additionally, the amount of ETB is dependent upon employee exercise behavior and the company's stock price, which are difficult to predict. The following table reconciles our 2018 outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense and ETB to the corresponding amount determined under GAAP:\nLow\nHigh\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n5.42\n$\n5.62\nRestructuring and integration charges (a)\n0.59\n0.59\nAmortization expense (b)\n0.53\n0.53\nETB (c)\n(0.04)\n(0.04)\nAdjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense and ETB\n$\n6.50\n$\n6.70\n(a)\nRepresents estimated full year pre-tax charges of $110 million primarily associated with systems conversions, integration and workforce reductions incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. Income tax benefits were calculated using a combined tax rate of 25.5%.\n(b)\nRepresents the estimated impact of amortization expense for 2018 on the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. Amortization expense used in the calculation is as follows (dollars in millions):\nAmortization of intangible assets\n$\n82\nAmortization expense included in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes\n16\nTotal pre-tax amortization expense\n$\n98\nTotal amortization expense, net of an estimated tax benefit\n$\n73\n(c)\nRepresents the estimated impact of ETB.\n8)\nThe outlook for 4% to 5% revenue growth in 2018 represents management's estimates for 2018 versus 2017 reported revenues adjusted to reflect the impact of new revenue recognition rules that are effective January 1, 2018. Under the new rules, the Company will report uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe following table reconciles our 2017 net revenues determined under current revenue recognition rules with 2017 net revenue adjusted to reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition rules:\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\n(dollars in millions)\n2017 Revenue on an adjusted basis:\nNet revenues\n$\n1,899\n$\n1,943\n$\n1,931\n$\n1,936\n$\n7,709\nAdjustment for adoption of new revenue\nrecognition rules\n(82)\n(79)\n(75)\n(71)\n(307)\n2017 Revenue on an adjusted basis\n$\n1,817\n$\n1,864\n$\n1,856\n$\n1,865\n$\n7,402\n2018 Revenue outlook:\nLow\nHigh\n2017 Revenue on an adjusted basis\n$\n7,402\n$\n7,402\n2018 Equivalent revenue growth\n4\n%\n5\n%\n2018 Revenue outlook\n$\n7,698\n$\n7,772\n releases/quest-diagnostics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-provides-guidance-for-full-year-2018-increases-dividend-11-to-050-per-quarter-300591487.html\nSOURCE Quest Diagnostics", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/quest-diagnostics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-provides-guidance-for-full-year-2018-increases-dividend-11-to-050-per-quarter-300591487.html", "http://www.questdiagnostics.com/", "http://www.QuestDiagnostics.com/investor"], "published": "2018-02-01T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:15:19.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
