Copies of it were posted Tuesday to Chinese websites that cover the entertainment industry.\nThe number of theaters accounts for roughly 10 percent of China's total, with quotas issued for each major city, province and autonomous region.\nChina, the world's second-biggest film market, saw movie ticket sales rise 13.5 percent last year to over $8.6 billion. Chinese-made movies accounted for 54 percent of ticket sales, with baldly nationalistic action thriller \"Wolf Warrior 2\" topping the box office.\nThe ruling Communist Party is anxious to promote more productions with patriotic themes and exercises broad control over scripts and shooting permits.\nIt also routinely manipulates ticket sales and movie release dates, including limiting the number of foreign films that can be shown and banning them entirely for certain periods.\nThat helps pump-up sales for domestic productions, although patriotic themes don't always win out. Recent successes have included films glorifying materialism and complex interpersonal relationships, such as the Tiny Times series.\nAs part of party leader and President Xi Jinping's ideological drive, the party has also sought to crack down on internet content deemed frivolous or immoral.\nThat includes online games such as the Japanese hit \"Travel Frog,\" although the denouncements appear to have done little to dampen public enthusiasm for them and the authorities are eager to keep the internet open as a conduit for business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T10:21:47.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
