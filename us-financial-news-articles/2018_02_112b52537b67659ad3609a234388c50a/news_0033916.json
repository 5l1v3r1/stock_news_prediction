The proposal did not pass, with 67.8 percent of shareholders voting against it.\nAnother proposal urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China and to report results back to the public. The proposal was defeated, with 94.4 percent of shareholders voting against it.\nApple had recommended that shareholders vote against both of the measures.\nShareholders approved four measures put forth by the company, including a required “say on pay” vote to approve pay for executives and a measure on re-electing the current directors.\nShares of Apple were up 0.1 percent at $162.84.\nReporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T20:36:21.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
