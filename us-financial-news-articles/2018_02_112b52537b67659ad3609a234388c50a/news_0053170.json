Best.\nLast week CBL’s newly hired chief operating officer departed while CBL said it would exit the French business and that “all exit options” were being considered, including a sale.\nCBL shares have not traded since the company requested a halt on Feb. 5. The company is due to report half-year results on Feb. 27 and has said it is “working towards a capital raise”.
