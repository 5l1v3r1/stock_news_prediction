That is a very strange time, if in fact he is trying to show a warming,” Mattis said, referring to Kim Jong Un.\nU.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis joins White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders for the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S. February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Mattis will meet his Italian counterpart in Rome and will attend a counter-Islamic State meeting.\nPyongyang conducted its largest nuclear test last year and in November tested its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile that experts said has the range to reach anywhere in the United States.\nU.S. President Donald Trump and the North Korean leadership traded insults and threats of nuclear war as tensions rose, with Trump repeatedly dismissing the prospect or value of talks with North Korea.\n“On a political level in Seoul, there is no wedge that can be driven between us by North Korea,” Mattis said, echoing comments made by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence.\nPence, who was in South Korea for the Olympics, has said the United States and South Korea were closely aligned in their approach to dealing with North Korea.\nA visit by Moon to the North would enable the first summit between leaders from the two Koreas since 2007, and would mark only the third inter-Korean summit to take place.\nReporting by Idrees Ali, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T06:42:54.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
