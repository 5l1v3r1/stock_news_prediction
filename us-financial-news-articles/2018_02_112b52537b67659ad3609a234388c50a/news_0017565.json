The deals have historically performed well, and between 1993 and 2015 just over 70 of the more than 8,500 tranches issued – primarily the more junior slices of the fund – experienced a principal impairment, according to Moody’s Investors Service. \nDespite its performance and structure as a long-term holder of debt, the funds fell under the Dodd-Frank risk-retention rule, forcing managers to hold a portion of their fund. \nThe LSTA sued and the case bounced through the court system for more than three years. At question was the word “transfer” and who is the transferee and who is the transferor. It also questioned whether CLOs should hold 5 percent of their fund or 5% of the equity tranche, the riskiest slice of the deal. \n“The judges recognized that the statutory language did not give the agencies the right to tag managers as securitizers and their analysis was spot on,” Ganz said. \nThe ruling will allow the CLO market, which has been off to a strong start with more than $9.9 billion of funds arranged through February 8, to save money as managers will no longer have to buy some of their fund in order to meet the risk-retention requirement.
