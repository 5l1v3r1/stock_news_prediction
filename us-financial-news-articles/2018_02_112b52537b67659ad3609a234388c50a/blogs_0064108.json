She has previously announced she is quitting her acting career and stepping down from her existing charitable work.\n“We wait a couple of months and then we can hit the ground running but up until then I‘m pretty excited,” she said.\nBritain's Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum held at Aviva in London, February 28, 2018 .

I have been fortunate enough to meet with some incredible women and organizations in the UK that are doing work here, but also knowing that some of the work I’ve done in the past has been in Commonwealth countries.”\nThe Royal Foundation focuses on issues such as helping young people, wildlife conservation, cyberbullying and supporting the military, most notably through the Invictus Games for wounded or disabled veterans which Harry founded.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Last year, the princes were widely praised for leading a campaign to tackle the stigma of mental health illness and speaking out about how they had personally suffered following the death of their mother Princess Diana in a Paris car crash in 1997.\n“We’re pretty tied up with planning a wedding at the moment but we’re really looking forward to working as a pair and as a four going forward and hoping to make as much of a difference where we can,” Harry said.\nThe four were pictured together leaving a service on Christmas Day on the queen’s Sandringham estate but the event on Wednesday marked the first time the group - dubbed the “Fab Four” by media - had all attended an official event.\nAsked if there were any disagreements with the family working closely together, William joked: “Oh, yes!”\nHarry added: “They come so thick and fast. Working as family does have its challenges, of course it does. But we’re stuck together for the rest of our lives.”\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:05:10.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
