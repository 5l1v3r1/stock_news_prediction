The Riksbank also declined to comment.\nThe Swedish central bank has been among the most aggressive central banks around the world, betting that negative rates and a hefty bond-buying program would lift inflation by weakening Sweden’s currency, the crown.\nThat seems to have largely succeeded, with inflation at or around the 2 percent target for most of last year. The question now is when to start normalizing monetary policy, with the official forecast being a first rate hike in the second half of this year.\nBoth Floden and Deputy Governor Henry Ohlsson dissented against a decision in December to bring forward the reinvestment of maturing bonds, effectively making policy more expansionary this year. Ohlsson was alone in entering a reservation against this week’s decision to keep the key repo rate on hold at -0.50 percent. He wanted an immediate hike.\nReaching political agreement over new candidates has proved difficult and was a key factor in the renewal of Governor Stefan Ingves’ mandate last year, potentially extending his tenure to 17 years.\nMandates are normally extended by five or six years, but it was not clear for how long Floden’s term at the Riksbank would be extended.\nReporting by Daniel Dickson and Johan Sennero; editing Niklas Pollard, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:57:59.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
