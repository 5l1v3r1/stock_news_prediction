This is simply not acceptable to the Welsh government, or the people of Wales who have voted for devolution in two referendums,” the Welsh government said.\nPrime Minister Theresa May’s government says it wants to make unspecified exceptions to their powers where it deems it necessary for overall British unity, and that is the stumbling block in talks.\nBy introducing its own bill now, the Scottish government can ensure enough time for it to be made effective before Brexit legislation is passed in Britain’s national parliament in London, the Scottish bill said.\nIt added: “It is a bill which prepares Scotland’s devolved laws for the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union. This means that EU laws currently in force will be retained after withdrawal and the Scottish government will be given the tools needed to make sure these laws keep working after withdrawal.”\nThe Scottish challenge to Prime Minister Theresa May’s authority comes after her government indicated on Monday it would go no further in offering concessions to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in reaching agreement over the EU (Withdrawal) Bill.\nScotland’s first minister said earlier that the Scottish parliament would not consent to the UK legislation as it stands.\n“I will not sign up to something that effectively undermines the whole foundation on which devolution is built,” Nicola Sturgeon told BBC radio.\nReporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; Editing by Michael Holden, Guy Faulconbridge and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T15:59:27.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
