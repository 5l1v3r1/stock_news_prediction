We want to continue to drive and make savings,” he added.\nTokyo’s overall budget, after several revisions, now stands at $12.6 billion, of which $5.6 billion are the organizing committee’s budget for staging the Games.\nThe IOC contributes some $1.7 billion in cash and services to the organizing committee.\nThe Japanese capital has already eclipsed all of its Olympic predecessors in terms of domestic sponsorship proceeds, raking in close to $3 billion, almost three times more than any previous host city.\n”(Savings) are at $2.5 billion already,“ Coates said. ”I think there is a hesitancy (from Tokyo) particularly given the extraordinary revenues that are coming in from national sponsors... because they do not want to take any chances.\n“Money for the organising committee is not an issue. But we will keep pushing.”\nThe reforms cover reduced costs for bidding for the Olympics as well as organizing the Games. Bidders must also present specific legacy plans before they are awarded the event to avoid littering cities with white elephants, as is often the case.\nThe IOC was alarmed by the withdrawal of four cities campaigning for the 2022 Winter Olympics over size and cost concerns, prompting a “complete rethink”, Coates said.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T09:20:03.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
