He served with the Yugoslav anti-aircraft defenses,” Milutin Dragicevic, who described himself as a distant relative told Reuters.\n(Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2EZMedo )\nIn 1999 NATO planes bombed targets in Montenegro and Serbia which together formed rump-Yugoslavia at the time, to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Serbia’s then southern province of Kosovo.\nMontenegro, the smallest of all former Yugoslav republics, became the 29th country to join NATO last May.\nState prosecutor Lepa Medenica, assistant directors of police Enis Bakovic and Dragan Blagojevic and spokesman Tamara Pavicevic address a news conference in Podgorica, Montenegro February 22, 2018.
