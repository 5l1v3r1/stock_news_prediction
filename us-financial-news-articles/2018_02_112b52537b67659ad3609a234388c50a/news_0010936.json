If the opening's tomorrow weirdly up because of some problem we don't even know â€¦ don't bite. Let it come in,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nBased on a pattern he has noticed in the stock market's intraday moves, Cramer encouraged investors to keep their eyes on the clock.\n\"The market tends to bottom intraday between 11:00 and 2:30, but if it doesn't rally, then there's a lot of forced selling that comes from margin clerks,\" Cramer said. \"So quarter to 3:00 is make or break. So if you want to buy a little, don't buy [at] the opening. Wait until 11:00 when Europe is closing. Be sure not to buy all of it, because at 2:30, we'll find out whether it's going to hold. If it doesn't, we're going to have to wait until the next day to buy a little more.\"\nAll things considered, Cramer determined that if he were an investor, he wouldn't run away with the weak hands.\n\"I am not going to flee this market,\" he said. \"I'm going to look at individual stocks that aren't impacted and maybe do some buying.\"\nWATCH: Cramer takes caller questions during sell-off show chapters Cramer's sell-off strategy: Spotting the market's bottom 21 Hours Ago | 08:25 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T02:07:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
