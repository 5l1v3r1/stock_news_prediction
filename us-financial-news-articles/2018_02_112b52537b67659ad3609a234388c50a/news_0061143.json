He was a key character in Michael Lewis’ best-selling book “The Big Short” and was depicted by actor Steve Carrell in the movie based on the book. \nThe investor downplayed any concerns over bank leverage or how much a company borrows for its assets versus its equity capital. He cited how Citigroup had 35 to 1 leverage before the financial crisis, compared to just 10 to 1 today. \n“I think three, four years from now [Citigroup] will be levered 13 [or] 14 to 1,” he said. “I don’t see systemic risk these days.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T18:41:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
