The small-cap index is down more than 3 percent year-to-date, while the Dow and S&P are both down around 2 percent. \nHow far could small-caps fall? To determine an exact level, Gordon draws a trendline from IWM small-cap ETF's 2009 lows, with the line ending at around $125. Since IWM was trading at around $147 on Thursday, this means that IWM could potentially see a 15 percent plunge from current levels. \nBut since there's a way to go before IWM would hit $125, Gordon wants to look at another key technical indicator before determining that IWM could plunge that low. He draws a line connecting the lows from 2016 and points out that with the recent fall, IWM has actually broken below trend, an occurrence that could serve as a warning sign for small-caps. \n\"We came back on the bounce, we've retested this resistance,\" he explained. \"I think that's going to be the catalyst that gives us a potential push down on our decision point of $125.\" \nFor a shorter-term trade on IWM, Gordon wants to buy the Feb. 23 weekly 145-strike puts and sell the Feb. 23 weekly 140-strike puts for a total cost of 81 cents, or $81 per options spread. This means that should IWM close above $145 on Feb. 23 expiration, then Gordon would lose the $81 he paid to make the trade. \nBut should IWM close below $140 on Feb. 23, Gordon could make a maximum reward of $419. \nThe IWM was down more than 1 percent on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T23:43:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
