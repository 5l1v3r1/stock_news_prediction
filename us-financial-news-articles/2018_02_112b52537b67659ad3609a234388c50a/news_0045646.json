Currencies from Brazil, Mexico and Chile treaded water, while the Colombian peso weakened 0.8 percent. Traders have been anxiously awaiting new hints over the Fed's strategy in coming months following an unexpectedly strong increase in wages, which stoked concerns of inflationary pressure. \"Investors expect the Fed to strike a firmer tone over the outlook for interest rates going forward,\" Banco Bradesco economists wrote in a note to clients. Higher U.S. rates could draw capital away from higher-yielding but riskier emerging markets. Stock markets in Latin America were mostly higher, with Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rising for a sixth straight session. Shares of Centrais El√©tricas Brasileiras SA jumped for a second day in a row and were the biggest gainers on the index on investor optimism over plans to privatize the state-owned power utility.
