Slideshow (2 Images) \nFinland’s Iivo Niskanen made much of the early running in the race but the Norwegians took over with three laps left and an epic internal battle for medals unfolded. \nKrueger made his break for glory with little more than a lap to go, striking out on his own and leaving the rest of the field struggling to find an answer. \nThe 28-year-old built up a lead of more than 20 seconds before his Norwegian team mates Sundby and Holund struck back, breaking away from the chasing pack to try to reel him in. \nThough they managed to close the gap considerably, it was too little, too late as Krueger held on to cross the line and claim the gold medal in a thrilling finish.
