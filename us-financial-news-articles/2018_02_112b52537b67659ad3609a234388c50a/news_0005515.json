And now, they’re asking the people.”\nAround 59 percent of Ecuadoreans plan to vote in favor of limiting re-election, versus some 27 percent who plan to vote against it, according to pollster Opinion Publica Ecuador. A handful of other surveys found a similar trend.\nCorrea, however, says Moreno is a “traitor” seeking to annihilate him politically.\nWhile he has been living in Brussels with his Belgian wife since leaving office, Correa has returned several times to whip up support during campaign stops across Ecuador.\n“They’re trying to destroy everything that has to do with Correa,” he told Reuters in an interview, flanked by several lawmakers who still call him “president.”\nThe economist remains popular in some quarters for his welfare policy and an oil-fueled boom at the start of his decade-long presidency.\n“There have been no changes with Moreno. He’s an ungrateful traitor because he does not recognize everything Correa did,” said security guard Jose Delgado, 58.\nBut many Ecuadoreans are tired of Correa’s confrontational style and want to turn over a new leaf.\nShould Moreno score a resounding win on Sunday, he could shed some Correa-era cabinet members and feel emboldened to push through economic reforms.\nA loss could dampen his presidency as Correa would likely seek office again.\nThe vote includes six other questions on issues ranging from new anti-corruption measures to limiting mining and oil production in environmentally-sensitive areas. Results are expected around 8 p.m. local time (0100 GMT).\nWriting by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T08:34:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
