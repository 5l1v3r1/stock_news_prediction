(ALFA), the US manufacturer of rapid, point-of-care (POC) medical devices, today announced that the US FDA granted the first 510(k) clearance for ALFA’s iFOB with Driven Flow™ Technology. The Instant-view-plus iFOB 510(k) clearance is indicated for professional, CLIA-waived, and over-the-counter (OTC) users. The immunoassay identifies human blood in feces, a possible symptom of pre-cancerous polyps and Colorectal Cancer (CRC). ALFA’s iFOB test requires only one drop of sample solution with the result appearing as soon as 1 minute, demonstrating a 5-fold increase in speed in comparison to standard lateral flow assays.\n“Improving rapid, POC diagnostics has been a major focus at ALFA throughout our 21 years, and Driven Flow™ Technology is a pinnacle achievement of our successes,” states Dr. Chai Bunyagidj, President and CEO. “Receiving this 510(k) clearance accomplishes a significant milestone for us and, we believe, all rapid, POC diagnostic test end-users. ALFA’s iFOB with Driven Flow™ Technology is a noteworthy improvement to our industry’s lateral flow platform because it stands poised to improve patient outcomes.”\nOver the past few years, iFOB tests, also known as Fecal Immunochemical Tests (FIT), have gained prominence in the general public. Because positive test results may be an indication of CRC, education about the importance of CRC screening is vital. Educational efforts by the American Cancer Society (ACS) include CRC program funding, and the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable (NCCRT) launched the 80% by 2018 campaign to increase CRC screening rates. Research from both ACS and NCCRT show:\nCRC is the 3rd most common cancer diagnosed in the US CRC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death despite its high cure rate Death rates for people younger than 50 years of age increased 13% during 2000-2014 Early diagnosis yields a 90% cure rate, and iFOB tests lead to early diagnosis\nAbout Alfa Scientific:\nAlfa Scientific Designs, Inc. is a leader in the development and manufacture of rapid, immunoassay, point-of-care tests.
