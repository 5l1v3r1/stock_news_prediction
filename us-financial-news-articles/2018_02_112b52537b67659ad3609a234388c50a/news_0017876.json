Average prices for the steel-making ingredient rose 20 percent last year from 2016, the miner said.\nAustralia’s government has forecast a 20 percent fall in average iron prices this year on rising supply and moderating Chinese demand, but that is out of step with private forecasts, such as UBS and Citi, which see smaller reductions.\nRio maintained its 2018 capital expenditure forecast at around $5.5 billion, while keeping its 2018 production guidance intact after raising its iron ore shipments target by 10 million tonnes last month.\nIts growth projects include the giant Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia.\nIt has also said Africa is the largest untapped source of growth and on the sidelines of the Indaba mining conference in Cape Town said its board would this year consider a potential $450 million investment in expanding infrastructure near the Richards Bay terminal, South Africa.\nJacques acknowledged market volatility and short-term risk in China, but said the miner was confident in the world’s top commodities consumer and said global manufacturing was growing.\n“China is the main customer in relation to the mining business (but) the GDP is pretty strong across all geographies today. Mining at the end of the day is a GDP-driven industry so today we are in a good space,” he said.\nadditional reporting by Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T10:04:43.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
