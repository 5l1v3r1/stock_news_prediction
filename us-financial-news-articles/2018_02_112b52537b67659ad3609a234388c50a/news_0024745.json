They called him out and we were introduced in front of a (massive) flash. \n“It was overwhelming. He kept saying, ‘I love you’ over and over in Korean, which was extremely awkward for me. The Korean press asked me to say, ‘I love you’ back.” \nDawson’s biological mother had divorced his father and was also located but did not come to the reunion though some years later Dawson said on Twitter that they were meeting up. \nIn 2012, Dawson took up the challenge to become the head coach of South Korea’s freestyle moguls team and returned to the land of his birth. \n“The two girls and three boys that I started with in 2012 are all in the Olympics now. I was pretty excited to get them all into the home Olympics in Korea. In 2014 (in) Sochi, I only got two girls and one boy,” he said. \nThat boy, Choi Jae-woo, who finished 12th at the Sochi Games, remains the host nation’s best hope for a moguls medal in Pyeongchang. \n“It’s unbelievable how much pressure is on him. He’s ranked fourth in the world, they are expecting the world of him. It’s a little sad because they won’t let him settle in,” Dawson added.
