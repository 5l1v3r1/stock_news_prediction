Half-sister Kim Kardashian and her rapper husband Kanye West announced the arrival in January of their third child, a girl they called Chicago, who was born to a surrogate. \nJenner’s other half-sister, Khloe Kardashian, is seven months pregnant with her basketball player boyfriend Tristan Thompson. \nStormi joins Kardashian cousins North, Saint, Reign, Dream, Mason and Penelope.
