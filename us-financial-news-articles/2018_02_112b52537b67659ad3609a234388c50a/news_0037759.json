The lawsuit is seeking class-action status.\nMusso said he could not execute trades using Fidelity’s Active Trader Pro platform when the market opened on Feb. 6, according to his lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Trenton, New Jersey.\n“Considering the volatility (a day earlier), it was important for (Musso and others) ... to have access to Fidelity’s Active Trader Pro platform in order to monitor their respective investments and be able to execute fast and quick trades,” according to the complaint.\nMike Aalto, a spokesman for Boston-based Fidelity, declined to comment, citing company policy about ongoing litigation.\nReporting by Tim McLaughlin; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T00:03:54.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
