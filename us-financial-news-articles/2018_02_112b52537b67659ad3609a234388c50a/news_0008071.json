REUTERS/Vincent Kessler \nIt left its ultra easy policy unchanged last month, warning that inflation remains muted and may take several more years before it rises back to the bank’s target of almost 2 percent. \nBut with the euro zone economy motoring ahead and unemployment falling rapidly, the ECB is expected to end its more than three-year, 2.55 trillion euro ($3.17 trillion) bond purchase program by the end of this year. \n“The euro area economy is expanding robustly, with stronger growth rates than previously expected and significantly above potential,” Draghi said. “These developments bode well for economic growth, as expansions tend to be stronger and more resilient when growth is broad-based.” \nDraghi nevertheless emphasized that the ECB would be patient and persistent with policy to let underlying inflation pressures build up. \n($1 = 0.8055 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T19:11:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
