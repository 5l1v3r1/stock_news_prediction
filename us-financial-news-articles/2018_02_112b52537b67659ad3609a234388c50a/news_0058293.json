REUTERS/Russell Cheyne The cold spell has been caused by a jump in temperatures high over the Arctic, known by meteorologists as sudden stratospheric warming, which has weakened the jet stream that brings warm air in from the Atlantic to Ireland and Britain.\n“The Jet Stream weakens and so we tend to get a strong easterly flow of air and that air is really originating right from over in Siberia - so very dry, cold continental air,” Mitchell said.\nSlideshow (8 Images) The unusual weather could continue as Storm Emma, packing more snow and ice, approaches western England from Portugal and France.\nAcross London, there were severe delays on public transport. Europe’s biggest airport, Heathrow, said its runways were fully operational, although its website showed that dozens of flights had been delayed or canceled due to disruption at other airports.\nBritain’s weather service issued a severe weather warning for snow in parts of Scotland where schools were closed and council offices shut.\nIreland’s weather service issued a status red warning - the highest level of alert - for five countries in the east, including the capital Dublin after heavy overnight snowfall led to accumulations of 5 to 10 cm.\nTotal snowfall may reach 25 cm (10 inches) by Thursday, it added, prompting the closure of many schools and universities. Businesses advised workers to stay at home with some roads inaccessible and public transport operating a limited service.\nThe chief executive of Irish insurer FBD said on Tuesday she expected the snowfall would be an event for the industry, leading to frozen pipes and possible accidents, though not as severe as Tropical Storm Ophelia which battered Ireland in October.\nWriting by Guy Faulconbridge and Padraic Halpin; editing by John Stonestreet, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T11:04:32.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
