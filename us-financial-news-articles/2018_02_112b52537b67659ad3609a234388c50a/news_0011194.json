The sales are likely to generate net proceeds of $3.8 billion, according to the Bank of Montreal. \nNutrien may sell Arab Potash in the second quarter, Brownlee said. He did not give a timeline for the SQM sale. \nNutrien shares tumbled 4.5 percent to C$57.74 in Toronto as the company’s first full-year outlook disappointed investors. \nThe company, which operates six Canadian potash mines, wants to shift production to its lowest-cost facilities, said Raef Sully, president of Nutrien’s potash business. \nAll options are on the table, including closing higher-cost mines, and may be reviewed in the second half of the year, Sully said.
