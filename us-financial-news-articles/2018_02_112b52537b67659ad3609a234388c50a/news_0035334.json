I asked the photographer if he was OK too and he said he was. I think it’s getting scary to be a photographer on skiing hills,” Gut joked later with reporters.\nShe won an Olympic bronze in the downhill in Sochi four years ago, and in 2016 became the first Swiss woman to win the overall World Cup title since Vreni Schneider in 1995.\nDespite struggling for full fitness this season after suffering a knee injury, she currently tops the World Cup super-G rankings and sits seventh in the downhill.\n“I think I just went a little bit too early on my inside ski but it’s not something new that I‘m struggling a bit in GS (giant slalom) this year,” she said.\n“My Olympics aren’t over after 17 seconds. I’ll be back racing again on Saturday.”\nReporting by Mark Trevelyan and Rory Carroll; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T03:39:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
