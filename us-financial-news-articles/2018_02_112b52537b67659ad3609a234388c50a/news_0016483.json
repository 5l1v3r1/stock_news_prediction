But we're careful with all of our trade relations,\" Ferreyros said, when asked about Tillerson's remarks.\nFerreyros also praised Peru's trade relationship with Washington, despite a trade deficit with the United States. \"I'm not afraid of trade deficits,\" Ferreyros said.\nSince China first overtook the United States as Peru's biggest trade partner in 2011, thanks mostly to its appetite for Peru's metals exports, bilateral trade has surged and diplomatic ties have tightened.\nKuczynski, a former Wall Street banker, made a point of visiting China before any other nation on his first official trip abroad as president in 2016.\nUnder former president Barack Obama, the United States had hoped to counter China's rise in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region, which includes large parts of Latin America, with the sweeping Trans-Pacific trade deal known as the TPP.\nWhile President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the TPP upon taking office, the 11 remaining signatories, including Peru and Japan, have struck a similar deal that they plan to sign without the United States in March.\nTillerson, who left Peru for Colombia on Tuesday, said on Monday that Trump was open to evaluating the benefits of the United States joining the so-called TPP-11 pact in the future, which Ferreyros called \"a good sign.\"\nAll countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including China, were welcome to join TPP-11, Ferreyros said. \"But the deal has closed and countries that want to join obviously can't renegotiate the whole agreement,\" he added.\n(Reporting By Marco Aquino, Writing By Mitra Taj, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T11:04:21.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
