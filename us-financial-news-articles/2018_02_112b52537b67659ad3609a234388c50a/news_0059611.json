Defense lawyers sought fines of $5,000 per charge.\nThe Singapore government has pledged to seek public feedback on a regulatory framework covering such rentals after the cases of the two hosts prompted a plea from Airbnb that the existing framework was “untenable”.\nAirbnb, founded in 2008 in San Francisco, matches people wishing to rent out all or part of their homes to temporary guests.\nThe firm has clashed with hoteliers and authorities in cities including New York, Amsterdam, Berlin and Paris, which are limiting short-term rentals in some cases.\nCritics blame Airbnb for exacerbating housing shortages and driving out lower-income residents.\nWriting by Jack Kim; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T04:39:04.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
