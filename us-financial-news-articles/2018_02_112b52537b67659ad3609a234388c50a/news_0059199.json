The wrestler, who is currently active in the sport, has denied the charges, it said.\nReferring a person to prosecutors is frequently a precursor to arrest. Police and the Japan Sumo Association said they had no comment to make.\nThe sport’s top referee resigned in January over an incident in which he kissed and touched a teenaged referee while drunk.\nThat followed the resignation of former grand champion Harumafuji in November for injuring a fellow Mongolian wrestler while drinking at a restaurant-bar with other wrestlers.\nReporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:47:42.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
