Ukita then made a kicking motion at Svedin’s lower body. \nThe IIHF’s disciplinary panel determined the kicking motion was a clear leg movement made toward Svedin. The panel did not believe there was intent to injure but the action remains a rule violation subject to suspension. \nAs a result Ukita will miss Monday’s preliminary-round game against Switzerland. \nUkita scored late in the second period in the tournament’s opening game, tying the score at 1-1. Sweden got the winner early in the third period.
