Johan Sverdrup, one of the five largest oilfields on the Norwegian continental shelf, is due to start pumping oil in late 2019. “We think Johan Sverdrup is a prime candidate for addition to the North Sea basket,” Jonty Rushforth of Platts said at a conference. “Looking forward it is very difficult to see any other grades beyond Sverdrup that really are suitable for the benchmark on an FOB basis.” A general view of the drilling platform, the first out of four oil platforms to be installed at Norway's giant offshore Johan Sverdrup field during the 1st phase development, near Stord, western Norway September 4, 2017.

Originally based just on Brent, Platts has added more grades over time to the basket to compensate for declining output. Platts is considering introducing a quality premium for the newest addition, Troll, to encourage it to be delivered into contracts and play more of a role in setting prices. “We are discussing with the market the possibility of a prompt implementation,” Rushforth said. In addition, Platts said it will begin publishing from March 1 all cargo loading date information for the five existing benchmark grades to improve transparency. Platts also announced that it will, starting on March 26, assess the value of 11 crudes on a delivered basis to North Asia, reflecting its growing importance as the world’s largest oil importing region.
