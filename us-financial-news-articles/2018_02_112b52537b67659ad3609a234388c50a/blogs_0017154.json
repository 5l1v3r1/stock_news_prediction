Bond prices move inversely to yields. \n\"Under what scenario would that happen?\" O'Leary asked Grant. \nGrant responded with, \"There's a lot of big money managers ... that have mandates to buy bonds, plus the big pension funds\" could impact yields. \nHe also spoke on the stock market's massive swings this week. \nThe Dow traded in a more than 1,000-point range Tuesday and ended with a 567-point gain. It marked the first time in history that the Dow was both up 500 and down 500 points in the same session. \nGrant said the market is seeing a correction but cautioned investors from overreacting. \n\"I've been doing this for 43 years,\" Grant said. \"The world is not melting down. ... Some days it's ugly, but you have to put ugly in perspective.\" \nDisclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to \"Shark Tank.\" Morning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup \nSign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
