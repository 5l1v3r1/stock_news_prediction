That refers to a bank’s significance and whether its problems could spill over to affect others. Asked whether the authority was monitoring other banks for money laundering, he said that it was not limiting its supervision activity to ABLV. But he did not provide any further details or comment on the ABLV case. U.S. authorities have singled out ABLV for alleged money laundering, accusations the bank denies.
