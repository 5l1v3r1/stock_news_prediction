Other thorny issues include health reform, labour law and European policy. \nSeehofer insisted that a new coalition must stick to plans limiting additional government spending to 46 billion euros ($57 billion) through to 2021, the basis of a blueprint agreed in exploratory talks last month. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and members of parliament vote during a session of German lower house of Parliament, Bundestag, in Berlin, Germany, February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt \nThe parties have agreed on climate goals, pension contributions and family reunions for migrants. \nOn Thursday, Germany’s lower house of parliament voted to extend the rules to stop reunions of migrants until the end of July, agreed by would-be coalition partners just two days ago. The existing suspension, introduced in 2016, had been due to expire. \nMerkel’s Bavarian allies have dug in their heels against more generous migrant policies demanded by the SPD. \nA row erupted between the two sides after Tuesday’s compromise on reunions, with both trying to paint it as a victory. \nBut leading Social Democrat Manuela Schwesig struck a cautious note on migrant policy. \n“I would not speak of a success on family reunions, that would be totally exaggerated,” she told ZDF television, adding, however, that a resumption in reunions represented progress. \nThe party’s roughly 440,000 members could yet sink any deal as they have the final say in a ballot. \nThe JUSOS youth wing of the SPD, along with other leftist members, are deeply opposed to rejoining a coalition under Merkel, fearing it will decimate their support.
