Depreciation and amortization expense (including asset impairment charges) totaled $57 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $52 million in the prior year period.\nInterest expense for the fourth quarter totaled $13 million, as compared to less than $1 million in the prior year period, which reflects the interest related to the issuance of $1,550 million of debt in connection with the separation from the former parent.\nU.S. GAAP tax expense in was $27 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 30%. This compares to U.S. GAAP tax expense of $23 million, or an effective tax rate of approximately 21%, in the prior year period.

Visit delphi.com .\nUse of non-GAAP financial information\nThis press release contains information about Delphi Technologies' financial results which are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Specifically, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Operating Income represents net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expense, equity income (loss), net of tax, restructuring, separation costs, asset impairments and other acquisition and portfolio project costs. Other acquisition and portfolio project costs include costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions, including business and product acquisitions and divestitures. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of Net sales.\nAdjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to Delphi Technologies before restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. Cash Flow Before Financing represents cash provided by operating activities plus cash used in investing activities.\nManagement believes the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, management believes Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are useful measures in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nSuch non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures in the attached supplemental schedules at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release, as well as other statements made by Delphi Technologies PLC (the \"Company\"), contain forward-looking statements that reflect, when made, the Company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance and, in particular, the Company's 2018 outlook.

Our management utilizes Adjusted Operating Income in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Management also utilizes Adjusted Operating Income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to our segments, as management also believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments. Adjusted Operating Income is defined as net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expense, equity income (loss), net of tax, restructuring, separation costs, asset impairments and other acquisition and portfolio project costs. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Operating Income, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Management utilizes Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income attributable to Delphi Technologies, restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Management believes this measure is useful to investors to understand how the Company's core operating activities generate and use cash. Cash Flow Before Financing is defined as cash provided by operating activities plus cash used in investing activities. Not all companies use identical calculations of cash flow before financing therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The calculation of Cash Flow Before Financing does not reflect cash used to service debt, and, therefore, does not necessarily reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses.\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions)\nCash flows :\nNet income\n$\n65\n$\n88\n$\n319\n$\n268\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n57\n52\n201\n210\nRestructuring expense, net of cash paid\n1\n(35)\n10\n(4)\nWorking capital\n38\n10\n(194)\n(4)\nPension contributions\n(15)\n(18)\n(48)\n(52)\nOther, net\n(51)\n(29)\n101\n(46)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n95\n68\n389\n372\nCash flows from investing activities:\nCapital expenditures\n(86)\n(55)\n(197)\n(171)\nProceeds from sale of property\n4\n4\n10\n9\nCost of technology investments\n(1)\n—\n(1)\n—\nIncrease in restricted cash\n(1)\n—\n(1)\n—\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(84)\n(51)\n(189)\n(162)\nCash flow before financing\n$\n11\n$\n17\n$\n200\n$\n210\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delphi-technologies-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300601212.html\nSOURCE Delphi Technologies", "external_links": ["http://ir.delphi.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delphi-technologies-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300601212.html", "http://delphi.com/"], "published": "2018-02-21T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T16:50:31.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
