[nL3N1IY03M]\nProducers including Australia’s Woodside Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell have said they are open to negotiating new contracts with more flexibility, but they have resisted granting changes to existing deals. [nL3N1HF233]\nThe decision by state-run KOGAS to enter court-administered arbitration with Australia’s North West Shelf joint venture over pricing is the first known such case in the Asia/Pacific region. [nL4N1Q22B6]\n“Asian buyers and their counterparties have traditionally preferred to avoid litigation under long-term LNG contracts. However, the market is changing,” said James Taverner of energy consultancy IHS Markit.\nAnalysts expect more Asian cases.\nMore than 15 LNG contracts are either under price review, or have price reviews coming up this year, accounting for over 15 percent of North Asian LNG supply, said Saul Kavonic of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\nSupply contracts go into arbitration when counterparties fail to agree terms during regular term reviews, but how many of these reviews will end up in arbitration is unclear.\n“There is usually very little public information revealed about LNG arbitration cases,” said Taverner.\nTHREE STICKING POINTS The main sticking points in fixed LNG supply contracts are “take or pay” clauses forcing buyers to pay for cargoes even if they don’t need them, “destination clauses” preventing buyers from selling on cargoes, and an oil-link to the price of LNG.\nBuyer demands received support when regulators in Japan, by far the world’s biggest LNG importer, said in mid-2017 that restrictions on reselling cargoes were illegal. [nL3N1JP2E0]\nIHS’s Taverner said the industry “will be watching price reviews and the prospect of any arbitration closely.”\nAustralia’s Macquarie bank said in an earnings preview for Woodside that 2019 earnings “will fall as Pluto’s (export facility) foundation contract comes up to re-pricing” with Japan’s JERA.\nJERA has said it will cut the amount of long-term contracts and seek more flexible terms with any future deals. It has already done so with Malaysia’s Petronas. [nL4N1N02FS][nL3N1J9338]\nPoten and Partners, an LNG consultancy and brokerage, said in a note “contract sales fell to less than 22 million tonnes per year in 2017, down from more than 30 million per year in 2016.”\nThis fall came despite a 20 percent rise in global LNG demand last year.\nReporting by Henning GloysteinAdditional reporting by Jessica Jaganathan in SINGAPORE and Sonali Paul in MELBOURNE; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T09:19:53.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
