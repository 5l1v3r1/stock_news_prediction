The central bank said Wells Fargo's aggressive business strategy prioritized growth over effective risk management, leading to serious compliance breakdowns.\nWells Fargo stock fell to $60.05 in after-hours trading, down about $4 or 6 percent from its afternoon close.\nWe take this order seriously and are focused on addressing all of the Federal Reserves concerns, said Timothy Sloan, Wells Fargos president and chief executive officer, in a statement.\n\"It is important to note that the consent order is not related to any new matters, but to prior issues where we have already made significant progress, he added.\nWells Fargo's balance sheet grew steadily from the end of 2013 to 2016, but growth slowed dramatically last year as it battled to address the issues raised by the scandal.\nUnder the terms of the order, Wells Fargo must average $1.95 trillion in assets over any two-quarter period, which Fed officials said would allow the bank to continue its normal operations while halting expansion.\nThe bank must submit a plan within 60 days outlining how it plans to address the Fed's concerns and will engage independent third parties to conduct a review by September to confirm the bank has made the necessary improvements.\nThe growth halt will be in place until this review, which will be led by the San Francisco Fed and top regulatory officials in Washington, has been completed to the Fed's satisfaction, the Fed said.\n\"We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank, said Chair Janet Yellen in a statement on her final day as leader of the central bank.\nThe Fed action follows persistent compliance issues at Wells Fargo which agreed to pay $190 million in September 2016 to settle charges it created millions of phony customer accounts.\nThe scandal led to the exit of several top bank executives, including its then-CEO, John Stumpf, who retired one month later.\nWhile regulatory intervention in a banks operations and corporate governance has been rare, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency gave orders to Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, which received massive bailouts during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, regarding their business plans and boards of directors, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.
