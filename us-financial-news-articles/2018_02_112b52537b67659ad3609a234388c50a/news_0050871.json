That beat an expectation of A$343.3 million according to three analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company declared an interim dividend of A$0.34 per share, up slightly from A$0.33 last year.\nA marginal fall in the construction segment’s underlying earnings was far outweighed by a 55 percent and 48 percent rise in underlying earnings of the development and investment segments, respectively, helping the bottom line.\nThe company had flagged falling earnings in its construction business in October, two months after proclaiming the outlook as “strong”, but had said that would be offset by earnings rising in other segments.\nHalf-year revenue for the company, which has projects in Europe, the United States and Malaysia as well as Australia, came in at A$8.69 billion, up from A$7.95 billion a year ago.\nThe company also announced a buy-back of A$500 million of its shares.\nAustralian builders have been basking in a five-year construction boom, buoyed by unexpectedly resilient homebuilding as well as state-led infrastructure spending.
