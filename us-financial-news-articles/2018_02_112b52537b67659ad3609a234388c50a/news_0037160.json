It wants those banks to reduce their bad loans and re-assess how much money they invest in the bonds of various governments, to re-balance their risk exposure.\nOnce such “legacy issues” are dealt with, EDIS could become reality, Germany and several other countries say. But it’s not clear how to assess when the risks have fallen enough to introduce EDIS, who should make the assessment and what criteria they should use.\n“This has not been decided yet, it is under discussion,” the senior euro zone official said, adding ministers will have the first chance to express their views on that on Monday.\nLinked to that topic is another discussion that euro zone ministers will have on Monday on turning the euro zone bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund. Germany wants countries that apply for emergency funds from the European Monetary Fund to automatically undergo debt restructuring.\nBut many senior euro zone officials, including the head of the bailout fund, Klaus Regling, believe debt restructuring should not be done automatically and that it should be preceded by a debt sustainability analysis.\nReporting By Jan Strupczewski, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:25:51.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
