The court’s office could not immediately be reached for comment. \nAbout 4,000 mostly urban poor Filipinos have been killed by police in the past 19 months in a brutal crackdown that has alarmed the international community. \nDuterte has many times dared the ICC to bring him to trial and said he was willing to rot in jail to save Filipinos from the scourge of crime and drugs. \nHis tirades against the court are notorious, and include calling it “bullshit”, “hypocritical” and “useless”. \nHe has threatened to withdraw his country’s ICC membership and said lawyers in Europe were “rotten”, “stupid”, and had a “brain like a pea”. \nPolice say those thousands of killings were during legitimate anti-drugs operations in which the suspects had violently resisted arrest. Duterte has repeatedly told police they can kill if their lives are in danger. \nBut human rights groups and Duterte’s political opponents accuse him of inciting murder and say he refuses to investigate allegations that police are planting evidence, fabricating reports and executing users and dealers in cold blood. \nDuterte and the police deny those accusations. \nA Philippines lawyer filed the ICC complaint against Duterte and at least 11 senior officials in April last year, saying crimes against humanity were committed “repeatedly, unchangingly and continuously” and killing drug suspects and other criminals had become “best practice”. \nSince it was established in 2002, the ICC has received over 12,000 complaints or communications, nine of which have gone to trial. \nRoque said “domestic enemies of the state” were behind the complaint and the ICC had no jurisdiction when it came to the war on drugs, which was a sovereign issue. \nPending cases in the Philippine courts showed that domestic legal processes had not been exhausted, so the ICC would have no justification to go beyond its preliminary examination, he added.
