There was also no information on exchanges.\nThe first operations will be carried out through a private sale, Maduro has said, without elaborating.\nVenezuelan Cryptocurrency Superintendent Carlos Vargas last week said the government was expecting to draw investment from investors in Turkey, Qatar, the United States and Europe.\nThe value of the entire petro issuance of 100 million tokens would be just over $6 billion, according to details given by Maduro in recent months, though no new price information was provided on Tuesday.\nThe tokens will each be valued at and backed by a barrel of Venezuelan crude oil, Maduro has said.\nAdvisers working for the government have in the past recommended that 38.4 percent of the petros should be sold in a private auction at a discount of 60 percent.\nMaduro says his government is the victim of an “economic war” led by opposition politicians with the help of the government of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nSanctions levied last year by Washington block U.S. banks and investors from acquiring newly issued Venezuelan debt, effectively preventing the nation from borrowing abroad to bring in new hard currency or refinance existing debt.\nAccording to the document published on Tuesday, the petro will not be a token on the Ethereum network, as was previously disclosed in a whitepaper provided by the government.
