(“Buckeye”) (NYSE:BPL) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Buckeye reported net income attributable to Buckeye’s unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $126.3 million compared to net income attributable to Buckeye’s unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $107.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $289.9 million compared to $255.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income attributable to Buckeye’s unitholders was $0.85 per diluted unit for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.78 per diluted unit for the fourth quarter of 2016. The diluted weighted average number of units outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 147.3 million compared to 138.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in the weighted average number of units outstanding is attributable to the units issued during the year to fund a portion of the buyout of the public unit holders of VTTI Energy Partners LP, 2017 capital expenditures and a portion of 2018 capital expenditures.\n“Buckeye’s strong results for the fourth quarter continue to highlight the benefit of our diversified portfolio of global assets,” said Clark C. Smith, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The improved performance of our Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment resulted primarily from increased pipeline and terminal throughput volumes during the quarter, with incremental revenue contributions from the first phase of our Michigan/Ohio expansion project as well as strong heating oil volumes due to colder weather in the markets we serve. Increasing petroleum product prices also drove improved settlement revenues for this segment. Results from our Global Marine Terminals segment increased in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of our investment in VTTI and improved operating performance from our Buckeye Texas Partners joint venture. Lower capacity utilization during the quarter, driven by the departure of a long-term customer at one of our facilities earlier in the year and weaker overall storage market conditions, partially offset these improvements. We have undertaken certain tank conversion projects that we expect will better align our product storage capabilities with evolving customer demand, and our commercial teams continue to advance our recontracting efforts. Our Buckeye Merchant Services business delivered strong and stable returns, while driving a record contribution to the other segments during the quarter.”\nDistributable cash flow (as defined below) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $188.9 million compared to $170.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Buckeye also reported distribution coverage of 1.01 times for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCash Distribution. Buckeye also announced today that its general partner declared a cash distribution of $1.2625 per limited partner unit (“LP Unit”) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The distribution will be payable on February 27, 2018 to unitholders of record on February 20, 2018. This cash distribution represents a 2.0 percent increase over the $1.2375 per LP Unit distribution declared for the fourth quarter of 2016. Buckeye has paid cash distributions in each quarter since its formation in 1986.\nFull Year Results. For 2017, Buckeye reported net income attributable to Buckeye’s unitholders of $478.8 million compared to net income attributable to Buckeye’s unitholders for 2016 of $535.6 million. This year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to increased interest and debt expense related to the long-term debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2016 to partially fund the acquisition of a 50% equity interest in VTTI B.V. and increased depreciation and amortization expense related to assets placed in service during the year. Additionally, the Global Marine Terminals segment was impacted by lower capacity utilization driven by weaker overall storage market conditions, which was substantially offset by contributions from our investment in VTTI.\nNet income attributable to Buckeye’s unitholders was $3.32 per diluted unit for 2017 compared to $4.03 per diluted unit for 2016. The diluted weighted average number of units outstanding for 2017 was 143.1 million compared to 132.9 million for 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $1,113.9 million compared to $1,028.0 million for 2016. Distributable cash flow for 2017 was $731.9 million compared to $726.6 million for 2016. Buckeye reported distribution coverage of 1.00 times for 2017 compared to 1.09 times in 2016.\n“Our 2017 Adjusted EBITDA benefited significantly from our investment in VTTI, the contribution from our Michigan/Ohio expansion project and other smaller growth capital projects executed during the year,” said Mr. Smith. “Looking forward to 2018, we remain focused on executing on a number of strategic initiatives and investment opportunities across our diverse portfolio of assets, including our VTTI global platform. We believe these investments will position us to continue generating stable, long-term returns for our unitholders.”\nConference Call.

(NYSE:BPL) is a publicly traded master limited partnership which owns and operates, or owns a significant interest in, a diversified global network of integrated assets providing midstream logistic solutions, primarily consisting of the transportation, storage, processing and marketing of liquid petroleum products and crude oil. Buckeye is one of the largest independent liquid petroleum products pipeline operators in the United States in terms of volumes delivered, with approximately 6,000 miles of pipeline. Buckeye also uses its service expertise to operate and/or maintain third-party pipelines and perform certain engineering and construction services for its customers. Buckeye’s global terminal network, including through its interest in VTTI B.V. (“VTTI”), comprises more than 135 liquid petroleum products terminals with aggregate tank capacity of over 176 million barrels across our portfolio of pipelines, inland terminals and marine terminals located primarily in the East Coast, Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States as well as in the Caribbean, Northwest Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Buckeye’s global network of marine terminals enables it to facilitate global flows of crude oil and refined petroleum products, offering its customers connectivity between supply areas and market centers through some of the world’s most important bulk liquid storage and blending hubs. Buckeye’s flagship marine terminal in The Bahamas, Buckeye Bahamas Hub, is one of the largest marine crude oil and refined petroleum products storage facilities in the world and provides an array of logistics and blending services for the global flow of petroleum products. Buckeye’s Gulf Coast regional hub, Buckeye Texas Partners, offers world-class marine terminalling, storage and processing capabilities. Through its 50% equity interest in VTTI, Buckeye’s global terminal network offers premier storage and marine terminalling services for petroleum product logistics in key international energy hubs. Buckeye is also a wholesale distributor of refined petroleum products in certain areas served by its pipelines and terminals. More information concerning Buckeye can be found at www.buckeye.com .\nAdjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, such as non-cash compensation expense; transaction, transition, and integration costs associated with acquisitions; certain unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and foreign currency derivative financial instruments, as applicable; and certain other operating expense or income items, reflected in net income, that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance results and business outlook, such as hurricane-related costs, gains and losses on property damage recoveries, and gains and losses on asset sales. We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense, cash income tax expense, and maintenance capital expenditures incurred to maintain the operating, safety, and/or earnings capacity of our existing assets, plus or minus realized gains or losses on certain foreign currency derivative financial instruments, as applicable. These definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are also applied to our proportionate share in the Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of significant equity method investments, such as that in VTTI, and are not applied to our less significant equity method investments. The calculation of our proportionate share of the reconciling items used to derive these VTTI performance metrics is based upon our 50% equity interest in VTTI, prior to adjustments related to noncontrolling interests in several of its subsidiaries and partnerships, which are immaterial. These adjustments include gains and losses on foreign currency derivative financial instruments used to hedge VTTI’s United States dollar denominated distributions which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and included in distributable cash flow when realized. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures that are used by our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to assess the operating performance of our business and optimize resource allocation. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to: (i) evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our business segments; (ii) allocate resources and capital to business segments; (iii) evaluate the viability of proposed projects; and (iv) determine overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. We use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare cash-generating performance of Buckeye from period to period and to compare the cash-generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to our unitholders. Distributable cash flow is not intended to be a liquidity measure.\nWe believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures used by management and that these measures are useful to investors because they aid in comparing our operating performance with that of other companies with similar operations. The Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow data presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies because these items may be defined differently by other companies. Please see the attached reconciliations of each of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to net income.\nThis press release includes that we believe to be reasonable as of today’s date. Such statements are identified by use of the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “should,” and similar expressions. Actual results may differ significantly because of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and that may be beyond our control. Among the set forth in this press release are statements regarding our expectation of increasing quarterly distributions in the future. These statements are subject to, among other risks, (i) changes in federal, state, local, and foreign laws or regulations to which we are subject, including those governing pipeline tariff rates and those that permit the treatment of us as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, (ii) terrorism and other security risks, including cyber risk, adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes, environmental releases, and natural disasters, (iii) changes in the marketplace for our products or services, such as increased competition, changes in product flows, better energy efficiency, or general reductions in demand, (iv) adverse regional, national, or international economic conditions, adverse capital market conditions, and adverse political developments, (v) shutdowns or interruptions at our pipeline, terminalling, storage, and processing assets or at the source points for the products we transport, store, or sell, (vi) unanticipated capital expenditures in connection with the construction, repair, or replacement of our assets, (vii) volatility in the price of liquid petroleum products, (viii) nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, (ix) our ability to integrate acquired assets with our existing assets and to realize anticipated cost savings and other efficiencies and benefits and (x) our ability to successfully complete our organic growth projects and to realize the anticipated financial benefits. You should read our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, for a more extensive list of factors that could affect results. We undertake no obligation to revise our to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today’s date except as required by law.\nThis release is intended to be a qualified notice under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b). Brokers and nominees should treat one hundred percent (100.0%) of Buckeye’s distributions to non-U.S. investors as being attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, Buckeye’s distributions to non-U.S. investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate.\nBUCKEYE PARTNERS, L.P.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per unit amounts)\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue: Product sales $ 532,294 $ 508,060 $ 2,014,980 $ 1,594,240 Transportation, storage and other services 413,758 415,995 1,633,165 1,654,136 Total revenue 946,052 924,055 3,648,145 3,248,376 Costs and expenses: Cost of product sales 521,774 500,207 1,969,182 1,549,522 Operating expenses 157,555 177,571 639,563 629,942 Depreciation and amortization 73,256 66,439 269,243 254,659 General and administrative 20,988 22,361 90,975 86,098 Other, net (801 ) 513 (4,722 ) (5,187 ) Total costs and expenses 772,772 767,091 2,964,241 2,515,034 Operating income 173,280 156,964 683,904 733,342 Other income (expense): Earnings from equity investments 13,295 3,077 36,005 11,536 Interest and debt expense (56,713 ) (50,829 ) (225,583 ) (194,922 ) Other income 54 281 211 179 Total other expense, net (43,364 ) (47,471 ) (189,367 ) (183,207 ) Income before taxes 129,916 109,493 494,537 550,135 Income tax benefit (expense) 837 (564 ) (872 ) (1,460 ) Net income 130,753 108,929 493,665 548,675 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (4,436 ) (1,264 ) (14,863 ) (13,067 ) Net income attributable to Buckeye Partners, L.P. $ 126,317 $ 107,665 $ 478,802 $ 535,608 Earnings per unit attributable to Buckeye Partners, L.P.: Basic $ 0.85 $ 0.78 $ 3.33 $ 4.05 Diluted $ 0.85 $ 0.78 $ 3.32 $ 4.03 Weighted average units outstanding: Basic 146,649 137,613 142,501 132,242 Diluted 147,318 138,440 143,144 132,927\nBUCKEYE PARTNERS, L.P.\nSELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue: Domestic Pipelines & Terminals $ 274,225 $ 258,728 $ 1,035,663 $ 1,011,696 Global Marine Terminals 147,136 161,812 634,749 671,465 Merchant Services 539,783 518,729 2,038,221 1,621,915 Intersegment (15,092 ) (15,214 ) (60,488 ) (56,700 ) Total revenue $ 946,052 $ 924,055 $ 3,648,145 $ 3,248,376 Total costs and expenses: (1) Domestic Pipelines & Terminals $ 150,051 $ 140,297 $ 584,762 $ 550,394 Global Marine Terminals 105,116 129,469 421,779 423,689 Merchant Services 532,697 512,539 2,018,188 1,597,651 Intersegment (15,092 ) (15,214 ) (60,488 ) (56,700 ) Total costs and expenses $ 772,772 $ 767,091 $ 2,964,241 $ 2,515,034 Depreciation and amortization: Domestic Pipelines & Terminals $ 26,775 $ 23,009 $ 96,660 $ 87,092 Global Marine Terminals 45,193 42,114 167,443 162,438 Merchant Services 1,288 1,316 5,140 5,129 Total depreciation and amortization $ 73,256 $ 66,439 $ 269,243 $ 254,659 Operating income (loss): Domestic Pipelines & Terminals $ 124,174 $ 118,431 $ 450,901 $ 461,302 Global Marine Terminals 42,020 32,343 212,970 247,776 Merchant Services 7,086 6,190 20,033 24,264 Total operating income $ 173,280 $ 156,964 $ 683,904 $ 733,342 Adjusted EBITDA: Domestic Pipelines & Terminals $ 159,311 $ 145,160 $ 573,021 $ 568,405 Global Marine Terminals 121,737 101,519 512,821 427,229 Merchant Services 8,853 8,463 28,077 32,372 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 289,901 $ 255,142 $ 1,113,919 $ 1,028,006 Capital expenditures: (2) Domestic Pipelines & Terminals $ 77,224 $ 78,179 $ 250,454 $ 294,849 Global Marine Terminals 52,327 28,065 182,267 191,422 Merchant Services 95 — 614 45 Total capital expenditures $ 129,646 $ 106,244 $ 433,335 $ 486,316 Summary of capital expenditures: (2) Maintenance capital expenditures $ 35,476 $ 45,150 $ 144,046 $ 129,691 Expansion and cost reduction 94,170 61,094 289,289 356,625 Total capital expenditures $ 129,646 $ 106,244 $ 433,335 $ 486,316\nDecember 31, December 31, 2017 2016 Key Balance Sheet Information: Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,180 $ 640,340 Long-term debt, total (3) 4,658,321 4,217,695 Includes depreciation and amortization.
