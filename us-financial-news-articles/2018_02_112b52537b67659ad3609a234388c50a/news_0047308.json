Our Macroeconomic and Investment Research Group analyzed the late-cycle behavior of several key economic and market indicators, and concluded that the current expansion will end as soon as late 2019.”\nCurrent conditions could persist for some time—economic growth is accelerating, monetary policy is not overly restrictive, and optimism is high—but history has shown that with a recession approximately two years away, the time for caution is approaching.\nWith this quarter’s outlook, we also release timely and relevant video commentary from Portfolio Manager Adam Bloch, and Brian Smedley, Head of the Macroeconomic and Investment Research Group.\nAmong the highlights in the 32-page report and video:\nWe have reduced our allocation to corporate bonds—including investment grade, high yield, and preferreds—to the lowest level since the financial crisis, given the low absolute spreads across these sectors.\nSpreads in collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), asset-backed securities (ABS), Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), and non-Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) remain attractive relative to corporate bonds.\nWe see unemployment ultimately falling to 3.5 percent, and expect that a tight labor market will nudge wage growth higher, causing inflation to rise. Given these factors, we expect the Fed to raise rates four times in 2018.\nAnalyzing the effects of the new tax plan is a focus across sector teams. The reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent is expected to help boost cash flow primarily for smaller, domestically focused companies. Higher-levered industries and companies will be negatively affected by the new limit on deductibility of interest expense above 30 percent of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. In municipals, the cap on state and local tax deductions may prompt more migration from high-tax states to low-tax states, which would have negative credit consequences for certain issuers.\nWe expect 2018 will see further loosening of credit standards in bank loans. Covenant-lite loans now represent around three-fourths of outstanding loans, a phenomenon we would categorize as late-cycle behavior.\nThe Treasury’s recent refunding announcement reflects an increase in the government’s need to borrow. The looming increase in supply, particularly in bills and two-year and three-year maturities, combined with four rate hikes, will result in disproportionate pressure on the front-end yields and support further bear flattening of the yield curve.\nFor more information, please visit http://www.guggenheiminvestments.com .\nAbout Guggenheim Investments\nGuggenheim Investments is the global asset management and investment advisory division of Guggenheim Partners, with more than $250 billion 1 in total assets across fixed income, equity, and alternative strategies.
