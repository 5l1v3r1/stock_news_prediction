Of the 200 archaeological sites they have discovered there, around 140 are Mayan.\nSome cenotes acquired particular religious significance to the Maya, whose descendants continue to inhabit the region.\nApart from human remains, they also found bones of giant sloths, ancient elephants and extinct bears from the Pleistocene period, Mexico’s Culture Ministry said in a statement.\nThe cave’s discovery has rocked the archaeological world.\n“I think it’s overwhelming. Without a doubt it’s the most important underwater archaeological site in the world,” said Guillermo de Anda, researcher at Mexico’s National Anthropology and History Institute (INAH).\nDe Anda is also director of the Gran Acuifero Maya (GAM), a project dedicated to the study and preservation of the subterranean waters of the Yucatan peninsula.\nAccording to the INAH, water levels rose 100 meters at the end of the Ice Age, flooding the cave system and leading to “ideal conditions for the preservation of the remains of extinct megafauna from the Pleistocene.”\nThe Pleistocene geological epoch, the most recent Ice Age, began 2.6 million years ago and ended around 11,700 years ago.\nReporting by Anthony Esposito & Sharay Angulo; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T16:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T12:15:13.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
