That’s the key tail-risk from his speech.”\nSterling slid against the dollar and the euro on Friday after the European Union’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned Britain that a post-Brexit transition deal was “not a given”.\nSterling slipped 0.3 percent against the euro to 89.20 pence , its weakest since Jan. 12.\nIt also edged down 0.1 percent on the day to $1.3869 against a dollar that was weaker against most other currencies.\nSome investors wagered that Johnson’s speech would be sterling-positive.\n“We expect the speech to overshadow any other Brexit development today and its content to create a positive sentiment which could support the pound,” said IronFX analyst Peter Iosif in a note to clients.\nSterling had strengthened on Tuesday after data showed British inflation unexpectedly stayed close to its highest levels in six years in January, firming up investors’ bets that the Bank of England will raise interest rates again in May.\nThe BoE surprised financial markets last week by indicating that rates could move up faster than previously expected, as the Bank wanted to bring inflation back to its target of two percent within two years rather than three.\nIn a Reuters poll taken after the BoE’s policy meeting last week, 32 of 57 economists said the Bank would raise its key rate to 0.75 percent in May, when it publishes its next quarterly Inflation Report.\nIn a January poll, only 13 of 71 economists had a rate hike in their forecasts for next quarter.\nWages numbers due next week will be closely eyed.
