Indian demand averaged 840 tonnes over the last 10 years.\nGold demand will lag because of the higher goods and services tax (GST) on bullion purchases imposed in 2017 and measures to track gold purchases, he said.\nIn July, the GST on gold was raised to 3 percent from 1.2 percent. India has also made it mandatory for customers to disclose their tax code, or Permanent Account Number (PAN), for high-value gold purchases.\nThe government moves have disrupted the business of the small jewellers that account for nearly two-thirds of India’s total sales, Somasundaram said.\n“More changes are coming in like hall marking, responsible gold sourcing, all this will continue to disrupt the industry... It will take two years for India to reach normal demand level,” he said.\nGold is a mainstay of Indian culture, serving as the primary vehicle for household savings for hundreds of millions of people in Asia’s third-largest economy.\nGold demand in the country rose 9 percent in 2017 from 2016 to 726.9 tonnes as jewellery demand rose 12 percent from a year ago, the WGC said in a report published on Tuesday.\nReporting by Rajendra Jadhav Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:58:04.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
