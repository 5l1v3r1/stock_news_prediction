We are looking forward to the addition of the Mohegan Sun Exposition and Convention Center, slated to open in the summer of 2018, which will continue to position Mohegan Sun as the premier gaming and entertainment destination in the Northeast for years to come, while we simultaneously prepare for significant international expansion in South Korea.\"\nConsolidated operating results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2017 (unaudited):\nNet revenues of $331.5 million, relatively flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Gaming revenues of $287.0 million, relatively flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Gross slot revenues of $193.7 million, a 2.1% decrease from the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Table game revenues of $93.2 million, a 6.2% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Non-gaming revenues of $69.6 million, a 3.6% decrease from the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Income from operations of $55.0 million, an 11.3% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Net income attributable to MGE of $29.2 million compared to net loss attributable to MGE of $51.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure described below, of $76.0 million, a 9.9% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2017\nThe growth in Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations was primarily driven by increased table game revenues at Mohegan Sun, combined with our continued efforts to contain overall operating costs and expenses. The increase in net income attributable to MGE reflected the impact of a $73.8 million loss on modification and early extinguishment of debt that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, combined with the increase in income from operations.\nMohegan Sun\nOperating results (in thousands, unaudited):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\n2017\n2016\nVariance\nVariance\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 73,534\n$ 65,174\n$ 8,360\n12.8%\nIncome from operations\n$ 56,393\n$ 49,349\n$ 7,044\n14.3%\nOperating costs and expenses\n$ 206,544\n$ 209,854\n$ (3,310)\n(1.6%)\nNet revenues\n$ 262,937\n$ 259,203\n$ 3,734\n1.4%\nGaming revenues\n$ 226,746\n$ 222,180\n$ 4,566\n2.1%\nNon-gaming revenues\n$ 57,136\n$ 58,084\n$ (948)\n(1.6%)\nThe growth in Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations primarily resulted from increased table game revenues which benefited from higher year-over-year hold percentage, combined with lower entertainment and other promotional expenses. Overall revenue growth for the quarter was somewhat impacted by a difficult comparison due to Mohegan Sun's 20 th anniversary festivities which drove higher than normal business activity during the month of October 2016.

As of December 31, 2017, $35.0 million was drawn on MGE's $170.0 million revolving credit facility, while no amounts were drawn on MGE's $25.0 million line of credit. As of December 31, 2017, letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility totaled $50.2 million, of which no amounts were drawn. Inclusive of letters of credit, which reduce borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility, MGE had approximately $84.8 million of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and line of credit as of December 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by $1.7 million, or 5.7%, to $28.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $30.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The reduction in interest expense was attributable to lower weighted average interest rate driven by MGE's October 2016 refinancing and April 2017 repricing transactions. Weighted average interest rate was 6.3% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 6.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is a commonly used measure of performance in the casino and hospitality industry. EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. MGE historically has evaluated its operating performance with the non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA, which as used in this press release, represents net income before interest, depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on disposition of assets, pre-opening costs and expenses, accretion of discount to a redemption liability, loss on modification and early extinguishment of debt, income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, other non-operating income and expense and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests.\nAdjusted EBITDA provides an additional way to evaluate MGE's operations and, when viewed with both MGE's GAAP results and the reconciliations provided, MGE believes that it provides a more complete understanding of its business than could be otherwise obtained absent this disclosure. Adjusted EBITDA is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because: (1) MGE believes it enhances an overall understanding of MGE's past and current financial performance; (2) MGE believes it is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of the business in comparison to other operators within the casino and hospitality industry since Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that may not be indicative of MGE's operating results; (3) measures that are comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are often used as an important basis for the valuation of casino and hospitality companies; and (4) MGE uses Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the performance of its operating personnel and management and as a benchmark to evaluate its operating performance in comparison to its competitors.\nThe use of Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, any GAAP financial measure including net income (as an indicator of MGE's performance) or cash flows provided by operating activities (as an indicator of MGE's liquidity), nor should it be considered as an indicator of MGE's overall financial performance. MGE's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be different from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA or other similarly titled measurements used by other casino and hospitality companies, and therefore, comparability may be limited. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates certain items from net income, such as interest and depreciation and amortization. Each of these items has been incurred in the past, will continue to be incurred in the future and should be considered in the overall evaluation of MGE's results. MGE compensates for these limitations by providing relevant disclosures of items excluded in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, both in its reconciliations to the GAAP financial measure of net income and in its consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating its results. MGE strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nContact:\nMario C.
