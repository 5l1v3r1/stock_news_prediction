He will be competing in the 15 kilometer freestyle skiing.\nMatthias Hangst | Getty Images Klaus Jungbluth Rodriguez of Ecuador competes in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships on February 23, 2017 in Finland. Rodriguez founded the Ecuadorian Ski Federation with the help of the country's National Olympic Committee and has raced in international competitions before this foray into the Olympics.\nEritrea Alpine skier Shannon-Ogbani Abeda, a Canadian-Eritrean, will be representing the African country.\nHe was born in Canada, after his parents fled their home country due to a war. \nThe 21-year-old will be participating in giant slalom and slalom skiing.\nAbeda, like his fellow athletes from the warm-climate countries, hopes to promote his wintry sport.\n\"Right now my focus is to go to the Olympics, but afterward I'd like to finish school, do some coaching and get the Eritrean community on some skis,\" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\nMalaysia This Southeast Asian country is represented by two athletes.\nBorn in the capital of Kuala Lumpur, Jeffrey Webb will compete under the Malaysian flag for alpine skiing. The 18-year-old moved to the U.S. at the age of five.\nWebb's attempt to represent the country gained momentum after a Malaysian ski association was formed in 2013. He will take part in the giant slalom and slalom events.\nAtsushi Tomura | ISU | Getty Images Julian Zhi Jie Yee of Malaysia competes in Four Continents Figure Skating Championships on January 27, 2018 in Taiwan. Figure skater Julian Yee was introduced to the sport by his mother — a former official at the Ice Skating Association of Malaysia — and started doing his turns in an indoor rink. Now, his training takes place at two rinks in local malls.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak gave a shout-out to the two last week on Twitter.\n\"Good luck to Julian Yee and Jeffrey Web who will be competing in the #WinterOlympics 2018. I am confident that they will bring glory to the country!\" Najib wrote in Malay.\nNigeria Three women will compete in bobsled for the country.\nThe trio of Nigerian-Americans are former competitive sprinters. One of them, pilot Seun Adigun, who recruited the other two for the attempt, had also competed in the London Summer Olympics in 2012. \nKirill Kudryavtsev | AFP | Getty Images Nigeria's women's bobsleigh and skeleton team members Seun Adigun, Ngozi Onwumere, Akuoma Omeoga and Simidele Adeagbo attend a welcoming ceremony for the team in the Olympic Village in Pyeongchang ahead of the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Setting their sights on the 2018 Winter Games, the three set out to learn bobsled. \nInitially, it seemed like an impossible dream. The team started training in October 2016 by pushing a wooden cart in a sports center.\n\"I was trying to do my research,\" Akuoma Omeoga told NBC TV affiliate KPRC. \"Because I didn't know what bobsledding was.\" \nBeating expectations, success soon followed with their story capturing public imagination — the three have raised $75,000 through a crowdfunding campaign to finance their bold plan.\nAlso making history is Simidele Adeagbo, who represents the country in skeleton. She is also a former track and field athlete and only started training for the winter sport in recent years.\nSingapore The island nation in Southeast Asia will be represented by 18-year-old Cheyenne Goh, who was born in Singapore but moved to Canada at the age of four, where she learned to ice skate.\nShe will take part in the women's short-track 1,500 meter skating race.\nRoslan Rahman | AFP | Getty Images Singapore speed skater Cheyenne Goh skating during a training session at an ice rink in Singapore.
