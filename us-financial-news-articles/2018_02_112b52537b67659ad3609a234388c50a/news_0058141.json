The table has been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The table includes estimated amounts and percentages for this distribution and for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date (11/01/2017 â€“ 01/31/2018), from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital.\nEstimated\nAmounts of\nCurrent\nDistribution\nper share ($)\nEstimated\nAmounts of\nCurrent\nDistribution\nper share (%)\nEstimated\nAmounts of\nFiscal Year to\nDate Cumulative\nDistributions\nper share ($)\nEstimated\nAmounts of\nFiscal Year to\nDate Cumulative\nDistributions\nper share (%)\nNet Investment Income\n$0.12\n100%\n$0.48\n100%\nNet Realized Short-Term Capital Gains*\nNet Realized Long-Term Capital Gains\nReturn of Capital\nTotal (per common share)\n$0.12\n100%\n$0.48\n100%\n*includes currency gains\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes.

The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nCircular 230 disclosure: To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the U.S. Treasury, we inform you that any U.S. tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.\nClosed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio.
