Chicago fell to 1-8-1 in its past 10 contests and is in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time in a decade.\nKings goaltender Jonathan Quick made 27 saves to improve to 23-21-2 on the season. On the opposite end of the rink, Blackhawks goaltender Anton Forsberg turned aside 29 shots but fell to 6-12-3.\nLos Angeles opened the scoring with 11:29 to go in the first period. Kings center Nate Thompson won a battle for the puck along the side boards and flipped a backhand pass to Mitchell, who ripped a slap shot into the net for his fourth goal of the season and his second in the past four games. Kyle Clifford parked his 6-foot-2, 211-pound frame in front of the net to screen Forsberg.\nThe Kings made it 2-0 with 3:23 remaining in the first period. Jonny Brodzinski snapped a wrist shot from the left circle, and Andreoff redirected the puck above Forsberg’s glove for his third goal of the season.\nA power-play goal increased Los Angeles’ advantage to 3-0 with 15:56 to go in the second period. Phaneuf blasted a slap shot for his second goal in three games since the Kings acquired him from the Ottawa Senators.\nChicago cut the deficit to 3-1 when Sharp scored his seventh goal 1:42 into the third period. Defenseman Carl Dahlstrom threw a shot on net, and Sharp punched the rebound past Quick to snap an 11-game scoring drought.\nBlackhawks right winger Patrick Kane skated in his 800th career game. He did not record a shot on goal, and he finished with a minus-2 rating.\nBefore the game, the Blackhawks shipped defenseman Michal Kempny to the Washington Capitals in exchange for a conditional third-round pick in the 2018 draft. Kempny, 27, tallied three goals and 12 assists in 81 career games for Chicago.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:21:31.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
