Their signing of Neymar from Barca for a world record 222 million euros looked like a statement of intent to make their mark on this season’s competition.\nThe Brazilian has scored 28 times for PSG but was less effective in their biggest game so far and picked up an early yellow card for fouling Real defender Nacho Fernandez.\nMbappe will cost the Qatari-backed club 180 million euros when his loan deal from AS Monaco expires in June. He forced the opening goal scored by Adrien Rabiot.\nHe squandered a clear chance to restore his side’s lead in the second half, however, firing straight at Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas after being played in by Neymar.\nPSG coach Unai Emery said his side had been unfortunate and criticized referee Gianluca Rocchi for awarding Real a penalty for Giovani Lo Celso’s shirt pull on Toni Kroos and not penalizing Sergio Ramos when Rabiot’s shot hit the Madrid captain’s arm in the area in the second half.\n“We played with character but the late goals are hard for us to take,” Emery told reporters.\n“We deserved a better result. You could say the game was decided by the small details, the referee didn’t help us. From the start of the game he gave more decisions to Real. I don’t think it was a penalty (for Real) and then there’s the Ramos handball. It’s not the same criteria.”\nReporting by Richard Martin; editing by Clare Lovell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T02:27:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
