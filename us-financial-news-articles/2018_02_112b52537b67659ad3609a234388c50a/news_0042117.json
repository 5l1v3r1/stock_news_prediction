The entire Cabinet would have to step down if such a vote went through.\nZuma has been dogged by scandal since he became president in 2009. He is fighting the reinstatement of corruption charges, which were dismissed before he became president, over a 30 billion-rand ($2.52 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s.\nSouth Africa’s economy has stagnated during Zuma’s tenure, with banks and mining companies reluctant to invest because of policy uncertainty and rampant corruption.\nZuma has been living on borrowed time since Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a union leader and lawyer once tipped as Nelson Mandela’s pick to take over the reins, was elected as head of the 106-year-old ANC in December.\nRamaphosa narrowly defeated Zuma’s ex-wife and preferred successor, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, in the leadership vote, forcing him to tread carefully in handling Zuma for fear of deepening rifts in the party a year before an election.\n$1 = 11.9203 rand Reporting by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T13:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T08:54:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
