It doesn’t matter who it is, whether it’s me or Jordan or anybody else in the field, I mean there’s just no place for that.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Adelaide, South Australia; Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T03:47:01.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
