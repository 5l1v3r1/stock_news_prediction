The focus will be to see if he is indeed open to that and the rationale behind it,” said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management.\nMSCI’s gauge of equity market performance in 47 countries gained 0.35 percent and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 0.39 percent.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 164.86 points, or 0.65 percent, to 25,474.85.
