Offline customers aren’t paying electric bills, eating into Prepa’s revenues while construction bills pile up.\nThe federal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances placed the central government under what amounts to bankruptcy in May and two months later voted to move Prepa under court protection as well. Governor Ricardo Rosselló said recently he wants Prepa privatized to cut costs while attracting private partners to invest in upgrading its assets.\nPrepa’s problems have been decades in the making. It earned praise for powering Puerto Rico’s industrialization efforts in the 1940s and 1950s. But the utility became more inefficient over time as generating plants, which largely rely on fossil fuels, required major upgrades that were never made or left uncompleted. Corruption scandals around fuel purchases tarnished Prepa’s reputation and sparked lawsuits and investigations.\nFederal authorities and congressional committees are investigating Prepa over its actions following Hurricane Maria. Prepa touched off a scandal by awarding a Montana startup firm a $300 million deal to rebuild the power grid without a competitive bidding process.\n—Andrew Scurria contributed to this article\nWrite to Tom Corrigan at tom.corrigan@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T05:25:14.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
