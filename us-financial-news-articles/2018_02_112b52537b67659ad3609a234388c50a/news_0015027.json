That marked a fall of more than half from a peak of almost $20,000 in December. The currency surged more than 1,300 percent last year.\nLawmakers on Tuesday are set to probe Giancarlo and Clayton on the powers of the SEC and CFTC to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges, how the watchdogs can protect investors from extreme volatility and fraud, and the risks posed by cyber criminals intent on stealing digital tokens.\nGiancarlo and Clayton will use the hearing to showcase the efforts their agencies have made to police the market and to highlight limitations in the regulatory structure, according to their testimony published on Monday.\nThe sharp drop in bitcoin on Monday coincided with a broader sell-off in U.S. stock markets, which plummeted to their lowest levels in 2018.
