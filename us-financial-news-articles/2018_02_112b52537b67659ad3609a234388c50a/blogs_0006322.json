And we support that.\"\n\"We know Steve incredibly well. We have for a very long time. He's a visionary. He's done incredible things for the industry. What he's built is unparalleled,\" Eric Trump said. Before being elected president, businessman Donald Trump had competed with Wynn in building casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Both have since pulled out of the town.\nAsked during a \" Squawk Box \" interview whether the scandal will affect Wynn's business, Eric Trump said: \"I'm sure it will.\"\nShares of Wynn Resorts , with interests in Las Vegas and Macau off the south coast of China, have fallen about 17.5 percent since The Wall Street Journal reported Friday on the allegations of a \"pattern of sexual misconduct\" by Wynn. The Journal, citing employees, reported that the billionaire CEO pressured workers to perform sex acts. Wynn denies the allegations.\n\"It's a scary world, what's happening,\" Eric Trump said. \"A lot of this coming out in a lot of companies, and it's opening up a problem that's clearly existed for a long time. I think it's good that it's being spoken about across the board. But everyone has to have their day in court.\"\nDuring the 2016 election, Trump's father faced accusations about inappropriate sexual behavior. Donald Trump has denied the allegations made by several women to The New York Times before the election, and around the time of the release of the infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape. In the second presidential debate, Trump had admitted to bragging on the tape about kissing and groping women but insisted he actually never did any of those things.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
