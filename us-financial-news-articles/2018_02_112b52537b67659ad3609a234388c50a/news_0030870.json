He was tripped by Jaden Schwartz while on a breakaway and awarded a penalty shot, which he converted by ripping a glove-side shot past Blues goalie Carter Hutton for his 17th goal of the season to the delight of the Bridgestone Arena crowd.\nNashville goalie Pekka Rinne made 28 saves for the Predators, who have reached extra time in five consecutive games. This was certainly among the most thrilling, as they trailed 3-0 until the late-game heroics.\nJay Bouwmeester opened the scoring for the Blues at the 15:18 mark of the opening frame when he picked up the puck just outside his own blue line and rushed down the ice before unloading a slap shot from the top of the circle to beat Rinne.\nAlexander Steen doubled the lead 3:10 into the second period with another goal off the rush, pouncing on a rebound after Rinne stopped Paul Stastny’s shot.\nSchwartz made it a three-goal edge for St. Louis exactly nine minutes into the middle frame with a power-play goal coming off another rebound. Vladimir Tarasenko collected two assists, souvenirs from his 400th NHL game.\nBut the Predators showed with their third-period comeback why they’re leading the Central Division.\nCalle Jarnkrok put the hosts on the board 9:06 into the third period when he was on the spot for a rebound after Hutton stopped Mattias Ekholm’s point shot.\nWatson then took over, first potting a shorthanded tally at the 14:33 mark, by burying the rebound after Ryan Ellis was denied. Then Watson added his second of the night and seventh of the season just 75 seconds later to force OT.\nHutton stopped 29 shots in the loss.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:13:40.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
