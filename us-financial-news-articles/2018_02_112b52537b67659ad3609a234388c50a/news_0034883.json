Numis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn January, Reuters reported Rothschild had been hired to examine a listing for the company, which was formed in 2001 and is headquartered in Leeds.\nPrivate equity firm CVC acquired an 80 percent stake in the betting business from pay-television operator Sky ( SKYB.L ) just over three years ago in a deal that at the time valued it at 800 million pounds.\nIn the year ended June 2017, Sky Bet’s revenue increased to 516 million pounds ($715.5 million) from 374 million pounds in the previous period.
