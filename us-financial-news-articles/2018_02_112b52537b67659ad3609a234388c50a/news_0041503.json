I don’t think there is any risk it will have a government dominated by populist and anti-European positions.”\nNo party or coalition has sufficient support to build a clear parliamentary majority, according to the polls, but an alliance between former premier Silvio Berlusconi and two anti-EU far-right parties has the best chance of governing alone.\n“I think the only possible bulwark of a stable and pro-European government is the center-left coalition led by the PD,” Gentiloni added.\nReporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Crispian Balmer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:41:01.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
