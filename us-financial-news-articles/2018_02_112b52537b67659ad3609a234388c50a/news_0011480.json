It did not disclose financial details of the transaction. \nIt also has a joint venture with Discovery Communications, which operates the Russian versions of the Discovery Networks, Eurosport and Turner channels. In 2016 NMG also struck a partnership agreement with Viasat World. \nNMG was set up in 2008 by Bank Rossiya -- now under Western sanctions over Moscow’s role in the Ukrainian conflict -- as well as metals tycoon Alexei Mordashov and insurance group Sogaz. \nBank Rossiya no longer controls NMG, a leading private media holding in Russia, business daily Vedomosti reported in 2016.
