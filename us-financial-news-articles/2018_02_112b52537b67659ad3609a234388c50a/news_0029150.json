Gazprom has four contracts with the company until 2035.\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin and Oksana Kobzeva; Additional reporting by Vera Eckert in Frankfurt; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:32:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
