During this session, Wallerstein will detail how managed service providers can create new, recurring revenue streams, as well as leverage the aforementioned applications with Microsoft cloud services like Azure and OneDrive to create profitable opportunities while helping customers grow.\nWHO: Ernie Wallerstein, President for the Americas Enghouse Interactive; Eric Bauer VP Marketing & Business Development AudioCodes; and Evan Kirstel (Moderator), Digital Social Influencer and Business Strategist WHAT: The Modern MSP: Recurring Revenue and Business Opportunities from\nOffice 365 and S4B/Teams WHEN: Wednesday, Feb. 14, 3:00 – 3:55 pm, Room MSP-09 WHERE: ITEXPO 2018 Greater Ft. Lauderdale/Broward County Convention Center 1950 Eisenhower Boulevard Fort Lauderdale, Florida According to IDC, the cloud opportunity will exceed $500 Billion by 2020. This is a huge opportunity for MSPs, especially for those in the Microsoft Partner Ecosystem. These partners, however, have challenges to overcome. Many MSPs lack the background and know-how to sell new services, do not have the technical expertise or certifications to easily integrate new offerings and cannot afford additional time and resources to manage and support the constant evolution of the cloud market.\nBut, to succeed, they must move beyond traditional thought processes and become “modern MSPs.” This includes evolving beyond being a “one trick pony” specializing in basic cloud migration, and instead look at the latest services being adopted and demanded by businesses.\nITEXPO is billed as an annual gathering spot where telecom, IT C-level professionals, business owners, developers, and the channel learn and conduct business.\nABOUT ENGHOUSE INTERACTIVE\nEnghouse Interactive ( www.enghouseinteractive.com ) delivers technology and expertise to maximize the value of every customer interaction.
