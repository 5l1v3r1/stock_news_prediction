The Fed released a brief pre-recorded video message at that time in which Powell pledged to remain \"vigilant\" to any emerging economic risks.\nBut the video message and Tuesday's comments made no specific reference to the recent wild market gyrations. Analysts have said the increased volatility could reflect rising fears in markets that inflation will soon become a bigger threat, prompting the Fed to accelerate the pace of its rate hikes.\nPowell is certain to face questions on how the Fed plans to deal with the market turmoil when he delivers the central bank's semi-annual monetary report to Congress on Feb. 28.\nIn his comments Tuesday, Powell said the central bank had made \"great progress\" in moving closer to its goals of maximum employment and stable prices, as well as creating a financial system that is \"incomparably stronger and safer, with much higher capital and liquidity, better risk management and other improvements\" since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"Much credit for these results should go to Chairman (Ben) Bernanke and Chair Yellen. I am grateful for their leadership and for their example and advice as colleagues,\" Powell said, saluting his two predecessors.\nPowell was tapped by President Donald Trump to succeed Yellen, who has said she was disappointed that Trump did not offer her a second term.\nIn his remarks, Powell said that the Fed has been a leader over the past 25 years in improving transparency to give the public a better understanding of the decisions it has made in managing the economy.\n\"We will continue to pursue ways to improve transparency both in monetary policy and in regulation,\" Powell said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T09:23:42.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
