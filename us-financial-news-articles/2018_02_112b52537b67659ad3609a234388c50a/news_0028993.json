The company, which is itself listed, hopes to cut costs by becoming one of the first major exchanges to adopt blockchain technology, a strategy it says it will outline in March.\nRevenue from its biggest business, derivatives and over-the-counter markets, grew 4 percent to A$138.1 million.\nThe company declared an interim dividend of 107.2 Australian cents per share, up from 102 cents a year earlier.
