People may be advancing their plans to see these places in all their current glory, they note. \nThe report is based on data Squaremouth collects when people input their destination and trip costs into the site to compare policies. \nFor example, interest in the Maldives — an island chain southwest of India that is fighting rising sea levels — jumped 68 percent from 2016 to 2017. In comparison, Squaremouth's 20 most-traveled destinations saw an average increase of 15 percent in the same time period. \nUnfortunately, travel insurance doesn't cover climate change, said Carolyn Leckie, director of marketing for Squaremouth. \nBut other factors, such as the cost of the trip or the remoteness of the destination, could make it worth assessing travel insurance needs for these possible \"last chance\" trips. Maldives \nTravel interest boost: 68 percent \nThe Maldives has seen the biggest spike in travel, as the island nation uses mass tourism to raise the funds necessary to adapt to climate change. That includes relocating thousands of people and building the necessary infrastructure to accommodate them. \nThe paradise atolls, famous for their turquoise waters and idyllic beaches, may be under water by 2100, according to the United Nations. That's a fate the Maldives is trying to avoid. \nLast year, tourists flocking to the Maldives insured an average of $3,593 in nonrefundable costs, an 11 percent increase from the year before, according to Squaremouth. Those costs could include airfare, hotel, and recreational activities. \nRound-trip plane tickets from New York City to the Maldives cost around $1,000 on the low end, while hotels can range from under $50 to around $2,000 per night, depending on the level of amenities.

Last year marked the first year mass bleaching is known to have happened to the 1,400-mile-long habitat two years in a row . \nTravelers spent significantly more money when visiting Australia last year, Squaremouth found. In 2017, they insured an average of $3,412 in nonrefundable costs, a 28 percent increase from the year before. \nThe cheapest round-trip flights to Sydney, Australia from New York City go for about $1,200, while hotels can range from just under $100 to several hundred per night. AFP | Getty Images Antarctica \nTravel interest boost: 17 percent \nIncreased tourism has helped fund scientific expeditions to Antarctica, where researchers study the effects of climate change. Warming temperatures have been chipping away at the Antarctic ice and contributing to sea level rise. \nIn July, a 1 trillion ton iceberg the size of Delaware broke off the Larsen C ice shelf in western Antarctica. In March 2017, sea ice around the North and South Poles reached record lows for that time of year. \nTraveling to Antarctica is expensive. Cruises — a popular way to see the continent — can run $5,000 to $20,000, depending on the cruise line and duration of the trip. \nLast year, tourists to Antarctica insured an average of $9,279 in nonrefundable costs, a 3 percent decline from the year before, according to Squaremouth.
