Rival UniCredit targets a 7.8 percent impaired debt ratio in 2019. \nMessina said Intesa, which has so far bet on recovering bad debts internally, would consider disposals to speed up the clean-up process as requested by regulators but only at prices in line with the loans’ book values. \nTo ease potential sales, it will book 4.1 billion euros before taxes in writedowns in the first quarter, mostly on loans, taking advantage of the introduction of the new IFRS9 accounting rule. \nIt sees its core capital ratio at a healthy 13 percent after the writedowns, the same level it targets for 2021 despite a number of negative regulatory impacts. \nIntesa first signalled a shift in its strategy last month when it said it was discussing selling a portfolio of bad debts together with a stake in its debt collection unit. \nMessina said a decision on that would be taken over the next month. OVER-DELIVER \nIntesa aims to grow its net profit by 58 percent over the next four years to reach 6 billion euros in 2021, with 4 percent annual growth in fee and interest income. \nBy comparison, UniCredit forecasts 0.2 percent annual revenue growth under its plan to 2019. \n“We need to prove once again that we can do things others cannot do,” Messina said. “I think we can over-deliver on the results ... the main challenge is the Italian situation ... a recession would be a major threat to our plan.” \nIntesa’s business is concentrated in Italy, where the economy has been gradually strengthening since emerging in 2014 from its worst post-war slump. Economic growth is estimated to have reached 1.5 percent last year, the highest since 2010. \nAnalysts flag the need for Intesa to diversify away from Italy, but Messina said he did not think a cross-border merger was “a feasible project.” \nAfter rewarding shareholders with 10 billion euros in cash dividends in the past four years, Intesa is planning to pay out 85 percent of this year’s profit as dividends and gradually reduce the payout ratio to 70 percent in 2021. \nInvestors viewed the bank’s plans positively, pushing its shares up 2.5 percent by 1450 GMT, bucking a 1 percent drop in Italy’s blue-chip index as a global sell-off in equities deepened. \n“We believe Intesa ticked all the major boxes,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.
