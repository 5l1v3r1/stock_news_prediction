This letter is replete with inaccurate statements, misconceptions and factual errors, including a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between the VIX Index, VIX futures and volatility ETPs, among other things. As a result of these errors, we feel the conclusionary statements contained in this letter lack credibility.\"\nThe SEC declined to comment to Reuters and the CFTC was not immediately available for comment.\nâ€” CNBC contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T16:06:40.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
