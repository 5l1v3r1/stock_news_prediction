But that is above the 2.70 percent mark some investors had set as a tipping point for the market, though many believe equities can easily handle 3 percent or more if the economy and profits continue to grow.\nMSCI’s gauge of equity markets in 47 countries shed 0.20 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 0.25 percent as a bevy of healthcare stocks fell sharply.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.94 points, or 0.01 percent, to 26,078.83. The S&P 500 lost 6.34 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,816.09 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.52 points, or 0.17 percent, to 7,389.96.\nBoeing Co, the world’s biggest planemaker, provided the most upside to both the benchmark S&P 500 stock index and MSCI’s all-country world index.\nBoeing forecast core profit would rise to $13.80 to $14.00 a share this year, well ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $11.96, Thomson Reuters data showed.\nInvestors had been relieved when Boeing beat expectations for both earnings and revenue, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.\nThe dollar initially rose against a basket of six currencies after the Fed statement, but later gave back those gains.\nThe dollar index fell 0.08 percent, with the euro up 0.11 percent to $1.2414. The Japanese yen eased 0.28 percent versus the greenback at 109.09 per dollar.\nOil prices rebounded from earlier losses to end higher after the U.S. Energy Department said oil inventories rose for the first time in nearly three months.\nBut that outlook was offset by strong demand for gasoline and distillate products and news that OPEC countries maintained heavy supply cuts in January.\nU.S. crude rose 23 cents to settle at $64.73 per barrel and Brent settled up 3 cents at $69.05.\nU.S. gold futures for February delivery settled up $3.60 at $1,339.\nEditing by Bernadette Baum; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:10:22.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
