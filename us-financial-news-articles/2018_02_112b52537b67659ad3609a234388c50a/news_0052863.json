A week ago Kelly set a Friday deadline for resolving the cases of Kushner and dozens of administration officials like him. \n\"I will let General Kelly make that decision and he's going to do what's right for the country and I have no doubt he'll make the right decision,\" Trump said about the Kushner case at a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
