Residents of some states with higher rates of land titling said they did not feel more secure, while people in states with lower rates did.\n“You can look at it positively and say: ‘They are doing OK even though they don’t have formal documentation’,” said Malcolm Childress, executive director of Land Alliance, a Washington D.C.-based think tank that compiles the PRIndex.\n“But the flip side is maybe they are feeling a false sense of security, and don’t know how vulnerable they are,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at a land conference in Delhi, where some of the findings were published in a report.\nProperty rights experts say clear titles are critical - not just for the security they give residents, but also to help obtain credit or get essential services such as food subsidies.\nLand Alliance, with support from the Omidyar Network, launched the multi-state survey with market research firm Gallup in India in early 2016. Last year’s test was its second, and involved 16,475 respondents across the country.\nRespondents were asked how likely it was that they would lose the right to live in their home, why they felt secure or insecure, what documents they possessed, and who would get ownership in the event of divorce or death.\nThe survey found more women than men felt they might lose their property in the event of divorce - 62 percent versus 57 percent.\nAbout a quarter of homeowners and nearly one in five rural landowners told researchers in the 2016 survey that they feared losing their property.\nPRIndex is an initiative of the Omidyar Network - with which the Thomson Reuters Foundation has a partnership on land rights coverage - and the UK’s Department for International Development. It will cover 34 countries this year.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Robert Carmichael.
