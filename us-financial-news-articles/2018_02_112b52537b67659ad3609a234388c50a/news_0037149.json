In a statement about his resignation, the former CEO did not admit to any wrongdoing.\nShares of Caesars are up about 1.2 percent this year, while Boyd Gaming is up 3.8 percent.\nMoore Capital also took a new stake in Abercrombie & Fitch of 375,000 shares. The retailer, which struggled last year, raised fourth-quarter guidance in late January to the high single digits. Shares are up 26.2 percent so far this year.\nMany other new holdings fell in the category leisure and retail, such as Marriott , McDonald's Ralph Lauren , Ross Stores , Starbucks , Burlington Stores and Deckers Outdoor .\nThe hedge fund also bet on technology stocks over banks. Moore Capital increased its holdings in Apple and Microsoft , but reduced its ownership of Alibaba and Amazon.com . The fund dissolved its stake in J.P. Morgan Chase and decreased its holdings of Bank of America , Citigroup and Morgan Stanley .\nâ€” CNBC's Everett Rosenfeld contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T02:15:30.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
