[nL4N1PX5GL] \nMicrosoft lost about 3.1 percent over the three sessions ended Tuesday. \nAmazon’s market cap at points on Wednesday during intraday trade already topped that of Microsoft, but it has never closed at a higher value. \nAmazon’s explosive growth in retail and cloud computing has sent its shares 77 percent higher over the past year, outpacing Microsoft’s 42 percent rise. [nL4N1PS4R6] \nApple Inc’s ( AAPL.O ) $819 billion market capitalization remains Wall Street’s largest, followed by Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL.O ), the parent of Google, at $736 billion.
