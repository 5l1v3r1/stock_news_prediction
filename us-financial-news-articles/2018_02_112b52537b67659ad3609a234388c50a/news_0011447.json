A U.S. trade commission dismissed Boeing’s complaint on Jan. 26.\nCunningham also said Boeing was in discussions across Asia for possible future defense sales, including attack helicopters in Philippines and Thailand.\nBoeing has also had preliminary conversations with Vietnam, following the lifting of a U.S. arms embargo in 2016.\n“We have been to Vietnam several times to have conversations, but we are still in a formulative phase,” Cunningham said, adding that Boeing would strictly follow specific export controls that apply to all military products.\nReporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T10:31:23.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
