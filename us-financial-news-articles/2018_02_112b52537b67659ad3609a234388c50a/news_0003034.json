Ma‘aden’s earnings statement gave no reason for the fourth-quarter loss and company could not immediately be reached for comment. \nTabuk Cement, which had jumped its 10 percent daily limit on Wednesday after a media report said the government had started awarding contracts for its huge NEOM business zone project in the northwest of the country, near where Tabuk is located, fell back 3.0 percent. \nBut another company located nearby, Tabuk Agricultural Development, rose 1.3 percent in unusually heavy trade. \nSaudi banks were mostly strong with Al Rajhi Bank climbing 1.6 percent. \nIn Dubai, the index rose 0.2 percent as Emaar Properties, which had been weak in the last several days, rebounded 0.8 percent. \nAbu Dhabi’s index was flat and Qatar edged down 0.1 percent, but Qatar Commercial Bank rose 1.6 percent after its chief executive said on Wednesday that it would deploy more capital to Turkey to benefit from closer political ties with that country.
