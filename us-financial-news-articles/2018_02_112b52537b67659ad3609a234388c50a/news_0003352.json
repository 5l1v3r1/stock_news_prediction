When potential holes in the global anti-doping system are exposed so that they can be fixed.”\nThe manufacturer, Berlinger Special AG, has told WADA it was unable to replicate the issue when the security bottles were handled per the product’s instruction, WADA said.\nThe Winter Olympics begin on Feb. 5 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
