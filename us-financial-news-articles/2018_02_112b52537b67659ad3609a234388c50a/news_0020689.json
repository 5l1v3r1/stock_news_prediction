It reported revenue of $15.35 billion. Wall Street analysts were anticipating $15.45 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.\nThat adjusted earnings per share figure accounts for the recent tax overhaul and other one-time benefits totaling about $1.6 billion.\nIn addition to that one-time tax benefit and previously announced $1,000 employee bonuses, Iger told CNBC the new tax law will also free up more free cash flow for the company. That will allow it to continue investing, he added.\n\"You'll see a blend of investment going forward that will be somewhat similar to the way we've been investing before,\" he said, pointing to the company's track record of investing in organic growth.\nHowever, the size of the Fox acquisition \"suggests that we won't be acquiring anything at least of any significance for quite a long period of time.\"\nâ€” CNBC's Christine Wang and Michelle Castillo contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:14:19.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
