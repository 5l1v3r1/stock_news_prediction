Eight police officers were killed and more than 40 people wounded in the latest wave of guerrilla attacks.\n“This statement, if they back it up with action, is exactly the type of gesture we’re looking for to restart talks,” Santos said in an interview on Monday with local La FM radio. “I‘m going to study the statement, verify its authenticity and then we’ll take decisions.”\nThe Cano Limon pipeline has been halted for more than six weeks because of bombings attributed to the 2,000-strong ELN, which was founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1964.\nReporting by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T14:55:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
