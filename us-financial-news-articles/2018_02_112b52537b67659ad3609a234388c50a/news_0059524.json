She added that she has a good relationship with Warjiyo and described him as a “likeable person” who tells “a lot of jokes.”\nAs a deputy governor, Warjiyo’s role includes monetary policy mix formulation, financial market deepening and Islamic financial market development.\nIndrawati also told Reuters that it was important for Indonesia to boost consumption growth back towards the 6 percent level seen before the 2008-2009 financial crisis. It has been stuck around 5 percent in recent years.\nReporting by David Lawder and Tabita Diela; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:07:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
