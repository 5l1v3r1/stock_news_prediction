It is not possible to have it both ways.”\n“We must not lose sight of the ultimate aim here — to build a new comprehensive partnership between the UK and the EU that sees us stay as the closest of friends and allies.”\nOn Thursday, Davis accused the EU of being “discourteous” for publishing a document that shows it has the power to restrict British access to the single market during a transition period.
