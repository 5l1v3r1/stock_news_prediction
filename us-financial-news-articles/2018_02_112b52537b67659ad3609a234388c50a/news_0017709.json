Analysts had expected growth to ease to closer to 6 percent from 11 percent a quarter earlier.\nThe company, which is expanding its leather goods production capacities through to 2020 with new workshops in France, said strong demand for its handbags had lead to low inventory levels at the end of 2017.\nHermes shares, which hit a record high of 468.30 euros in April 2017, dipped 0.3 percent to 430.90 euros in early session trading.\nHermes, due to report full results on March 21, said operating profitability should be close to the level recorded over the first half of last year, when it hit a record 34 percent.\nHermes - which also makes perfumes, clothing and watches - is trying to boost online sales, similar to its rival companies.\nThe label is overhauling its website, and is due to roll out the new version in Europe by the end of the first quarter and in China by year-end, Dumas said.\nHermes said it had long benefited from steady appetite in China but had noted improved demand in other parts of Asia, including Hong Kong, where it opened a new flagship store in January, and Macau.\nHermes’ sales reached 5.5 billion euros for 2017 as a whole, up 9 percent at constant currencies.\n$1 = 0.8140 euros Reporting by Sarah White and Pascale Denis Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:04:54.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
