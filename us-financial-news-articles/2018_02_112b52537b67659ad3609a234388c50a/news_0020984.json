The government has set a goal to sell 7 million zero- and low-emission vehicles annually by 2025. As the auto industry transforms rapidly toward battery-powered vehicles and autonomous cars, major manufacturers are bracing for challenges including billions of dollars in investment with uncertain payoffs. \nThe other 11 partners in the network are BAIC BJEV, BYD, Chang’an Automobile Group, Chery Automobile Group, Dongfeng Passenger Vehicle, First Auto Works, Geely Auto, Hawtai Motor, JAC Motors, KIA Motors, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, and Zotye Auto.
