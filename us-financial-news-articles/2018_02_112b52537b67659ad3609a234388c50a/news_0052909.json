I generally felt that my life was saved by this early intervention,” Fry said in the video on his website.\n“For the moment, I‘m fit and well and happy.”\nLast month, Fry stepped down as host of Britain’s BAFTA film awards, having presented the ceremony 12 times. He is also known for presenting the BBC2 TV comedy quiz show QI.\nHe has spoken frankly about his health previously, and his struggles with anxiety and depression. In 1995, he fled a London theater production just days after its opening in what he later called “emotional turmoil.”\nHe won an Emmy in 2007 for his documentary “Stephen Fry: The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive”.\nReporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T17:06:01.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
