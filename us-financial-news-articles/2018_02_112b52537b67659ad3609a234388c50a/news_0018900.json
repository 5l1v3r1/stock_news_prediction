North Carolina has won two straight following a three-game losing streak.\nDuke (19-5, 7-4) lost for the second game in a row and the third time in the past four outings despite 16 points from Gary Trent Jr. and 15 points and 16 rebounds from Marvin Bagley III. Alex O‘Connell scored 11 points, Wendell Carter Jr. supplied 10, and Grayson Allen and Trevon Duval, who fouled out, both had nine points.\nNorth Carolina wiped out a 42-33 hole by scoring on 10 of 11 possessions bridging the two halves for a 10-point lead.\nDuke cut the deficit to 74-71 as the Tar Heels missed 13 consecutive shots from the field. Johnson’s 3-pointer ended the dry spell.\nNorth Carolina, which figured to have difficulty with Duke’s stout frontcourt, held a 44-38 rebounding advantage. That included 20 boards on the offensive end, several times keeping alive possessions during the second-half shooting drought.\nIt was largely a clean game, with North Carolina charged with only two turnovers and Duke giving the ball away eight times -- including Allen’s errant pass with the Blue Devils trailing by five with about 20 seconds to play.\nDuke led 49-45 at halftime buoyed by 56.8 percent shooting.\nWilliams was 4-for-5 from 3-point range in the first 10 minutes, accounting for more than half of the Tar Heels seven first-half treys.\nHowever, Duke had a stretch of 10 consecutive made field goals, building a 33-16 lead.\nNorth Carolina reserve point guard Seventh Woods played for the first time since November, though he finished scoreless.\nThe teams split the previous 100 meetings, though North Carolina’s series lead is now 136-110.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:42:49.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
