The alliance added that drones had left the T4 air base in the morning to conduct routine operations against Islamic State in the Syrian desert.\n“When the base was targeted our aircraft were still flying over the town of Sokhna, towards the desert,” the statement said. Sokhna is a town northeast of the city of Palmyra in central Syria.\nReporting by Lisa Barrington and Tom Perry; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T13:55:09.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
