The Air Force said it saved some money last year when he reached a deal with Boeing for two 747 jets to serve as Air Force One, taking advantage of an unusual limited-time discount on planes once bound for Russia.\nBut much of the costs for the presidential plane come from pricey and complex modifications required to turn the aircraft into the flying fortresses that ferry U.S. presidents around the world.\n“President Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people,” Boeing said in a tweet. The shares rose less than 1 percent to $366.29 at 10:49 a.m. in New York.\nIn February last year, Trump said the Air Force was “close to signing a $4.2 billion deal” and that “we got that price down by over $1 billion.” But the Air Force said at the time that it was unaware of what savings the president was referring to and that the service didn’t have an established cost estimate for the entire program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T18:55:23.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
