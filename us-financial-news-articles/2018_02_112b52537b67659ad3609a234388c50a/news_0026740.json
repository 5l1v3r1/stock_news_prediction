U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit new four-year high at 2.902.\nWhile U.S. stocks, along with global markets, attempt to bounce back, any recovery hinges on their ability to withstand another sharp move up in bond yields - something that will be put to the test by two important readings on U.S. inflation this week.\nIf the January’s U.S. consumer price index due Wednesday from the U.S. Labor Department, and the producer price index the next day, come in higher than the market anticipates, that could spur further gyrations in stocks.\nU.S. consumer prices rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in December and is forecast to stay around that pace this month.\nPresident Donald Trump will unveil his second budget on Monday afternoon – seeking to make good on his promise to bolster military spending and requesting funds for infrastructure, construction of a wall along the border with Mexico and opioid treatment programs.\nThe infrastructure and tax plans have been the key drivers of the so-called Trump rally – the U.S. market’s relentless gains since Trump’s election. The latest budget plan will include $200 billion for infrastructure spending and more than $23 billion for border security and immigration enforcement.\nEquities for years have looked relatively attractive compared to the low yields offered by bonds, but the rise in Treasury yields has diminished the allure of stocks, especially with stock valuations at historically expensive levels.\nThat, along with a reversal of bets on low volatility drew the three major Wall Street indexes to correction territory last week, measured by a 10 percent decline from their record highs hit on Jan. 26.\nSince that high, the S&P 500 lost $2.49 trillion in market value through last Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nAmong stocks, shares of CSRA soared 32 percent in premarket trading after General Dynamics said it would buy the government IT contractor for about $6.8 billion.\nCisco was up more than 2 percent after brokerage Instinet upgraded the stock to “buy” ahead of the network gear maker’s results later this week.
