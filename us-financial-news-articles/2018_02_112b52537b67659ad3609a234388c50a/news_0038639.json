Accidents in recent years have in some cases been blamed on poor maintenance.\nWhile the SNCF’s debt is bigger than that of a small country such as Iceland or Croatia, it is in line with the debt of rail networks in places such as Britain, where rail services were privatised in the 1990s.\nFor Macron, the risks in tackling the issue are two-fold. One is union protests snowballing into strikes, even if it is unclear how determined railway employees are to resist.\nThe other is the damage the debt transfer would do French finances; with interest rates expected to rise after a prolonged period at ultra-low levels, prompting Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire to say on Thursday that extra measures may be needed to keep a lid on debt servicing costs.
