There will also be eKarting and eSports rounds. \n“We respect the FIA and we are honoured to have their support ahead of our inaugural season,” said Electric GT Holdings chief executive Mark Gemmell. \nThe FIA also sanctions Formula E, the first all-electric racing series, which is now in its fourth season and attracting increasing manufacturer involvement. \nFormula E is planning a production-based electric series to start up later this year with cars based on Jaguar’s I-PACE performance SUV.
