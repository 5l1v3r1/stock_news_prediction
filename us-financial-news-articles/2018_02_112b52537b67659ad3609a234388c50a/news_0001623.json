I‘m only focused on working with my team and trying my best for the team. \n“I trust in my work. This is the only way I work and that brought me to be one of the best coaches. Only trusting in my work and in my job. I continue in this way, because I think this has made me become one of the best.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T07:39:32.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
