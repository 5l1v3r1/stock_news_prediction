REUTERS/Mike Hutchings Moreover, the economy remains largely under the control of whites who held power under apartheid.\nThe 75-year-old Zuma said in a 30-minute farewell address to the nation he disagreed with the way the ANC had thrust him towards an early exit after Ramaphosa replaced him as party president, but would accept its orders.\n“Zuma did the right thing to resign. Yes, let’s see what Ramaphosa is having for us, thank you,” said Hlengiwe Mswazi, an office worker in the capital Pretoria.\nTshepo Kgobane, also in Pretoria, said: “So it is a good thing that he resigned. We must have a party, a big party, we must throw a party because he resigned. We wanted to see that.”\nZuma bowed out hours after police raided the luxury home of the Gupta family, the Indian-born billionaire allies of the former president who have been at the centre of corruption accusations against Zuma and his circle for years.\nZuma and the Guptas have always denied wrongdoing.\nSlideshow (7 Images) “GOING, GOING, GONE”\n“Defiant in defeat” and “Going, Going, Gone” were among the newspaper headlines that captured Zuma’s unwillingness to leave.\n“South Africa’s long nightmare is over,” read the headline from online political news website Daily Maverick.\nJulius Malema, leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led his party in a mass walkout from parliament on Thursday, saying it would not take part in the election of a new president so as not to legitimise an ANC candidate.\nThe EFF, which has six percent of the seats in parliament, had sponsored a no-confidence motion in Zuma that would have gone ahead on Thursday had Zuma not jumped.\nThe foundation set up to guard the legacy of the late anti-apartheid icon and first black South African president Nelson Mandela said Zuma’s departure brought to an end “a painful era for the country”.\n“One chapter in South Africa’s political soap opera has finally ended with the resignation last night of President Jacob Zuma,” NKC African Economics analysts wrote in a note.\n“It would be gratifying to see the dedication and purpose the ANC put into ridding itself of Zuma now be directed into rebuilding the economy, dealing with the corruption still residing in the ANC and improving its shoddy governance record.”\nSouth African police said officers had arrested eight people so far in its investigations into high-echelon influence-peddling revolving around the Gupta family.\nChief prosecutor Shaun Abrahams declared Ajay Gupta, one of the three Gupta brothers, a “fugitive from justice” after he failed to hand himself in. Abrahams provided no further details.\nState broadcaster SABC said a Gupta family member was among those detained, while a senior judicial source said police were expected to arrest up to seven more people and that Gupta family members would be among them.\nPolice said the raid on the Gupta estate was in connection with a state-funded dairy farm, which prosecutors last month called a “scheme designed to defraud and steal”.\nAdditional reporting by Ed Cropley and Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo in Johannesburg, Dinky Mkhize in Pretoria and Siphiwe Sibeko in Bloemfontein; writing by James Macharia; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T10:39:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
