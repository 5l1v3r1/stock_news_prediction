Powell's debut appearance is seen as critical for the financial markets, with many investors nervous about the Fed's policy normalisation following years of stimulus. London copper has held above the $7,000-a-tonne mark since Feb. 14 and edged up on Monday on the back of strong import data from top metals consumer China. \"The positive sentiment in the market looks likely to remain. However, investors will now be focused on economic data, with Chinese PMIs on Wednesday likely to set the tone for the remainder of the week,\" ANZ wrote in a note. China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey will be published on Wednesday, along with a similar official survey covering the services sector.
