He was referring to the left anterior descending artery, or left coronary artery, which is considered the most important for blood supply to the heart.\n“If I hadn’t canceled show 2 to go to the hospital, I would’ve died tonight. But for now, I‘m still above ground!” Smith said on Twitter.\nSmith, who currently stars in the AMC TV reality series “Comic Book Men,” earned critical praise for his satires on suburbia, romance and religion. He rose to prominence with his 1994 raunchy low-budget cult comedy “Clerks” about a day in the life of two convenience store workers. He won a screenwriting Independent Spirit Award for 1997’s “Chasing Amy.”\nReporting by Eric Kelsey; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:08:47.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
