(NYSE:LDL) today announced financial results and year\nHIGHLIGHTS - Q4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\nGAAP Financials\nNet sales of $178.0 million, up $33.8 million, or 23.5%, from $144.2 million\n- Technical Nonwovens' Gutsche acquisition contributed $14.2 million, or 9.9% Gross margin of 22.1%, down 10 basis points Operating margin of 8.7%, up 360 basis points\n- Q4 2016 included the German Cartel settlement expense of $3.5 million, or 240 basis points Earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $0.80 compared to $0.26\n- 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform Act\") resulted in a provisional net tax benefit of $3.7 million, or $0.22 EPS\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures*\nOrganic sales growth of 9.3%; all four segments reporting growth Adjusted gross margin of 22.2%, down 20 basis points Adjusted operating margin of 9.3%, up 90 basis points Adjusted EPS of $0.67, up 28.8%, from adjusted $0.52 per share Adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.9%, up 40 basis points\n*Reconciliations of the Non- to Lydall’s GAAP financial results are included at the end of this release. See also “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nDale G. Barnhart, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am pleased to report sales growth of over 20% in the quarter, including strong organic sales growth of nearly 10%, led by above-market growth in the Technical Nonwovens, Thermal/Acoustical Metals and Performance Materials segments. Moreover, we converted well by delivering 29% growth in adjusted earnings per share. Gross margin was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter, as improved manufacturing productivity was offset by price reductions of approximately 130 basis points. Adjusted operating margin improved 90 basis points on disciplined management of expenses coupled with sales growth.\"\n\"Overall, for full year 2017 performance, Lydall delivered 7.2% organic sales growth with above market growth in all segments. Earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share were $2.85 and $2.80, respectively, an improvement of 7.3% versus 2016 on an adjusted basis. Last, we made progress executing on the Technical Nonwovens' acquisition integration and Thermal/Acoustical Fibers and Metals consolidation plans, each of which are expected to reduce operating costs and increase efficiency.\"\nQ4 2017 Results\nNet sales increased by $33.8 million, or 23.5%, to $178.0 million, compared to $144.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Technical Nonwovens (\"TNW\") segment reported increased net sales of $25.6 million, including $14.2 million from the December 31, 2016, acquisition of Gutsche. TNW’s organic sales growth was 21.4%, led by advanced materials sales in North America, as well as, increased demand for industrial filtration products, particularly in China and Europe. The Thermal/Acoustical Metals (\"T/A Metals\") segment realized organic sales growth of 10.6% led by international operations. The Performance Materials (\"PM\") segment reported organic sales growth of 8.8%, primarily due to improved filtration demand in the fluid power market. The Thermal/Acoustical Fibers (\"T/A Fibers\") segment reported 0.8% organic growth as increased volume of 3.6% was partially offset by lower customer pricing. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by $4.7 million, or 3.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGross margin and adjusted gross margin were 22.1% and 22.2%, respectively, essentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2016. Improved performance in the TNW segment was primarily offset by the T/A Fibers segment. The TNW segment reported improved gross margin from the inclusion of the acquired Gutsche business as well as from lower raw material and overhead expenses at the other TNW segment operations, while the T/A Fibers segment negatively impacted consolidated gross margin due to reduced customer pricing on certain parts. The PM and T/A Metals segments had only a marginal impact on consolidated gross margin comparisons. In the T/A Metals segment, improved manufacturing productivity was partially offset by increased commodity prices and lower customer pricing.\nOperating margin was 8.7%, up 360 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016, while adjusted operating margin improved 90 basis points to 9.3%. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 included the add-back of $1.0 million of expenses, including $0.5 million from the T/A Metals and T/A Fibers consolidation. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2016 included the add-back of $4.9 million of expenses, including $3.5 million, or 240 basis points, from the German Cartel settlement and $1.1 million, or 70 basis points, of strategic initiative expenses from acquisitions. The overall improvement in operating margin quarter-on-quarter was driven by lower selling, product development and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales of 370 basis points, or approximately 100 basis points on an adjusted basis, due to managed spending coupled with sales growth.\nThe Company's low effective tax rate of 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017 was the result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that became law on December 22, 2017. The Company recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $3.7 million primarily from the revaluation of its net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 from a tax rate of 35% to 21%. Going forward, the Company expects its ordinary effective tax rate in 2018 to be in the range of 19% to 21%, based on its current evaluation of the tax law change.\nNet income was $13.8 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared to $4.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.67, compared to $0.52 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nNet sales were $698.4 million compared to $566.9 million in 2016, including net sales of $87.3 million contributed by acquisitions. Organic sales growth was 7.2%, with above market growth in all segments, led by TNW segment organic growth of 16.5%. Gross margin was 23.3%, a reduction of 110 basis points and adjusted gross margin was 23.6%, a decline of 120 basis points from 2016. Operating margin was 9.4% and adjusted operating margin was 10.1% compared to operating margin of 9.7% and adjusted operating margin of 11.3% in 2016. Earnings per share in 2017 were $2.85, compared to $2.16 per share in 2016. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.80 compared to $2.61 in 2016, an increase of 7.3%.\nLiquidity\nCash flows from operations was $62.9 million in 2017 compared to $69.7 million in 2016, as improved cash from net income was offset by increased working capital, most notably tooling inventory of $9.2 million in advance of new platform launches in 2018. Cash was $59.9 million at December 31, 2017, net of $50.0 million paid down on the Company’s domestic credit facility during 2017, leaving availability of $94.5 million on the facility at December 31, 2017.\nMr. Barnhart added, \"I am pleased with our cash generation in 2017 which allowed us to pay down a large portion of our debt, while at the same time investing in our businesses. With a strong balance sheet and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.9 to 1.0, we have ample capacity to support organic growth programs, fund capital investments and pursue attractive acquisitions that will drive profitable growth.\"\nOutlook\nMr. Barnhart concluded, \"Effective January 2018, our automotive businesses are now consolidated into a single segment, Thermal Acoustical Solutions, which is expected to allow for better customer alignment, leverage operating discipline and realize efficiencies across the global automotive operations. As we move forward in the first quarter of 2018, backlog is solid and we continue to see favorable demand in our markets across all segments. While we do expect to face commodity cost pressures and price reductions in certain applications, we remain focused on realizing manufacturing productivity improvements in our TAS segment, progressing on the TNW restructuring, and driving above-market growth across all segments. Overall, we expect consolidated gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 to be in a range consistent with the last half of 2017 with consolidated revenues comparable to the prior year. Given Tax Reform, we expect our ordinary effective tax rate to drop to a range of 19 percent to 21 percent, allowing for both improved net income and reinvestment of a portion of the benefit to accelerate growth and achieve our long-term objectives.\"\nConference Call\nLydall will host a conference call on February 22, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss results for its fourth quarter and year as well as general matters related to its businesses and markets.

information regarding organic sales change, defined as net sales change excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses (2) the impact of foreign currency translation and (3) tooling sales. Management believes that the presentation of organic sales change is useful to investors because it enables them to assess, on a consistent basis, sales trends related to the Company selling products to customers, without the impact of foreign currency rate changes that are not under management's control and do not reflect the performance of the Company and management. Tooling sales are excluded because tooling revenue is not generated from selling the Company's products to customers, but rather is reimbursement from our customers for the design and production of tools used by the Company in our manufacturing processes. Tooling sales can be sporadic and may mask underlying business conditions and obscure business trends.\nFor further information: Brendan Moynihan Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations Telephone 860-646-1233 Facsimile 860-646-4917 info@lydall.com www.lydall.com\nSource:Lydall, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3b4d012c-202f-4db2-82b1-adf46f536448", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VjohSjdrmsT_HdXLCcAn_UviUo0qP-MAsiiEVnRDzBUHPSUw7dwdEDsEnzj-_U0oFmDwEftrLoUQMc1K3KFrUF0yYZBNGeLH44AlsFMSNVs="], "published": "2018-02-22T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T02:31:00.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
