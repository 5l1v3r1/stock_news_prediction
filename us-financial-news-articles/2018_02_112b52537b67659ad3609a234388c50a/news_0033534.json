(Nasdaq: CETX, CETXP, CETXW), a world leading multi-industry technology company reported its first quarter consolidated results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\n“We delivered strong topline growth with a 10% increase in total revenue to $32.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

We are seeing an overall decline industry wide in the environmental technology market globally.”\n“Fortunately, we have been maintaining a diversification strategy for the last several years and have been focused on investing in our technology related businesses. We have begun an R&D program that is yielding proprietary technology both in hardware and software. We are in the process of developing compelling virtual and augmented reality software applications and content for multiple markets which we expect to release this year.”\n“We are also extremely excited to unveil our “smart desk” this May as the Company releases its first consumer electronics product leveraging our deep experiences in electronics development and manufacturing. We have an exciting roadmap with multiple products in the pipeline as the company evolves its capabilities to capture more value for its shareholders,” concluded Saagar Govil, Chairman and CEO of Cemtrex.\nQ1 FY 2018 Business Highlights and Financial Highlights\nTotal Revenue for Q1 2018 increased by 10% to $32,381,900 compared to $29,397,257 for Q1 2017.
