This thereby jeopardised our ability to discharge the dues of the group to the banks,” Modi wrote, in a letter reportedly addressed to PNB management.\nModi and his representatives were not immediately reachable for comment. Last week PNB, India’s No. 2 state-run lender said it detected fraudulent transactions worth $1.77 billion.\nThe fraud involved firms controlled by Modi and his relatives and sparked raids across Mumbai and New Delhi, targeting offices and homes linked to Modi.\nShares in PNB fell for fifth straight day on Tuesday. The stock, which has shed more than a quarter of its market capitalization since disclosing the fraud, was down 3.5 percent in early trading.
