The company said this growth was bolstered by higher checks and beverages such as shakes and smoothies.\nFor the full year, same-store sales were up 0.6 percent at U.S. Dunkin' Donuts locations and flat at U.S. Baskin-Robbins stores.\nDunkin' has been pressured by competitors such as McDonald's , Burger King and Starbucks , to make itself known for more than just its doughnuts.\nThe company has been making major changes in the last few months, ramping up its digital ordering, slowing down its expansion plans and slimming down its menu to refocus its efforts on being a beverage-led brand. And that seems to be paying off.\n\"Morning comparable store sales increased each quarter sequentially, and we had our highest quarterly beverage comparable sales of the year in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by iced coffee and Frozen Dunkin' Coffee,\" CEO Nigel Travis said in a statement Tuesday.\nThe company declined to provide 2018 estimates during the earnings conference call Tuesday.
