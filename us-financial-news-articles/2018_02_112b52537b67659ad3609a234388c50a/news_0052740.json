Record revenue of $65.7 million in 2017 was driven by the rapid adoption of our cloud based hosted encryption offering, add-ons to our installed base and the success of our new email protection bundled offering. We remain committed to delivering profitable growth for our shareholders. From a profitability and cash flow standpoint, we also experienced positive results, ending the fourth quarter with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29%. In addition, we repurchased 500,000 shares during the quarter and continue to move forward with our balanced capital allocation strategy.”\nWagner continued: “Looking ahead to the new fiscal year, we look forward to extending the 87% year-over-year revenue growth we experienced last year in our cloud-based encryption product and the opportunity to accelerate that success with ZixProtect and Zix Archive. However, the excess customer churn due to M&A and competitive pressures is slowing our revenue growth and impacting our 2018 guidance. The excess competitive churn we are experiencing is primarily from our on-premise appliance customers, which now only represent about 20% of our ACV. We believe the success we are seeing with our cloud-based email security solutions positions us well for expanding our market position and building a foundation for stronger levels of growth and profitability moving forward.”\n2017 Operational Highlights\nCompleted the successful acquisition of Greenview Data and achieved 166% of our 2017 New First Year Orders target for Advanced Threat Protection and Email Archiving products Launched ZixCentral, Zix’s single “pane of glass” for managing and reporting Encryption, Advanced Threat and email Archiving solutions Achieved 100% renewals on Zix Messaging Server, the product acquired in September 2017 from Entrust Datacard, which provides SMIME based end-to-end email and is utilized by 3 of Canada’s largest banks Grew hosted encryption customer base by 87% over 2016, adding over 850 new customers and ending 2017 with $18.2 million of Annual Contract Value\n2017 Tax Adjustment\nIn the fourth quarter, Zix made an adjustment to the carrying value of its deferred tax asset to reflect the future effect of the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate resulting from the 2017 tax reform legislation (effective January 1, 2018), which reduced Zix’s planned corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The result was a one-time, non-cash charge of $12.5 million to GAAP earnings.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Corporate Financial Summary and Other Operational Metrics\n$ in Millions, except per share data Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Change (1) Revenue $16.8 $15.6 7.8% GAAP Gross Profit $13.5 $12.9 5.2% GAAP Net Income ($12.9) $1.9 (764%) GAAP Net Income Per Share – Diluted ($0.24) $0.04 (756%) EBITDA (3) $2.8 $4.1 (29.8%) EBITDA Margin (3) 16.9% 26.0% (9.1 pts) Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Profit (3) $13.7 $12.9 6.1% Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (3) $4.5 $3.7 20.3% Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income Per Share – Diluted (3) $0.08 $0.07 18.8% Adjusted EBITDA (3) $4.9 $4.5 7.6% Adjusted EBITDA Margin (3) 29.0% 29.1% (0.1 pts) New First Year Orders $2.5 $2.7 (6.7%) Total Orders $14.5 $15.8 (8.3%) Backlog (4) $72.6 $81.7 (11.1%) Fiscal 2017 Corporate Financial Summary and Other Operational Metrics\n$ in Millions, except per share data 2017 2016 Change (1) Revenue $65.7 $60.1 9.2% GAAP Gross Profit $53.1 $49.6 7.0% GAAP Net Income ($8.1) $5.8 (238%) GAAP Net Income Per Share – Diluted ($0.15) $0.11 (238%) EBITDA (3) $13.3 $11.9 12.0% EBITDA Margin (3) 20.2% 19.7% 0.5 pts Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Profit (3) $53.5 $49.8 7.5% Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (3) $15.6 $14.0 11.2% Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income Per Share – Diluted (3) $0.29 $0.26 11.5% Adjusted EBITDA (3) $18.2 $16.9 7.7% Adjusted EBITDA Margin (3) 27.7% 28.1% (0.4 pts) New First Year Orders $9.3 $9.5 (1.9%) Total Orders $58.9 $68.6 (14.2%) (1) Changes are based on actual numbers versus numbers shown in the columns, which may reflect rounding (2) Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (3) A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results (including non-GAAP adjusted results) is included in this press release and available on our investor relations Web page at http://investor.zixcorp.com\n(4) Service contract commitments that represent future revenue to be recognized as the services are provided Financial Outlook\nFor the first quarter 2018, the company forecasts revenue to range between $16.6 million and $16.8 million, representing an increase of 4% to 6% year-over-year.

We also believe these Non-GAAP measures provide investors with a more informed baseline for modeling the Company’s future financial performance. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to make operational and investment decisions, to evaluate the Company's performance, to forecast and to determine compensation. Further, management utilizes these performance measures for purposes of comparison with its business plan and individual operating budgets and allocation of resources. We believe that our investors should have access to, and that we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. These Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We have provided definitions below for certain Non-GAAP financial measures, together with an explanation of why management uses these measures and why management believes that these Non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors. In addition, in our earnings release we have provided tables to reconcile the Non-GAAP financial measures utilized to GAAP financial measures.\nADJUSTED NON-GAAP MEASURES\nOur Non-GAAP measures adjust GAAP Cost of revenue, Gross profit, Research and development expense, Selling and marketing expense, General and administrative expense, Operating income, Net income, Net income per share - diluted, and EBITDA for non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and strategic consulting and litigation costs to derive Non-GAAP adjusted Cost of revenue, adjusted Gross profit, adjusted Research and development expense, adjusted Selling and marketing expense, adjusted General and administrative expense, adjusted Operating income, adjusted Net income, adjusted Net income per share - diluted and adjusted EBITDA. We provide a reconciliation of these adjusted Non-GAAP measures to GAAP Gross profit, Operating income, Net income, Net income per share - diluted and EBITDA.\nOur forward-looking adjusted Non-GAAP earnings per share information consistently excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, the adjusted Non-GAAP earnings per share will consistently exclude litigation expenses and non-recurring items that impact our ongoing business. See items (A) through (E) below for further information on the current quarter's reconciling items.\nItems (A) through (F) on the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" table are listed to the right of certain categories under \"Gross profit,\" \"Operating income,\" \"Net income,\" \"Net income per share - diluted\" and \"EBITDA\" and correspond to the categories explained in further detail below under (A) through (F).\n(A) Non-cash stock-based compensation charges relating to stock option grants, restricted stock, and restricted stock units awarded to and accounted for in accordance with Share-Based Payment accounting guidance. See (1) on previous page for breakdown of stock-based compensation. Because of varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and varying award types, the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation charges provides for more accurate comparisons to our peer companies and for a more accurate comparison of our financial results to previous periods. Additionally, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of non-cash stock-based compensation charges on our operating results.\n(B) Strategic consulting, acquisition and litigation costs. See item (2) on previous page. The Company’s management excludes certain board-directed consulting costs and litigation expenses when evaluating its ongoing performance and/or predicting its earnings trends and therefore excludes these charges on our adjusted operating results.\n(C) Intangible amortization costs. See item (3) on previous page. The Company’s management excludes amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of intangible assets when evaluating its ongoing performance and/or predicting its earnings trends and therefore excludes these charges on our adjusted operating results.\n(D) Corporate separation payment relating to employment termination benefits agreement. See item (4) on previous page. The Company’s management excludes these costs when evaluating its ongoing performance and/or predicting its earnings trends and therefore excludes these charges on our adjusted operating results .\n(E) The Non-GAAP adjustment to the tax provision represents the non-cash tax expense included in the GAAP tax provision, including the current period utilization of deferred tax assets created in previous periods. The remaining provision for income taxes represents expected cash taxes to be paid.\n(F) EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA adds back stock-based compensation charges and litigation expenses.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222006134/en/\nZix Company Contact\nGeoff Bibby, 214-370-2241\ngbibby@zixcorp.com\nor\nZix Investor Contact\nLiolios Group, Inc.\nMatt Glover and Najim Mostamand, CFA, 949-574-3860\nZIXI@liolios.com\nSource: Zix Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zixcorp.com&esheet=51762895&newsitemid=20180222006134&lan=en-US&anchor=Zix+Corporation&index=1&md5=76350104f69336f11e55462099866338", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zixcorp.com%2Fabout-us%2Four-leadership%2F%23Rockvam&esheet=51762895&newsitemid=20180222006134&lan=en-US&anchor=David+Rockvam&index=3&md5=55f84fb5df493002563ca65597bc2c99", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zixcorp.com%2Fabout-us%2Four-leadership%23Wagner&esheet=51762895&newsitemid=20180222006134&lan=en-US&anchor=David+Wagner&index=2&md5=23d4cd42ab6c0d7d7bb79f528fd09983", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222006134/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.zixcorp.com&esheet=51762895&newsitemid=20180222006134&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.zixcorp.com&index=4&md5=b76f93c342827c211dd5a0297dac8099", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.zixcorp.com%2Fphoenix.zhtml%3Fc%3D108645%26p%3Dirol-calendar&esheet=51762895&newsitemid=20180222006134&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=6&md5=6bdb217b4c5f504f5aba502c6fd89984", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.zixcorp.com%2Fphoenix.zhtml%3Fc%3D108645%26p%3Dirol-calendar&esheet=51762895&newsitemid=20180222006134&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=5&md5=299a371fac3ef71775f67742fa792e2e", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zixcorp.com&esheet=51762895&newsitemid=20180222006134&lan=en-US&anchor=www.zixcorp.com&index=7&md5=bf38eb9d67a5868c44c4a100aa0741f0"], "published": "2018-02-23T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T01:55:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
