The Rockets connected on only 28.9 percent (13 of 45) of their 3-point tries and appeared a step slow on both ends before Paul injected some life into their offense just long enough to build a cushion.\nClint Capela posted a double-double (16 points, 11 boards), and Gerald Green added 12 points while burying four 3-pointers off the bench for Houston. The Rockets improved to 3-0 against Dallas this season.\nThe Mavericks left Dirk Nowitzki, Wesley Matthews and J.J. Barea back in Dallas following their home triumph over the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night. They received a spirited effort from those who made the trip, with Dwight Powell (18 points, 12 rebounds) and Yogi Ferrell (20 points) leading the charge. Dallas rookie guard Dennis Smith Jr. paired 16 points with 11 assists.\nThe Mavericks’ 36-point second quarter was largely a byproduct of their collective hustle. Dallas repeatedly beat the Rockets to 50/50 balls and turned four offensive rebounds in the period into 13 second-chance points, including a follow dunk with one second left by Kyle Collinsworth.\nDallas closed the half with a plus-12 advantage in shot attempts, a total that helped offset 42.3 percent shooting. However, the Rockets led 57-55 at halftime.\nWhen Houston dashed to a 10-point lead in the first period, it feasted on Dallas’ inferior interior defense. The Rockets made 6 of 7 shots inside the arc in the opening quarter, but when the Mavericks began to hustle hard, Houston needed Paul to lead its charge.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:41:51.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
