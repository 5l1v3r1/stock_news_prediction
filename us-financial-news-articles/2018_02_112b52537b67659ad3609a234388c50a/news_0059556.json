In October 2016, Chinese logistics company ZTO Express raised $1.41 billion from an IPO in New York.\nNio declined to comment on its IPO plans. UBS, Citigroup and Goldman declined comment while the other banks did not immediately respond to Reuters emailed request for comment.\nShanghai-based Nio, formerly known as NextEV, is among the first of a raft of Chinese electric vehicle firms to launch a production vehicle, with many so far only showing concept cars.\nIt launched sales of its first mass production car - the ES8 pure-electric, seven-seat sport-utility vehicle in December, at about half the price of American peer Tesla's Model X. It has also vowed to bring an autonomous electric car to the U.S. market by 2020.\nNio counts Asian tech behemoth Tencent Holdings Ltd as its main backer alongside investment firms Hillhouse Capital Group and Sequoia Capital.\nLast November, the firm raised more than $1 billion in its latest fundraising round, led by existing investor Tencent, valuing the firm at about $5 billion.
