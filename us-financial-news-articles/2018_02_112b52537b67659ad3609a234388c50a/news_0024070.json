You must do something. You must notify someone. You must step in and intervene,” he added.\nTillerson’s comments come amid a chorus of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men in media, business and politics in the United States.\nIn November, some 200 women who worked in national security, including at the State Department, signed a letter saying that sexual harassment policies were weak and often unenforced. They made several recommendations, including mandatory training and channels to report abuse without fear of retribution.\nThe White House has been rocked by similar allegations. Last week, two White House aides left the administration after domestic violence allegations surfaced against them.\nBoth men have denied the accusations. Reuters has not independently verified either case.\n“(People‘s) lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false ... Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?” Trump said on Twitter on Saturday.\n(This story corrects to show Trump’s tweet was on Saturday, not Sunday)\nReporting by Yara Bayoumy; Writing by Makini Brice; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T15:15:18.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
