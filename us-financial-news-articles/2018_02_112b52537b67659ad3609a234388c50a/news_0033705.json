Fitch followed suit.\nPatrick said plaintiffs’ lawyers are negotiating final terms, with a judge likely to sign off “in coming days”. In the meantime, he said, Syngenta has been meeting ratings agencies to allay concerns over its balance sheet and debt structure.\n“I would envisage that we would be in a position to come back to the bond market in the coming weeks, hopefully before the end of Q1, maybe not with a $7 billion bond, probably more likely in the $5 billion range,” Patrick said.\n“Obviously a key component of that is finalisation of the (legal) settlement and confirmation from S&P and Fitch of the investment-grade rating,” he added.\nSyngenta reported 2017 sales slipped 1 percent to $12.65 billion, hurt in particular by weakness of crop protection products in Latin America. “2017 was a tough year,” Patrick said.\nSyngenta has been making acquisitions, including the Nidera crop seeds business of Chinese grains trader COFCO International.\nIt may be a suitor for Bayer’s global vegetable seeds business that the German company is unloading to win approval of its own $63.5 billion purchase of U.S.-based Monsanto.\n“I think certainly the industry consolidation is providing a number of opportunities that are of strategic value to us and clearly we would be very interested in acquiring some of those,” Patrick said.\nHe said regulators will continue to play a big role in determining what happens.\nFor instance, DuPont had to buy a unit of FMC Corp and sell a crop protection business to FMC to win European Union approval for its $130 billion merger with Dow Chemical.\n“As to whether we’ll be in a position to acquire is somewhat down to the regulators, as we saw with the Dow-Dupont sale to FMC,” Patrick said. “M&A is important to us, but it’s not just limited to those assets that are coming out of industry consolidation.” (Editing by Michael Shields)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:46:57.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
