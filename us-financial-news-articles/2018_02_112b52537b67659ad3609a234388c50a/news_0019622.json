We are doing our best.” \nHe conceded, however, that winning the title is no guarantee of longevity in a job these days, especially at a club not averse to removing trophy-winning managers. \n“A lot of the time the manager’s future depends on the results. For this reason we have to pay great attention,” he said. “Watford was a bad game for us, it can happen, but we must make sure it only happens once.” \nFourth-placed Chelsea have won only two of their last 10 games in all competitions, plus a penalty shoot-out defeat of second-tier side Norwich City in the FA Cup third round. While a home match against a West Brom side with only one league win since August looks like a home banker, Conte urged caution. \n“You have to try to stop this bad run and to try to get three points against West Brom,” the Italian said. \n“But it won’t be easy because in this type of situation the confidence is not high. We must trust in our football.” \nOlivier Giroud, signed from Arsenal in the transfer window, could make his first start after a substitute appearance against Watford, but fellow striker Alvaro Morata remains sidelined with no return imminent, according to Conte. \n“We are facing a serious situation. Players like Morata that are important for us are missing for a long time. We are trying to find a solution to solve the pain in his back,” he added.
