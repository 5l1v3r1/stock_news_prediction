Still, the gauge is heading toward its worst weekly loss in 21 months, and threatens to plumb three-year lows.\nChiNext volatility appears to have dampened sentiment in the broader market.\nTrading in at least 20 companies was suspended on Friday in an apparent effort to avoid margin calls.\nMeanwhile, major shareholders of a growing list of companies have announced plans to buy shares in their firms, stirring memories of the 2015 stock market crash that sent shockwaves across global financial markets.
