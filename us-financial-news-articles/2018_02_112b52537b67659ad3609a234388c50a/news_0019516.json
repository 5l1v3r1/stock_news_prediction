Pearl currently produces 330 million cfd of gas and 20,000 barrels per day of condensate in northern Iraq, he said.\nPearl is owned 35 percent by Crescent Petroleum, 35 percent by Crescent’s affiliate Dana Gas, 10 percent by Austria’s OMV, 10 percent by Germany’s RWE, and 10 percent by Hungary’s MOL.\nJafar also said that Gulftainer, a privately owned port management and logistics company based in the UAE which he chairs, aimed to close an acquisition on the U.S. East Coast this year.\nIf the acquisition closes successfully, Gulftainer will invest an additional $350 million over 10 years in the United States, over and above the company’s plans at Canaveral Container Terminal, he said. Gulftainer currently operates eight terminals worldwide including one in the United States.
