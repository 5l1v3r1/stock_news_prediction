Numis ( NUM.L ) and Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) will act as joint bookrunners for the planned listing, which comes amid an expected clampdown on gambling machines in British betting shops that may make Sky Bet, which is online-only, relatively more attractive. CVC [CVC.UL], Citi, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Numis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In January, Reuters reported Rothschild had been hired to examine a listing for the company, which was formed in 2001 and is headquartered in Leeds. Private equity firm CVC acquired an 80 percent stake in the betting business from pay-television operator Sky ( SKYB.L ) just over three years ago in a deal that at the time valued it at 800 million pounds. In the year ended June 2017, Sky Bet’s revenue increased to 516 million pounds ($715.5 million) from 374 million pounds in the previous period. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 38 percent to 146 million pounds.
