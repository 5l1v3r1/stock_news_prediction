It shows him taking a power saw to the barrel of an AR-15 assault rifle, saying he wanted to make sure it would never be used in a massacre like the one in Florida that killed 17 students and faculty last week.\n“This isn’t the answer to solve all the problems. Quite frankly there is no one answer. There will always be people that will want to kill and will do it one way or another,” Pappalardo says in the video. “But they are not going to do it with this gun. And I‘m hoping that maybe someone will see it and say: ‘Maybe I’ll do the same thing.'”\nPappalardo, a gun rights supporter who says he has the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution tattooed on his arm, closes the clip by pointing out that destroying the gun meant there would be one less lethal weapon in America.\nSince Pappalardo made his post on Saturday afternoon, the hashtag #oneless has mushroomed on Twitter and Facebook as other gun owners have posted pictures or video of their firearms being destroyed.\nA gun cut in half by its owner is pictured in Orange County, California, U.S., February 20, 2018, in this picture obtained from social media.

But this is literally the only I way I can think of to just have fewer guns in the world,” Meyer says in the clip.\nThe movement has won praise from many gun-control advocates who see it as a rare concession from gun owners. Others have scorned the videos as an empty gesture, sometimes countering with an ironic #onemore hashtag that suggests they would be buying another firearm instead.\nReporting by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T03:30:28.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
