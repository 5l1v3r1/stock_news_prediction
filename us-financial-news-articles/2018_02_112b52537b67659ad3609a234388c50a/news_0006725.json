The Advertising Standards Authority has released its annual list of the most complained-about U.K. ads. This year’s winner/loser? A KFC ad featuring a chicken bopping to DMX’s “X Gon’ Give It To Ya,” which racked up 755 complaints. Complainants argued it was disrespectful to chickens (I wonder how many chickens wrote in?) and distressing for vegetarians, vegans and children. Fun fact: For many years, KFC also held the accolade of the most complained-about U.K. ad of all time. Critics at the time said the 2005 spot, w hich showed people eating with their mouths open , could encourage children to adopt bad manners.\nNothing Better Than Spending Time With You Facebook posted another storming quarter , but there were a couple of warning signs. Facebook said its move toward encouraging users to have meaningful interactions reduced the collective time users spend on the platform by about 5%. Remember adland predicting more competition in the ad auction and that reduction in time spent would result in lower ad load and higher ad prices ? Facebook said the average price per ad rose 43% in the quarter, while total supply increased just 4%. Facebook says the price growth was due to providing better targeting and ad units, which drive better business outcomes for advertisers. Elsewhere, daily active users in the U.S. and Canada fell for the first time ever in the quarter, by 700,000. But any bump in the road is unlikely to have a negative effect on marketers’ spending habits in the near term. Here’s Pivotal Research senior analyst Brian Wieser’s take: “Our interactions with marketers suggests that any concerns they have can still be alleviated by Facebook’s sheer scale and its relative utility vs. alternatives in digital media.”\nFacebook and GDPR As we approach Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation coming into effect in May, I’ll continue chronicling how big companies plan to respond and what they’re saying about its projected impact on their businesses. The regulation, you’ll recall (and if you don’t, TechCrunch produced a comprehensive primer earlier this month) requires companies to apply much stricter standards to the way they collect data from European consumers, including asking for consent. On Facebook’s earnings call, COO Sheryl Sandberg said the company realizes “there’s some risk” as some users may opt out of their data being used for ad targeting and that “there may be a DAU [daily active user] impact” in Europe. Ms. Sandberg didn’t offer any estimated numbers. That said, Facebook is confident of its compliance. On a related note, analysts at Deutsche Bank predict users opting out of data sharing could have a 2% impact on Google’s ad revenue , Business Insider reported\nShare a Koch Koch Industries is one of the world’s largest companies, with holdings in businesses as diverse as paper manufacturing and Lycra production. But the “Koch” brand is more associated with the political activities of it owners, Charles and David Koch, who are power players in Republican politics. CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports the company is launching a new series of ads during the Olympics and Super Bowl that aims to raise awareness of the corporate brand’s principles, which include integrity and entrepreneurship. Koch is also hoping the ads will dispel some “misperceptions” about its owners, not by addressing them directly, but communicating why the company does what it does. Koch has run ads before, but this effort, promoting the brand on especially big stages, is about taking the message to another level in the hope of resonating with people who are influential in their communities. Koch is spending between $8 million to $12 million on the campaign, according to a person close to the effort.\nFox Ball Fox Broadcasting confirmed Wednesday it had clinched a five-year deal to broadcast the NFL’s Thursday night package of games. The new $3.3 billion package is a big increase over the NFL’s current deal with NBC and CBS , people familiar with the matter told WSJ. For marketers, the news signals Fox’s intent to be an aggressive bidder for content after parent company 21st Century Fox’s deal to sell a big chunk of its entertainment business to Disney closes. The Fox network’s primetime ratings have been in decline for a while and NFL ratings are declining, too. But football still pulls in some of the biggest audiences on TV, and the Thursday night franchise could give Fox’s other prime-time programming a boost. On the advertising front, data from Standard Media Index shows ad unit rates during Thursday night football games rose 7% in 2017 (although the amount of makegoods to compensate for ratings shortfalls increased 6%) and Thursday games account for around 20% of in-season gross ad spending. Reminder: 21st Century Fox and WSJ parent News Corp share common ownership.\nBest of the rest More than a million followers have disappeared from the accounts of high-profile Twitter users since the New York Times published its investigation into companies that sell fake followers. [ New York Times ]\nYouTube has signed a deal for exclusive rights to air games of a new Major League Soccer team in Los Angeles (known as Los Angeles Football Club). It will stream approximately 18 games on web TV service YouTube TV, with access restricted to subscribers in the Los Angeles market. As part of the deal, YouTube TV also has naming rights on the team’s jerseys. [ Variety ]\nVox Media CEO Jim Bankoff published a memo on the company’s 2017 performance, in which he also said Facebook “does not offer a viable path to monetize our in-depth video work.” But while Vox will cut back its native video programming on Facebook, the news feed is still an “important promotional platform,” Mr. Bankoff wrote. [ Vox Media ]\nAmazon has surpassed Google and Apple to become the world’s most valuable brand, according to Brand Finance’s annual rankings. [ Campaign ]\nTwitter has told at least 1.4 million people they engaged with content created by Russian trolls during the 2016 presidential election. [ Recode ]\nPandora is laying off about 5% of its workforce, a move the company says will help it save $45 million in annual costs. The restructuring will see the streaming company shift its focus to ad tech and an expansion into non-music content.
