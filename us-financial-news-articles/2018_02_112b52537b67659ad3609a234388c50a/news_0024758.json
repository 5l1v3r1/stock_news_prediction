REUTERS/Mukesh Gupta \nThe director general of police for Jammu and Kashmir, S P Vaid, said communications intercepts “suggest that the terrorists involved in the attack belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad group,” a Pakistan-based separatist militant organisation. \nArmy spokesman Lt Col Devender Anand said the three dead militants were wearing fatigues and had assault rifles, a grenade launcher and grenades.

A curfew has been imposed parts of the city. \nIndia accuses Pakistan of training and arming militants and helping them infiltrate across the Line of Control that divides the Kashmir region. Pakistan denies the allegations. \nThe South Asian neighbours have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part.
