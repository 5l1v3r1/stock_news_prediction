A spokesman for the governor had no immediate comment on that decision.\nThe study “will seek to analyze all data available related to mortality, including death certificates, to determine how many more deaths than usual could be related to the hurricane,” according to a statement.\nAn initial report is slated to come out in a month, with a more detailed report likely to take about a year.\nMaria, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in nine decades, came at a time when the island was already trudging through an unprecedented economic crisis. The island declared a form of bankruptcy last May, shouldering some $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt.\nReporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T03:48:36.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
