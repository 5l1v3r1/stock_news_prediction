We’re in the process of doing that now,” said Probst. \nFormer sports doctor Nassar last year pleaded guilty to molesting female athletes under the guise of medical treatment for nearly 20 years, and has been given two prison sentences in Michigan of 40 to 125 years and 40 to 175 years. \nHe is also serving a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions. [nL2N1PV0NI] \nU.S. lawmakers on Thursday began a second congressional investigation into USOC, USA Gymnastics and other gymnastic organizations over the abuse scandal. \nDozens of the victims, including Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles, have accused officials at the USOC, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University of failing to investigate complaints stretching back decades. \nThe board of directors of USA Gymnastics stepped down after U.S. Olympic officials threatened to decertify the governing body. \nThe USOC had announced an independent investigation into its own conduct that would help them understand “who knew what about Nassar’s abuse, when and what they did with that information”. \nUSOC CEO Scott Blackmun has faced calls to resign but Probst said the organization thought he “did the right thing at every turn”.
