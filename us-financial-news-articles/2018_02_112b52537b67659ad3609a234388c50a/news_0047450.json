Their knowledge and experience will be an invaluable resource in our effort to retain the Ryder Cup.”\nWoods, who this week will make his third start of the PGA Tour season after a year-long absence during which he had back surgery, first served as a vice captain at Hazeltine in 2016.\nThe 42-year-old Woods is a veteran of seven Ryder Cups as a player, most recently in 2012. He said he was thankful to be selected as a vice captain but is still keen to earn a spot on the team as a player.\n“My goal is to make the team, but whatever happens over the course of this season, I will continue to do whatever I can to help us keep the Cup,” Woods said in a video played at the news conference. “I‘m excited about the challenge.”\nFuryk said Woods possesses an ability to effectively pair players together in foursomes and fourballs while also inspiring a young team room filled with players who took up the game in the hope of emulating Woods.\nWoods may have plenty of ground to make up if he hopes to be a playing vice captain, but Furyk did not rule out the greatest golfer of his generation filling a dual role.\n“I want to do what’s best for Tiger and I want to do what’s best for the team and that would be a bridge we cross when we got there,” said Furyk. “If he could be valuable as a player, I mean, I‘m sure we would want him playing on this team. But there’s so much time to go.”\nThis year’s Ryder Cup, to be played from Sept. 28-30, will mark Stricker’s third stint as a vice captain, having served at Gleneagles in 2014 and in the 2016 U.S. victory at Hazeltine.\nFuryk previously appointed former Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III as a vice captain and will announce additional vice captains at a later date.\nThe United States won the biennial matchplay event at home in 2016, marking their first triumph since 2008, but they have not celebrated on European soil since a 15-13 victory at The Belfry in England in 1993.\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T01:24:45.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
