One was exempt as she had recently given birth, said Nakhon Chompuchat, a lawyer for the workers.\n“Today, witnesses for the prosecution were presented. The workers will have a chance to speak tomorrow and the day after, confirming the details of their complaint,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation over the phone.\nThe trial will end on Friday with a ruling expected next month, he said.\nNakhon said this was the first time migrant workers had faced criminal defamation charges in Thailand, which could see them jailed for up to two years if found guilty.\n“Today was only the first day of the trial. It is too early to say anything,” Thammakaset owner Chanchai Pheamphon told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThailand has been at the center of a slew of slavery and human trafficking cases, including in its seafood sector, with migrants from Myanmar thought to suffer the worst exploitation, according to rights groups.\nIn the face of mounting global scrutiny of supply chains, Thailand has strengthened laws to crack down on labor exploitation, but activists say the practice is still widespread.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.
