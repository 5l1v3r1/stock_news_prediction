This is the result of long and hard work.”\nThe Games also got a major sports boost on Saturday when Czech Ester Ledecka, a rank outsider, caused one of the biggest upsets in winter Olympics history to win the Alpine skiing Super-G title.\n“Like everyone else we were amazed. It is an incredible story, a most amazing story,” said IOC spokesman Mark Adams of Ledecka, a world champion snowboarder.\n“She is already maybe the Queen of the Games and if she wins that (snowboard competition), then who knows.”\nOne broadcaster who missed the winning run by the Czech was U.S. rights holder NBC -- the biggest single source of income for the Games -- which decided Austrian favorite Anna Veith, in the lead at the time, had done enough to win and cut away before Ledecka’s charge down the mountain.\nVictory for Ledecka, who is a world champion snowboarder, was a welcome distraction for organizers from questions about the empty seats in venues, which they say were due to some postponements at the start due to winds, the Lunar New Year and a cold snap at the start of the Games.\nPyeongchang organizers say they have sold more than 90 percent of their one million-plus tickets but regularly bring in volunteers and other staff to plug the gaps in the tribunes.\nEven venues such as Alpine skiing and short track speed skating -- hugely popular in South Korea -- were not full during preliminaries.\n“Some of the sessions do not have 100 percent tickets sold,” Dubi said, adding organizers were giving tickets to people who had contributed to the Games to have full venues.\n“This is a great thing organizers have done here. We have really great competitions and performances and also a very good job done by the (volunteers) of the athletes.”\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T15:03:12.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
