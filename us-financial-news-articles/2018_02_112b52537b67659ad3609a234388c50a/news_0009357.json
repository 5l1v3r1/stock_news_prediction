However, regulatory crackdowns—most recently in China and India appear to be the prime causes of bitcoin’s current slide . \nFacebook also caused jitters by banning ads promoting cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) on the world’s largest social network. \nAt the time of writing, one bitcoin was worth around $7,720, representing a mighty fall since it neared $20,000 in early December.
