Wilhelmsen ASA ( WWI.OL ) confirmed at the time the raids at its 50 percent-owned Wallenius Wilhelmsen unit and EUKOR, in which it has a 40 percent stake. \nOther shippers involved in the case include K Line (Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd) ( 9107.T ) and Mitsui O.S.K Lines ( 9104.T ), the people said, adding that the companies admitted wrongdoing in exchange for a 10 percent cut in their fines.
