(NASDAQ:CIGI) (TSX:CIGI) today announced fourth quarter and full year operating and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts are in US dollars.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, revenues were $734.2 million, a 27% increase (25% in local currency) relative to the comparable prior year period, adjusted EBITDA (note 1) was $101.1 million, up 12% (10% in local currency) and adjusted EPS (note 2) was $1.41, up 16% versus the prior year period. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS would have been approximately $0.03 lower excluding foreign exchange impacts. GAAP operating earnings were $84.0 million, relative to $76.1 million in the prior year period. GAAP EPS was $0.86 per share, relative to $1.14 per share in the prior year period, and included a one-time charge of $13.3 million ($0.34 per share) to re-measure US deferred income tax assets at lower corporate tax rates upon the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS would have been approximately $0.03 lower excluding changes in foreign exchange rates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues were $2.28 billion, a 20% increase (19% in local currency) relative to the comparable prior year period, adjusted EBITDA was $242.3 million, up 19% (18% in local currency) and adjusted EPS was $3.11, up 27% versus the prior year period. Full year adjusted EPS would have been approximately $0.03 lower excluding foreign exchange impacts. GAAP operating earnings were $166.8 million, relative to $146.2 million in the prior year period. GAAP EPS was $1.25 per share, compared to $1.75 per share in the prior year, with the current year impacted by (i) a significant increase in the non-controlling interest redemption increment related to the quarterly non-cash balance sheet revaluation of non-controlling interests and (ii) the re-measurement of US deferred income tax assets as noted above. Full year GAAP EPS would have been approximately $0.03 lower excluding changes in foreign exchange rates.\n“Colliers generated strong results for the fourth quarter and full year across our all major markets through a combination of acquisitions and solid internal growth,” said Jay S. Hennick, Chairman and CEO of Colliers International. “Client demand and skilful execution drove revenues to record levels, while our leadership team continued to successfully expand and diversify our global platform.

Consolidated internal revenues measured in local currencies were up 13% (note 3), led by very strong Lease Brokerage activity in the Americas region and a significant rebound in Sales Brokerage revenues in the EMEA region relative to unusually low activity levels in the prior year quarter in the aftermath of the June 2016 “Brexit” vote.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, consolidated revenues grew 19% on a local currency basis, led by strong growth in both Lease Brokerage and Sales Brokerage, predominately in the Americas. Internal revenue growth in local currencies was 7%, with the balance from acquisitions completed during the past year.\nSegmented Fourth Quarter Results\nAmericas region revenues totalled $402.8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $291.3 million in the prior year quarter, which represented a 37% increase on a local currency basis. Recent acquisitions contributed 21% to growth and internal growth in local currencies was 16%. Internal growth was generated from very strong Lease Brokerage activity, particularly in the US. Adjusted EBITDA was $40.0 million, versus $34.1 million the prior year quarter, with margin impacted by (i) ongoing investments in people to strengthen operations and add service line capabilities and (ii) greater contribution to revenues from lower margin operations in the US. GAAP operating earnings were $33.7 million, relative to $29.4 million in the prior year quarter.\nEMEA region revenues totalled $183.8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $152.2 million in the prior year quarter, which equated to a 15% increase on a local currency basis. Internal growth was 11%, while acquisitions contributed 4% growth. Internal growth was driven by Sales Brokerage activity during the quarter, particularly in the UK. Adjusted EBITDA was $37.2 million, up 7% from $34.9 million, with margin impacted by additional investment in people and performance-based incentive compensation. GAAP operating earnings were $31.1 million, up from $28.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAsia Pacific region revenues totalled $147.0 million for the fourth quarter compared to $132.2 million in the prior year quarter, which represented a 9% increase on a local currency basis. Internal revenue growth was 8% and a recent acquisition contributed 1%. Adjusted EBITDA was $28.7 million, up 17% from $24.5 million. GAAP operating earnings were $26.8 million, up from $22.9 million in the prior year quarter.\nGlobal corporate costs as reported in Adjusted EBITDA were $4.8 million in the fourth quarter, relative to $3.1 million in the prior year period, with the increase attributable to higher performance-based management incentive compensation accruals. The GAAP operating loss was $7.6 million, relative to $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSegmented Full Year Results\nThe Americas region’s revenues totalled $1.31 billion for the full year compared to $1.02 billion in the prior year, which equated to a 28% increase on a local currency basis. Revenue growth was comprised of 20% growth from acquisitions and 8% internal growth. Internal growth for the year was evenly weighted among all three services lines. Adjusted EBITDA was $122.5 million, up 15% from $106.7 million in the prior year, with the growth rate impacted by (i) investments in people to strengthen operations and add service line capabilities as well as (ii) greater revenue contribution from lower margin operations in the US. GAAP operating earnings were $86.7 million, versus $85.3 million in 2016, with growth largely offset by acquisition-related items and amortization of intangible assets related to recent acquisitions.\nEMEA region revenues totalled $521.3 million for the year compared to $474.9 million in the prior year, which equated to a 9% increase on a local currency basis. Revenue growth was comprised of 6% from acquisitions and 3% internal growth. Internal growth was concentrated in Sales Brokerage, primarily in the UK. Adjusted EBITDA was $69.4 million, versus $55.9 million in the prior year, an increase of 24%. GAAP operating earnings were $47.9 million, up from $34.3 million in 2016.\nAsia Pacific region revenues totalled $441.5 million for the year compared to $399.4 million in the prior year, which equated to a 9% increase on a local currency basis, almost entirely from internal growth across all three service lines. Adjusted EBITDA was $62.0 million, up from $51.4 million in the prior year, an increase of 20%. GAAP operating earnings were $55.7 million, up from $45.6 million in the prior year.\nGlobal corporate costs as reported in Adjusted EBITDA were $11.6 million for the year, versus $11.0 million in the prior year, with the increase attributable to higher performance-based compensation accruals. The GAAP operating loss for the year was $23.5 million versus a loss of $19.0 million in 2016, with the current year’s result impacted by acquisition-related items and restructuring costs.\nImpact of US Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in the United States (“US Tax Reform”), lowering US corporate income tax rates as of January 1, 2018. The impact of US Tax Reform on Colliers is a one-time increase in income tax expense of $13.3 million ($0.34 per common share) for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the re-measurement of US deferred income tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates for 2018 and beyond. The Company believes that presenting its results excluding the 2017 impact of US Tax Reform is meaningful as excluding this non-recurring, non-cash item increases the comparability of period-to-period results (see notes 1 and 2 below).\nUS Tax Reform is expected to favourably impact the Company’s consolidated income tax rate going forward. For 2018, assuming a consistent geographical mix of earnings, a consolidated income tax rate of 30-32% is expected.\nConference Call\nColliers will be holding a conference call on Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the quarter’s results. The call, as well as a supplemental slide presentation, will be simultaneously web cast and can be accessed live or after the call at www.colliers.com in the “Shareholders / Newsroom” section.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release includes or may include forward-looking statements.

This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and MD&A to be made available at www.sedar.com .\nNotes\n1. Reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBITDA:\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings, adjusted to exclude: (i) income tax; (ii) other expense (income); (iii) interest expense; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) acquisition-related items (including transaction costs, contingent acquisition consideration fair value adjustments and contingent acquisition consideration-related compensation expense); (vi) restructuring costs and (vii) stock-based compensation expense. We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our own operating performance and our ability to service debt, as well as an integral part of our planning and reporting systems. Additionally, we use this measure in conjunction with discounted cash flow models to determine the Company’s overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We present adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure because we believe such measure is useful to investors as a reasonable indicator of operating performance because of the low capital intensity of the Company’s service operations. We believe this measure is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies, especially in the services industry. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, net earnings or cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating adjusted EBITDA may differ from other issuers and accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBITDA appears below.\nThree months ended Twelve months ended (in thousands of US$) December 31 December 31 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net earnings $ 42,788 $ 50,320 $ 92,132 $ 91,571 Income tax 37,106 23,691 63,300 47,829 Other income, net 1,868 (233 ) (500 ) (2,417 ) Interest expense, net 2,188 2,277 11,895 9,190 Operating earnings 83,950 76,055 166,827 146,173 Depreciation and amortization 13,610 11,886 52,992 44,924 Acquisition-related items 1,260 1,162 14,927 3,559 Restructuring costs 1,300 547 3,104 5,127 Stock-based compensation expense 1,013 790 4,425 3,279 Adjusted EBITDA $ 101,133 $ 90,440 $ 242,275 $ 203,062 2. Reconciliation of net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share to adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS:\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted net earnings per share, adjusted for the effect, after income tax, of: (i) the non-controlling interest redemption increment; (ii) income tax expense on enactment of US Tax Reform; (iii) amortization expense related to intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions; (iv) acquisition-related items; (v) restructuring costs and (vi) stock-based compensation expense. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company and enhances the comparability of operating results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating this non-GAAP measure may differ from other issuers and, accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings and of diluted net earnings per share to adjusted EPS appears below.\nThree months ended Twelve months ended (in thousands of US$) December 31 December 31 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net earnings $ 42,788 $ 50,320 $ 92,132 $ 91,571 Non-controlling interest share of earnings (7,772 ) (8,826 ) (20,236 ) (20,085 ) Income tax expense on enactment of US Tax Reform 13,325 - 13,325 - Amortization of intangible assets 6,511 5,674 26,658 21,293 Acquisition-related items 1,260 1,162 14,927 3,559 Stock-based compensation expense 1,013 790 4,425 3,279 Restructuring costs 1,300 547 3,104 5,127 Income tax on adjustments (2,298 ) (1,846 ) (8,820 ) (8,202 ) Non-controlling interest on adjustments (582 ) (514 ) (3,359 ) (1,846 ) Adjusted net earnings $ 55,545 $ 47,307 $ 122,156 $ 94,696\nThree months ended Twelve months ended (in US$) December 31 December 31 2017 2016 2017 2016 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.86 $ 1.14 $ 1.25 $ 1.75 Non-controlling interest redemption increment 0.02 (0.07 ) 0.58 0.09 Income tax expense on enactment of US Tax Reform 0.34 - 0.34 - Amortization of intangible assets, net of tax 0.11 0.09 0.43 0.35 Acquisition-related items 0.03 0.03 0.34 0.08 Restructuring costs, net of tax 0.02 0.01 0.06 0.09 Stock-based compensation expense, net of tax 0.03 0.02 0.11 0.08 Adjusted EPS $ 1.41 $ 1.22 $ 3.11 $ 2.44 3. Local currency revenue growth rate and internal revenue growth rate measures\nPercentage revenue variances presented on a local currency basis are calculated by translating the current period results of our non-US dollar denominated operations to US dollars using the foreign currency exchange rates from the periods against which the current period results are being compared. Percentage revenue variances presented on an internal growth basis are calculated assuming acquired entities were owned for the entire current period as well as the entire prior period. Revenue from acquired entities is estimated based on the operating performance of each acquired entity for the year prior to the acquisition date. We believe that these revenue growth rate methodologies provide a framework for assessing the Company’s performance and operations excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Since these revenue growth rate measures are not calculated under GAAP, they may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers.\nCOLLIERS INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC.
