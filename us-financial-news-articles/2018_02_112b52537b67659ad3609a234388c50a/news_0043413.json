As the President of the Republic (Emmanuel Macron) has said, we reaffirm our full attachment to the global action plan and its strict implementation.”\nWithout directly responding to the report, the foreign ministry added: “We will continue to talk about the Iran nuclear programme with our European and American partners.”\nReporting by Ingrid Melander and Sudip Kar-Gupta; editing by Luke Baker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T15:30:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
