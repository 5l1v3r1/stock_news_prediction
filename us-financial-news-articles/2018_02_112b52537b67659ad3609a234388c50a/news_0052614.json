Mr. Sinclair joined the company in 2015 as Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer and worked closely with Mr. Covert to dramatically improve the Company's financial performance and position the Company for growth.\n\"99 Cents Only Stores is one of the most iconic and unique brands in retail today,\" said Mr. Sinclair. \"I am privileged to serve with a team that has laid a solid foundation for success and that delivers unparalleled value and a unique customer experience.

As Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer at 99 Cents Only Stores, Mr. Sinclair refocused the merchandise team on its core mission of providing exceptional value with top-name brands, closeouts, fresh produce and seasonal offerings.\n\"Jack is deeply committed to 99 Cents Only Stores and has been a tremendous advocate for our associates, customers and communities,\" said Mr. Covert. \"I am confident that we have put the company on a path to success and continued profitable growth.\"\nMr. Covert's retirement caps a 44-year career in the grocery retail sector with some of the most iconic brands in the world. Under Mr. Covert's leadership as Chief Executive Officer since September 2015, 99 Cents Only Stores has successfully grown both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has outpaced the industry through a focus on enhancing its merchandising selection and improving the customer shopping experience. This positive operating momentum was instrumental in facilitating the three-year extension of the Company's capital structure announced in December 2017 and positioning the Company for the next stage of growth.\n\"Geoff's contributions to 99 Cents Only Stores have been invaluable and we are grateful for his leadership,\" said David Kaplan, Co-Founder and Global Private Equity Co-Head of Ares Management, L.P. \"Today the Company is well positioned to extend its recent growth trajectory, thanks to Geoff's stewardship and Jack's unique understanding of our business model, knowledge of the industry, and proven track record.\"\nJason Kidd has been appointed as President and Chief Operating Officer, reporting to Mr. Sinclair. Mr. Kidd has over 25 years of retail experience and joined the Company in 2014 as Senior Vice President of Store Operations. Prior to joining 99, Mr. Kidd held a Senior Vice President role with Sam's Club, a division of Walmart Stores Inc.
