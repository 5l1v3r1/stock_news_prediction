They rose despite a jump in bond yields.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average traded 250 points higher after falling as much as 150 points. Goldman Sachs contributed the most to the gains, rising more than 2 percent. The 30-stock index also erased all of its 2018 losses.\nThe S&P 500 gained 1.4 percent, with financials and tech each rising more than 1.5 percent. Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley all traded higher. The index also turned positive for 2018.\nThe Nasdaq composite advanced 1.9 percent, as shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet rose.\n\"It almost looks like the market is realizing the economy is still doing well,\" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. He noted however, the market is \"still in the process of carving off a bottom. ... There's going to be more volatility ahead.\"\nU.S. equities opened lower on the back of stronger-than-expected inflation data. The consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in January . Economists polled by Reuters expected a gain of 0.3 percent. Investors also digested weaker-than-expected retail sales for last month.\nBrendan McDermid | Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. \"You got the worst-case scenario with this economic data,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. \"You got a hotter-than-expected CPI number and weaker retail sales. Unfortunately, CPI gets much more focus than normal because of the wage growth number we saw\" in the last jobs report.\nThe 10-year note yield spiked higher following the data release and hit a four-year high above 2.91 percent.\nBut Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said: \"This isn't, in our view, problematic inflation, but rather a side effect\" of current economic conditions. He noted that corporate earnings are strong and the U.S. economy is accelerating.\nConcerns of rising inflation have recently sent jitters down Wall Street. Last week, all three major U.S. indexes finished the five-day trading period more than 5 percent down each, with the Dow delivering its worst performance since January 2016.\nThose jitters also helped kick off a fresh bout of market volatility. In its previous eight sessions, the Dow has posted six triple-digit moves and two of those are 1,000-point losses.\nIn that time, the Cboe Volatility index (VIX) briefly broke above 50, but traded back below 20 for the first time since the sell-off on Wednesday.\nThe SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund (KBE), rose more than 2 percent and was on track to post its best day since Nov. 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:02:09.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
