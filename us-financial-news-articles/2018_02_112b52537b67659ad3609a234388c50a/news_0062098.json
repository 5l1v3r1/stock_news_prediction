He was originally indicted last year with Gates, Trump's former deputy campaign manager.\nGates agreed to cooperate with Mueller as part of a plea deal to charges that he lied to investigators and conspired against the United States.\nGates' move was seen as adding to pressure on Manafort to cut a deal himself but he said in a statement issued last Friday after Gates' plea deal that he maintained his innocence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T17:10:01.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
