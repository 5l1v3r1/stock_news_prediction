Japan, which colonized the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, has left a deep legacy of mistrust and ill-feeling in South Korea.\nThe Pyeongchang Organising Committee (POCOG) had earlier told Reuters that it ”informed NBC of the errors in their commentary and the sensitivity of the subject in Korea.\n“NBC issued an official letter of apology with additional apology on a live morning show.”\nPOCOG did not immediately respond to the news Ramo had been let go.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford;\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T06:44:02.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
