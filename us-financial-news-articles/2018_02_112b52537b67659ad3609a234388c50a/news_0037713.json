SRS Investment Management LLC, which said it had a 31 percent economic interest in the company, nominated two current Avis board members and three new nominees. Avis acknowledged in a statement it had received SRS’ notice and said it was “disappointed” it would be engaged in a “costly and distracting proxy fight.” Avis last month approved a one-year stockholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, to prevent SRS from obtaining control without paying a premium. SRS said on Thursday its demands included the hiring of a new chief financial officer as well as linking management compensation with performance targets.
