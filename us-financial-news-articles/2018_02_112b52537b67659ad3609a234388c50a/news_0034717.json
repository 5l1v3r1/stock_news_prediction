Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\nHalf of them were at least 64 years old, and three out of four were white.\nIt’s possible that socioeconomic status might have influenced whether people set up patient portal accounts or used them, but the study didn’t include people without insurance, researchers note.\nWhile results from patients at a single cancer center in Texas might not reflect what would happen everywhere, the findings do suggest that doctors should consider the possibility that information communicated via online portals may not necessarily reach patients, the authors conclude.\nParticularly for nonwhite or non-English speakers, this means the portals may not have the intended effect of making medical information more transparent and supporting shared decision making between doctors and patients.\n“Cancer patients presumably are focused on being healthy, and the patient portal is meant to allow patients to engage deeply in managing their health through looking at results and communicating with their providers,” said Dr. Mita Sanghavi Goel, a researcher at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.\n“This study was surprising because it found that there was a trend towards looking at fewer test results over time, even among cancer patients,” Goel said by email. “It raises the question, then, that if cancer patients are less likely to look at their results over time, who would?”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2Bx9yga JAMA Oncology, online January 25, 2018.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T20:41:48.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
