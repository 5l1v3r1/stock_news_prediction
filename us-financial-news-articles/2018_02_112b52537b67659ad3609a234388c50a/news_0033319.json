REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo Answering a question from a member of the public about whether he should buy Bitcoin, Draghi struck a cautious tone.\n“Frankly I would think (about) it carefully,” he said.\nDraghi pointed out that the value of Bitcoin had oscillated much more wildly than that of the euro and that cryptocurrencies were not backed by any public institution.\nHe added blockchain, the distributed ledger technology used to record Bitcoin transactions, was “quite promising” and expected it to bring “many benefits”, citing its possible use to settle payments.\nHe cautioned, however, it was not yet safe enough for use by central banks.\n“We’re very interested in this technology but it’s still not secure for central banking and therefore we need to look through it and investigate it more,” he said.\nThe ECB and the bank of Japan have been looking into using blockchain for financial market infrastructure for over a year, reporting in September “promising results” but “no direct conclusion” for its practical use.\nReporting by Francesco Canepa; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T20:24:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
