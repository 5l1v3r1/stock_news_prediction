Some of China's stainless steel mills, the major consumers of nickel, are losing money at current prices and have already wound down their operations, it said. \"Looking into February, a week long Chinese Lunar New Year will further dampen production and demand. More steel plants are expected to arrange care and maintenance therefore production of stainless steel is expected to contract further,\" it said. \"We expect to see price weakness in nickel going forward.\" FUNDAMENTALS * NICKEL: London Metal Exchange Nickel cut early losses to trade up 0.4 percent, paring Friday's 4 percent plunge that was also fanned by expectations of a glut due to growing nickel ore exports from Indonesia.
