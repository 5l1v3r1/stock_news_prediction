IG investigators had referred Wright Simpson's conduct to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution. But the DOJ declined to bring charges.\nWhen the report was released Wednesday, Shulkin was contemptuous of its findings, saying, \"I have done nothing wrong.\"\n\"The report is not accurate, not objective,\" Shulkin told The New York Times that day . \"I was horrified when I saw the way the investigator conducted himself.\"\nThe Times also noted that Wright Simpson had denied the report's conclusions, claiming that the dinner she had mentioned in the email justifying paying for Bari's travel had actually occurred, and that she had not had a chance to review the report or respond to it before it was released.\nBut by the next day, while appearing before the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Shulkin took a much different tone.\n\"I do recognize the optics of this are not good,\" Shulkin said, according to The Washington Post . \"I accept responsibility.\"\nShulkin said he had written a check to the U.S. Treasury to cover the $4,300 cost of his wife's travel with him last summer, as had been recommended by the IG's report.\nShulkin also said he would follow another recommendation from the report, to pay for the Wimbledon tickets.\nLater Thursday, Shulkin was reportedly summoned to the White House to speak with John Kelly , chief of staff to President Donald Trump .\nThe Post, citing a White House official, reported that at the meeting, \"Shulkin defended himself ... and sought to blame others within VA for not properly handling the trip's preparations and its aftermath.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T20:12:01.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
