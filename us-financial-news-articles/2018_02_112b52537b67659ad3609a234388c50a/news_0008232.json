Economic net income reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on Blackstone’s portfolio and is a key earnings metric for U.S. private equity firms.\nFourth-quarter distributable earnings -- the actual cash available for paying dividends -- was up 94 percent on a year at $1.2 billion.\nNew York-based Blackstone’s assets totalled $434.1 billion at the end of 2017, a record for the firm and up from $387 billion the previous quarter.
