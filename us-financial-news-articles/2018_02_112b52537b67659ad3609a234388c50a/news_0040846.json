The 19-year-old suspect, Nikolas Cruz, was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.\nTrump pledged federal help to the Florida community reeling from the murders. \n\"We are all joined together as one American family and your suffering is our burden also,\" the president said. \nThe shooting is the latest in a string of killings at schools in the United States in recent years. \nLike past mass shootings, it swiftly reignited a national debate about access to assault weapons and possible changes to gun control laws. Authorities believe Cruz used an AR-15 style rifle, which is frequently used in American mass shootings. \nTrump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until sunset Monday, saying in a statement: \" Our Nation grieves with those who have lost loved ones in the shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\"\nThis story is developing.
