Details of the offer could not be learned.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Nordstrom did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe Nordstrom family group, which has partnered with buyout firm Leonard Green & Partners LP, had suspended its attempt to take the company private in October because of difficulties in arranging debt financing for its bid ahead of the key holiday shopping season.\nReporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Harry Brumpton in New York; Additional reporting by Joshua Franklin and Andrew Berlin in New York; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:36:15.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
