It said it continues to support the Second Amendment, which grants Americans the right to bear arms.\nDelta officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. The airline is one of the largest employers in Georgia.\nCagle’s tweet follows a wave of threats to boycott the carrier after Delta’s Saturday announcement.\nNeither Cagle’s office nor the NRA were immediately available for comment.\nThe Georgia legislature is considering a proposed jet fuel tax exemption designed to benefit Delta, but as of Monday, several state Republicans have threatened to withdraw their support for the provision.\nEmory University School of Law Professor Robert Schapiro said that the state has broad discretion in deciding which entities to tax or not tax.\n“In terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,” Schapiro said. “So it doesn’t violate any constitutional principle” to pull support over the NRA debate.\nCagle is running for governor of the state in the 2018 race.\nReporting by Alana WiseEditing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:26:43.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
