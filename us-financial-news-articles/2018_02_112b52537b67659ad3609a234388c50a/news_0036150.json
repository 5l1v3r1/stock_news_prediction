L‘Oreal’s CEO last week said the company was ready to buy back the Nestle stake, should the Swiss group decide to sell.\nSuch a sale figured prominently among Loeb’s demands.\nFILE PHOTO: A Nestle company logo is pictured on a bar of Milky Bar chocolate in Manchester, Britain April 25, 2017. REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo Nestle also said it will explore strategic options including a sale for its Gerber Life insurance business, which had sales of 840 million Swiss francs ($908 million) last year. It will hold on to Gerber baby food.\n“We continue to believe that Nestle has a lot of potential for improvement and a mechanism by which that potential will be realized. But in our view these results don’t advance the argument,” said RBC Capital Markets analysts.\nShares of Nestle, Europe’s second-biggest public company, lost 2.6 percent on Thursday and are down around 8 percent this year. Liberum analysts said they are still expensive, trading at 20.9 times estimated 2018 earnings, a 7 percent premium to the consumer staples sector.\n“Investors’ expectations for a quick turnaround at Nestle appear fully priced in,” said Liberum, which has a “sell” recommendation on the stock.\nWEAK NORTH AMERICA, BRAZIL Nestle’s organic sales growth slowed to 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter to Dec. 31, well below the 2.85 percent estimate in the Reuters poll, hit by weakness in North America and Brazil, particularly in waters and nutrition.\n“We expect most of these issues to be transitory in nature,” Schneider said, forecasting an improvement this year. Still, he gave a wide target for 2018 growth of 2-4 percent, whose mid-point is below the 3.5 percent estimate in the Reuters poll.\nNet profit in the full year dropped 16 percent to 7.2 billion Swiss francs, short of the 9.625 billion average poll estimate, hit by a goodwill impairment in its skin health unit “taken to reflect the current prospects of the business”.\nSchneider would not comment on whether Nestle was still committed to the unit.\nHe said Nestle’s recent purchase of vitamin maker Atrium Innovations and the sale of its U.S. candy business to Ferrero would add 20 basis points to organic growth.\nHe declined to comment on Nestle’s interest in the consumer health businesses being sold by Merck ( MRCG.DE ) and Pfizer ( PFE.N ). Reuters reported earlier this month that Nestle had dropped out of the Merck race.\nNestle proposed a dividend of 2.35 francs per share for 2017, also shy of the 2.40 francs average in the poll.\n($1 = 0.9251 Swiss francs)\nAdditional reporting by Martinne Geller and Helen Reid in London; editing by Alexander Smith and Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T10:35:13.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
