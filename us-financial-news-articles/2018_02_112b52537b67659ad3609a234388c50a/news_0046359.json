Lane would be well placed as chief economist but Weidmann depends on the distribution of the big jobs in 2019.”\nThe “big jobs” include the head of the European Commission, the chairman of European Union leaders and the head of the European Parliament -- all of which will come up for replacement in 2019.\nEuro zone officials said Weidmann could get the ECB top job if, for instance, a Frenchman became the head of the European Commission -- someone like the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier or the head of he IMF Christine Lagarde.\nPicking the Bundesbank chief for the ECB presidency may be tricky, even though Weidmann is considered a top-notch central banker, because he has alienated some officials with his opposition to the ECB’s ultra easy monetary policy, which is credited with reviving economic growth.\nSome other central bank governors regarded this as disloyalty in a time of crisis.\nWeidmann has also ruffled some political feathers, engaging in public exchanges with former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi by criticising Rome’s performance in cutting its debt.\nAfter joining the losing side in the ECB’s biggest decisions to stimulate the economy, Weidmann could also struggle to unite the Governing Council, which rarely takes votes and strives for the broadest possible consensus.
