The index has now fallen for 11 straight sessions. \n* Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which usually carry coal or grain cargoes of about 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes, fell $105 to $9,925. \n* Among smaller vessels, the supramax index fell six points to finish at 819 points, while the handysize index fell six points to close at 520 points. \n* However, the capesize index gained 34 points, or 1.9 percent, to end at 1,824 points. \n* Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as iron ore and coal, rose $182 to $14,318.
