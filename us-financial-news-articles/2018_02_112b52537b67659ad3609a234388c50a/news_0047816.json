Over 93 percent of both female and male Barclays International employees receive a bonus, but female employees received bonuses that were a staggering 78.7 percent lower than their male peers.\nTolga Akmen/AFP | Getty Images \nBarclays suggests that these findings are a result of fewer women in high-paying leadership roles. Across the 79,900 members of Barclays' global workforce — of which 45,100 are male, 34,800 female — there are currently 401 senior management positions held by male employees, compared to just 154 held by female employees.
