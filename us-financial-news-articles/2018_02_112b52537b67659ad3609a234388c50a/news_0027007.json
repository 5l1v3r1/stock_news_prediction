The expenditure increase will be financed with more federal borrowing.\nPrior to the budget agreement, the Treasury had been reducing its borrowing as it approached its statutory debt limit of $19.9 trillion.\nIt sold $15 billion in one-month T-bills a week ago.\nInvestors were avoiding T-bills that mature in early March on worries the government might run out of cash at that time.\nThe Treasury also sold $50 billion in 55-day cash management bills on Tuesday at an interest rate of 1.560 percent.
