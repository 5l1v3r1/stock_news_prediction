REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood Despite Nawaz Sharif’s legal woes, the 68-year-old has maintained a tight grip on the party.\nShahbaz, 66, chief minister of the vast province of Punjab, has built a reputation as a competent administrator who gets things done, especially infrastructure mega projects that are the cornerstone of the party’s electoral appeal.\nRelations between the ruling party and the judiciary have plummeted since Sharif’s ouster in July, with several party officials facing contempt of court notices.\nSharif and party officials have painted the Supreme Court verdicts as judicial overreach and a political conspiracy, insinuating that elements of Pakistan’s powerful military establishment are working against the party because Sharif challenged their power. The military denies playing a role.\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled against Sharif and ordered his removal from the post of party leader, the verdict also barred Sharif’s chosen candidates from contesting next week’s senate elections under the party banner.\nThe court order overturned a legal amendment by party lawmakers allowing Sharif to stay party president despite being disqualified from public office by the Supreme Court for failing to declare monthly income of 10,000 Emirati dirham ($2,723) from a company owned by his son.\nSharif had served as prime minister twice before and each time was removed from office - in 1993 by a presidential order, and in 1999, by a military coup that saw him jailed and later exiled before he returned when General Pervez Musharraf stepped down.\nAdditional reporting by Syed Raza Hassan; Writing by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T13:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T13:35:29.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
