Two years later at the Rio Olympics they added to it.\nMembers of the Finland Olympic team attend a news conference regarding the knitting project in Pyeongchang, South Korea, February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard Their efforts this time, though, are for a different project.\n“We are knitting a blanket for our president’s child,” Koskinen said. “Everyone is knitting a little square, and then we will join them together... I got a bit carried away, so... a rectangle,” he laughed, holding it up.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Another to have got carried away was 20-year-old ski jumper Eetu Nousiainen, who worked away at a long strip of scarf.\n“Maybe mine can be for the president’s dog,” he chuckled.\nPresident Sauli Niinisto’s wife Jenni Haukio gave birth to the couple’s first child on Feb. 2.\nNiinisto, 69, and Haukio, 40, were married in 2009. The child is Haukio’s first and Niinisto’s third. Niinisto lost his first wife in a car accident in 1995.\nEditing by John O'Brien and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:15:54.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
