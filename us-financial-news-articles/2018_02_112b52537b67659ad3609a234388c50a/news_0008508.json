The stock market is taking it as bad news because it is one of the key drivers of inflation and this just suggests potential higher inflation in the U.S. and will eventually lead to potential higher interest rates,” said Ric Spooner, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\nU.S. job growth surged in January and wages recorded their largest annual gain in more than 8-1/2 years, bolstering expectations that inflation will push higher this year as the economy reaches full employment.\nMining stocks were among the biggest burdens on the index, with global miners BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd each shedding more than 2 percent. BHP’s falls pulled the index down by about 10.3 points.\nThe mining index saw its biggest intraday percentage loss since late June, with gold and copper prices dropping as the U.S. dollar strengthened on the unexpectedly strong employment data.\nThe Australian gold index shed nearly three percent.\nDowner EDI, an integrated services business that designs, builds and runs infrastructure and facilities, fell around three percent after it said it would book an impairment on its mining-related business for the half-year to December 31.\nFinancials tracked their peers in the U.S., shedding more than one percent, in line with a more than two percent drop in the S&P Financial index. Commonwealth Bank of Australia dragged the benchmark about 3.9 points lower, while Westpac Banking Corp took it down about 4.2 points.\nWestpac said its stressed assets fell slightly in the three months to Dec. 31 and also announced plans to raise A$750 million ($592 million) in capital through the launch of new hybrid securities.\nConsumer stocks were also lower, with diversified conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd falling to its lowest since late October.\nWesfarmers said it expects A$1.3 billion ($1 billion) in writedowns for the first half of 2018, mostly against its newly acquired and loss-making British hardware division.\nIn New Zealand, the benchmark index fell about 1.6 percent on broad based losses, marking its biggest intraday percentage loss since November 2016.\nThe S&P/NZX 50 index fell 1.6 percent or 131.4 points to 8,283.91.\nHealthcare and consumer staples stocks led the declines, with Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corp losing about 2.9 percent, while a2 Milk Co shed more than three percent.\nA2 Milk was also the biggest drag on the benchmark, pulling it back nearly 20 points.\nMedia company NZME Ltd fell after it said it would apply for leave to appeal the high court’s decision to bar its merger with Fairfax Media Limited’s New Zealand unit.
