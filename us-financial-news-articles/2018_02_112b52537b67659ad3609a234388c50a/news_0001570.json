It is made up of 91 Siemens Gamesa turbines and can generate enough electricity to power 500,000 U.K. homes per year, the Denmark-headquartered business said.\n\"Not only have we achieved full power on schedule, but we have also done so safely, without compromising our high standards,\" David Summers, project director for Race Bank at Orsted U.K., said Thursday. Summers added that he looked forward to officially opening the project this summer.\nAccording to authorities, the U.K. has the world's largest offshore wind capacity. The Race Bank facility is 50 percent owned by Orsted.
