These stakes are held via Yunnan Metallurgical Group.\nTrading in Yunnan Aluminium and Yunnan Chihong’s shares is set to resume on Thursday, having been suspended since Jan. 18 pending major announcements.\nNo formal deal has yet been signed but the parties are “actively negotiating and pushing forward the process of this transaction,” Yunnan Aluminium said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange.\nAsked if Chinalco was going to acquire Yunnan Aluminium, a spokesman for Chinalco said he had no related information. Yunnan Aluminium has a smelting capacity of around 1.6 million tonnes per year, versus around 4 million tonnes per year for Chinalco, China’s biggest state-owned aluminium firm.\nYunnan Aluminium on Tuesday said it expected annual profits to rise by around 488 percent in 2017.\nA third Yunnan metal company, Yunnan Copper, whose parent is part of Chinalco, had trading in its shares halted at the same time and also said trading would resume on Thursday.\nReporting by Tom Daly.
