They were saying to Saad al-Hariri that because you have a deal with Michel Aoun ... and part of Hezbollah in the government, you must resign,” a source close to Hariri said.\nSaudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud welcomes Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, February 28, 2018.
