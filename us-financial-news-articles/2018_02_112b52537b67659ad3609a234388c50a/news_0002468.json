Clayton said at a November conference he hoped to reconcile concerns about the cost of shareholder resolutions with the corporate governance improvements they can bring about. \nSpokespeople for AES and the SEC declined to comment, and the SEC did not make Clayton available for an interview. \nShareholder resolutions have taken on a new importance as fund firms seek money from investors concerned about climate change and corporate governance. \nThe SEC has already taken steps that could raise the bar for filers, such as allowing more resolutions to be skipped as “ordinary business.” \nThe AES resolution and a similar one at CF Industries Holdings Inc were filed by independent investor John Chevedden. Both called for shareholders with at least 10 percent of shares to be able to call special meetings, which can put pressure on management. \nThe companies requested SEC permission to leave the proposals off their proxies. Each company said it planned instead to offer shareholders a resolution to set the special meeting threshold at 25 percent of shares, a higher standard that could protect executives and directors. \nThe SEC sided with AES in December, and with CF on Jan. 30, saying Chevedden’s measures conflicted with the management proposals. A CF spokesman did not respond to messages. \nIn an interview, Chevedden said shareholders could logically vote for both standards to see which had more support. Now, he said, shareholders would “only get to hear management’s side.” Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston; Additional reporting by Michelle Price in Washington; Editing by Richard Chang", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T21:35:16.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
