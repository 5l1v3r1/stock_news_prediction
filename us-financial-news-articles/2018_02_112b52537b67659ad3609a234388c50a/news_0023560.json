The five settlements total $236 million.\nInvestors such as the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and J. Kyle Bass’ hedge fund Hayman Capital Management LP had accused more than 20 banks of conspiring to rig yen Libor, Euroyen Tibor and Euroyen Tibor futures contracts to benefit their own positions from 2006 through at least 2010.\nBanks use the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (Tibor) to set costs of borrowing from each other. Libor is often used to set rates on mortgages, credit cards and other loans.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New YorkEditing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T16:32:34.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
