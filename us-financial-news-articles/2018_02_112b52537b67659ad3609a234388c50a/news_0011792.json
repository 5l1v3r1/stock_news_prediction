We are going to leave him to face justice for rebellion, a crime catered for and punished by the Congolese penal code,” Defence Minister Crispin Atama Tabe told Reuters by text message.\nTshibangu used to be a military commander in the central Congolese region of Kasai. He defected in 2012 and moved to the lawless east, long a haunt of would-be Congolese rebels.\nOne of Tshibangu’s associates, a captain in the Congolese army called Freddy Ibeba, was also arrested in northern Congo on Monday and will be taken to Kinshasa for a hearing, justice minister Alexis Thabwe Mwamba told a press conference on Monday.\nOf Tshibangu, he said: “I would like to reassure that he will be entitled to a fair and equitable trial.”\nKabila’s refusal to step down when his mandate expired in December 2016 has emboldened several armed groups, stoking violence and raising the specter of the vast, mineral-rich nation tumbling back into the kind of wars that killed millions in the 1990s, mostly from hunger and disease.\nReporting Amedee Mwarabu; Writing by Joe Bavier, Tim Cocks and Edward McAllister; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T12:20:25.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
