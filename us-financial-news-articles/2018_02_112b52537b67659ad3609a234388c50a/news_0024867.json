But the ONS highlighted a smaller than usual seasonal decline in the cost of visiting zoos and gardens as pushing up on price growth.\nBoE Governor Mark Carney said last week that inflation could rise above 3 percent before starting a slow descent.\nThe Office for National Statistics figures suggested less pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices.\nAmong manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many of them imported - was 4.7 percent higher than in January 2016, down from 5.4 percent in December and the smallest increase since July 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had expected input prices to rise by 4.2 percent.\nManufacturers increased the prices they charged by 2.8 percent compared with 3.3 percent in December, weaker than the consensus forecast of 3.0 percent and the smallest increase since November 2016.\nThe ONS also said house prices in December rose by 5.2 percent annual across the United Kingdom as a whole compared with 5.0 percent in November. Prices in London alone increased by 2.5 percent.\nMortgage lender Halifax reported last week that average house prices across Britain rose 2.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2017, but fell on a monthly basis in both December and January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T13:54:06.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
