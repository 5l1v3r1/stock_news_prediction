Total fourth quarter revenue growth of 10.9 percent was led by the performance of our commercial business, which increased 25 percent, thanks to year-on-year growth throughout the commercial client category and higher pass-through revenue. Additionally, government revenue benefited from double-digit growth in international government revenue, supported by slightly higher revenue from federal government clients. On a consolidated basis, we delivered service revenue growth for the quarter of 5.3 percent over the prior year quarter, which demonstrated steady growth in demand for our services,\" said Sudhakar Kesavan, ICF's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\"In the fourth quarter, we elected to pay a larger portion of our 2017 non-executive bonuses in cash, rather than in stock awards, to accelerate tax deductible expense into 2017 and reduce our tax expense over a multi-year period. This action, along with our ongoing staff realignment and infrastructure cost reduction programs and acquisition-related expense, reduced operating income by $4.3 million. Excluding quarter-specific items, operating income would have increased 9.7 percent in the fourth quarter, significantly ahead of service revenue growth.\n\"2017 was a year of progressive improvement for ICF. Our full year 2017 organic revenue growth and Non-GAAP EPS performance was in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, and we succeeded in significantly exceeding the range of our operating cash flow guidance. In 2017, we had $1.31 billion in contract wins, the majority of which represented new business. We ended the year with a strong backlog, as well as a robust pipeline of $4.24 billion, providing positive momentum heading into 2018,\" Mr. Kesavan noted.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFourth quarter 2017 revenue was $321.2 million, a 10.9 percent increase from $289.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Federal government revenue accounted for 44 percent of total revenue in the prior year quarter.

ICF Olson 1to1 was named a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Customer Loyalty Solutions, Q3 2017, the highest distinction a company can attain. The Company was recognized as a \"Fast Moving\" Brand by Government Decision-Makers. ICF Mostra, our Brussels-based communications agency, received two gold awards and one silver award at the prestigious 2017 Cannes Corporate Media & TV Awards for videos produced for EU clients.\nSummary and Outlook\n\"We believe that ICF is well-positioned for continued growth in 2018,\" said Mr. Kesavan. \"Our domain expertise and our advisory and implementation skills are aligned with spending priorities in both the government and commercial sectors. Looking ahead to 2018 and 2019, specific growth catalysts for ICF in the government market include budget priorities in the areas of post-hurricane housing recovery, infrastructure, and social/public health programs. In commercial markets, we have a strong pipeline in commercial energy efficiency programs, and an improved economic climate for spending on commercial engagement and marketing programs.\n\"The recent two-year budget agreement calls for the highest increase in appropriations for federal civilian agencies in many years. It usually takes several months after appropriations are completed for the funds to be available to the various agencies and departments. As a result, we have not factored these increases into our 2018 revenue guidance because we do not expect the appropriations process to be completed in time to significantly benefit our 2018 results. Additionally, the new budget includes a substantial allocation for disaster recovery, and we continue to expect RFPs to be released in support of housing recovery programs at the state, county and local levels in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico over the next few quarters.\n\"We expect to continue to achieve operating leverage in 2018 and to deliver year-over-year improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin on service revenue of 10 to 20 basis points, while increasing our investments to drive long-term growth and to improve the Company's ability to scale efficiently. For 2018, GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.45, exclusive of any special charges, on total revenue of $1.245 billion to $1.285 billion. The midpoint of our total revenue guidance is equivalent to 2.9 percent growth in total revenue and approximately 4 percent growth in service revenue, as 2017 total revenue included a higher-than-usual percentage of pass-through revenue. The midpoint of our diluted EPS guidance reflects an estimated year-on-year increase of 16.7 percent, after normalizing 2017 EPS for the impact of the Tax Act. Non-GAAP diluted EPS should range from $3.60 to $3.80. Per-share guidance is based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 19.1 million. Operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million.\n\"As a full taxpayer, ICF will gain a meaningful benefit from the reduction of its effective tax rate to an estimated 26.5 percent from approximately 38 percent, as a consequence of the recently-enacted 'Tax Cuts and Jobs Act'. As a result of this benefit, we have taken the opportunity to return capital to shareholders through the initiation of a dividend program and payment of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14, payable on April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 30, 2018. Given our expectations of continued strong operating cash flow, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged, and includes strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, innovation and technology development, and debt repayment,\" Mr. Kesavan noted.\n1 Non-GAAP EPS, Service Revenue, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measurements.

These exit costs include charges incurred under a contractual obligation that existed as of the date of the accrual and for which we will either continue to pay until the contractual obligation is satisfied but with no economic benefit to us.\n(7) Special charges due to additional cash bonus expense: In response to the Tax Act that was passed in December 2017 and will take effect in 2018, we increased the portion of bonuses that will be paid in cash, which will increase the amount that can be deducted for income tax purposes for 2017.\n(8) EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Percent were calculated by dividing the non-GAAP measure by the corresponding revenue.\n(9) Income tax effects were calculated using an effective U.S. GAAP tax rate of 41.1% and 37.0%, prior to the adjustments for changes in the tax rate under the new tax regulations, for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and 36.8% and 37.5% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 respectively.\n(10) As is shown in the supplemental schedule, we track revenue by key metrics (including client markets and client type) that provide useful information about the nature of our operations. The client markets metric provides insight into the breadth of our expertise while the client type metric is an indicator of the diversity of our client base.\nICF International, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 11,809\n$ 6,042\nContract receivables, net\n291,515\n281,365\nPrepaid expenses and other\n11,327\n11,724\nIncome tax receivable\n5,596\n—\nRestricted cash - current\n11,191\n—\nTotal current assets\n331,438\n299,131\nTotal property and equipment, net\n38,052\n40,484\nOther assets:\nGoodwill\n686,108\n683,683\nOther intangible assets, net\n35,304\n46,129\nRestricted cash - non-current\n1,266\n1,843\nOther assets\n18,087\n14,301\nTotal Assets\n$ 1,110,255\n$ 1,085,571\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$ 75,074\n$ 70,586\nAccrued salaries and benefits\n45,645\n39,763\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n65,080\n52,631\nDeferred revenue\n38,571\n29,394\nIncome tax payable\n—\n106\nTotal current liabilities\n224,370\n192,480\nLong-term liabilities:\nLong-term debt\n206,250\n259,389\nDeferred rent\n15,119\n15,600\nDeferred income taxes\n33,351\n39,114\nOther\n15,135\n12,984\nTotal Liabilities\n494,225\n519,567\nCommitments and Contingencies\nStockholders' Equity:\nPreferred stock, par value $.001 per share;
