John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)\n* Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2BTh857\nBy John Kemp\nLONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Hedge funds continued to take profits on their bullish positions in crude and especially refined fuels in the most recently reported week but supportive comments from OPEC helped steady oil prices.\nHedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by the equivalent of 48 million barrels in the week to Feb. 20.\nThe hedge funds’ net long position has been cut in each of the four most recent weeks by a total of 263 million barrels, in what has been the largest drawdown for more than seven months.\nMost of the drawdown has come from the liquidation of bullish long positions rather than the establishment of new bearish short ones and it has been proportionately greater in fuels rather than crude.\nPortfolio managers have cut their net long position in U.S. heating oil by 58 million barrels, European heating oil by 45 million barrels and U.S. gasoline by 27 million barrels since Jan. 23.\nOver the same period, the net long position in Brent has been cut by 61 million barrels while WTI is down by 71 million barrels ( tmsnrt.rs/2BTh857 ).\nMost of this liquidation seems to be attributable to profit-taking after the big rally in oil prices over the last seven months. Few fund managers have dared to initiate new short positions.\nShort positions across the whole of the petroleum complex total just 137 million barrels. Short positions in NYMEX WTI have fallen to just 30 million barrels, the lowest since July 2014.\nFund positioning remains very stretched with longs outnumbering shorts by a ratio of almost 10:1, but down from almost 12:1 at the end of January.\nDespite the profit-taking, oil prices have steadied, probably owing to a combination of strong consumption growth, a continued fall in oil inventories, and supportive comments from senior OPEC leaders.\nSaudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, has confirmed that it intends to maintain production restraint throughout the remainder of 2018, even if that risks over-tightening the market.\n“If we have to err on over-balancing the market a little it, so be it. Rather than quitting too early and finding out we were dealing with less reliable information ... stay the course and make sure that inventories are where the industry needs them,” the kingdom’s energy minister said on Feb. 14.\nSaudi officials have indicated they want to change the organisation’s target for inventories from the five-year average, which is close to being achieved, to something more ambitious.\nThis represents a significant hardening of OPEC’s policy and has partially reversed the recent slide in benchmark Brent prices, which was probably the intention.\nBut with the market still looking very stretched, especially on the crude side, OPEC may need to sustain its verbal intervention to reassure investors and keep prices firm.\nRelated columns:\n“Hedge funds lighten bullish positions in oil”, Reuters, Feb. 20\n“Oil prices tumble as hedge funds liquidate record bullish position”, Reuters, Feb. 12\n“Hedge funds pause oil buying as rally runs out of steam”, Reuters, Feb. 5\nEditing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T03:46:28.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
