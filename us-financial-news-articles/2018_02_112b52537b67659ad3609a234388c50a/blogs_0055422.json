Hogg — who now has more than 330,000 followers on Twitter — and peers at Stoneman Douglas have gained national attention as advocates for gun-law reforms since a Feb. 14 attack at the school left 17 students and teachers dead.\nFedEx said its views on firearms policy differ from the NRA’s. While the company said it supports the constitutional right of U.S. citizens to own firearms, subject to appropriate background checks, it supports keeping assault rifles out of civilian hands.\n‘Inherent Danger’ Assault rifles and large capacity magazines are “an inherent danger to schools, workplaces and communities when such weapons are misused,” FedEx said in the statement. “We therefore support restricting them to the military.”\nShares of the Memphis, Tennessee-based company rose less than 1 percent to $254.51 at the close in New York. They were unchanged in late trading, following the company’s statement on the NRA.\nFedEx is part of the NRA Business Alliance and offers discounts through its FedEx Advantage program for shipping by FedEx Ground and FedEx Express and some services at FedEx Office, according to company and NRA websites.

Georgia Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, a Republican who is running for governor, on Monday threatened to kill tax legislation that would benefit Delta unless it reinstates its relationship with the NRA. A bill before the state’s General Assembly would exempt jet fuel from sales tax, benefiting the airline.\n“Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Cagle wrote on Twitter.\nDelta said Saturday it would end an NRA contract for discounted rates on flights to the group’s annual meeting. The airline also asked to have its name removed from the NRA’s meeting website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T02:25:50.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
