He said he likes to support local fundraising efforts.\n\"Cannabis is now legal in California and a direct result of that is the munchies a lot of times,\" he joked.\nThe photo drew praise and criticism. Some objected to a child photographed outside a dispensary.\nMarijuana is medicinal and not like alcohol, Senn countered, adding that doctors have been known to prescribe it to treat epilepsy in children.\nAbout 14,000 girls participate in San Diego's Girl Scout cookie program.\n\"As Girl Scouts, we assume good intent,\" Doyle said. \"When we learn that a girl is in violation of a standard/guideline, we almost always discover that the parent was unaware of the rules.\"\nIf a rule is broken again, the girl could lose the awards she earned by selling a certain number of boxes of cookies, but Doyle said that is determined on a case-by-case basis.\nUrbn Leaf wants to talk to the council and clear up any misunderstandings, Senn said.\n\"I've been in the cannabis industry a long time and worked to bring it out of the shadows,\" he said.\nSince the use of recreational marijuana became legal in California on Jan. 1, Senn said it is rapidly becoming accepted.\n\"Anytime we can help out by driving more people to support local fundraising like a Girl Scout selling cookies, we'll do that,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T21:54:53.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
