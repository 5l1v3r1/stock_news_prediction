The prevalence of these schemes has increased in recent months as the volume of trading in bitcoin and other crypto currencies has surged. \nThe tainted version of Browsealoud caused inserted software for mining the digital currency Monero to run on computers that visited infected sites, generating money for the hackers behind the attack, The Register said. \nRepresentatives of the U.S. and British law enforcement agencies and Texthelp could not immediately be reached for comment. \nTexthelp told The Register that it had shut down the operation by disabling Browsealoud while its engineering team investigated.
