It is also my first race of the season‚ which adds to the excitement for me.” \nThe sprinter sacked coach Dennis Mitchell in December after doping allegations were made against Mitchell, who like Gatlin was previously banned for doping. Gatlin is now back with former U.S. Olympic and national team coach Brooks Johnson, who trained the sprinter in 2010-11. \nIn a statement in December to Britain’s Daily Telegraph, which made the allegations against him, Mitchell said: “I never suggested in any way that any of my current athletes used any banned substances or that I was familiar with training any of my current athletes with those substances.” \nThe Athletics Integrity Unit and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) have both said they are investigating the allegations.
