Mashatile was part of a group of the ANC’s top six most powerful officials who met Zuma late on Sunday at his official residence in Pretoria in a bid to convince him to resign.\n“Zuma basically said to us: ‘I‘m not going anywhere. I‘m not convinced by you guys so I‘m not going to resign,” Mashatile told investors at a mining conference in Cape Town on Tuesday. His comments emerged in a recording leaked to several domestic media outlets late on Wednesday.\nPresident Jacob Zuma leaves Tuynhuys, the office of the Presidency at Parliament in Cape Town, South Africa, February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Sumaya Hisham “Our view is that if the president doesn’t want to resign, for whatever reason, we have a party to run that is going to be very soon in the election campaign,” Mashatile said. “We want to ensure that we are not involved in motions of no-confidence, or impeachment that will affect our party.”\nMashatile was not immediately available for comment and an ANC spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\nSlideshow (2 Images) South Africa holds elections next year and ANC leaders worry Zuma’s tenure, which has included corruption scandals and an economic slowdown, could help it lose a majority it has held since the end of apartheid in 1994.\nZuma took power in 2009 but has been in a weakened position since Ramaphosa replaced him as ANC leader in December.\nZuma has survived several no-confidence votes in parliament but faces another on Feb. 22 filed by the far-left opposition party Economic Freedom Fighters.\nANC officials say they want Zuma to resign rather than be forced out by a vote of the ANC’s executive committee, or a parliamentary no-confidence vote, either of which could expose divisions in the party.\nEditing by James Macharia and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:50:27.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
