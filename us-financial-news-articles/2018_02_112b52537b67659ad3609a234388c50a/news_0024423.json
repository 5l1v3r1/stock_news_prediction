Radicalism which is pro-violence,” National Police Chief Tito Karnavian told reporters in Jakarta. \nPolice are currently investigating whether the attacker acted alone or with the help of a larger network. \nAuthorities estimate there are hundreds of sympathisers of the group Islamic State in the country. Many who travelled to Syria to join the group have returned as it loses territory in the Middle East, and officials believe they could pose a security threat to Southeast Asia. \nFour people were killed and 20 injured in 2016 after an Islamic State-linked cell used guns and bombs to mount an attack in the heart of Jakarta’s business district.

Police shot him twice in the leg and he was being treated at a local hospital. They previously said the suspect had been shot in the stomach.
