I was ahead of myself in terms of how to land a jump, how to get out,” he said. \n“I think that it was a good opportunity for me to put myself out there and make silly mistakes like this. In individual, I’ll be more ready.” \nCanada had 17 points to 14 for the United States. Japan was in third place with 13 points, while Olympic Athletes from Russia, bouyed by Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov’s top score of 80.92 in the pairs, were in fourth also on 13 points.

Slideshow (7 Images) \nSkating to Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons,” the 20-year-old was nearly flawless, snapping out a clean set of jumps including a quad toeloop and triple toeloop sequence that drew cheers from the crowd for a whopping 103.25 points. \nHe wobbled on his initial quad flip but was able to hold on, which he said was “a relief.” \n“It wasn’t a perfect performance, but I thought it was pretty good overall,” he said. “I thought I might fall on the flip, but I managed not to, so that gave me confidence.” \nUno said he was surprised by the number of mistakes by the others and said the early start time might have contributed. Skating events normally take place in the afternoon or evening. \n”Skaters who are usually so stable really fell a lot,“ he said. ”I thought it was because it was early morning and there were nerves because of the Olympics. \n“I also thought I’d mess up, I was worried, and just thought that I’d fail too. I was really relieved after the first jump.” \nThe short programs for the women’s singles and ice dancers take place at the weekend.
