Hall has 14 goals and 16 assists in his last 21 contests and recorded his 19th multi-point game of the season.\nKeith Kinkaid, who beat the Islanders Jan. 16 in New York, made 30 saves, including a point-blank stop on John Tavares during an Islanders power play with 4:23 remaining and a glove save on Jordan Eberle’s sharp-angle shots with 44.4 seconds remaining after New York pulled goaltender Jaroslav Halak.\nEberle scored for the Islanders, who dropped their third straight since getting consecutive shutouts over the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes Feb. 15-16.\nHalak recorded 31 saves.\nThe Islanders struck first 3:55 into the second period when Eberle finished off an odd-man rush with Anthony Beauvillier. Eberle scored his 22nd goal when he simply tipped Beauvillier’s pass under New Jersey defenseman Sami Vatanen’s leg into the vacated left side of the net.\nAfter Halak stopped the first 28 shots, the Devils tied it with 13:25 remaining when Palmieri cut to the middle of the slot and ripped a wrist shot over Halak’s left glove.\nNearly five minutes later, Palmieri gave the Devils the lead by re-directing Vatanen’s shot from above the left circle past Halak’s stick while stationed directly in front of the net, doing so moments after Hall dug the puck out of the right corner.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T19:59:11.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
