(NYSE: AOI) today announced results for its fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nAlliance One is transforming itself to realize its potential as a purpose driven organization with a clear vision and focus on achieving competitive distinction and building upon new opportunities to increase shareholder value. We have moved proactively on compelling opportunities to strengthen our company. As we continue to take a well-measured approach to improving our core business, we will build upon the strength of our competencies and prioritize what matters most to our customers. Now, when customers ask us why they should buy our products and services – our answer is clear. Everything we do is to transform people's lives so that together we can grow a better world. Today, we are more confident than ever in our collective strengths to build upon our legacy as a trusted business partner.\nHighlights\nThird Quarter\nTotal sales and other operating revenues increased 5.1% to $477.8 million primarily due to the larger South American crop and a 4.9% increase in average sales prices due to product mix. Gross profit increased 12.8% to $73.5 million and gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to 15.4% from 14.3% last year. Net income was $88.5 million, including a net tax benefit of $73.3 million with $59.4 million associated with estimated discrete net tax benefits related to the new tax law enacted in December, and Adjusted EBITDA improved 12.1% to $57.0 million.\nNine Months Year-to-Date\nSales increased 8.8% to $1,202.1 million mainly driven by the larger South American crop and a 7.5% increase in average sales price due to favorable product mix. Gross profit increased 14.7% to $171.5 million and gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to 14.3% from 13.5% last year. Selling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\") increased 2.3% to $103.3 million primarily due to higher legal and professional fees. Net income was $56.9 million, including a net tax benefit of $66.2 million with $59.4 million associated with estimate discrete net tax benefits related to the new tax law enacted in December, and Adjusted EBITDA improved 17.7% to $115.9 million. In April 2017, as previously reported, the Company purchased and cancelled $28.6 million of its senior secured second lien notes. There are currently $662.9 million of such notes outstanding.\nPieter Sikkel, President and Chief Executive Officer said, \"Fiscal year 2018 continues to progress in line with our expectations. We achieved solid sales growth during the third quarter when compared to last year. Our volume sold has increased, as crop sizes have returned to more normal levels in many key markets despite reduced crop sizes in Africa. We are pleased with this quarter's results and with the continued progress against our key initiatives and strategic objectives.\n\"I am excited to announce that Alliance One has embarked on an ambitious transformation plan called 'One Tomorrow.' This initiative will drive future growth opportunities and reshape our brand as the trusted provider of responsibly produced, independently verified, sustainable, and traceable agricultural products and services. As part of our 'One Tomorrow' long-term business strategy, we are actively developing new business lines and building upon the strength of our core operations.\n\"As we move forward with our 'One Tomorrow' initiative, Alliance One will do much more than just package and sell tobacco leaves. We are pursuing a larger purpose-driven brand vision with the goal of transforming people's lives so that together we can grow a better world. We are an agricultural company where the farmer is at the heart of everything we do. As we move to the future, we will build upon our core competencies, take measured steps to expand into promising new sectors that grow our lines of business, and add new capabilities that fit cohesively into our value-added business model.\n\"This quarter's financial performance highlights both the successful launch of new product lines as well as our proactive efforts to meet the needs of our leaf business.\nCompelling Market Opportunities\n\"Most of our new business lines focus on products that are value-added or require some degree of processing. These products generally have higher margin potential than our core business and play well to our strengths. In January, we successfully acquired majority stakes in two new joint ventures. The extension into growth segments, namely e-liquids, industrial hemp and cannabis, expands Alliance One's presence in higher margin, fast-growing categories. We intend to broaden our business portfolio over the next three to four years by focusing on consumer-driven agricultural products, with increased operating margins when compared to our historical leaf processing business. Consistent with our commitment to growth and incremental to our core leaf earnings, our goal is to generate a significantly increasing portion of our profit from new, higher-margin businesses by 2020.\nE-Liquids\n\"In 2014 Alliance One saw an opportunity to apply the institutional knowledge of our core business when we started Purilum, LLC as a joint venture between IOTO E-Liquids America LLC and our subsidiary, AOSP Investments, LLC (\"AOSPI\"). This investment in a new and growing industry line represented the start of our journey into a new future.\n\"Purilum sets the standard for excellence in flavor development, product quality and compliance – with current good manufacturing practices. Each ingredient used in its e-liquids and flavors is subjected to an extensive review in order to maintain Purilum's position at the forefront of emerging trends. This includes the testing and evaluation of ingredients for flavors and e-liquids. Ingredients include traceability from raw materials to finished product, with batch labeling and quality verification. These industry-leading standards give Purilum the ability to consistently meet the quality and capacity demands of its customers.\n\"In August 2017, AOSPI made a 40% equity investment in Nicotine River, LLC. This new joint venture has enhanced Purilum's revenue and profitability growth, and Purilum's business is anticipated to further expand as it utilizes its flavor expertise to support product offerings for our new hemp and cannabis businesses.\nIndustrial Hemp\n\"In December 2017, our subsidiary Pure-Ag NC, LLC, acquired a 40% equity position in North Carolina-based Criticality, LLC (\"Criticality\"), with triggers that allow for consolidation up to 50% on or after March 31, 2020. Criticality utilizes the strength of our farmer network to grow industrial hemp in North Carolina under the state's pilot program, which is then used for cannabidiol hemp oil (\"CBD\") extraction in Criticality's facility in North Carolina. Our five year goal is to become a leader in CBD production and consumer products.\nCannabis\n\"In January 2018, our wholly owned indirect subsidiary, Canadian Cultivated Products, Ltd. acquired a 75% equity position in Canada's Island Garden Inc. (\"CIG\") and an 80% stake in Goldleaf Pharm Inc. (\"Goldleaf\").\n\"CIG is one of only 35 companies fully licensed to produce and sell medicinal cannabis under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations in Canada (\"ACMPR\"), and has a 20,000 square foot indoor growing facility in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Plans are underway to expand the current facilities by an additional 250,000 square feet of greenhouse capacity at their current site. Currently CIG sells products direct to patients and through distributors. In January, CIG signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Province of Prince Edward Island to be one of three suppliers chosen to supply the recreational cannabis market that is expected to open in the summer 2018.\n\"Goldleaf is a late-stage applicant under the ACMPR for required licensing to produce and sell medicinal cannabis in Ontario, Canada and is currently completing construction of a 20,000 square foot indoor growing facility with further expansion planned for an additional 710,000 square feet of production over a three year period.\n\"The combined Canadian cannabis acquisitions are anticipated, subject to regulatory approvals, to have approximately 1 million square feet of production space within a three year period and with the opportunity to become a truly international cannabis company - expanding into international markets as anticipated legalization of medicinal and recreational cannabis use progresses around the world. These acquisitions will integrate and further advance Purilum's flavor expertise as edibles and vaping products become permitted under applicable law.\nContinued Focus on the Core Business\n\"Included within our 'One Tomorrow' transformation initiative is a continued focus on our core business. We recognize that building upon our core business requires us to remain focused on delivering high-quality products and services to our core tobacco customers. Additionally, our contracted farmer base remains a priority for us, often producing a significant volume of non-tobacco crops utilizing the inputs and agronomic expertise that our team provides. Alliance One is working to find markets for these crops as part of our ongoing efforts to improve farmer livelihoods.\n\"Our fiscal year forecast is in line with our expectations. Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, volume increased 1.7% driven mostly by South America and Asia, and partially offset by smaller, lower-quality African crops. Excluding Africa, global market conditions have been positive and weather patterns good, supporting better growing conditions. The heavy North American hurricane season did not materially affect our contracted flue-cured crop and qualities are generally good. Additionally, we anticipate that, in the fourth quarter, we will catch up with delayed shipments, which resulted from a prolonged shortage of containers in South America and China.\n\"Compared to the prior year, total sales increased $97.0 million or 8.8% to $1,202.1 million attributable to a 7.5% increase in average sales price due to product mix primarily in South America, North America, Asia and Europe. Current year revenues increased by 8.8% with total costs of goods and services sold increasing by 7.9% which improved gross profit by 14.7% to $171.5 million, and gross profit as a percentage of sales from 13.5% in the prior year to 14.3% in the current year.\n\"Current year sales included a higher ratio of lamina to byproducts than in the prior year. Average tobacco costs per kilo increased 8.9% predominantly from product mix, although they were offset favorably by lower conversion costs from the larger current South America crop. The larger South America crop size this year was the primary driver of processing and other revenues increasing 2.1%, with processing costs decreasing 10.1% from lower conversion costs.\n\"We are pleased to report that operating income increased by 50.7% to $78.1 million when compared to the prior year. In addition to a stronger third quarter compared to the prior year, our fiscal year 2018 forecast remains unchanged with sales in a range of $1,900.0-$2,000.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA in a range of $165.0-$185.0 million. By fiscal year-end, we also expect good improvement in our net leverage ratio, defined as total debt minus cash divided by Adjusted EBITDA. Our goal remains to purchase $25.0-$50.0 million per year of our more expensive debt.\n\"We will continue to enhance our sustainability and track and trace capabilities. Sustainability is core to everything we do and central to our value proposition with customers and suppliers. From the field, to our factories, to our products, to our customers' products, every action we take is centered on the future with emphasis on continuous improvement. Our focus on sustainability began many years ago, because it made sense for our business. Only recently has regulation started to catch-up to standards we established for ourselves, in labor and environmental impact, as well as the ability to track and trace crops through the supply chain.\"\nMr. Sikkel, concluded, \"Future prospects for our business are bright. We are taking measured steps to strengthen our preferred supplier role with customers, further developing our position as a key supplier for both traditional requirements as well as next generation products. Looking forward, we have begun to transform the company by diversifying our earnings stream through new businesses that are complementary to and help support each other by building on our core capabilities, institutional knowledge, operational expertise and corporate values. By developing a team for the future, creating an innovation-driven culture, and strengthening the balance sheet – we plan to redeploy invested capital with a goal of achieving net income growth over the next four years. These actions reflect our ongoing commitment to providing high-quality products while meeting evolving customer and consumer preferences. Our transformation strategy is anticipated to substantially improve the earnings potential and competitiveness of our company. We are excited about developing and maximizing future opportunities to drive enhanced shareholder value.\"\nPerformance Summary for the Fiscal Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nVolumes increased 0.9% to 102.5 million kilos primarily driven by the large crop size in South America normalizing after the smaller weather-related crop size last year, and the timing of shipments in North America. Volume increases were slightly offset by volume decreases in Africa due to short weather-related crops this year, primarily in Malawi.\nTotal sales and other operating revenues increased 5.1% to $477.8 million primarily attributable to a 4.9% increase in average sales prices due to product mix in Asia, where lamina as a percentage of Asian sales was 32.6% higher this year compared to last year.\nGross profit increased 12.8% to $73.5 million, and gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to 15.4% from 14.3% in the prior year.\nSG&A increased $5.9 million to $34.6 million as a result of higher professional fees associated with our business development initiatives and the non-recurrence of a reversal of reserves for customer receivables in the prior year.\nInterest expense decreased 5.4% to $33.2 million from the prior year primarily due to lower average borrowings on our long-term debt, and seasonal lines of credit which were at lower average rates.\nCash taxes increased 11.1% to $2.7 million and the effective tax rate was (1,007.6)% this quarter compared to 692.1% for the same period last year. This quarter's rate includes a provisional discrete net tax benefit of $59.4 million due to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, release of the valuation allowance, and a so-called transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). For additional information please refer our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.\nPerformance Summary for the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2017\nVolumes increased 1.7% to 255.8 million kilos this year versus last year due to the larger crop size in South America normalizing after the smaller weather-related crop size last year, and the timing of shipments in North America were offset by volume decreases in Africa due to short weather-related crops this year primarily in Malawi.\nTotal sales and other operating revenues increased $97.0 million to $1,202.1 million attributable to a 7.5% increase in average sales price due to product mix primarily in South America, North America, Asia and Europe, and an increase in volume.\nAverage tobacco costs per kilo increased 7.9% from product mix and the impact of European currency movement, which was partially offset by lower conversion costs.\nGross profit increased 14.7% to $171.5 million and gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to 14.3% from 13.5% last year. The increase in gross profit was driven by revenues increasing by 8.8% with total costs of goods and services sold increasing by 7.9%. The larger South America crop size this year was the primary driver of processing and other revenues increasing 2.1%, with processing costs decreasing 10.1% from lower conversion costs.\nSG&A increased 2.3% primarily related to higher professional fees associated with our business development initiatives and the non-recurrence of a reversal of reserves for customer receivables in the prior year partially offset by reduced incentive compensation costs.\nOther income increased $5.6 million to $9.9 million, driven by sales of intrastate trade tax credits in South America and the receipt of South American funds previously held in escrow that are now covered by bond.\nOperating income increased by 50.7% to $78.1 million when compared to the prior year.\nDuring the current year, we purchased $28.6 million of our existing senior secured second lien notes due 2021 at a discount, resulting in debt retirement income of $3.0 million.\nInterest expense increased 2.5% to $100.1 million, mainly due to higher average rates and slightly higher average balances on our seasonal lines of credit.\nCash taxes increased 78.0% to $12.7 million and the effective tax rate was 396.4% year-to-date compared to (49.2)% for the same period last year. This period's rate includes a provisional discrete net tax benefit of $59.4 million due to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, release of the valuation allowance, and a so-called transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income resulting from the Tax Act.

These statements are based on current expectations of future events. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated expected or projected. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements: changes in the timing of anticipated shipments, changes in anticipated geographic product sourcing, political instability, currency and interest rate fluctuations, shifts in the global supply and demand position for tobacco products, changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation of tax laws and regulations, resolution of tax matters, adverse weather conditions, changes in costs incurred in supplying tobacco and related services, the impact of regulation and litigation and risks and uncertainties associated with our new business lines, including the risk of obtaining anticipated regulatory approvals in Canada, as well as the anticipation of enactment of Canadian legislation legalizing the production and sale of cannabis for recreational use. Additional factors that could cause the Company's results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements can be found in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2017 and the other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") which are available at the SEC's Internet site ( http://www.sec.gov ).\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\" or \"GAAP\"). They include EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Debt. Tables showing the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures are attached to the release. Adjusted EBITDA anticipated for fiscal year 2018 is calculated in a manner consistent with the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the attached tables. Because of the forward-looking nature of this estimate of Adjusted EBITDA, it is impractical to present a quantitative reconciliation of such measure to a comparable GAAP measure, and accordingly no such GAAP measure is being presented.\nAbout Alliance One International, Inc.\nAlliance One International is an agricultural company that delivers value-added products and services to businesses and customers, and is a trusted provider of responsibly sourced, independently verified, sustainable and traceable products and ingredients.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nSales and other operating revenues\n$ 477,783\n$ 454,535\n$ 1,202,115\n$ 1,105,060\nCost of goods and services sold\n404,282\n389,383\n1,030,648\n955,576\nGross profit\n73,501\n65,152\n171,467\n149,484\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n34,625\n28,736\n103,274\n100,904\nOther income\n1,019\n2,688\n9,909\n4,311\nRestructuring and asset impairment charges\n-\n450\n-\n1,068\nOperating income\n39,895\n38,654\n78,102\n51,823\nDebt retirement expense\n-\n2,339\n(2,975)\n2,339\nInterest expense\n33,222\n35,129\n100,079\n97,635\nInterest income\n601\n1,845\n2,295\n5,888\nIncome (loss) before income taxes and other items\n7,274\n3,031\n(16,707)\n(42,263)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(73,282)\n20,977\n(66,233)\n20,774\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee companies\n7,770\n2,351\n7,121\n290\nNet income (loss)\n88,326\n(15,595)\n56,647\n(62,747)\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(130)\n(138)\n(289)\n(127)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Alliance One International, Inc.\n$ 88,456\n$ (15,457)\n$ 56,936\n$ (62,620)\nIncome (loss) per share:\nBasic\n$ 9.83\n$ (1.73)\n$ 6.34\n$ (7.02)\nDiluted\n$ 9.80\n$ (1.73)\n$ 6.32\n$ (7.02)\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding:\nBasic\n9,001\n8,941\n8,982\n8,923\nDiluted\n9,029\n8,941\n9,009\n8,923\nRECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\"ADJUSTED EBITDA\")(1) (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nNet income (loss) attributable to Alliance One International, Inc.\n$ 88,456\n$ (15,457)\n$ 56,936\n$ (62,620)\nPlus: Interest expense\n33,222\n35,129\n100,079\n97,635\nPlus: Income tax expense (benefit)\n(73,282)\n20,977\n(66,233)\n20,774\nPlus: Depreciation and amortization expense\n8,174\n8,506\n24,845\n25,859\nEBITDA(1)\n56,570\n49,155\n115,627\n81,648\nPlus: Abnormal unrecovered advances (recoveries) to suppliers(2)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nPlus: Reserves for (recoveries on) doubtful customer receivables\n(59)\n(2,943)\n(122)\n(2,801)\nPlus: Non-cash employee stock based compensation\n271\n335\n815\n1,180\nLess: Other income\n1,019\n2,688\n9,909\n4,311\nPlus: Fully reserved recovery of tax(3)\n2,258\n2,382\n6,898\n6,189\nPlus: Restructuring and asset impairment charges\n-\n449\n-\n1,068\nPlus: Debt retirement expense (income)\n-\n2,339\n(2,975)\n2,339\nPlus: Amortization of basis difference - CBT investment(4)\n512\n583\n1,165\n1,208\nPlus: Kenyan investigation legal & professional costs\n161\n436\n1,931\n5,565\nLess: Kenyan green leaf operation Adjusted EBITDA(5)\n1,668\n(840)\n(2,436)\n(6,388)\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$ 57,027\n$ 50,888\n$ 115,867\n$ 98,473\n(1) Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") are not measures of results of operations under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") and should not be considered as an alternative to other U.S. GAAP measurements. We have presented EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to adjust for the items identified above because we believe that it would be helpful to the readers of our financial information to understand the impact of these items on our reported results. This presentation enables readers to better compare our results to similar companies that may not incur the sporadic impact of various items identified above.
