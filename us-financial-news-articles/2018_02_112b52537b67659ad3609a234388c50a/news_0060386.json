So we’re kind of bouncing around the 2,750 area,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 177.61 points, or 0.7 percent, to 25,232.42, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 9.95 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,734.33 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 7.84 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,322.51.\nAbout 76 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is above the average 72 percent recorded in the past four quarters.\nCelgene’s 8.1 percent drop ( CELG.O ) was a drag on the healthcare sector after U.S. health regulators rejected the company’s application seeking approval of a multiple sclerosis drug.\nWall Street opened higher after the government revised lower its reading on economic activity in the fourth quarter to 2.5 percent. A regional gauge on U.S. Midwest factory activity fell more than forecast in February, while pending home sales unexpectedly declined in January.\nThe CBOE Volatility index .VIX, a measure of short-term stock market volatility, rose to 19.63.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 62 new lows.\nAdditional reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T17:16:38.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
