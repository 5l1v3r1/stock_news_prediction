Guard/forward Anthony Lawrence had a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds as Miami won the battle of the boards 39-24.\nGuard/forward Jared Wilson-Frame led all scorers with 17 points for the Panthers (8-15, 0-10 ACC).\nThe Hurricanes increased a nine-point halftime lead to 13 points in the first two minutes of the second period, but the Panthers went on a 14-0 run and assumed their first lead of the game when Wilson-Frame’s 3-pointer put them up 44-43 at the 10:43 mark.\nThat was when Walker stepped up, scoring seven consecutive points to give the Hurricanes a 50-44 lead. Miami was back up by double digits, 57-46, with under five minutes left and rolled from there.\nThe defeat was the 10th in a row for the Panthers, matching the program’s longest losing streak.\nBoth teams started cold, combining for only five field goals in their first 19 attempts. The Hurricanes (3 of 10) came out of their funk first, pulling out to a 21-9 lead over the next four minutes.\nThey held a trio of 15-point cushions after that, the last at 34-19 on forward Dewan Huell’s jumper with 3:11 left in the period.\nThe Panthers closed the cap to 34-25 at the break. Miami finished the half 13 of 31 (41.9 percent) to Pitt’s 10 of 23 (43.5 percent) and owned a 20-11 rebounding advantage.\nFor the game, Miami shot 41.8 percent to Pitt’s 41.5 percent. However, the Hurricanes made 17 of 23 free throws, while the Panthers had only three foul shots, sinking all of them.\nBrown, the team’s No. 2 scorer and leading rebounder, will miss about six weeks because of a foot injury.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:31:03.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
