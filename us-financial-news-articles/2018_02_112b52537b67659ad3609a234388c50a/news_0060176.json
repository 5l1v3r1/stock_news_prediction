REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/Files “By the end of 2018, we should have the level of reassurance we need concerning the potential for production rates equivalent to 70 aircraft a month (each),” Petitcolin said.\nCFM, the GE-Safran engine partnership, is experiencing delays of several weeks in LEAP production but aims to catch up within “a few months” as it targets 1,100 deliveries of the new engine this year, up from 459 in 2017, Petitcolin added.\nSafran posted a recurring operating profit of 2.47 billion euros in 2017 on adjusted revenues that rose 4.7 percent to 16.521 billion euros. It raised the dividend 5.3 percent.\nAnalysts were on average expecting flat operating income of 2.403 billion euros on revenues of 16.272 billion euros, according to an Inquiry Financial poll conducted for Reuters.\nSafran said its widely watched civil aftermarket services revenue grew 11.2 percent in dollar terms in 2017 and predicted 2018 growth in the high single digits. GE said last month that its aviation services revenue had grown 13 percent in 2017.\nSeparately, French investment company FFP - one of the leading shareholders in carmaker Peugeot - said it had taken up a stake in Safran with a view to having a say on how Safran is managed.\nSafran shares, which rose 26 percent in 2017, remain up by around 2 percent so far in 2018.\n($1 = 0.8112 euros)\nReporting by Tim Hepher, Jean-Michel Belot; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T11:00:44.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
