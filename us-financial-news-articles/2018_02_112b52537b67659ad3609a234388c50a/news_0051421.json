The All-Star finished with nine assists, seven rebounds and four steals.\nDomantas Sabonis came off the bench to score 21 points and grab 13 rebounds, and Lance Stephenson added 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the Pacers, who have won four in a row and 10 of their last 13.\nIsaiah Taylor scored 17 points, and Taurean Prince added 14 points for the Hawks, who committed 22 turnovers.\nThe Pacers have been one of the bigger surprises of the NBA. They opened the post-All-Star break stretch in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. They also got a key contributor back with the return of Glenn Robinson III, who missed the first four months of the season after undergoing ankle surgery during training camp.\nThe Hawks are headed in the opposite direction and are tied with Orlando for the fewest wins in the Eastern Conference.\nThe Pacers turned 13 Atlanta turnovers into 18 points in the first half and separated themselves by closing the second quarter with a 13-5 run. Young hit a layup in the final seconds of the second quarter, sending the Pacers into the locker room with a 61-44 lead. Young led all scorers with 16 points in the first half.\nAtlanta never mounted a serious challenge in the second half and lost its third straight game.\nKent Bazemore finished with 12 points, and rookie Tyler Dorsey came off the bench to add 11 points for the Hawks.\nIndiana now heads out on a four-game road swing, beginning in Dallas on Monday.\nAtlanta will look to bounce back at home on Monday against the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe Hawks and Pacers will meet again Wednesday in Atlanta.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:37:04.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
