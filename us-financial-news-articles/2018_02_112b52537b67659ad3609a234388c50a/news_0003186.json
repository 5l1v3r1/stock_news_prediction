In addition to the hotel, the development will include new upscale apartments, residential townhomes, condos, retail space, and a community center.\nWe completed construction on two 3-R projects during the fourth quarter: Bolton Plaza, Phase II (Jacksonville, FL) and Trussville Promenade (Birmingham, AL). The Company invested $8.9 million into these properties for a projected annualized return of 10.1%.\nThe Company’s 3-R program currently includes seven projects under various stages of construction, with estimated combined costs ranging from $71.0 to $77.0 million and an estimated combined annualized return ranging from 8.0% to 9.0%. During the quarter, the Company commenced construction on one new 3-R project at Beechwood Promenade (Athens, GA), which will include a new 21,668 square foot lease with Michaels and a new outlot for Starbucks.\n2018 Earnings Guidance\nThe Company is introducing guidance for 2018 FFO, as defined by NAREIT, in a range of $1.98 to $2.04 per diluted common share. The 2018 earnings guidance is based on the following key assumptions:\nOperations\nIncrease in same-property NOI of 1.0% to 1.5% (including bad debt expense); Year-end retail portfolio leased rate of 94.5% to 95.5%;\nInvestments\nDispositions of operating properties of +/- $60 million in the first quarter; No acquisition or capital markets activity; The effects of prior-year operating property dispositions of $78 million;\nOther\nGeneral and administrative expense of $21.5 million to $22.5 million; GAAP interest expense of $66 million to $67 million; Non-cash below market lease amortization and straight line rent of $9.0 to $9.5 million; Gain on sale of non-depreciable assets included in Other Property Related Revenue of $2 million to $3 million; and Fee Revenue of $2.0 million to $2.5 million.\nThe 2018 earnings guidance is based on a number of factors, many of which are outside the Company’s control and all of which are subject to change. The Company may change its guidance during the year if actual or anticipated results vary from these or other assumptions, although the Company undertakes no obligation to do so.\nGuidance Range For Full Year 2018 Low High Consolidated net income per diluted common share $ 0.27 $ 0.33 Add: Depreciation, amortization and other 1.71 1.71 FFO, as defined by NAREIT, per diluted common share $ 1.98 $ 2.04 Earnings Conference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss its financial results on Friday, February 2, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Funds from Operations (FFO) is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. The Company calculates FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, in accordance with the best practices described in the April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). The NAREIT white paper defines FFO as net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairments of depreciated property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nConsidering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. For informational purposes, the Company has also provided FFO adjusted for accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs, transaction costs, a severance charge and a debt extinguishment loss in 2016. The Company believes this supplemental information provides a meaningful measure of our operating performance. The Company believes our presentation of FFO, as adjusted, provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and among our peer companies. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance, is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. A reconciliation of net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) to FFO is included elsewhere in this Financial Supplement.\nKite Realty Group Trust\nSame Property Net Operating Income\nFor the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(Unaudited)\n($ in thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 %\nChange 2017 2016 %\nChange Number of properties for the quarter 1 104 104 Leased percentage at period end 94.6 % 95.3 % 94.6 % 95.3 % Economic Occupancy percentage 2 93.2 % 93.3 % 93.6 % 93.0 % Minimum rent $ 59,124 $ 57,940 $ 234,739 $ 228,652 Tenant recoveries 16,172 15,905 65,245 62,866 Other income 1,159 1,412 1,998 2,133 76,455 75,257 301,982 293,651 Property operating expenses (10,490 ) (10,474 ) (40,373 ) (39,430 ) Real estate taxes (9,534 ) (9,202 ) (39,342 ) (38,124 ) (20,024 ) (19,676 ) (79,715 ) (77,554 ) Same Property NOI 3 $ 56,431 $ 55,581 1.5 % $ 222,267 $ 216,097 2.9 % Same Property NOI - excluding the impact of the 3-R initiative 4 1.5 % 3.2 % Reconciliation of Same Property NOI to Most Directly\nComparable GAAP Measure: Net operating income - same properties $ 56,431 $ 55,581 $ 222,267 $ 216,097 Net operating income - non-same activity 5 9,546 10,886 46,156 49,078 Provision for bad debts - same properties (547 ) (573 ) (2,427 ) (1,814 ) Other expense, net (65 ) (126 ) (315 ) (983 ) General, administrative and other (5,360 ) (5,375 ) (21,749 ) (20,603 ) Transaction costs — — — (2,771 ) Impairment charge — — (7,411 ) — Depreciation and amortization expense (40,758 ) (42,939 ) (172,091 ) (174,564 ) Interest expense (16,452 ) (17,613 ) (65,702 ) (65,577 ) Gains on sales of operating properties — 4,059 15,160 4,253 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (486 ) (541 ) (2,014 ) (1,933 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 2,309 $ 3,359 $ 11,874 $ 1,183", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T01:00:45.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
