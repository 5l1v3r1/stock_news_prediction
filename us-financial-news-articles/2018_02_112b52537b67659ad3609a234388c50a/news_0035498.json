After that, though, we were able to increase the gap stage by stage.”\nFrance’s world champion and three-times Rally Sweden winner Sebastien Ogier, who won last month’s Monte Carlo opener, was in 10th place for M-Sport Ford, four minutes and 24 seconds off the lead.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Neville Dalton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T22:41:09.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
