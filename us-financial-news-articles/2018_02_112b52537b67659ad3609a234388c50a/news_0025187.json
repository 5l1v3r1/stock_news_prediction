Wang would retain a minority stake in the business. \nLanvin does not publish earnings. It made an 18.3 million euro loss in 2016, sources with knowledge of the situation had previously told Reuters. Losses had been forecast to deepen to at least 27 million euros in 2017 as sales continued to fall, they said. \nLanvin has twice changed artistic director since Elbaz’s departure, but the appointments have yet to revive sales. \nChinese interest in European fashion labels has been on the rise. A Lanvin purchase by Fosun would follow recent acquisitions by conglomerate Shandong Ruyi ( 002193.SZ ), which on Friday agreed to buy a controlling stake in Swiss luxury shoe and accessories firm Bally. \nShandong Ruyi already owns stiletto-heels maker Jimmy Choo.
