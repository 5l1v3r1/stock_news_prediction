He said that England got their first and there was no clear downward pressure. I saw that completely different. I thought Gareth got there first and there was clearly downward pressure. \n“It’s human error. But in front of 82,000 people when there’s a lot at stake these guys have to get these decisions right. That looked a clearcut one to me.” \nDespite Wales clawing their way back into contention with a valiant second-half display after England’s fast start, captain Alun Wyn Jones said it had been too little too late. \n“We showed positive character and were in the ascendancy in the second half,” he said. \nEngland coach Eddie Jones preferred to steer clear of the controversy, heaping praise on his side who have now won 15 consecutive home games in the Six Nations. \n“I don’t know why people say we’re lucky with the refereeing decision. The TMO has all the time in the world to make his decision and I never get involved in what is decided,” he said. \n”He made a decision and you get on with it. \n“It was a win built around a lot of courage, a lot belief in the team. We had a short turnaround. We knew we had to play a certain way to beat Wales today and the execution was outstanding. The effort in defence was first class.” \nHolders England slipped behind Ireland at the top of the table on points difference but remained on course for an unprecedented third successive Six Nations title.
