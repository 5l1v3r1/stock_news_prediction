While Ryanair says talks are ongoing in seven countries, only British union BALPA has signed a recognition agreement.\n“We suggest you leave now, and we call on the board and investors to engage a new CEO to return this airline to its rightful place,” the EERC letter said.\nRyanair said in a statement that the EERC and its communications had “no legal standing or validity.”\nIt said that 80 percent of Ryanair pilots had already accepted a 20 percent pay increase that the EERC has opposed on the grounds that accepting it could prejudice future talks between management and trade unions.\nReporting by Conor Humphries, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:56:13.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
