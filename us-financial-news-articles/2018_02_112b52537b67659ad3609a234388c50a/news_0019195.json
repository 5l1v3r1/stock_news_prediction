A random selection saw 780 winners receive two tickets each, the government said in a statement.\nA total of 812 people attended Thursday’s show, among them 252 special invitees picked separately by the government.\nAbout five minutes away from the concert hall, 80 protesters staged a demonstration in sub-zero temperatures, blasting out songs opposing the Pyeongchang Olympics and beating on drums.\nA barricade of about 100 police kept the protesters away from the performance site.\n“They are here to make fools of South Koreans, and I cannot accept that,” said 71-year-old Kwon Oh-seok, adding that he had travelled from Seoul, the capital, to protest against the performance.\nSouth Korea temporarily lifted a ban on North Korean ships to allow the Mangyongbong 92 ferry, carrying the troupe to enter the eastern port of Mukho on Monday.\nThe North’s orchestra will stage its second and last performance in Seoul on Sunday.
