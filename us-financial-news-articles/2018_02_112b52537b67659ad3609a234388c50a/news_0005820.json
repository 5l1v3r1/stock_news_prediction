It plans to raise that amount to 400 million euros in 2018. \nThe bank, which is the driving force behind the current boom in funding for French start-ups, also reached a record 255 million euros in venture capital funding in 2017, up 33 percent from the previous year. \n($1 = 0.8051 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T10:20:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
