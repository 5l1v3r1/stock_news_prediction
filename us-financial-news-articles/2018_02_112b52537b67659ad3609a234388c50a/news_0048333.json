The aircraft took flight for the first time at the end of January , but this is the first footage we've seen. The test flight lasted for 53 seconds, reaching a height of just 16 feet. \nAirbus announced Vahana two years ago and it's being developed by the company's A 3 team. The ultimate goal is to create a personal, autonomous taxi service. Airbus believes it could someday achieve a vehicle that goes four times faster than road traffic, with a range of 50 miles and a cost that's comparable to commuting by car or train.
