Instead, the US equity benchmark managed to pare back its weekly loss to 5.2 per cent, the biggest decline since early 2016.\nMr Dalio has also become increasingly gloomy over the past year, concerned at the deepening political polarisation in Washington and a shift in central bank policy.\n\"We will have more volatility as we are entering a new macroeconomic environment.\" -Bob Prince, Co-chief investment officer at Bridgewater At the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, he said markets were still in a \"goldilocks\" period, but warned that the current cycle was in its final stages and would be acutely sensitive to shifts in expectations for interest rate increases.\nMost analysts expect markets to recover their footing further once investors refocus on the healthy economic backdrop, but volatility remains elevated and Mr Prince, cautioned that there could more pain in the pipeline.\n\"Last year equity markets had a free run. But this year we are going from central banks contemplating tightening policy to actually doing it,\" Mr Prince said. \"We will have more volatility as we are entering a new macroeconomic environment.\"\nBrian Levine, co-head of global equities trading at Goldman Sachs, on Friday sent out an email to the investment bank's bigger clients that also warned that the market probably still has not hit its bottom.\n\"Historically shocks of this magnitude find their troughs in panicky selling,\" he said in the email, seen by the FT. \"I've been amazed at how little 'capitulation selling' we've seen on the desk . . . The 'buy on the dip' mentality needs to be thoroughly punished before we find the bottom.\"\nWhile last week's turmoil was primarily fuelled by the unwinding of \"short-volatility\" bets, Mr Prince predicted that the broader economic backdrop was setting the stage for more turbulence later this year.\nThe improving health of the global economy has sparked concerns that long-dormant inflationary pressures will finally emerge, forcing central banks to reduce bond-buying programmes and raise interest rates more aggressively than expected.\nWhile Mr Prince doubted inflation would become a real problem, he expected central banks to start draining the global economy of some of the trillions of dollars they have pumped into the financial system in recent years — further challenging the post-crisis bull market.\nThat meshes with the view of Mr Levine at Goldman Sachs, who said that \"longer term, I do believe this is a genuine regime change, one where you sell-the-rallies rather than buy-the-dips\".\nHowever, Mr Prince expects global growth will stay on track despite tighter monetary policy and more turbulent markets. \"The real economy will outperform financial economy this year, the opposite of what we've seen in recent years,\" he said.\nReceive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1 .", "external_links": ["https://sub.ft.com/spa2_14/?segmentId=5f29555b-cfe0-3e40-9d3d-6c4e520fe546&utm_us=JJLAL", "https://www.ft.com/content/9eb75568-0fcf-11e8-8cb6-b9ccc4c4dbbb", "https://www.ft.com/content/76ebf55e-0fc3-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277", "https://www.ft.com/content/a108e1fe-0dec-11e8-8eb7-42f857ea9f09"], "published": "2018-02-12T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T14:36:37.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
