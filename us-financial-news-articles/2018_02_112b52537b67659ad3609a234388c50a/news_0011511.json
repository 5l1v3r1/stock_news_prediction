Christine brings tremendous pedigree and energy in building and leading early stage companies. Our focus on scaling the business into a more mature organization is well aligned with her previous experience. The Board of Directors has full confidence in Christine’s leadership skills in executing on our customer and market expansions.

Christine received her Masters in Economics from Norges Handelshoyskole in Bergen and holds undergraduate degrees from the University of Bergen and University of Oslo.\n“I am very excited to join Kezzler at a time where digitalization of products is at an inflection point. The Kezzler technology platform leveraged through partnerships with leading packaging, licensing and management consulting organizations holds great promise. I look forward to working with the Board and all of our employees. Implementation of the Kezzler product platform will significantly contribute to an increasingly transparent product value chain with no room for fraud or counterfeiting.
