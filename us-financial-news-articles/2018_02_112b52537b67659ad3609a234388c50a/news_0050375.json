On Sunday, it announced two new models, plus refreshed versions of three phones first offered last year.\n“We feel great about the momentum we had in 2017 and that gives us the confidence to double down in 2018,” Seiche told reporters at a briefing in London ahead of the product launch.\nMobile phone market tracker Counterpoint Research said Nokia phones surged during 2017 to become the world’s No. 1 seller of low-cost feature phones and No. 11 in smartphones after only entering the market last year. On a combined basis, Nokia now ranks as the No. 6 mobile phone seller, Counterpoint calculates.\nThe New Nokia 6, Nokia 8 Sirocco, Nokia 8110, Nokia 1 and the Nokia 7 Plus are seen at a pre-launch event in London, Britain February 22, 2018.

REUTERS/Peter Nicholls HMD’s strategy is to use distribution partnerships with 600 top mobile operators and retailers in selected markets around the world to offer reliable, affordable products with the latest innovations, plus monthly Google security updates on all phones.\nEurope remains the biggest region for Nokia phones sales, Seiche said; India, Russia and Indonesia are its biggest country markets.\nSlideshow (5 Images) The Nokia 8 is the company’s flagship phone, priced at 749 euros ($920.75) and designed to compete with Samsung’s and Huawei’s premium models. A new, 4G-ready version of Nokia’s 8110 is priced at 79 euros ($97).\nNokia 8 is available in April, the revamped 8110 in May. The 1990s throwback model comes in two colour choices, classic black or banana yellow, a play on how its keyboard slid out, inspiring the nickname “banana phone”.\nNokia Corp, once the world’s dominant phone maker, sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 and is now focused on telecom network equipment.\nHMD took over the Nokia feature phone business from Microsoft in 2016 and struck a deal with Nokia Oyj to use the brand on smartphones.\nEditing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T19:08:21.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
