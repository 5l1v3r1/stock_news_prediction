We are not happy with this date, we think it is modest, this is too distant.” \nOrban met Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic earlier in the day in Budapest. \nThe EU acted on Tuesday to reinvigorate the membership ambitions of six Balkan states and reclaim the region as its own amid growing Russian and Chinese influence, setting 2025 as a goal for Serbia and Montenegro to join.
