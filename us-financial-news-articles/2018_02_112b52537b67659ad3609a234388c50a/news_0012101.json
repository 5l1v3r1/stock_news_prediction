Thousands were Haitians fearing deportation after the United States ended their temporary protected status granted after a 2010 earthquake. \nCanadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale met with U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday and said afterward that the two countries still did not fully understand what exactly was driving the phenomenon. \nWashington said last month it would end the temporary protected status of some 200,000 Salvadorans in September 2019. \nGoodale, asked whether he was concerned by a possible increase in border crossings, said “the status issues are not likely to arise in significant volumes during the course of 2018” given the September 2019 cutoff date. \n“So far, the statistics would indicate the impact is relatively minor, but we need to be ready for every eventuality,” he said in a phone interview from Washington. \nCanada has sent multiple members of parliament to speak with diaspora communities in the United States and dissuade people from crossing illegally. \nDespite this push, the number of people walking across the border increased 23 percent in December compared with the month before. Goodale, though, said that was well below the peak seen earlier in 2017. \n“If the numbers dramatically change, then we would be ready to cope with that,” he said. \nDuring the meeting with Nielsen, Goodale also discussed cyber security, opioids, and issues regarding border preclearance, or approving goods and people before they cross the frontier.
