The Company expects to close the offering of the Notes on or about February 23, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThe Notes will be the unsecured obligations of the Company and will earn interest payable semi-annually on each September 1 and March 1 to registered holders of the Notes at a rate of 4.70% per annum.\nThe Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") or any state or other securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws. The Company plans to offer and issue the Notes only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S. The Notes will be subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom and in compliance with other applicable securities laws.\nThe Company estimates that the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Notes (after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and its estimated offering expenses) will be approximately $345 million.
