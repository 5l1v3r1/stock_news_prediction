We wish Connor all the best and I‘m also sure that Sive Speelman is going to gain a wealth of experience during his time in South Korea.”\nSnow Sports South Africa has been trying to grow its footprint among the mainstream sports in the country and last year held Alpine ski events on the FIS tour that attracted over 80 international competitors from 18 different countries.
