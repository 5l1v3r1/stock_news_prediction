The crash of flight 703 killed everyone on board, Russia’s Transport Minister, Maksim Sokolov, told Interfax. \nThe airplane, which had made international flights, was operated by regional Saratov Airlines and was carrying 65 passengers and six members of the crew on its way to the city of Orsk on the border of Kazakhstan. \n“A few minutes (after takeoff) radio communication was lost with the crew of the airplane and sight of the plane disappeared,” Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency said. Other witnesses told Russian media that there was a loud bang before the plane hit the ground. The plane left a crater more than 6 feet deep in the rural surroundings of Ramenskoe region in the southeastern Moscow province, state TV said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:10:01.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
