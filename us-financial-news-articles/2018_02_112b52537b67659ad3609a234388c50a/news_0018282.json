Not to worry, there are talking robot guides for that. But what if you don't speak Korean? Have no fear — these robots speak English, Chinese, Korean and Japanese. What about transport between the PyeongChang event's 12 venues? Hyundai's self-driving buses have you covered.\nThese are just some of the next-level technologies that South Korea will be implementing for the Winter Games, with more than 655,000 tickets sold so far.\nSeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg via Getty Images The world's fifth biggest exporter and 10th-largest economy, the country of 50 million — which is about one-fifth the size of California — is home to tech giants including LG, Samsung and Hyundai. South Korea's Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning has teamed up with local companies to put together an experience they hope will drive home the country's dominance in advanced technologies.\nNext-level viewing experience South Korea's broadcasters are airing all their major events in Ultra-High Definition (UHD) standard, which is four times higher in resolution than HD content. The PyeongChang games will see the most widespread use of 360-degree virtual reality (VR) cameras of any major global sports event, giving at-home viewers a more immersive experience than ever.\nMike Egerton | PA Images via Getty Images First-person perspective You'll also get to watch events like figure skating from new perspectives with Korean mobile carrier KT Corp's \"time slice,\" which captures athletes mid-motion from different angles, or witness a race from a first-person perspective by watching it from a camera mounted on the athlete's helmet.\nED JONES | AFP | Getty Images Figure skaters Kim Ju-Sik (L) and Ryom Tae-Ok of North Korea attend a practice session at the Gangneung Ice Arena in Gangneung prior to the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 4, 2018. 'Ghost skier' technology Broadcasters may also use \"ghost skier\" technology, whereby a live run is overlaid by a previous run and can be compared in real time. These advances could provide vital information in an environment where milliseconds can make the difference between gold and silver.\nOffering viewers an even more engaging experience, a Hologram Live service will project athlete interviews from the slopes as holograms, letting you feel like they're right there in the room with you.\nGroundbreaking connection speeds SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg via Getty Images All of this is made possible by state-of-the-art information communication technology (ICT), for which South Korea is well known.

The robot also plays multiple songs and dances,\" a company representative told CNBC.\nYoungki Hwang Members of the popular Korean pop group \"Seventeen\" interact with a Furo-D robot at the ICT Pavilion in PyeongChang on January 31, 2018. South Korean robotics company Future Robot will be providing 30 Furo-D robots during the PyeongChang Games, which will act as guides and translators across the arenas and airport. Through AI, the machine learns from hearing thousands of examples and teaches itself to improve over time.

December 12, 2017. South Korea has been chasing this Olympic bid for 18 years, having lost past bids to Sochi and Vancouver. It's sparing no expense — in addition to the Olympic organizing committee's budget, the government is pouring $10 billion into infrastructure including roads and high-speed rail. Despite this, ticket sales have been slower than expected — in part due to the region's extreme cold and geopolitical tensions on the Korean peninsula.\nIt might not be able to change its fiercely cold weather conditions or the behavior of its northern neighbor, but South Korea is on track to set a precedent as a host for both the Olympic Games and game-changing tech.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T08:54:37.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
