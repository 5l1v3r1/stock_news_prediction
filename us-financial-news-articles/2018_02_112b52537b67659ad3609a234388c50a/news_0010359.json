He took over as Gas Natural’s chairman a year and a half ago and the company said on Tuesday in a statement that it had named him honorary chairman. \nAbertis said in a separate statement it would replace Reynes with current Chief Financial Officer Jose Aljaro. Gas Natural’s shareholders will have to ratify the change at their next meeting, which will likely take place in April. \nReynes takes over as Europe’s energy sector is expected to enter a period of consolidation as utilities seek to gain scale and shift their revenue streams towards renewables to protect profits from steep competition and narrower margins. \nReuters reported last year that Gas Natural had approached Portuguese rival EDP about merging to form Europe’s fourth biggest utility by market value. \nAbertis builds and maintains highways in Spain, France, Latin America and the United States. It also has a telecommunications division that manages and operates satellite infrastructure. \nHochtief secured unconditional EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its bid to buy Abertis. Abertis shareholders will have the final say on who will buy the company.
