Actually winning at HQ is a different story, however, as the rules have spurred some controversy over loopholes and the typical fine print frustrations. \nSoFi, an online personal finance company that essentially targets the same demographic as HQ (see: Millennials ), is hoping to console some of those players who are not as successful at HQ with a special challenge. \nThe San Francisco-based company announced on Monday that it will dole out $25 (in a SoFi Wealth account , of course) to 200 losers of HQ Trivia each day this week, starting today through February 16th. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nTo enter, HQ players will need to write a tweet to SoFi’s Twitter account ( @SoFi ) with a screenshot of their HQ loss display and the hashtag “#SoMoney.” Participants must be at least 18 years old and U.S. residents. \nDoubling down on the millennial love, SoFi is also wooing HQ gamers with the promise of its new card game, dubbed “So Money.” At first glance, it might look like a baby blue-hued version of the raunchy card game for parties, Cards Against Humanity .
