Improving economic conditions in Brazil are also boosting its shares, said Garcia.\nAmerica Movil, which holds more than half of Mexico’s mobile phone subscriptions, saw its profitability fall sharply after a 2014 telecommunications overhaul by the government, aimed at lessening the firm’s dominance. Attracted by the changes, AT&T ( T.N ) entered Mexico in 2014, touching off a price war.\nAmerica Movil has waged an aggressive campaign to shift its business toward mobile data. Broadband subscriptions rose more than 4 percent over the previous year in the fourth quarter, and the company’s average revenue per user jumped nearly across the board, driven by strong data consumption.\nOverall revenues and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the quarter were in line with analysts’ expectations.\nRevenue was 263.9 billion pesos, down slightly from 269.3 billion a year ago.\nShares of America Movil rose 26 percent over the past year, while Mexico’s IPC index was essentially flat. The results were released after the market closed.\nReporting by Julia Love, Noe Torres and Christine Murray, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T03:45:55.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
