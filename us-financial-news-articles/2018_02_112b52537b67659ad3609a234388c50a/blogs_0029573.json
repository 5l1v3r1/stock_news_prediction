Litecoin remained about 11 percent lower for the year so far. \nLitePay, which says it's based in San Francisco, tweeted late Monday that \"infrastructure for LTC [will launch] February 26.\" \nCoinbase, the leading U.S. marketplace for major cryptocurrencies, also announced on Wednesday that it has launched a new service that lets merchants accept bitcoin , bitcoin cash , ethereum and litecoin payments. \nLitecoin seven-day performance \nSource: CoinMarketCap \nLitePay CEO Kenneth S. Asare said in an email on Wednesday to CNBC that on Feb. 26, 41 countries including the U.S., U.K., China, Japan and Germany \"will have access to LitePay merchant payment processing.\" He also said that the Litecoin Foundation, a Singapore-registered nonprofit for advancing litecoin, is an investor in LitePay. \nAsare said his team has been working on LitePay's development since the summer of 2017. \"Our goal is to create a way for merchants to earn Litecoin, which is a particularly good crypto currency for payments,\" Asare said. \nLitecoin is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. The coin split off from bitcoin in an effort to increase transaction speeds and was released in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former employee of Coinbase and Google. Lee said in December he \"sold and donated\" nearly all his litecoin holdings. \nIqbal Gandham, U.K. managing director at eToro, also attributed part of litecoin's gains Wednesday to a fork, or split in two, scheduled for Sunday. The split will give every holder of litecoin 10 coins of \"litecoin cash.\" \n\"With the fork in litecoin cash it seems to help miners use their equipment more efficiently,\" Gandham said, noting the new coin does not appear to have significant transactional advantages over the original coin. \nFounder Lee has called the plan to split litecoin a \"scam\" not supported by the original litecoin team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T22:49:52.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
