The day after the incident, Twitter’s trending hashtags and topics were dominated by shooting-related terms, according to Wired.\nTroll and bot-tracking sites, like Hamilton 68 , which was created by Alliance for Securing Democracy , reported an immediate uptick in activity from accounts linked to Russian influence campaigns.\n“This is pretty typical for them, to hop on breaking news like this,” Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of New Knowledge, a company that tracks online disinformation campaigns, told the New York Times . “The bots focus on anything that is divisive for Americans. Almost systematically.”\nResearch sites that track Twitter activity from Russian-linked accounts look for indicators such as posting at an extremely high volume or sharing content that matches hundreds of other accounts.\nSome bot operators create hashtags and flood the platform until human users pick them up, while others seize hashtags already being used to hijack the conversation. The top two-word phrase on Twitter the day after the shooting, excluding President Donald Trump’s name, was related to the attack, according to Wired .\nThe bots are “going to find any contentious issue, and instead of making it an opportunity for compromise and negotiation, they turn it into an unsolvable issue bubbling with frustration,” said Karen North, a social media professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, told the New York Times . “It just heightens that frustration and anger.”\nFacebook , Google , and Twitter are all battling disinformation on their platforms and the companies have each announced new measures to help eliminate bots and moderate conversation.\nThirteen Russians were named in an indictment from special counsel Robert Mueller last week in the ongoing investigation into the country’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
