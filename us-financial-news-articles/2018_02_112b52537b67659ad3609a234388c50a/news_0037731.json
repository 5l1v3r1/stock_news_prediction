Whether it’s auto parts, chemicals, lumber, sea food, this is actually a very attractive market,” said Champagne spokesman Joseph Pickerill.\nCanada’s overall bilateral trade with Mercosur is only worth C$8 billion ($6.38 billion) a year, he said. Trade with the Pacific Alliance grouping of Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile - all of which have free trade deals with Canada - totals C$48 billion a year.\nThat is dwarfed by bilateral Canada-U.S. trade, which according to Statistics Canada totaled C$780 billion last year.\n“This (opening talks with Mercosur) makes a lot of sense and right now we have got countries very, very eager to work with us,” said Pickerill, adding that Canada was interested in free trade in both goods and services. Exploratory talks took place last year.\nTalks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement have run into trouble over U.S. demands for big changes and an increasingly isolationist approach by the administration of President Donald Trump.\nAfter the United States pulled out of a proposed 12-nation Pacific trade pact last year, the remaining 11 members forged a new deal. Champagne will be in Chile on March 8 to sign that treaty before heading to Paraguay.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau left on Friday for a trip to India, which Canada sees as a potentially valuable export market. Insiders say talks on a proposed free trade treaty are making very slow progress, however, and will not be completed for years.\nReporting by David Ljunggren, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:47:35.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
