It has hired executives who have worked at major international companies such as Intel Corporation and BlackBerry, but also some with backgrounds in Western military and intelligence agencies including the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). \nBannai said Darkmatter is profitable and is providing the UAE government with defensive security tools, but not offensive technology. \n“A massive chunk of what we do with government entities here is ‘how do we strengthen their network to be immune from attacks?’ or at least to recover from an attack,” Bannai said. \nCyber-attacks by hostile governments, militant groups, or by cyber criminals could disrupt key infrastructure such as oil and gas supplies, and desalination plants, which the UAE and other Gulf states depend on. \nTraditionally low-key UAE has become more influential in its foreign policy in recent years, potentially increasing the threat of cyber-attacks. \nIt has intervened in the Yemen civil war, and is taking a leading role in a dispute between some Arab states and Qatar. \nDarkmatter’s relationship with the UAE “is a pure commercial transaction,” Bannai said, unique in a country where nearly all major entities are state-owned or controlled. \n“Definitely, they see a value in having a local partner build these capabilities,” he said.
