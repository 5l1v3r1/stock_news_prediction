The trader believes that after seeing two rallies and two pullbacks, Tesla is in the middle of a fifth wave that will see it head up to complete its Elliott wave cycle.\n\"So heading into 2018 and into 2019, I'm bullish on this stock for a move up,\" he said, predicting that Tesla could even be close to $500 by the end of that wave.\n\nSince the electric-car maker is scheduled to report earnings Wednesday, Gordon is looking to sell a bullish put spread given the spike in implied volatility heading into the event. He wants to sell the February 9 weekly 350-strike put and buy the February 9 weekly 345-strike put for a credit of $2.23. This means that if Tesla closes above $350 on Feb. 9 expiration, then Gordon would make a maximum profit of $223.\nHowever, if Tesla were to close below $345 on that day, Gordon would face a maximum loss of $277. On Friday, the stock was trading at about $345, below the break-even level of $347.95.\nTesla is up 11 percent year to date.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
