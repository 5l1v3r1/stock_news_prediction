Last month, a Democrat won a special election for another Wisconsin state Senate seat that Republicans had held for 17 years. Republicans control both state legislative chambers.\n“Governor Scott Walker’s refusal to hold special elections is an affront to representative democracy,” Holder, who served as attorney general under former Democratic President Barack Obama, said in a statement issued with the lawsuit.\n“Forcing citizens to go more than a year without representation in the state legislature is a plain violation of their rights and we’re hopeful the court will act quickly to order the governor to hold elections,” Holder said.\nRepresentatives for Walker, a Republican first elected in 2010 who has been a leading antagonist of Democrats on labor law and other hot-button issues, could not be reached for comment on Monday afternoon.\nA spokeswoman for Walker, Amy Hasenberg, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his decision to wait to fill the seats was consistent with the law, more practical and a way to save money.\n“This D.C.-based special interest group wants to force Wisconsin taxpayers to waste money,” Hasenberg told the newspaper. “The Legislature will be adjourned for 2018 before these seats could be filled in special elections, and staff in these offices are working for constituents until new leaders are elected.”\nThe National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which bills itself as an anti-gerrymandering group, seeks to position Democrats favorably for the round of redistricting following the 2020 census, according to the election information website Ballotpedia.\nReporting by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Cooney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T04:54:14.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
