He will serve on the board nominating and governance committees, Chevron said in a statement. \nUmpleby doesn’t serve on any other corporate boards besides Caterpillar‘s. \nJohn Watson retired on Wednesday as chairman of Chevron’s board and chief executive. \nUmpleby’s appointment was the first move by Chevron’s board under Mike Wirth, the new chairman and CEO. \nBoth companies are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. \nChevron is slated to report quarterly results on Friday. The company boosted its dividend this week by 4 percent.
