Net income of $80.5 million included a one-time tax charge of $15.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29 percent to $199.2 million, representing a 76 basis point margin expansion from 2016.\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.58 for 2017 compared to $2.28 for 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $3.10 for 2017 compared with $2.56 for 2016. Reported results in 2017 include a one-time tax charge of $15.5 million associated with the passage of the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" and restructuring expense of $1.7 million. Reported results in 2016 included restructuring expense of $12.3 million.\n\"JBT delivered double-digit growth in 2017 and performed well against the framework of our three-year Elevate strategy,\" said Tom Giacomini, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We have positioned the company for continued strong performance in 2018 and beyond and are optimistic about our outlook based on robust market demand and further margin improvements.\"\nOrders and Backlog\nFor 2017, inbound orders of $1.7 billion increased 23 percent from 2016, reflecting a gain of 29 percent at FoodTech and a 9 percent increase at AeroTech. Backlog expanded 12 percent from 2016.\nInvestment for Growth\nDuring 2017, JBT completed acquisitions of Avure, a major provider of cutting edge, high pressure processing solutions; PLF, which makes food and beverage filling systems; and AMSS, a manufacturer of military aviation equipment. \"All three acquisitions enhance JBT's ability to provide comprehensive customer solutions,\" stated Giacomini.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, JBT acquired Schröder Maschinenbau GmbH & Co. KG (\"Schröder\") headquartered in Werther, Germany. \"The addition of Schröder solidifies JBT's position in the marinating and injection portion of the protein value chain,\" added Giacomini.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nFourth quarter 2017 revenue increased 19 percent from the year-ago period, comprised of 6 percent organic growth, 11 percent growth from acquisitions, and a 2 percent foreign exchange benefit. Net income of $19.4 million included a one-time tax charge of $15.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $67.6 million increased 39 percent, representing a 200 basis point margin expansion from the year-ago period.\n\"We achieved record margins in the fourth quarter of 2017, although slightly below our expectations,\" said Brian Deck, JBT Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"FoodTech faced some operational inefficiencies, which we expect to resolve by the end of the first quarter of 2018. We also incurred acquisition-related costs we had not factored into our guidance.\"\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.61 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $0.78 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding tax-related adjustments and restructuring charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.10 compared with $0.85 in the year-ago period.\nTax Reform\nAs a result of the U.S. Tax Reform signed into law in December 2017, JBT recognized a one-time tax charge of $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Half of this charge related to a repatriation tax on accumulated overseas earnings. The other half arose primarily from revaluing net deferred tax assets due to the lower statutory tax rate. For 2018, JBT expects a tax rate of approximately 27 percent, excluding any discrete items.\n2018 Outlook\nFor 2018, the Company anticipates revenue growth of 10 - 13 percent, reflecting organic growth of 7 - 8 percent, 2 - 3 percent from completed acquisitions, and a net benefit of 1 - 2 percent from adoption of the new ASC 606 revenue recognition standard.\nJBT forecasts diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $3.85 - $4.05 in 2018 with operating margin expansion of 100 to 125 basis points. The Company anticipates a new restructuring program in 2018. Details of the program and the impact on earnings guidance will be available at the time of the first quarter 2018 earnings release. The current guidance includes a benefit of $0.18 - $0.20 per share from a lower tax rate associated with U.S. Tax Reform.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company projects revenue growth of approximately 8 percent and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.32 - $0.36. JBT expects the first quarter to be impacted by project-related timing, the resolution of aforementioned operational inefficiencies, and higher R&D spending on new product development. JBT expects a discrete tax benefit in the second quarter of 2018 associated with stock compensation of an estimated $4 million, or $0.12 per share, subject to the stock price at the time of vesting. Similarly, in the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $5.8 million, or $0.19 per share.\n2017 Earnings Conference Call\nA conference call is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. EST on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 to discuss 2017 financial results.

Further, we add back to EBITDA significant expenses that are not indicative of our ongoing operations to calculate an Adjusted EBITDA for the periods reported. Given the Company's focus on growth through strategic acquisitions, management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important non-GAAP financial measure. This measure allows us to monitor business performance while excluding the impact of amortization due to the step up in value of intangible assets, and the depreciation of fixed assets. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally to make operating decisions and believe this information is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating results.
