Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.\n\"A deal (to sell the company) would have been best for everyone involved, including victims, assuming a sizeable amount of money was set aside from the acquisition to compensate victims,\" said New York lawyer Doug Wigdor, who represents multiple victims of Weinstein's alleged abuse.\nOthers said the bankruptcy would not necessarily limit claims and could introduce more oversight to the creation of a victims' fund.\n\"We don't think that the bankruptcy will ultimately limit what the victims could get,\" said Elizabeth Fegan, an attorney representing victims in a pending class action lawsuit. \"Our claims are not only against The Weinstein Company but also against the board of directors, which will continue to have liability.\"\nContreras-Sweet's latest offer did not meet the requirements of Schneiderman's office and did not set aside enough money to ensure the company's approximately 150 employees would be paid while waiting for the deal to close, according to a letter from the board of directors of The Weinstein Company to Contreras-Sweet and one of her investors, billionaire Ron Burkle of The Yucaipa Companies.\n\"While we recognize that this is an extremely unfortunate outcome for our employees, our creditors and any victims, the board has no choice but to pursue its only viable option to maximize the Company's remaining value: an orderly bankruptcy process,\" the company said in an emailed statement.\nIn its letter, The Weinstein Company said the acquisition offer would increase the liabilities left behind for the studio, \"charting a financial path that will fail.\" It added that the deal could take many months to close.\nThe Weinstein Company, which Reuters has reported as having debts of roughly $375 million, launched in October 2005 and has produced and distributed films including \"The King's Speech\" and \"Silver Linings Playbook.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T10:08:43.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
