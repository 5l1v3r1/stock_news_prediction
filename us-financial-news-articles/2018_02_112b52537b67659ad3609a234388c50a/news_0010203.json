On the other hand, strong high-margin download sales of previously released catalogue titles such as \"NieR:Automata\" have resulted in an increase of operating income, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.\nIn the smart devices and PC browser area, our established lineup of popular games such as \"FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,\" \"HOSHI NO DRAGON QUEST,\" \"DRAGON QUEST MONSTERS SUPER LIGHT\" and \"KINGDOM HEARTS Union χ\" is continuing to show strong performances globally, and an increase of royalty income pushed both net sales and operating income, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.\nIn the area of massively multiplayer online role playing games, revenues from the latest expansions of \"FINAL FANTASY XIV\" and \"DRAGON QUEST X\" led to an increase in the number of paying subscribers and disk sales, which resulted in an increase of net sale and operating income, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.\nIn the Amusement segment, operation of the amusement facilities has been showing steady performance while new amusement machine releases decreased, which led to the decline in this segment's net sales and operating income.\nIn the Publication segment, sales of comic books continues strong, in particular, the digital format sales increased, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.\nIn the Merchandising segment, sales and licensing performed strongly thanks to character goods and soundtracks derived from the Group's own IPs, as well as character goods originated in renowned third-party IPs.\nAbout Square Enix Holdings Co., Ltd.\nSquare Enix Holdings Co., Ltd. with headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, is a holding company leading the Square Enix group of companies with a diverse range of content and service businesses.
