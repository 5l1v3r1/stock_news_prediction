Analysts polled by Inquiry Financial for Reuters had given a median net income forecast of 1.67 billion euros.\nMichelin said foreign exchange movements - based on January 2018 rates - would reduce its annual operating income from recurring activities by about 300 million euros.\nThe French company added it would raise prices to offset higher raw material costs.\nEarlier this month, Goodyear ( GT.O ) cut its 2020 forecast for combined earnings of its three units amid higher prices for raw materials, overshadowing better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.\nMichelin said it would consider further acquisitions, and on Monday announced the purchase of a 20 percent stake in German automotive services provider ATU.\nReporting by Gilles Guillaume and Sudip Kar-GuptaEditing by Laurence Frost\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T19:36:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
