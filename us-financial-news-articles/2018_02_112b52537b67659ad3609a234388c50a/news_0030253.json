It is credited with keeping ticket prices down and stadiums full, giving Germany one of the healthiest fan cultures in European football, as it stops private companies taking over clubs and forcing changes against the wishes of supporters. Exceptions have been granted in the cases of Bayer Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg as investors who have held an interest in a club for at least 20 years can ask for an exemption. Another exception is Hoffenheim where software billionaire Dietmar Hopp was allowed to take majority control in 2014 after investing consistently over two decades. Critics say that some other clubs do not follow the rule to the letter. Bayern Munich are among those calling for a change, saying the rule prevents Bundesliga clubs competing on equal terms with those from England and Spain. In its report, the Bundesliga said the 36 clubs in the top two divisions posted a record combined revenue of 4.01 billion euros (3.56 billion pounds) in the 2016/17 season, a 4.2 percent rise over 2015/16 and the 13th increase in a row. The 18 clubs in the top flight earned a combined 3.37 billion euros while the second-tier clubs pulled in 635.2 million euros, the report said. Fourteen top-flight clubs enjoyed revenues of over 100 million euros and all but two made a profit, added the report which did not give the results of individual clubs. Despite solid finances and high attendances, the Bundesliga has been dogged by criticism that it has become dull with Bayern Munich winning the last five titles, often by large margins. It has again turned into a one-horse race this season with the Bavarians 18 points clear of the rest of the field. Bayern are also the only Bundesliga team in the knockout stages of the Champions League.
