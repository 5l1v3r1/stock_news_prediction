I don’t find it right to say that the Koran, religion and God should not be named in these kinds of events,” he said. \nThe media watchdog ordered that television broadcasts of the talk show be suspended for five episodes, saying it was insulting to women and promoted repression and abuse. \nIt also imposed a fine equal to five percent of the channel’s monthly advertising income because it said the channel was encouraging the audience to switch to its web stream, which the watchdog does not currently have the authority to monitor. \nA draft law presented to parliament on Thursday would expand the watchdog’s powers to include overseeing internet broadcasts, which would allow it to halt content streamed online. \nOktar wrote the Atlas of Creation in 2006, which argues Darwin’s theory of evolution is at the root of global terrorism, with his pen-name Harun Yahya. He has authored more than 300 books which were translated into 73 languages according to his channel’s website.
