Lots of news to get your teeth into before we head into Super Bowl weekend. We’ll have a bumper edition of the newsletter on Monday with all the ad highlights from the big game, but WSJ’s Suzanne Vranica offers up a nice preview from a comfy recliner in this video .\nPeak Football The Super Bowl will once again be a day of celebration for the NFL and command the biggest audience on TV. But what about the longer-term health of the league’s image? According to a new Wall Street Journal and NBC News poll , NFL bosses might have a big marketing job going into next season. Fans’ interest is waning and parents increasingly want their children to turn away from football, amid worries about player safety. Of the NFL’s core audience, men ages 18 to 49, just 51% say they follow the league closely, down from 75% four years ago. The NFL is coming off a tumultuous season in which the decline in TV ratings steepened, key players were injured and protests during the national anthem triggered controversy.\n—My Chart Will Go On—\nWant some stats to impress your friends when the commercials land during your Super Bowl party this weekend? WSJ has you covered with this chart-packed feature. As you’ll know, there’s a small group of companies that run ads virtually every year. Here are the biggest spenders:\nFrom Zero to Hero It’s been well documented that Unilever has been switching up its marketing approach to reduce unnecessary agency and production costs and spur sales growth. That showed up in the company’s financial results for last year. The zero-based budgeter said it generated cost savings of $700 million as it made fewer ads and in-housed some projects, Ad Age reported. The company said it reinvested around $300 million of those savings on media and in-store marketing. “We had too many pieces of traditional TV advertising and we took them off air before they reached full effectiveness. We now make fewer ads, show them for longer and reinvest the savings behind the best ones,” Unilever finance chief Graeme Pitkethly said on a press call. Meanwhile, rather than joining its rivals in a pricing war, Unilever is increasingly marketing to a higher-end audience and selling more products at higher prices . Overall, sales grew 4% in Unilever’s fourth quarter.\nEarning the Alphabet Google’s growth in mobile search and programmatic ads has been leading to higher traffic acquisition costs, the fees it pays to its network of publishers and to device partners like Apple to carry its services. That partly explains why Google-parent Alphabet missed analysts’ profit estimates in the fourth quarter , despite reporting a 24% lift in revenue to $32.3 billion. Elsewhere, while YouTube might have been plagued with brand safety issues last year, the ad money keeps rolling in. On the earnings call, the company talked up a strong quarter for YouTube. The company said the stricter monetization criteria it recently introduced and manual reviews for its Google Preferred premium lineup of channels are receiving “really positive” feedback from advertisers and creators. Cost-per-click, a metric closely watched by analysts that has been declining for years as mobile ad rates trail desktop, fell 14% last year, which was better than analysts had expected. The volume of clicks on Google’s ads was up 42% from the prior year.\n—Fact Label Society—\nSpeaking of YouTube improvements, Google announced Friday it’s going to start labeling all videos from what it identifies as state-funded broadcasters . As the WSJ points out, that is significant considering that YouTube has been a key outlet for RT, the Russian state news organization. (Interestingly, the RT channel, one of the most-watched news networks on the platform, was in YouTube’s Preferred program up until October last year.) Elsewhere, as YouTube looks to prevent the spread of misinformation on its platform, the video platform said it’s also considering surfacing credible news sources next to conspiracy theory videos—reminiscent of some of Facebook’s recent attempts to ward off fake news.\nProject Management A CMO Today exclusive : Ad tech company Rubicon Project announced last year it was dropping the fees it charges ad buyers. Buyer fees represented around half of Rubicon Project’s revenue and last quarter the company said it would need to find ways to operate more efficiently. For some staff, that unfortunately meant cutbacks. The company has now eliminated around 20 back office roles, around 5% of its workforce. Rubicon Project CEO Michael Barrett told me: “We are dealing with a world when you are not running a 1,000-person company, [but] a company of 400 or so people. You don’t need the support staff you once envisioned.” Looking forward, Rubicon Project is also considering whether it should depreciate or sell its orders business, Mr. Barrett said. That division essentially offers tools that streamline the sales processes between buyers and sellers, making it easier to transition traditional ad budgets onto automated platforms. Mr. Barrett added: “We have never been more excited about the long-term prospects of Rubicon,” which he said is now seeing more ad impressions than ever before.\nBest of the rest Bud Light is increasing its media spend and boosting outreach to distributors as it looks to turn around slowing beer sales. Look out for Bud Light’s latest take on its “Dilly Dilly!” campaign at this weekend’s Super Bowl. [ WSJ ]\nAd agency Droga5 has fired its chief creative officer, Ted Royer. A company representative said in a statement: “We are committed to maintaining a safe and inclusive environment for all our employees. We are unable to comment further on personnel matters.” [ Adweek ]\nAmazon executives didn’t really give much away about its advertising business on the company’s earnings call Thursday, but we did find out its “other” division, where its advertising revenue is accounted for, grew 60% to $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. [ Digiday ]\nCBS and Viacom said Thursday that their boards have formed special committees to once again evaluate a potential merger. [ WSJ ]\nBuzzFeed editor Ben Smith and Laurene Powell Jobs have reportedly held discussions about Ms. Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective investing in BuzzFeed’s news division. [ Financial Times ]\nGermany’s antitrust regulator has opened a probe into online advertising in response to concerns from advertisers and publishers about the dominance of Google and Facebook. [ Reuters ]\nA report from ad fraud researcher Social Puncher suggests the publisher of Newsweek and the International Business Times bought fake traffic in order to meet the guarantees of an ad deal it had secured with federal agency Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Newsweek Media Group acknowledged it had purchased traffic but said it works with third-party verification companies and denied any fraudulent activity. CFPB says it is investigating the report’s findings. [ BuzzFeed News ]\nNorm Johnston, chief digital and strategy officer of WPP’s media agency Mindshare (and global CEO of its FAST business division), is joining video ad tech company Unruly as its chief executive. WSJ-owner News Corp acquired Unruly for about $90 million in 2015 and the company’s three founders announced they were stepping down from their full-time positions late last year. Mr. Johnston replaces co-founder Sarah Wood.
