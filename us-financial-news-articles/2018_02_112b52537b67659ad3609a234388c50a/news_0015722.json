(2) Land sales transactions which require the Company to incur the cost to provide the requisite mitigation credits necessary for obtaining the applicable regulatory permits for the buyer, with such costs representing either our basis in credits that we own or potentially up to 5% - 10% of the contract amount noted. (3) The acres and amount include the buyer’s option to acquire 19 acres for approximately $2.0 million, in addition to the base contract of 26 acres for approximately $3.2 million.

The Company may determine to complete the site-work or develop some or all of this parcel.\nAs noted above, these agreements contemplate closing dates ranging from early 2018 through fiscal year 2020, and although some of the transactions may close in 2018, some of the buyers are not contractually obligated to close until after 2018. Each of the transactions are in varying stages of due diligence by the various buyers including, in some instances, making submissions to the planning and development departments of the City of Daytona Beach, and other permitting activities with other applicable governmental authorities including wetlands permits from the St. John’s River Water Management District and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and conducting traffic analyses with the Florida Department of Transportation and negotiating other matters with Volusia County. In addition to other customary closing conditions, the majority of these transactions are conditioned upon the receipt of approvals or permits from those various governmental authorities, as well as other matters that are beyond our control. If such approvals are not obtained or costs to meet governmental requirements or obligations are too high, the prospective buyers may have the ability to terminate their respective agreements prior to closing. As a result, there can be no assurances regarding the likelihood or timing of any one of these potential land transactions being completed or the final terms thereof, including the sales price.\nUpdate Regarding Development in our Area\nThe following provides an update regarding the developments ongoing and recently completed on land we have sold over the past few years:\nThe first phase of the 3,400-home age-restricted master-planned community, Latitude Margaritaville, being built by Minto Communities opened their first phase of approximately 400 homes for sale, and as of December 31, 2017 has contracts for more than half the available inventory – which have delivery dates beginning to occur as early as the second quarter of 2018; The 400,000 square-foot distribution facility for BBraun, built by VanTrust, is due to open operations in the first quarter of 2018; North American Development Group has broken ground and begun vertical development of its approximately 400,000 square-foot retail power center at Tomoka Town Center with tenants including Ross, Hobby Lobby, Dave & Busters, TJ Maxx, Academy Sports + Outdoors, Designer Shoe Warehouse, Ulta Beauty, and Burlington Coat Factory; Mosaic, the 1,000-home residential development by ICI Homes is well under way and the first homes are in construction; Site work on the location for a new Honda dealership has begun at the southern end of the auto mall, on the west side of Interstate 95; and The newest RaceTrac in Volusia County at the southeast corner of LPGA Boulevard and Williamson Boulevard opened in January.\nExcluding the approximately 6,025 acres under contract or subject to a term sheet, the Company’s remaining land holdings consist of approximately 2,075 acres of undeveloped land.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased to approximately $17.5 million, compared to approximately $27.6 million during the same period in 2016.
