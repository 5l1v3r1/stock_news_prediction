Benedict also noted that Target sales surged after the 2003 Bush tax cuts, implying another wave of improved same-store sales given the recent Trump tax reform.\n\"Target outlined plans at last year's investor meeting to roll out twelve new exclusive brands across the company's signature categories through 2018,\" Benedict said. \"With eight brands launched in 2017 and more already rolling out thus far in 2018, Target is well on its way to achieving this goal.\"\nTarget shares were up 2 percent Wednesday morning.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T15:04:16.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
