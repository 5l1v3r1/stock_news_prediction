UK-based Vodafone owns majority stakes in dozens of operators globally.\nRajeev Suri, Nokia's President and Chief Executive Officer, speaks during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 25, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman “The confidence about where that 5G uplift comes from is understanding the accelerated timelines operators now have,” Suri told Reuters in an interview ahead of the Mobile World Congress taking place in Barcelona this week.\nA year ago, operators were saying 5G rollouts would take off in earnest around the back end of 2019. Many cash-strapped phone service providers were then questioning whether there any were good business justifications for upgrading to 5G, he said.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “Now, it has accelerated by almost a year, which is good news for the sector, because then they’ll be the next wave of investment coming.” Europe, however, so far lacks the catalysts for rapid, large-scale 5G rollouts, he added.\n“Far and away, the U.S. and China activity will dwarf Europe ... (but) I think some 5G will be launched (in Europe) at some point in 2019,” he said. Nokia said last month that its stepped-up capital spending to win future 5G upgrade deals would weigh on profitability this year. It forecast an operating margin of 6-9 percent for 2018 but predicted a steady rebound to around 9-12 percent in 2020.\nNokia said it would collaborate with Facebook to deliver high-capacity wireless signals in dense urban areas where fibre optic cabling is not practical to deliver to each household. The technology can be strung from street lights.\nThe service relies on unlicensed, high-frequency 60 gigahertz airwaves which have been freed up in countries including United States, United Kingdom, Germany, China, South Korea, Japan, Facebook has previously said.\nNokia also said it agreed to acquire U.S. mesh networking software firm Umium to boost its wi-fi product offerings for both service providers and consumers to help them quickly diagnose and fix connection issues. No terms were disclosed.\nAdditional reporting by Mathieu Rosemain; Editing by Dale Hudson and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T15:26:26.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
