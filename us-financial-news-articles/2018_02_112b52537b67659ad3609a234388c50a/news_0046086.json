Instead, it’s now just up to doctors as to whether they choose to use it or not.\nAll eyes are now on the reformulated FluMist’s effectiveness, as experts have worried that poor effectiveness will turn people off flu vaccines. It’s already the case that most Americans don’t get a flu vaccine every year, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend they do.\nAccording to an NBC News report, some ACIP members are worried that an ineffective FluMist will hurt public perceptions, but others argue that the lack of a needle-free option turns kids off getting vaccinated.\nA recent influenza epidemic has been killing an estimated 4,000 people in the U.S. every week, with current vaccines offering a low success rate, although there are signs that the outbreak may be drawing to a close .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T09:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T14:58:30.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
