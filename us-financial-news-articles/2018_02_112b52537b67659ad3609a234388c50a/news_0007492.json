By 2035, agricultural and rural modernization should have “basically taken shape”, and by 2050, the country should have a strong agriculture sector and full realization of farmers’ wealth.\nChina aims to modernise its sprawling farm sector to make it more efficient and better able to supply changing tastes in its wealthier population.\nIt has been overhauling support for grain production, abandoning state stockpiling schemes and cutting support prices for major crops, such as wheat and rice, after years of bumper harvests saddled the government with overflowing reserves.\nIt is also trying to shift the focus to quality rather than quantity by promoting varieties in higher demand, such as high-gluten wheat, or corn used to make silage for dairy cows.\nReporting by Dominique Patton; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T12:15:39.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
