Their purchases at the quarterly refunding were equal to 22 percent of the supply offered. The purchases marked a contrast from the unremarkable presence of overseas investors at recent Treasury auctions, based on the Treasury data. Analysts had partly blamed lackluster foreign appetite for Treasuries on a weak dollar , which has made holding U.S. assets less attractive. Overseas investors, which include private investment funds and foreign central banks, bought $5.268 billion of the latest three-year supply, which was their largest share since September. That compared with the $3.316 billion they purchased in January, according to the Treasuryâ€™s auction allotment data. They purchased $7.135 billion of the latest 10-year supply, the most since May 2016 and compared with the $4.144 billion they purchased the previous month. Foreign investors bought $2.283 billion of 30-year bonds, which was the highest amount at an auction for this maturity in three years. They purchased $1.291 billion in 30-year bonds in January.
