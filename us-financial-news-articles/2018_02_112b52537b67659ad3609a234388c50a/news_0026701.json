The pipe is generally used to transport oil, natural gas, slurry and steam and for piling, the department said.\nThe U.S. investigations, part of the 94 cases President Donald Trump’s administration has opened since taking office, are aimed at protecting U.S. manufacturers in global markets, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.\nThe Commerce Department estimated that in 2016 imports of large-diameter welded pipe from Canada had a value of $66 million, China $139 million, India $26 million, Greece $70 million, Korea $150.3 million, and Turkey $116.1 million.\n“Dumping” is the practice of selling goods at below market price.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Ian Simpson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T18:07:13.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
