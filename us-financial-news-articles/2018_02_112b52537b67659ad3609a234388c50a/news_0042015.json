He claimed a record-extending 20th grand slam title by winning the Australian Open for a second successive year last month, becoming the oldest player to triumph in Melbourne since Ken Rosewall in 1972.\nIncredibly, since turning 35 -- an age still considered beyond the sell-by-date in the high-octane world of top-level tennis -- Federer has won three of the last five grand slam titles on offer playing arguably the best tennis of his career.\nThose craving eternal youth really should have a look at this man’s DNA.\nYet Federer, for all the unique magic that other players can only dream about, offers a far more pragmatic explanation for his ability to make a mockery of the aging process.\nWhen he was sidelined by a knee injury in 2016, forcing him to skip the French Open and snap a streak of 65 consecutive grand slam appearances, Federer took a career time-out.\nThough he played at Wimbledon that year, soldiering on to the semi-finals, he then shut down his season and came up with a formula designed to protect his knee and back and give him the chance to add several golden chapters to his career.\nQuality not quantity was the essence of it and in 2017 he returned to play 12 tournaments, winning seven of them, including the Australian Open, a record eighth Wimbledon and Masters 1000 titles at Indian Wells, Miami and Shanghai.\n“My philosophy is I play when I‘m ready. What I did last year and what Rafael (Nadal) is doing also is maybe a bit of a lighter schedule,” he said this week in the Dutch port city.\n”It shows to others by working or practicing a bit more... you become a different or better player.\n“I hope I take that fear away a little bit, that sometimes it’s OK to take time.”\nEasy to say for an athlete for whom the clock appears to be slowing down, rather than speeding up as it does for mere mortals as the years pass, but fellow 30 something Nadal, Murray and Djokovic will take heart from his words of wisdom.\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T01:35:05.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
