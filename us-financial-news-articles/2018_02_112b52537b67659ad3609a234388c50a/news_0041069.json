Each controls more ground than any other side in the conflict.\nReporting by Angus McDowall and Ellen Francis; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:33:27.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
