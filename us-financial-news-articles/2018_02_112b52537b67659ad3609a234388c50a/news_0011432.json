Gayoom is Yameen’s half-brother and ruled the country in the Indian Ocean for 30 years until 2008 but is now in the opposition. \nHis detention is further evidence of a bid by Yameen to strengthen his grip on power. \nThe president has defied a Supreme Court ruling ordering jailed opposition leaders to be freed, including Gayoom’s son Farish, an opposition lawmaker. \nYameen has ruled since 2013 but faces mounting pressure at home and from the United States and India to release former president Mohamed Nasheed from a 13-year jail sentence and free eight other opponents from prison. \n“The President has been compelled to declare a state of emergency due to the risk currently posed to national security,” said a statement from the president’s office. “Implementation of the Supreme Court ruling is – in its current form – incompatible with maintenance of public safety.” \nChina, the United States and India issued travel advisories for the Maldives, a country of 400,000 people best known as a beach paradise for tourists. \nThe tumult comes during the peak tourism season. Tourism brought in $2.7 billion (£1.9 billion) of revenue for the Maldives in 2016. \n“I just spoke to the Chief Justice and he told me that the gates of the Supreme Court is being stormed by the military. He is inside and nobody can go out or come in,” Husnu Al Suood, the president of Maldives Bar Association and a former Attorney general, told Reuters late on Monday. \n“The emergency means the Supreme Court activities are suspended and nobody is in charge of judiciary,” he said. \nShortly after, the spokesperson for the court confirmed that state security forces had broken into the court. \n“RESPECT RULE OF LAW” - U.S. \nThe U.S. White House National Security Council released a statement on Twitter saying, “The Maldivian government and military must respect the rule of law, freedom of expression, and democratic institutions. The world is watching.” \nOpposition legislator Eva Abdulla said the state of emergency shows Yameen’s desperation.

He has no democratic mandate to govern and must resign immediately,” she said in a statement. \nThe Maldives has experienced political unrest since Nasheed, the island’s first democratically-elected leader, was forced to quit amid a mutiny by police in 2012. \nThe following year, Yameen then defeated him in an election that Nasheed said was rigged. Nasheed was jailed on terrorism charges but was allowed to go to Britain for medical treatment in January 2016. \nHe has lived in exile since and is currently in Sri Lanka.

In the event of a dispute about the declaration, the Supreme Court is meant to rule on its validity. \nWith the court effectively suspended, it was unclear how that might happen. ELECTIONS IN OCTOBER \nIn its ruling last Thursday, the Supreme Court said it found that prosecutors and judges had been influenced “to conduct politically motivated investigations” into the allegations levelled at Nasheed, former vice president Ahmed Adeeb and the other opposition leaders.

Politics centres on the tiny but densely populated capital Male.
