Dewey of Allison Transmission. \"He has provided valuable insights that contributed to Allison's success, especially in our transition to a public company. We are grateful for his commitment to Allison and wish him all the best.\"\nRaborn said, \"I'm truly honored to have served on Allison's board of directors over the past decade alongside such a gifted group of executives. Over the course of my tenure, I'm especially proud of how Allison made the successful transition from a private equity-owned enterprise to a public company that effectively represents its shareholders.\"\nTom Rabaut, the board's lead director, said, \"Buzz has been a great asset to Allison due to his knowledge of finances and the defense industry. His leadership of the Audit Committee for the last 10 years has provided a great deal of stability as Allison transitioned to a public company.
