The United States is by far the largest market in North America. \nJanuary was the fourth consecutive month truck orders have passed the 30,000 mark. \n“Near-record levels can’t last for long, but orders could stay quite elevated throughout the spring,” Starks said.​ \nThe main truck makers in the U.S. market are Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ), Navistar International Corp ( NAV.N ), PACCAR Inc ( PCAR.O ) and Volvo AB ( VOLVb.ST ).
