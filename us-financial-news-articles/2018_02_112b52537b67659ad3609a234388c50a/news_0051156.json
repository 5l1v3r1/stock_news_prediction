That was two weeks of intense effort to get right,” he added.\nMcLaren face strong competition even in midfield while Mercedes have won the last four drivers’ and constructors’ championships, with Ferrari and Red Bull their closest competitors last year.\n“We are humble about the challenge ahead, but feel we’ve prepared well, have a solid package that we can build upon and exploit as the season progresses, and have two excellent drivers who will make the difference in races,” said racing director Eric Boullier.\nThe car was due to make its track debut at a filming day in Spain on Friday before testing starts in Barcelona on Monday. The first race is in Australia on March 25.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T11:14:12.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
