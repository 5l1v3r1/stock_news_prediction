In this role, Golderer will work closely with UWGPSNJ's regional Board of Directors and corporate and community partners to lead efforts around UWGPSNJ's singular cause— ending intergenerational poverty . Through a two-generation approach, UWGPSNJ is committed to achieving this cause through investing in the success of youth and the stability of individuals and families throughout the region.\nGolderer joins UWGPSNJ from Arch Street Presbyterian Church. He was also the founder of Broad Street Ministry, which enables cross-sector collaboration to lift people out of homelessness, and has become known for the inclusive service it extends to community members in need. At Broad Street Ministry, hundreds of individuals and families in need are able to join community meals and, through the ministry's partnerships, access resources such as case management, medical services, behavioral health support, benefits counseling, and legal support. He is also a co-founder of the Rooster Soup Company, the nation's first for-profit, crowd-funded social impact restaurant that creates jobs and returns revenue to Philadelphia's most impoverished citizens.\nUWGPNSJ's regional Board of Directors voted to appoint Golderer to the position. \"We are excited to have Bill as our next CEO. He brings a remarkable combination of passion for elevating the condition of our city and region, experience and innovation in the communities we serve, and credibility among existing and potential donors who want to invest in our mission. He will be an outstanding leader of our committed and talented staff, and he will work collaboratively with other community leaders in our region,\" said J. Gordon Cooney, Jr., chairman of UWGPSNJ's regional Board of Directors and leader of the global litigation practice at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP. \"We are grateful to interim President and CEO Mike DiCandilo and our Board for leading us through a pivotal and exciting time in our history. We are confident that Bill will do an outstanding job leading our United Way and driving our work to end intergenerational poverty in the region forward.\"\nUWGPSNJ's investments and partnerships with nonprofits throughout the region will tackle three specific goals by the year 2030: 90 percent of children will read on grade level by third grade; an additional 50,000 opportunity youth will be reconnected to school or work; and 300,000 more individuals and families will live above 200 percent of the federal poverty line .\nMarcus Allen, CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters Independence Region, member of UWGPSNJ's regional Board of Directors, and member of the Search Committee, said Golderer is the right leader for the organization as it channels its efforts to fight poverty. \"In Bill, United Way has found a mission-focused leader who truly understands the underlying issues that contribute to the experience of living in poverty, and who possesses a unique ability to bring people from all walks of life together in creative ways to make a positive difference for those in need.\"\n\"I took on this role because poverty looms as one of our greatest challenges – it traps our families and limits our entire region's potential,\" said Golderer. \"It's time to stop families from passing on poverty through generations and provide opportunities for our youth and families to thrive. Together, in partnership with the business community, the nonprofit sector, and our public officials, we can achieve this.\"\n\"Bill brings a dynamic skill set to the table, but what really stood out for the Search Committee was his alignment with our refined mission, his lifelong commitment to service, his track record of results in fighting poverty, and his vision for our future,\" said Mindy Holman, chairman of Holman Automotive, and a member of UWGPSNJ's regional Board of Directors who co-chaired the search. \"We are excited to work alongside him and our partners from around the region to help more children and youth achieve success and more individuals and families become financially stable.\"\nGolderer is a graduate of Southern Methodist University and Yale Divinity School, and he is an Ordained Minister of the Word and Sacrament in the Presbyterian Church, PC(USA). He and his wife Julie have two sons.\nAlong with Holman, UWGPSNJ's search was co-chaired by John Salveson, co-founder and principal of Salveson Stetson Group. Together they led UWGPSNJ's search committee and worked with Diversified Search to conduct a nationwide search, which involved more than 170 potential candidates.\nEach year, UWGPSNJ raises approximately $50 million to support the regional nonprofit sector, of which, approximately $28 million is directed to United Way's Impact Fund to end poverty in our communities.\nUnited Way of Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey, serving communities in Pennsylvania's Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia counties, and New Jersey's Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May and Cumberland counties, is part of a national network of more than 1,300 locally governed organizations that work to create lasting positive changes in communities and in people's lives. United Way fights for the health, education and financial stability of every person in every community. In Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey, United Way fights for youth success and family stability because we LIVE UNITED against intergenerational poverty.
