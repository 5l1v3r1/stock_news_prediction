Even before that, the best result a German national team had earned against the Swedes in the Olympics was a 1-1 tie in 1984 at Sarajevo. East Germany were also winless, with a 0-1 record.\nThe last time a German team won a medal at the Olympics was 1976 in Innsbruck, Austria, when they won bronze.\nGermany will take on Canada in the semi-finals.
