(NASDAQ:DERM), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions, today reported financial results for the quarter and 2017 and provided an update on its development programs.\n“Dermira made tremendous progress in 2017, and 2018 promises to be another exciting year, with the recent initiation of the Phase 2b lebrikizumab study in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, anticipated topline data from our two Phase 3 acne studies and the potential approval and launch of glycopyrronium tosylate,” said Tom Wiggans, chairman and chief executive officer of Dermira. “We are on the cusp of transforming Dermira into a commercial enterprise, and the progress we have made is a testament to the dedication of our employees, who share a singular goal to bring new medicines to those suffering from chronic, underserved skin conditions and the physicians who care for them.”\nOperational Highlights and Clinical Pipeline Update\nIn January 2018, Dermira announced the initiation of a Phase 2b dose-ranging study evaluating lebrikizumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2b study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program. Lebrikizumab is a novel, humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind to IL-13 with high affinity, specifically preventing formation of the IL-13 receptor/IL-4 receptor complex and subsequent signaling. IL-13 plays a central role in type 2 inflammation and is an important pathogenic mediator in atopic dermatitis. The study is expected to enroll approximately 275 patients. Topline results are expected in the first half of 2019.\nIn November 2017, Dermira announced that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) had accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. The FDA is expected to complete its substantive review of the NDA by June 30, 2018.\nIn November 2017, Dermira announced that Dermira and UCB Pharma S.A. would terminate their collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of CIMZIA (certolizumab pegol) in psoriasis, effective February 15, 2018.\nIn October 2017, Dermira announced the completion of patient enrollment in its CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 Phase 3 clinical trials. Both trials are designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olumacostat glasaretil in patients ages nine years and older with acne vulgaris. The company anticipates announcing topline data from the CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 studies in the first quarter of 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Dermira reported a net loss of $56.0 million compared with a net loss of $7.4 million for the same period in 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Dermira recognized $1.3 million in collaboration and license revenue, which was primarily related to a portion of the $25.0 million initial license payment received from Maruho Co., Ltd. pursuant to the exclusive license agreement entered into in September 2016 which granted Maruho the right to develop and commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in Japan. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Dermira earned and recognized $21.4 million in collaboration and license revenue related to the achievement of the final two development milestones pursuant to its prior agreement with UCB, as well as $1.1 million in collaboration and license revenue representing a portion of the $25.0 million initial license payment from Maruho.\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $55.0 million compared to $30.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nResearch and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $27.8 million compared to $20.9 million for the comparable prior-year period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in clinical trial activities related to the olumacostat glasaretil Phase 3 program, higher personnel-related expenses and growth in manufacturing activities for the glycopyrronium tosylate program.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $27.2 million compared to $9.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in external costs to build out the company’s infrastructure and to prepare for its first product launch and higher personnel-related expenses.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nFor the 2017, Dermira reported a net loss of $303.3 million compared with a net loss of $89.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nIn 2017, Dermira recognized total collaboration and license revenue of $4.5 million, which was primarily related to a portion of the $25.0 million initial license payment from Maruho. In 2016, Dermira recognized total collaboration and license revenue of $22.6 million, which included $21.4 million related to the company’s agreement with UCB and $1.2 million representing a portion of the $25.0 million initial license payment from Maruho.\nTotal operating expenses for 2017 were $304.9 million compared to $113.2 million for 2016.\nResearch and development expenses for 2017 were $104.4 million compared to $83.2 million for the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increases in clinical trial activities related to the olumacostat glasaretil Phase 3 program and personnel-related expenses, partially offset by decreases in costs related to the glycopyrronium tosylate and Cimzia programs.\nDermira recognized acquired in-process research and development expenses of $128.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 related to its licensing agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group (together Roche), pursuant to which Dermira obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retained certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab for interstitial lung diseases. These expenses reflected the initial $80.0 million payment made to Roche in October 2017 and the present value of the two additional payments totaling $55.0 million due to Roche in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2017 were $71.9 million, compared to $30.0 million for 2016. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in external costs to build out the company’s infrastructure and to prepare for its first product launch and higher personnel-related expenses.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\nAs of December 31, 2017, Dermira had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $551.0 million and 41.8 million common shares outstanding.\nKey Milestones and Expectations\nAnnounce topline results from the CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 Phase 3 pivotal trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of olumacostat glasaretil in patients with acne vulgaris in the first quarter of 2018.\nIssue 2018 financial guidance after the disclosure of the CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 topline results.\nHold the company’s inaugural analyst and investor day in the second quarter of 2018 to review the company’s commercial activities for glycopyrronium tosylate and its pipeline.\nLaunch the second phase of the hyperhidrosis disease state awareness campaign in the second quarter of 2018.\nIf approved by the FDA, launch glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis in the second half of 2018.\nAbout Dermira\nDermira is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions.
