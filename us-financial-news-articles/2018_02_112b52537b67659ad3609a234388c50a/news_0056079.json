Boko Haram violence has displaced a further 236,000 Cameroonians, the U.N. said.\nMueller commended host communities in Cameroon who often act as “the first humanitarians” in providing assistance.\n“I was also really impressed by the humanitarian response in the refugee camp in Minawao,” she said - a camp which is home to over 60,000 Nigerian refugees.\n“There’s some community life, there are schools, there are health services, and people are living in dignity to get the assistance and protection they need,” she said.\nMueller visited the CAR last week. This week she will go to Chad to meet more of those affected by Boko Haram’s attacks.\n“The purpose of my visit is to tell them ‘you’re not forgotten’,” she said.\nReporting by Inna Lazareva, Editing by Robert Carmichael.; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.
