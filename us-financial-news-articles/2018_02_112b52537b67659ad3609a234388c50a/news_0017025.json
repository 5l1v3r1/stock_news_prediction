The service is expected to start in Los Angeles in coming weeks, before it is rolled out more broadly as soon as this year.\nNeil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, said Amazon's entry into the delivery business would \"send shivers down the spines of the traditional delivery companies.\"\n\"The danger for the traditional delivery firms is twofold. Firstly, they are likely to lose business from Amazon; this will be slow at first but will accelerate as Amazon rolls out more of its own delivery services,\" Saunders wrote. \"Secondly, if Amazon starts offering delivery to businesses, it will likely do this at a reduced rate.\"\nSo not only would UPS and FedEx see diminished business from a massive client, they could soon be competing against it.\nNews that Amazon may kick off its own delivery service comes one day after the Seattle company announced two-hour food delivery for Prime members from Whole Foods, which the Seattle company acquired for nearly $14 billion.\nAmazon has been edging into the delivery business for some time. In August 2016, the company unveiled its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that were expected to make up its own air transportation network.\nShares of United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. dropped around 3 percent in premarket trading, but both had sold off more severely earlier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:29:31.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
