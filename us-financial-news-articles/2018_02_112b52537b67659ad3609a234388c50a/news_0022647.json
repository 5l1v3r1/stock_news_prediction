Another issue is extreme volatility, which also makes them less useful as currencies, he said. \nWhile Bitcoin is often criticized because it’s not backed by a physical commodity, that’s not an issue for Michael Lee, an economist in the New York Fed’s Research and Statistics Group, who says that neither is the dollar and most modern currencies. \n“It’s trust that the ‘worthless’ piece of paper is actually worth something to other people that makes it an acceptable medium of exchange,” Lee said. “As a result, the price of bitcoin fluctuates with news that vendors or firms accept or decline bitcoin as a mode of payment.” \nOne group that’s probably using Bitcoin are criminals as cryptocurrencies are ideal for circumventing legal or regulatory authorities, because they aren’t governed by any, said Lee. The Drug Enforcement Administration reports a sharp decline in bulk cash smuggling in 2016, which is the traditional payment method for drug shipments, and suggests that payments may have shifted toward cryptocurrencies, according to Lee. \nStill, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are trying to improve scalability and convenience “so perhaps in the future one of these cryptocurrencies could realistically compete with current payment methods,” Martin wrote. “But, fundamentally, we wonder whether a payment method designed to function where trust in institutions is completely absent can ever be as convenient as one where trust is required, but also already exists.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T22:02:22.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
