Dana’s cash balance at the end of 2017 amounted to $608 million, more than double the $302 million it had at the end of 2016. \nDana Gas is at the centre of a legal dispute with the holders of a $700 million sukuk, or Islamic bonds, that the company refused to redeem last year on the grounds that the notes were no longer sharia-compliant and therefore unlawful under UAE law. \nLegal proceedings in English and UAE courts are continuing. \nIn the latest development of the debt dispute, a London High Court judge found again for the creditors earlier this month when he rejected Dana’s attempt to overturn his previous decision that the purchase undertaking, part of the sukuk contract, was valid and enforceable.
