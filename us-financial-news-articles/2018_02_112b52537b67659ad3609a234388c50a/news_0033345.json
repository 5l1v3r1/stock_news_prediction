BP had previously indicated it expected to reach an FID on the project towards the end of this year.\nThe Greater Tortue Complex, which straddles the maritime boundaries of the two countries, is estimated to hold more than 25 trillion cubic feet of gas. The production is expected to be exported via a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility.\nSenegal’s President Macky Sall signed an inter-governmental cooperation accord on Friday with his counterpart in Mauritania, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, during a state visit.\n“This is an important milestone for this innovative gas project which reflects the strong, cooperative partnership between Mauritania and Senegal,” Bernard Looney, BP’s head of oil and gas production, known as upstream, said in a statement.\nBP shares were trading 2 percent higher and Kosmos London shares were up 2.6 percent at 0955 GMT, compared with a 1.7 percent increase in the broader energy sector.\nKosmos said the agreement provides for development of Tortue through cross-border unitization, with a 50-50 initial split of resources and revenues, and a mechanism for future equity redeterminations based on actual production and other technical data.\nEnergy companies are pushing further west from the waters off established African producers such as Angola, Nigeria and Gabon.\nHowever, in a region where maritime boundaries are often poorly established, the move into new, untapped territory carries the risk of inflaming tensions between neighbors.\nReporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru and Ron Bousso in London; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:35:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
