Net income for the fourth quarter was $108.2 million and earnings per share on a diluted basis were $0.73. Alliance Automotive Group (AAG), the Company's European acquisition which closed on November 2, 2017, contributed 6.8% to sales and $0.07 in earnings per diluted share during the fourth quarter.\nBefore the impact of AAG's operations as discussed above, as well as excluding fourth quarter transaction-related costs and the expense for transition tax and the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, adjusted net income was $165.5 million, or $1.12 per diluted share. Including the $0.07 contribution from AAG's operations, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.19 for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFourth quarter sales for the Automotive Group were up 16.7% including an approximate 1% comparable sales increase and a 4% total sales increase before the additional 13% sales contribution from AAG. Sales at Motion Industries, the Industrial Group, were up 7.4%, including a 5% comparable sales increase, and sales at EIS, the Electrical/Electronic Group, grew 8.9%, with comparable sales down 2%. Sales for S.P. Richards, the Business Products Group, were down 2.2% for the quarter in both total and comparable sales.\nPaul Donahue, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We were pleased to complete the fourth quarter with a 4.5% sales increase before the added benefit of the AAG acquisition. Additionally, the two month performance at AAG was in-line with our initial plan, and we remain excited for the growth prospects we see for this business across Europe. Overall, total sales for the fourth quarter included 2% organic growth, 8.5% from acquisitions and an approximate 1% foreign exchange benefit.\"\nMr. Donahue added, \"Importantly, our plans and initiatives to accelerate actions to improve our operating performance, which we emphasized following our third quarter results, had a positive impact on our fourth quarter. While we continue to focus on these efforts to drive further improvement, we are encouraged by our early progress.\"\nSales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $16.3 billion, a 6.3% increase compared to $15.3 billion for the same period in 2016. Net income for the twelve months was $617 million and earnings per share on a diluted basis were $4.18. AAG contributed 1.7% to sales and $0.07 in earnings per diluted share for the year.\nBefore the impact of AAG as discussed above, as well as transaction-related costs recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 and the tax expense resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted net income was $686 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $4.64. Including the $0.07 contribution from AAG's operations, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $4.71 for the year.\nMr. Donahue concluded, \"Reflecting on 2017, GPC's 90th year, we surpassed $16 billion in revenues, a new record for us. In addition, we better positioned the Company for sustained long-term growth, with significant investments in our existing businesses as well as new ones, both in North America and abroad. Our balance sheet is in excellent condition, our cash flows are strong and our plans are in place for the year ahead.\"\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company is establishing its full year 2018 sales guidance at up 12% to 13% and diluted earnings per share is expected to be $5.60 to $5.75, including the benefit of a full year of operations with AAG and approximately $80 to $90 million in lower income taxes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company currently expects a tax rate of approximately 26.0 to 27.0% in 2018.\nNon-GAAP Information\nThis release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). These items include adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operations. The Company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure following the financial statements below.\nConference Call\nGenuine Parts Company will hold a conference call today at 11:00 a.m. EST to discuss the results of the quarter and the future outlook.
