Paulo reported on Friday that conversations between Fibria and Suzano began three months ago, citing a source close to Suzano.\nSources close to the matter said a potential merger between Fibria and Suzano would have to take into account Fibria’s new production capacity following the opening of its second pulp unit in Três Lagoas, Mato Grosso do Sul State.\nThe new capacity would change Fibria’s valuation relative to Suzano, the sources added.\nOperation at the second Três Lagoas unit began in September and will add 1.95 million tonnes annually in production capacity, raising Fibria’s total annual capacity to 7.2 million tonnes.\nSuzano has production capacity of 3.6 million tonnes of pulp a year and 1.2 million tonnes in paper.\nOther two people close to the matter said neither company has hired financial advisors yet for the discussions.
