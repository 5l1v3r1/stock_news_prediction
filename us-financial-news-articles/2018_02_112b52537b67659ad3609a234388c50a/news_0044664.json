Its London shop was closed months before the group was bought by Bastagli.\nThe entrepreneur, who owns Italian brands that make leisure wear, aims to open “a couple” of European shops in the next years, ideally Milan, Paris and London. The aim is to extend its reach in the West and target “Millennials” -- young customers born between 1985 and 2000 -- who account for almost a third of the luxury market.\nProduction of clothes and accessories has been moved to Italy while that of homeware items remains in China.\nBastagli concedes that a big investment will have to be made on communication, particularly in Europe, where the brand is less well known, positioning it in a “high-end niche... but not necessarily too expensive.”\nThe creative helm of the Asian brand was handed to Massimiliano Giornetti, creative director at Florence-based luxury group Salvatore Ferragamo ( SFER.MI ) until March 2016.\nGiornetti told Reuters his first collection for Shanghai Tang, with Chinese-inspired details, quilted pieces, animal-print patterns and damasqued silks, was a “dream-like trip between two millenary cultures that are linked by the Silk Road.”\nGiornetti added that it was his intention to maintain the Chinese heritage but blend it with a contemporary look that would be appreciated by Western and Eastern customers alike.\nReporting by Giulia Segreti; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T18:30:53.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
