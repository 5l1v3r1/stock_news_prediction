Those charged included St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency known for its trolling on social media.\nSputnik had flagged in January that the Justice Department would require RIA Global to register under FARA.\nRIA Global said in its registration that it retains “independent editorial control” over the shows, newswires and web articles it produces and that it “respectfully disagrees that FARA should apply.”\nThe registration revealed an intention to promote to some extent the Kremlin’s view. A contract accompanying RIA’s registration includes a provision that essays focused on or involving Russia “must reflect Russia’s stance on the subject and present opinions of Russian experts.”\nRIA Global’s customer of record is Federal State Unitary Enterprise Rossiya Segodnya International Information Agency, the Russian state entity that owns Sputnik and was created by a decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013.\nReston Translator LLC, a Virgina-based radio broadcaster of Sputnik programming, registered as a foreign agent in November, as did T&R Productions, LLC (T&R), a Washington, D.C.-based firm that produces English-language programming for the RT Network, a TV broadcaster funded by the Russian government.\nRTTV America, Inc, which previously produced content for RT, registered under FARA in December.\nA January 2017 U.S. intelligence report concluded that Russia conducted an influence campaign of hacking and other measures aimed at swinging the 2016 presidential vote to Donald Trump. The report said Sputnik and RT are part of “Russia’s state-run propaganda machine” that contributed to that campaign.\nPutin, upset by the pressure on Russian media companies to register under FARA, has retaliated by signing a law that allows the Russian authorities to designate international media outlets as “foreign agents”.\nReporting by Nathan Layne in New York; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T05:25:04.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
