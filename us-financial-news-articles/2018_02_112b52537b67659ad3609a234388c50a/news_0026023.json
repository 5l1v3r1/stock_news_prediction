But instead of providing the hacking tools, the Russian produced unverified and possibly fabricated material involving Trump and others, including bank records, emails and purported Russian intelligence data, the paper cited the officials as saying.\nThe U.S. intelligence officials halted the deal out of concern it could entangle them in a Russian operation to create discord inside the U.S. government and potential fallout in Washington from the perception that they were trying to buy compromising material on Trump, the Times reported.\nThe Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment on the negotiations with the Russian seller, the Times said.\nThe NSA, which produced the bulk of the hacking tools that the Americans sought to recover, said only that “all N.S.A. employees have a lifetime obligation to protect classified information,” the Times reported.\nNSA officials were not available out of regular business hours for comment.\n Jonathan Landay; Reporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Leslie Adler and Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T04:38:03.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
