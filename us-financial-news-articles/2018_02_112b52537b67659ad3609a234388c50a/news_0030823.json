REUTERS/Christian Hartmann With the downhill run on the wind line on a shortened course, it was almost inevitable the gold medal would go to a technical skier and Austria’s Marcel Hirscher duly won his first Olympic title with a blistering slalom run.\nKjetil Jansrud, the other Norwegian medal contender who earlier suggested the conditions had not been fair to the speed specialists, was fourth fastest in the first stage but finished seventh overall after recording the 19th fastest slalom time.\nThe 32-year-old raced past reporters but a later Tweet made clear his feelings.\n“‘Eat up and look happy’ my parents told me when I was little and had a dinner I did not like. Very good lesson for the day. I gave everything I had, Norway.”\nSvindal, who won a medal of every color in Vancouver in 2010, will attempt to add the Olympic downhill title on Thursday to his impressive collection of trophies.\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:23:36.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
