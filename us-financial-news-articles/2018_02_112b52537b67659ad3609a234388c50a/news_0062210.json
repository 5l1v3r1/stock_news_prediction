[FRX/] The index has rebounded 1.7 percent since falling to a three-year low of 88.25 on Feb. 16.\nSome investors had expected Powell to be less hawkish, said Georgette Boele, commodity strategist at ABN AMRO in Amsterdam.\n“Once they realise that the policy’s going to continue like it has, then the dollar should recover and gold move lower. With the positioning that’s in place, we’ll get profit-taking in long euros and long gold.”\nBoele expects gold to slip under $1,300 an ounce by the end of the quarter.\n“Initial support for the metal holds around $1,325-$1,330, while resistance cuts in broadly between $1,340-$1,345,” MKS PAMP Group trader Sam Laughlin said in a note.\nHelping to support gold was data on Tuesday showing that net gold imports by China, the world’s top consumer of the metal, via main conduit Hong Kong surged 65.2 percent in January from the previous month.\nLast week, however, data showed gold imports by No. 2 consumer India fell 22 percent in January.\n”While we expect India’s gold demand to recover somewhat this year, we doubt that higher consumption in India and China\nwill be enough to offset lower investment demand elsewhere as a result of Fed tightening,” commodities economist Simona Gambarini at Capital Economics said in a note.\n“As such, we think that the price of gold will fall back from current levels.”\nSPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose 0.21 percent to 831.03 tonnes on Monday from 829.26 tonnes on Friday.\nAmong other precious metals, silver gave up 0.4 percent to $16.59 an ounce.\nPalladium lost 0.2 percent to $1,059.10 per ounce while platinum fell 0.7 percent to $992.60 per ounce.\nAdditional reporting by Eileen Soreng in Bengaluru; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T13:38:50.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
