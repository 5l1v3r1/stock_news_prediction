The Chinese public generally respects each Pope,” it said in an editorial in its Chinese and English-language editions.\n“Beijing and the Vatican will establish diplomatic relations sooner or later ... Pope Francis has a positive image with the Chinese public. It is expected he will push China-Vatican ties forward and solve related problems with his wisdom,” it said.\nThe newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily but, unlike its sister publication, does not speak for the party or the government.\nThe moves have not been without controversy in the church.\n“Our brothers in mainland China are not scared of losing all their fortunes, being thrown into jail or even bleeding. Their greatest pain is from being betrayed by their ‘family members,'” wrote Zen, who vowed to keep speaking out despite the Vatican’s rebukes.\nHe also said the Pope had, during a meeting with him three years ago, agreed that the official Catholic community run by the Chinese Communist Party objectively represents a schism.\nAnother source of friction with China is the Vatican’s maintenance of official ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a wayward province to be taken back by force if necessary.\n“The Taiwan question isn’t Beijing’s top concern in handling its relations with the Vatican as the mainland has many tools to pressure Taiwan,” it said.\nThe Vatican is Taiwan’s sole remaining European diplomatic ally. China has been ramping up the pressure on Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party won presidential elections in 2016.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard in Beijing and Venus Wu in Hong Kong; Editing by Paul Tait and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T03:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T03:39:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
