Potential international participants worried they would not be able to freely exchange the yuan because of a Chinese clampdown on capital outflows, and were concerned at Beijing’s heavy handed intervention in its commodity markets.\nJohn Browning, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based futures broker Bands Financial Ltd, which has been approved by the CSRC as an overseas intermediary for the INE, said international participation in the contract was crucial to ensure INE pricing truly reflects global trade flows.\n“The principal driver for the choice of this contract is to enable China to develop its own benchmark for oil pricing while increasing the trade of renminbi-denominated oil,” Browning said in a statement, using another name for the Chinese currency.\nBut while the contract will be Quote: d in yuan, “the exchange will accept USD as collateral for initial margin,” opening the way for participation by non-Chinese companies, he added.\nReporting by Xiaochong Zhang and Tom Daly; additional reporting by Ruby Lian; writing by Josephine Mason; editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T08:42:18.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
