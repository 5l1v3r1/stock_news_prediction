On Thursday it upgraded back to “buy”, saying higher volatility was here to stay.\n“Even though shares in Flow Traders have increased by nearly 50 percent over the past one-and-half weeks, we still expect further upside as the firm benefits from a more volatile environment in 2018,” the bank’s analysts said.\nReporting by Alasdair Pal and Julien Ponthus; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:46:51.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
