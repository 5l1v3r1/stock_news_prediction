It’s an unfortunate day to have a bad day.” The Utah native could only tip his hat to one-time slalom rival Austrian Marcel Hirscher, who picked up his second gold medal of the Games on Sunday. “You see him race after race being on point and that’s pretty phenomenal in a sport like this where not everybody is on point every single day and he always is able to bring out those best performances.” Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T09:54:09.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
