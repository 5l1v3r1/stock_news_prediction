It plans to sell the merged Otkritie and B&N banks in a stock market flotation, while turning PSB into a bank to serve the country’s defense sector.\nBAD BANK\nOtkritie Bank's Chief Executive Officer Mikhail Zadornov speaks during an interview with Reuters in Moscow, Russia February 21, 2018. Picture taken February 21, 2018. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov Zadornov said the central bank is still deciding whether to convert Rost bank, a subsidiary of B&N bank, or Trust Bank into a “bad bank” to take on bad loans from healthier banks.\nA decision should be made in March, Zadornov said. The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.\nAsked about Otkritie’s pension funds and Rosgosstrakh, Zadornov said 90 percent of toxic assets they held on their balance sheets had been offloaded as of early 2018.\n“A substantial part of these assets -- around 160 billion roubles or a quarter of all such assets -- were acquired by Otkritie and Trust at their face value,” Zadornov said.\nThe central bank would take into account the acquisition of toxic loans when it decides on how much to spend propping up the troubled banking group, he said.\nZadornov said that Otkritie’s 2018 business plan, approved by the supervisory board, envisages a 70 percent increase in retail lending, both in cash and mortgages, and more loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises.\nAt the same time, Otkritie expects 30 percent growth this year in deposits from companies and households and 125 billion rubles of loan repayments. The bank plans to make new loans of up to 160 billion roubles in 2018, Zadornov added.\nWriting by Andrey Ostroukh; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:14:26.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
