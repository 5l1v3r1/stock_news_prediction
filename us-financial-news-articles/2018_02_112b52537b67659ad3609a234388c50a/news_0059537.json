It also said it needed more time to wrap up the planned takeover of U.S. seeds giant Monsanto.\nIn the UK, ITV lost 7.5 percent. The British broadcaster reported a 5 percent drop in adjusted full-year earnings, reflecting a tough advertising environment.\nThe release of corporate results also triggered sharp moves upward, including Dialog Semiconductor, which jumped 7.9 percent.
