SoftBank is an investor in Didi, which raised $4 billion to fund its global push in December at a valuation of more than $50 billion. \nTech-based disruptors like Didi and Uber Technologies Inc, as well as traditional carmakers, are all looking to get ahead in the ride-hailing market, amid a global shift in the auto industry towards car sharing, autonomous driving and electric vehicles. \nDidi has rapidly expanded overseas in the past year since sealing its dominance in China with the purchase of Uber’s local unit in 2016, ending a cash-burning subsidy war that cost the U.S. firm roughly $2 billion. \nThe Chinese firm is, however, facing rising challenges at home, including a slower pace of growth, new rivals entering the market and drivers complaining that reduced subsidies mean they are working longer hours for the less pay. \nIn January Didi agreed to acquire control of Brazil’s 99, in a deal sources said valued 99 at over $1 billion and gave Didi a “significant majority” stake in the Brazilian firm.

Last month the Japanese firm became the largest shareholder in Uber. \nSoftBank founder Masayoshi Son said this week that given the shifts in the auto market, car-hailing platforms “may have bigger value than the automobile itself” in the future. \nRide-hailing firms see Japan as a potentially lucrative market and are pressing regulators to ease stringent rules. Uber’s new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi will meet regulators there on his first visit to Asia later this month. \nOn Thursday Toyota Motor Corp said it would take a stake in taxi-hailing service JapanTaxi, set up by Japan’s largest taxi firm, Nihon Kotsu, whose president, “prince of taxis” Ichiro Kawanabe, has vigorously opposed deregulation. \nDidi is also trying to diversify at home. This week it announced an electric car-sharing service with 12 automakers, including local partners of Ford Motor Co and the alliance between Renault SA, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. \nDidi and SoftBank’s trial service, which will leverage Didi’s “deep learning-based demand prediction and smart dispatch systems”, will initially roll out in cities including Osaka, Kyoto, Fukuoka and Tokyo.
