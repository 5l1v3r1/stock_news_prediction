I have no more ambition. I really would like to rest.” \nDuterte’s lower house allies last month voted to convene a constituent assembly to revise the charter, scrapping mid-term elections next year and extending the terms of all elected officials. \nThe constitution was introduced in 1987 after the ousting of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a bloodless “people’s power” revolution. \nPrevious moves to change it have failed, with civil society and religious groups thwarting what they see as threats to a system designed to prevent strongman rulers like Marcos from emerging. Fears that Duterte could become an autocrat are compounded by the admiration he has expressed for Marcos. \nExperts believe Duterte may succeed in changing the charter because of his public popularity and the super-majority he holds in Congress. \nReporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T13:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T14:11:30.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
