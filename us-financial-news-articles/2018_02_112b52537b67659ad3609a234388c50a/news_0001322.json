Milwaukee trimmed the lead to as little as 15, but the Timberwolves built the lead back up to 20 down the stretch.\nThe Timberwolves shot 54 percent from the field and held the Bucks to 38 percent shooting, with Milwaukee finishing just 21 percent (6 of 29) from 3-point range. Towns and Butler were both efficient from the field -- Towns hit 10 of 13 and Butler made 8 of 15.\nMilwaukee, which expects to get starting forward and former No. 2 pick Jabari Parker back Friday from a year absence caused by a torn ACL, lost starting point guard Malcolm Brogdon to a left quad strain in the second quarter.\nBrogdon’s backup, Matthew Dellavedova, finished with zero points in 25 minutes.\nMinnesota cruised to the win despite having just Towns and Butler in double figures. Wiggins finished with just seven points, but five Timberwolves had either eight or nine points, including Teague, who had nine points to go along with his eight assists.\nMilwaukee claimed the battle of the boards, 43-39, but the Timberwolves outdid the Bucks in assists, 27-19, and had seven blocks compared to one for Milwaukee.\nThe 19-point loss was the Bucks’ second big defeat in six games, following a 116-94 setback at Philadelphia on Jan. 20.\nThe Bucks host the New York Knicks on Friday. Minnesota hosts the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:41:07.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
