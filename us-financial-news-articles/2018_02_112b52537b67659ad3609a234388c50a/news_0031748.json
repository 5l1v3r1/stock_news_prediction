Also on Tuesday, Politico reported Pruitt flew first class on an American Airlines flight from Washington, D.C., to Boston. The EPA confirmed Politico's reporting to CNBC. \nThe renewed attention on Pruitt's travel is a potential concern for the EPA and the Trump administration, which has already seen one high-level deputy, former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, resign over criticism of his use of chartered flights. Pruitt is widely viewed as one of the most effective members of the administration, particularly in its bid to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations. \nBut his starring role in President Donald Trump 's deregulation agenda — and his history of climate change skepticism — have also made him one of the administration's most polarizing figures. show chapters 11:53 AM ET Fri, 10 March 2017 | 01:02 \nDue to security concerns, Pruitt has received a blanket waiver to travel first and business class, according to EPA spokesperson Jahan Wilcox. \nFederal rules require that government employees book the lowest-cost travel arrangements that meet their needs, fly U.S. carriers and take first-class flights only in certain cases. \nOn Tuesday, Pruitt told the New Hampshire Union Leader that security personnel made the decision that he fly first class. \n\"We live in a very toxic environment politically, particularly around issues of the environment,\" Pruitt said in an interview with the paper. He told the Union Leader there were some \"incidents\" during travel when he took his post early last year. \nThe EPA's Office of Inspector General opened 70 probes into threats against agency facilities and staff in fiscal 2017, up from 45 in 2016, Patrick Sullivan, the EPA's assistant inspector general for investigations, told the energy and environment website E&E News last month. \nThe EPA declined to comment when asked about why first-class travel is viewed as more secure, also saying members of Pruitt's security detail were behind the decision. A representative of Pruitt's security team could not immediately be reached for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T18:33:01.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
