There has been no major conflict between them since a month-long war in 2006.\nIn recent years, Israeli jets have repeatedly struck Hezbollah arms stores and convoys in neighboring Syria, where the group fights alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s army.\nReporting by Ellen Francis and Laila Bassam; Writing by Lisa Barrington; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T00:24:30.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
