This elite list of executives consists of channel leaders that have demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the channel by consistently promoting, defending, and executing outstanding partner programs.\nAll Channel Chief honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. However, only 50 of these executives were selected for the Most Influential list, which speaks to Stein’s prominent role in guiding and shaping the IT channel.\nThe executives on this annual list are part of an elite group drawn from the larger pool of Channel Chief honorees each year and represent the cream of the IT channel crop—leaders who drive the channel agenda and evangelize the importance of channel partnerships. This distinguished group is recognized for outstanding achievement in driving growth and revenue in their organization, as well as extraordinary leadership in the channel as a whole.\nIn his role, Stein recognized the opportunity to further enhance the way Kaspersky Lab North America supports its partners. He identified a need for providing more knowledge and value propositions to partners to share with their clients, which in turn has opened up new business opportunities for the company. He has worked closely with his team to implement and offer channel partners new structured trainings, built out a digital subscription channel framework to meet the industry changes within licensing, and focused on building relationships in the MSP community to establish a new segment of the company’s channel partner program.\n“I’m truly honored to not only be chosen as a CRN Channel Chief for the first time, but one of the 50 most influential people,” said Jason Stein, vice president of channel, Kaspersky Lab North America. “This year, we’ve embraced change in the channel community and we've focused our efforts on supporting our partners however they chose to consume our services. I will continue to lead my team to focus beyond traditional offerings to support our partners and their customers to provide not only the best comprehensive security solutions on the market, but the services and threat intelligence businesses need access to now and in the future.”\n“The executives on CRN’s 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,” said Robert Faletra, executive chairman of The Channel Company. “These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy, and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief’s impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.”\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list, including the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs, is featured online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs and will appear in the February 2018 issue of CRN.
