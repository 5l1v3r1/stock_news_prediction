The miner, whose shares have gained 16 percent in 2018 ahead of the announcement, reported a 45 percent increase in annual earnings and halved its net debt. \nElsewhere mid cap Moneysupermarket.com plummeted 13.7 percent after its guidance disappointed investors, with the firm pointing to costs around a new strategy. \nStocks trading ex-dividend also weighed, with Imperial Brands, Diageo and GlaxoSmithKline all falling. \nMore broadly, concerns over rising bond yields and inflation continued to plague equity markets, after the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest meeting showed more confidence in the need to keep raising interest rates. \nThis sent the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to a four-year high and the dollar also gained, which in turn hit greenback-denominated metals prices. \n\"Thanks to global growth, the expected impact of the U.S. tax bill and supportive financials markets, the Fed ... upped its growth expectations for the U.S.,\" Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said in a note. \n\"This would mean that a faster pace of rate rises could be on the cards.\" \nConsumer staples, which are considered by some to be proxies for bonds given their generous dividend income streams, took the most points off the FTSE, given that rising bond yields dents their appeal for some investors. \nThere were some bright spots on the FTSE though. Banking stock Barclays jumped more than 4 percent after reporting its annual results. \nAnalysts cheered Barclays restoring its full dividend, which demonstrates that the bank is confident in future earnings. \n\"Full-year dividend back to 6.5p next year and talk of buybacks should have investors purring with delight even though a series of one-off charges meant Barclays slid to a loss in 2017,\" Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said in a note. \nLikewise utility Centrica bounced 7.5 percent after its full year results, in which it raised its cost savings and announced that it would cut 4,000 jobs by 2020. \n(Reporting by Kit Rees and Danilo Masoni; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T14:17:15.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
