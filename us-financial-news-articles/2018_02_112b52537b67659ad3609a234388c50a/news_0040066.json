The Tigers lost senior forward Donte Grantham -- the team’s second-leading scorer and rebounder -- to a season-ending knee injury on Jan. 20, and starting point guard Shelton Mitchell missed Sunday’s game after suffering a concussion against Florida State on Wednesday.\nWendell Carter Jr. had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Duke while Trevon Duval scored 12 points and Gary Trent Jr. added 11.\nClemson was led by junior forward Elijah Thomas, who had his seventh double-double of the season with 13 points and 15 rebounds. Guard Marcquise Reed also scored 13 points while Aamir Simms and Mark Donnal added 10 apiece.\nNeither team led by more than six points in a first half that included seven ties. Allen scored 17 first-half points to help Duke take a 35-34 lead at the break.\nDonnal came off the bench to lead Clemson with 10 points in the first half. Senior guard Gabe DeVoe, who had made 25 of his last 40 shot attempts from 3-point range and was averaging 20.4 points over the Tigers’ last five games, was held scoreless until hitting a 3-pointer with 2:50 left in the game.\nThat shot pulled Clemson within two, 57-55, and a layup by David Skara on the Tigers’ next possession tied the game, 57-57, with 1:59 left.\nBut Duke outscored the Tigers 9-0 the rest of the way, including 7 of 7 from the free throw line, to seal the victory.\nClemson plays at Virginia Tech on Wednesday night while Duke plays host to Louisville.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:54:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
