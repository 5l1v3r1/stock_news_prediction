But much of that is thanks to a strong recovery in the global economy. Britain lagged its Group of Seven peers last year. \nConstruction comprises around 6 percent of British economic output. Official figures published last week showed the sector contracted in the fourth quarter of 2017 when it had its worst performance in more than five years. \nA PMI for Britain’s manufacturing sector - which accounts for about 10 percent of the economy - showed the weakest growth in seven months in January. \nA similar survey for the far larger services sector is due on Monday. \nFinance minister Philip Hammond announced measures in November that he hopes will improve Britain’s poor record of house-building, which has helped push up house prices sharply.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:13:20.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
