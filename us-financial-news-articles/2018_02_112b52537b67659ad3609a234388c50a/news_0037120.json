In 2016/17, by contrast, the armada of tankers was filled to the rims.\nWHERE FROM HERE? The main factors that could flip oil markets back into oversupply are an end to OPEC’s and Russia’s production restraint and soaring U.S. output.\nBut Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de-facto leader, says it is committed to withholding production.\n“If we have to err on over-balancing the market a little bit, so be it,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday.\nU.S. output, however, is rising fast and its exports are increasingly appearing in Asia.\nU.S. crude production hit a fresh record of 10.27 million barrels per day this month, more than top exporter Saudi Arabia pumps, and within reach of top producer Russia.\nThe International Energy Agency warned this week that supplies may start overtaking demand growth again later this year.\nReporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T09:56:50.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
