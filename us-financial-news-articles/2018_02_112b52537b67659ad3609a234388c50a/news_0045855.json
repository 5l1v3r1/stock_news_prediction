So we are acting on that and doing what we said we would.”\nThe CD business accounts for the bulk of the underperforming UK Logistics business which buys, warehouses, picks and delivers a range of products.\nIn the six-months to end December, Bidcorp spent 588.2 million rand on acquisitions which include a 70 percent stake in a Munich-based foodservice business and smaller bolt-on acquisitions in Australia, Spain, New Zealand and Turkey.\n“We do have a pipeline of future bolt on acquisitions and it’s likely that we could spend another half a billion (rand) plus on bolt on acquisitions in the next six months,” Berson said.\nBidcorp posted headline earnings per share (HEPS) from continuing operations of 640 cents for the six months to the end of December, compared with 589.3 cents a year earlier.\nBidcorp declared an interim cash dividend of 280 cents per share, a 12 percent increase from the prior period.\nIts share price was up 1.8 percent to 269 rand by 1120 GMT.
