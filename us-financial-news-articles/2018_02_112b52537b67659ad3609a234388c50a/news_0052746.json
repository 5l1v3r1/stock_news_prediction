Televisa has a large stake in Univision.\n\"TAO's deal with Amazon positions the company to become a key player in this ever-growing sector in entertainment throughout the region, while collaborating with a brand that propels content far and wide,\" Televisa said in a statement to Reuters.\nThe partnership is expected to help Amazon as it seeks to improve its position in Mexico and Latin America more broadly.
