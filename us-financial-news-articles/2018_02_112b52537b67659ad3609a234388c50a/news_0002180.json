It is in relatively less developed Ras Al Khaimah, located in the country’s north along the Oman border.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Most visitors to the UAE spend their time in Dubai, home to one of the world’s largest shopping centers, and an indoor ski slope. Ras Al Khaimah hopes the zipline, starting 1,680 meters above sea level on top of the Jebel Jais mountain, will be a drawcard for tourists.\nThe zipline can handle as many as 100,000 people a year, and though there are no age restrictions, riders must be at least 1.22 meters tall and no heavier than 150 kilograms.\nThe UAE’s latest record will be added to a mantle of achievements that includes the world’s tallest building, and artificial palm-shaped islands.\nWriting by Alexander Cornwell, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:26:54.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
