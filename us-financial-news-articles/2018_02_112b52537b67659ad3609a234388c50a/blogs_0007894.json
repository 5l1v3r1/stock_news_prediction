Mika Brzezinski takes Michael Wolff to school, Donald Trump unwittingly unearths an Aflac ad starring his wife, and Canada shows even greater commitment to gender parity. Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow this morning and predicts six more weeks of winter--stay warm this weekend! \nEVERYONE'S TALKING [bs_bullet_primary] On Mika and Nikki . Yesterday morning, Michael Wolff, author of Fire and Fury, the bestselling--though reportedly not entirely factual--book about the Trump White House appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe . \nOne of the book's claims is that the president is having an affair with someone in his administration. While Wolff did not publicly identify Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as the other participant in the alleged affair, she has still become the subject of incendiary rumors as a result of Wolff's statements, such as this one:\n\"She had become a particular focus of Trump's attention, and he of hers. ... The president had been spending a notable amount of private time with Haley on Air Force One, and was seen to be grooming her for a national political future.\"\nHaley was forced to address the rumors, telling Politico last week:\n\"I have literally been on Air Force One once and there were several people in the room when I was there. He says that I've been talking a lot with the president in the Oval about my political future. I've never talked once to the president about my future and I am never alone with him.\"\nMorning Joe panelist Susan Del Percio called Wolff out on his rumor-mongering on the show, and host Mika Brzezinski quickly followed up: \"Do you regret inferring anything [about Haley]?\"\n\"I did not go after her,\" Wolff responded , adding that he \"found it puzzling she would deny something she was not accused of.\"\n\"You might be having a fun time playing a little game, dancing around this, but you're slurring a woman. It's disgraceful,\" Brzezinski said. She then cut Wolff off entirely, proclaiming his time on the show, \"done.\"\nWhile Wolff's actions seem to be less sexist than they are sensationalist--the men in his book are not immune to the machinations of the rumor mill either--it's true that women historically have tended to bear \"the brunt of the reputational risk,\" as The Atlantic's Megan Garber puts it in this smart take .\nI don't disagree with this idea, but instead of bemoaning it, I'd like to take a moment and celebrate women like Mika Brzezinski and Susan Del Percio for shutting down behavior like Michael Wolff's on national television. And while we might not all have platforms quite so large, we do have plenty of opportunities--by the water cooler, at happy hours--to follow their lead.\nALSO IN THE HEADLINES [bs_bullet_primary] Well, that was fast. Since model and actress Kate Upton accused Guess? Inc. co-founder Paul Marciano of using his power in the industry to abuse women--\"He shouldn't be allowed to use his power in the industry to sexually and emotionally harass women #metoo\"--the company's stock fell 16%. Upton posted the accusation on social media Wednesday afternoon. The drop is as of Thursday afternoon. Marciano told gossip blog TMZ that he was shocked by Upton's accusations and can't figure out what she claims to have against him.

It might seem like public figures everywhere are talking about sexual harassment these days, but that's only half true. A Pew Research Center analysis of 44,792 Facebook posts published between Oct. 1 and Dec. 30, 2017 shows that while a large majority (72%) of women in Congress discussed the topic on social media, just 37% of their male counterparts did. The gap isn't just gender-based: 55% of Democrats and 34% of Republicans posted on the topic.

Canada's Senate passed a bill that alters the country's national anthem by replacing \"in all thy sons command\" with \"in all of us command\" as part of a push to strike gendered language from O Canada . Since 1980, when O Canada officially became the country's anthem, 12 bills have been introduced to strip the reference to \"sons.\" All attempts have failed until now.
