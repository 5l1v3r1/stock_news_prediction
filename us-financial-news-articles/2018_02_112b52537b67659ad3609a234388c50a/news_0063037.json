For instance, as a temporary solution to water shortages, it is paying about half a billion kwacha ($690,000) every month in energy costs to pump water to Blantyre from an area called Walkers Ferry.\nTapping water from Mulanje Mountain “will ensure that some water will be supplied using gravity, thereby lessening the energy costs”, she said.\nThe project, expected to be completed in April 2019, will ensure a stable supply of water to residents of both Blantyre and surrounding areas, she said.\n”This supply will be sustainable and will also improve the healthy living of residences as people will not be drinking unsafe water from unsafe sources,” she said.\nShe said the board had “consulted extensively” on the Mulanje Mountain project and “reached an agreement by signing a memorandum of understanding with Mulanje District Council, concerned citizens and traditional leaders within the project area to carry out the works”.\n“What everyone should know is that this is a very important project and will improve lives in surrounding districts (of Blantyre),” she said.\nBlantyre is not the only major Malawian city looking for new supplies of water. As droughts strengthen across southern Africa, in line with predictions about expected impacts of climate change, Malawi’s capital Lilongwe also is planning a project to pipe in water from Lake Malawi.\nJoseph Magoya, a local program officer at Water for People, a U.S.-based water charity, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that water has gradually been running short in Malawi’s cities as a result of growing urbanization.\nBlantyre currently has 730,000 people, about 70 percent of them living in informal homes where access to water has been growing more difficult, according to Water for People figures.\nIronically, more high-intensity rainfall and flooding – also a result of climate change – are adding to the city’s water shortage problems, he said, by washing out water systems and by leading to alternate floods and dry periods on rivers supplying water to the city.\nReporting by Charles Pensulo; editing by Laurie Goering :; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.
