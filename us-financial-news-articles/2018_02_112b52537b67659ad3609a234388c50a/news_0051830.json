Daejon Davis hit two free throws with 10 seconds left after being fouled by Bernstine, and Flynn missed a 3-pointer with three seconds left to ice the game for the Cardinal.\nComing off a career-high 33 points in a 94-78 win over Washington, Travis connected on 7 of 13 attempts and all six free throws, as the Cardinal won their third straight game and for the fifth time in seven games.\nStanford won the rebounding battle, 34-22, with Michael Humphrey and Davis each adding seven rebounds.

Washington State finished the game shooting 56.7 percent from the field, but the rebounding deficit and Stanfordâ€™s superb 18-for-20 shooting at the free throw line tipped the scales for the Cardinal.\nWashington State concludes its regular season next week with two home games against Oregon and Oregon State.\nStanford travels to Arizona and Arizona State next week to finish its conference slate.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:02:13.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
