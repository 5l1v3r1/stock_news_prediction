They took a decision and tried it... this time we were the lucky winners.” \nFor all the success Canada has had in the traditional format, winning the last three Olympic golds in the men’s competition and the women’s twice, the curling powerhouse has never captured a mixed doubles world title.

REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton \nOnly three times since the International Curling Federation introduced a mixed doubles world championship in 2008 have Canadians stood on the podium. \nSwitzerland, however, have won the world title six of 10 times it has been contested. \nMixed doubles, making its debut as an Olympic event in Pyeongchang, features a maximum eight ends as opposed to 10, and there is no shot-calling skip as in the four-player, single sex format of the sport. \nCanada led their semi-final from the start scoring two points in the first end before the Norwegians hit back with one point in each of the second and third. \nLawes, a member of Canada’s gold medal women’s team in Sochi and Morris, part of the men’s gold medal foursome at the 2010 Vancouver Games, quickly turned a nail-biter into a runaway victory scoring two in the fifth end and three in the seventh to clinch at least a silver. \n”It was a high pressure game but that’s what I live for, I love playing those games and the juices were flowing today,“ said Morris. ”Mixed doubles you have to play a full eight ends. \n”So I wasn’t sweating it that we were missing a few chances. \n“This is where we wanted to be, we know we are going to have a heck of battle in the final.” Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T16:11:49.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
