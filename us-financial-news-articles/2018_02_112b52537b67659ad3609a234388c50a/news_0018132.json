If we see cuts, it will be within the 0.5-1 percent range,” El-Swaify said.\nEgypt’s central bank has raised key interest rates by 700 basis points since November 2016 in an attempt to ease soaring inflation.\nDespite inflation easing, many Egyptians say they are still finding it hard to make ends meet.\n“I‘m 23 years old. I only make about 50 pounds ($2.84) a day. How am I supposed to pay rent or for my bills? Rent now is 700-800 Egyptian pounds,” Mohamed Sayed, a street vendor in the impoverished neighbourhood of Imbaba, said in January.\nBringing down inflation is key for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi who is running for a second term in a March election and is widely expected to win.\nThe IMF said in a report last month it expected inflation to fall to 12 percent by June and to single digits by 2019. It warned against a premature rate cut and urged the CBE to remain vigilant.
