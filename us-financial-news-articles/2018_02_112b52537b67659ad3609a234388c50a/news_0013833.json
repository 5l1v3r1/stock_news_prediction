U.S. stocks were last slightly lower in volatile trade.\n“I am not overly concerned about the market volatility. I think the fundamentals are quite strong,” Mnuchin told lawmakers during a scheduled hearing on Capitol Hill.\n“I think you’ve seen a normal market correction, although large,” he said, adding that the move did not raise any financial stability concerns. At its session low on Tuesday, the S&P 500 had declined 9.7 percent from its Jan. 26 record high.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testifies to the House Financial Services Committee on \"The Annual Report of the Financial Stability Oversight Council\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 6, 2018.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Last week Mnuchin called on the Republican-controlled Congress to lift the federal debt limit “as soon as possible” so the government could pay employee benefits and other obligations.\nIn a letter to congressional leaders last week, Mnuchin said the Treasury Department would continue to suspend payments into federal employee retiree, health and disability funds through Feb. 28.\nCongress must raise the debt ceiling to avoid a government default. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last Wednesday estimated that the U.S. Treasury would exhaust its borrowing options in the first half of March.\nReporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:58:01.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
