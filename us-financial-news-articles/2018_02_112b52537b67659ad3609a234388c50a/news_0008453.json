REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger CAS said a hearing was likely to be held on Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremony of the Games.\nEven if the athletes’ appeal was successful it was highly unlikely for any of them to compete in South Korea.\nCAS last week ruled there was “insufficient evidence” of anti-doping violations against 28 Russian athletes, who had also appealed their IOC sanctions, and cleared them to compete.\nThe IOC, however, has refused to invite them, noting there was evidence about the athletes that had not been available to the IOC commission that had investigated them.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T06:36:02.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
