I could never love another franchise, even one close to home as much as I love the Patriots.”\nMany others Pats fans said their dedication to the five-times Super Bowl winners would trump any UK-based team -- and added that they predicted a classic topsy-turvy encounter on Sunday, but with New England triumphing once more.\nRECORD VIEWERS With the game being played overnight in Britain, it allows a unique window for the sport to have no competition for viewers. Dozens of bars and restaurants in London have extended their opening hours significantly to host Super Bowl parties.\nKirkwood noted that the Super Bowl would be shown across four channels, three on satellite broadcaster Sky and the other on the terrestrial BBC.\nHe added that ratings for Sky’s coverage of NFL in particular had seen a 40 percent increase year-on-year in the latest figures.\n“Last year, we had about three and a half million people stay up and watch what was an unbelievable climax,” Kirkwood said, referring to the record number of viewers who saw the Patriots’ 34-28 overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons.\n“We’ll be lucky if we get half as good a game as last year.”\nBut the hard work will not end after Sunday’s clash, with UK-based Eagles fan club organizer Anthony Bullick believing that good communication is key to challenging the dominance of other team sports.\n“The toughest hurdle for the sport to challenge the likes of cricket and rugby in the UK is the perception that ‘there’s too many breaks in play’,” Bullick told Reuters before boarding a flight to Minneapolis, where he was predicting an Eagles win.\n“When you speak to fans who started following the sport in the last few years, most say as soon as they understood the rules, they didn’t really notice the breaks as they were discussing play calls and other in-game analysis.”\nBRITISH FRANCHISE Even with more than 100 universities having their own American Football teams, a national league to rival the NFL remains a long way off, hence a British franchise is seen as the most likely next step from hosting matches.\nAlthough not entirely NFL UK’s control, Kirkwood concedes that a team could come to fruition within the next 10 years.\n“We’ve got to a stage where that kind of concept becomes more compelling and much more doable,” he said.\n”Whether it happens in a particular timeframe I don’t know.\n”But then if you and I had spoken 10 years ago, I wouldn’t have necessarily predicted that we would have had 29 out of 32 teams playing in London, and us playing at the new Spurs stadium and having played more than 21 games at Wembley.\n“So I‘m not probably great at predicting what the future will look like, but I‘m saying the future for our sport looks particularly rosy.”\nReporting by Christian Radnedge; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T13:19:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
