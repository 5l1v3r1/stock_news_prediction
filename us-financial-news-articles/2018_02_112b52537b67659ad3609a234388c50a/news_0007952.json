The instant alternative requires a credit card payment, which apparently now incurs a total of 9% in fees when purchasing through Coinbase—an already-existing 4% credit card fee, plus the extra 5%. \nMasterCard said it had over the past few weeks “clarified” to exchanges’ banks which transaction or merchant category code they should be using for cryptocurrency purchases. “This provides a consistent view of such purchases for both merchants and issuers,” the company said. \nThe move comes after a slew of banks decided to ban their credit cards from being used to buy cryptocurrencies . Bank of America started the trend Friday, followed by J.P. Morgan , Citigroup , Capital One, Discover, and Lloyds Banking Group . \nThe fear there is that people might buy bitcoin and other virtual coins on credit, then be unable to pay the banks back due to depreciation in the value of the cryptocurrencies. \nA poll last month suggested that nearly one-fifth of all the people buying Bitcoin were doing so using their credit cards. \nAs for the notion that the big payment processors may fear cryptocurrencies as potential competitors, this could become an issue if and when cryptocurrencies recover from their current crash and settle into a less volatile pattern that encourages their use as virtual currency rather than as speculative assets. \nVolatility in the Bitcoin market also bumps up the number of transactions, which—given the Bitcoin network’s congested nature— increases transaction fees in unpredictable ways.
