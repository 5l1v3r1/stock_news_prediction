Bitcoin dropped below $8,000 Friday, a 60 percent tumble from its peak of $19,511 on Dec. 18. http://fortune.com/2018/02/02/bitcoin-bubble-nouriel-roubini/ \nIt isn’t just Bitcoin, Roubini added. There are more than 1,300 cryptocurrencies or initial coin offerings, and “most of them are even worse” than the largest digital token. These constitute a “a bubble to the power of two or three,” he said. \nBlockchain has “been around for 10 years, and the only application is cryptocurrencies, which is a scam,” the New York University economist added. \nIn another salvo aimed at crypto bulls, Bitcoin is an “environmental disaster,” he said, citing its soaring energy costs.
