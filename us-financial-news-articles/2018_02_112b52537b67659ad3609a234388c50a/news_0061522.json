St. Louis has fallen behind Dallas and Anaheim in the wild card standings for the Western Conference.\nRinne recorded his sixth shutout of the season and 49th of his 11-year NHL career.\nThe Predators opened the scoring at the 4:45 mark of the first period when Sissons, working on the power play, collected Kyle Turris’ feed on the rush and ripped a shot over the glove of St. Louis goalkeeper Jake Allen. Roman Josi was also credited with an assist on the play.\nNashville doubled its advantage about 10 minutes later as Kevin Fiala carried the puck in into the offensive zone on a two-on-one rush, waited patiently, and then fired a shot to the top shelf past Allen. Craig Smith garnered an assist on the goal.\nScott Hartnell added to the lead 1:20 into the second period as Calle Jarnkrok’s pass to the front of the crease deflected off Hartnell’s skate and into the net. The second assist on the goal went to Ryan Ellis.\nAustin Watson joined the Predators’ scoring party with 6:36 left in the second period, wristing a shot past Allen after a feed from Ryan Johansen for a 4-0 Nashville advantage.\nForward Nikita Soshnikov made his debut for the Blues after being traded from Toronto on Feb. 15 and waiting for his work visa.\nNext up for Nashville is a showdown for first place in Winnipeg on Tuesday while the Blues head to Minnesota to battle the Wild, also on Tuesday.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:53:22.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
