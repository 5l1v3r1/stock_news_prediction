The second phase of the plan will consist of a desalination unit at Oceana’s Laaiplek facility which will produce around 600,000 litres of water per day.\n“Phase one of the plan will see a 20 million rand desalination plant, capable of producing 800,000 litres of water per day, come online at their largest facility in St Helena Bay, by the end of March,” the Western Cape provincial government said in a statement.\nThe company is considering drilling boreholes on a nearby farm to augment its water supply to the St Helena Bay factory, about 170 kms north-west of Cape Town.\nAt the end of January dam levels in the Western Cape province fell to 24.5 percent from 25.3 percent the previous week, and from nearly 38 percent a year ago.
