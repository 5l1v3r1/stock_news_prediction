I hope not. I can’t think of any topic that is insurmountable.” \nMerkel, in office for 12 years, had said earlier on Sunday that her conservatives faced tough negotiations with the SPD, adding: “We did good groundwork yesterday but there are still important issues that need to be resolved.” PROGRESS Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Martin Schulz arrives for coalition talks at the Social Democratic Party (SPD) headquarters in Berlin, Germany, February 4, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt \nThe parties agreed on Sunday to invest more than 2 billion euros in social housing by 2021, to spend up to 12 billion euros on expanding broadband and to channel 33 billion euros to municipalities for various projects including childcare. \nThey have ticked off migration, energy and agriculture in recent days too but the most contentious issues -- labour rules and healthcare -- have yet to be resolved. Slideshow (10 Images) \nAs he arrived for talks, SPD leader Martin Schulz said the sides had edged closer on many issues but were still clashing over an SPD demand to abolish fixed-term employment contracts and its call to replace Germany’s dual public-private healthcare system with one insurance system for all. \nHealthcare and labour policy are crucial for the SPD as it tries to convince its 443,000 members -- many of whom oppose forming another awkward partnership with Merkel after their party suffered its worst postwar result in September’s election. \n“I think agreements are possible but they still haven’t been reached,” Schulz said. “Ultimately it’s necessary to take the time you need to create a stable foundation for a stable government.” \nThe conservatives have rejected SPD calls for sweeping reform of health insurance and talks are now expected to focus on improving public healthcare, such as by changing billing rules for doctors, who earn more by treating private patients. \nIn labour market policy, Merkel’s bloc does not want to ban fixed-term contracts, but has offered to prevent the repeated renewal of such contracts as a compromise. \nSPD negotiator Manuela Schwesig, aware of the need to push through distinctive SPD policies to sell the deal to the party at large, said: “We’ve promised our members that we’ll negotiate until the other side squeals, and we’ll do that.” additional reporting by Thorsten Severin; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Catherine Evans", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T11:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T11:35:02.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
