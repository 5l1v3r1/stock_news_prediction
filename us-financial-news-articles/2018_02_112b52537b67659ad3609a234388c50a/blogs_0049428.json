This was below analysts' forecasts of a margin of 14.5 percent and sales of 336 million euros, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nRovio saw rapid growth after the 2009 launch of the original \"Angry Birds\" game, in which players used slingshots to attack pigs who stole birds' eggs. But the company plunged to an operating loss and cut a third of its staff in 2015 due to tough competition and a shift to games available for free.\nShares in Rovio were down 39 percent to 6.07 euros by 0850 GMT. In November, the stock dropped by about 20 percent after Rovio's first interim report as a listed company.\n\"Competition in the mobile game industry is very tough and user acquisition has become more expensive for the companies,\" said Atte Riikola, analyst at Inderes Equity Research.\nHe said expectations may have been too high at the time of Rovio's listing, which valued it at $1 billion euros.\n\"The mobile game industry is very hot, it is believed that there's a lot of growth ahead. But the sector may be overinvesting at the moment,\" Riikola, does not have a rating for Rovio stock, said.\nRovio had bounced back in 2016 with a help of its 3D Angry Birds movie for which it is planning a sequel. Its game titles now include \"Angry Birds 2,\" \"Angry Birds Blast\", \"Angry Birds Friends\" and \"Battle Bay.\"\nFourth-quarter operating profit at Rovio more than doubled to 10.4 million euros on revenue up 17 percent to 73.9 million euros ($90.6 million). The company is due to publish its full interim results on March 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T13:05:24.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
