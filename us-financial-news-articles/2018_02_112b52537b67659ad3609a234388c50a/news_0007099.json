That compares with roughly $5,000 when South Crofty closed and a peak of $33,600 recorded in 2011. \nHe linked the price gains to broad-based economic recovery, meaning higher demand for tin, which has multiple industrial uses, including in electronics. \nThe mood towards mining in Britain has also shifted and the government is keen for international investment to shore up a revived industrial base as the country grapples with leaving the European Union. \n“We will list on AIM, hopefully this year,” Williams told Reuters on the sidelines of a mining industry conference in Cape Town. “AIM likes projects that are close to production.” \nThe Vancouver-based company already has a listing in Canada, known to favour small, adventurous mining stocks, often still at exploration stage. \nWilliams’ aim is to get production back in 2021, but first he needs to raise project financing of between $110 million and $120 million once a feasibility study is completed. \nThe mine has sufficient tin for at least eight years of mine life, Williams said, although industry sources say the high quality, super-giant lode could carry on producing for decades. \nIt also has a mineral rights agreement with British company Cornish Lithium, which means it will get royalties from any lithium extracted from brine springs in the area.
