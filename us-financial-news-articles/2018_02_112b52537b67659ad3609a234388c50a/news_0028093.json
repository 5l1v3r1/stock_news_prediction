Operating profits before one-offs were up by 6.2 percent. The firm also said it would pay a dividend of 1.47 euros ($1.80) per share, higher from a year ago.\nshow chapters Operating margin expansion trend continuing, says Heineken CFO      9 Hours Ago | 02:31 However, the Dutch brewer also said that in 2018 its operating margin would grow below the rate it guided for between 2014 and 2017 due to market volatility and last year's acquisition in Brazil.\nHeineken said it was aiming for an operating margin increase of 40 basis points per year between 2014 and 2017, but looking at 2018, it foresaw a margin increase of 25 basis points.\n\"Definitely a strong operating margin this year,\" Debroux said. Going into next year, Heineken sees underlying trends continuing in terms of operating margin expansion. But she added it was guiding lower \"due to (the) residual diluted effect of the major integration we did in Brazil at mid-year.\"\nThe stock was more than 2 percent lower in early European trade on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T10:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T11:43:35.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
