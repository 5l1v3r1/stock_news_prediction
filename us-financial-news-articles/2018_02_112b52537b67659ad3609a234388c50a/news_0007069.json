Martin Weinberg, McLellan’s lawyer, said the Massachusetts resident continues to contend he is innocent. \n“We fully believe there are compelling legal and factual bases to negate the viability of the new addition to an old indictment,” Weinberg said. \nBoston-based State Street said it regrets that clients were overcharged and is cooperating with prosecutors. \nMcLellan, who is scheduled to face trial in June, is one of three former State Street executives to face U.S. charges that they schemed to fleece the bank’s clients. \nEdward Pennings, a former senior managing director in State Street’s London office, and Richard Boomgaardt, who was head of the bank’s transition management desk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, pleaded guilty in 2017. \nThe case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the Boston-based bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging the six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. \nState Street in January 2017 agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations. \nProsecutors have alleged McLellan and others from 2010 to 2011 conspired to add the secret commissions for trades performed for six clients of the bank’s “transition management” business. \nThat unit helps institutional clients move their investments between asset managers or liquidate investment portfolios, prosecutors said. \nThe six clients included a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund and Irish and British government pension funds, according to court papers. \nThe case is U.S. v. McLellan, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 16-cr-10094.
