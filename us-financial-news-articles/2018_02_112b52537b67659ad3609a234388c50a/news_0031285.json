It is usually seen as a sign that the market is rebalancing and that prices are likely to head higher in future months.\n“Despite sharp sell-offs through financial markets, the backwardation in the Brent, WTI and Dubai curves is broadly unchanged over the last few weeks,” the analysts wrote.\n“The fact that the curve has stayed backwardated is a positive sign about the health of the physical market.”\nOil rose 2 percent on Monday, recovering some of last week’s steep losses as global equities steadied after their largest one-week slide in two years.\nReporting by Koustav Samanta and Swati Verma in Bengaluru; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T16:00:31.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
