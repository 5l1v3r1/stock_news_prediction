It was worth a trip,” said a middle-aged woman.\nThe showing was a welcome boost for Japan, with Tokyo hosting the Summer Games in 2020.\nHanyu took gold in the men’s singles competition, reasserting his dominance after being off the ice for weeks having injured his ankle in a training fall in November.\nPyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics Men's figure skating gold medallist Yuzuru Hanyu (R) and Women's speed skating gold medallist Nana Takagi attend a news conference with other medalists upon their return from the Pyeongchang Winter Games, in Tokyo, Japan, February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai “It was tough to win a second consecutive Olympics. The fact that I won with support of everyone made this gold medal even more valuable,” Hanyu told a joint news conference.\nThe win, ahead of compatriot Shoma Uno, who took silver, made the 23-year-old Hanyu the first man in 66 years to defend an Olympic title.\nSlideshow (7 Images) Speed skater Nana Takagi won gold in the women’s mass start for her second gold at Pyeongchang after an earlier win in the team pursuit.\nHer younger sister, Miho, who was part of that team, also won silver and bronze in the 1,500 and 1,000 meters speed skating, while Nao Kodaira took gold in the 500 meters.\n“I have put my life on skating since I missed Sochi Olympics four years ago. I wanted to share courage with everyone, so I‘m happy that I could do that even a little bit,” Miho said.\nAfter Kodaira’s win over South Korean defending champion Lee Sang Hwa, the Japanese athlete hugged and comforted her rival in a show of friendship and sportsmanship between athletes from the two countries, whose ties remain strained due to a shared past in which Japan colonized the Korean peninsula from 1910-1945.\n“I realized that we can spend a wonderful time in life if everyone extends a circle of friendship. These 17 days have become an unforgettable moment,” Kodaira said.\nReporting by Linda Sieg and Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T13:53:10.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
