But it offered to lift that suspension and drop the neutrality condition for the closing ceremony provided Russians observed a strict code of conduct during the Games.\nThe IOC is eager to normalise Russia’s Olympic status because it one of the world’s largest Olympic committees and a sporting powerhouse, but the IOC is made up of 100 equal members with competing agendas and the consensus could shift right up to the decision, which is expected at the weekend.\nIn an extremely rare move for Russia, curler Alexander Krushelnitsky, who tested positive for a banned drug, agreed this week to return his medal before a sanction had been issued.\nIn another sign of the unusually harmonious way in which the case has been handled, a hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport was cancelled at the request of all parties involved and the court speedily handed down a guilty verdict.\nThe IOC’s executive board will meet on Saturday to receive the report of a panel it had set up to assess Russia’s adherence to the Pyeongchang code of conduct. On Sunday, before the closing ceremony, a full IOC session will discuss the report.\nIn December, the IOC also fined Russia $15 million over the doping allegations. The fine is due to be paid by Sunday.\nAside from simply lifting or not lifting Russia’s suspension, the IOC could opt for a conditional reinstatement.\nIOC President Thomas Bach briefly met Igor Levitin, vice-president of the Russian Olympic Committee, on Wednesday night but did not discuss the closing ceremony, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said, describing it as a “four-minute” courtesy encounter.\nThe IOC’s Olympic Games executive director, Christophe Dubi, told Reuters last week, prior to the fresh doping case, that in his daily meetings with organisers and federations there had been no mention of Russian infringements of the code of conduct.\nNo Russian flags have been waved on the field of play, and athletes have avoided public criticism of the IOC’s rules on neutrality and its ban on many individual Russian athletes.\nSHARP CRITICISM The IOC’s handling of Russian doping has been sharply criticised, especially after it allowed Russia to compete at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics. Anti-doping agencies from the United States, Canada and Germany had wanted them banned.\nCalls for an outright ban at the Pyeongchang Games grew louder in recent months after the IOC stripped several Russian medals and banned dozens of athletes from the Games for life for doping at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.\nInstead, the IOC invited 169 carefully selected Russian athletes with no doping history to compete in South Korea. As neutrals, they are unable to use any national symbols or have their anthem played at medal presentations. They also underwent increased drug testing at Pyeongchang, the IOC said.\n“Having a Russian athlete test positive is not a good thing. In this particular situation where they were under a microscope it raises questions,” American Angela Ruggiero, head of the IOC’s athletes commission, said of the curler’s doping case.\nWithin the IOC, only one of its members, Britain’s Adam Pengilly, voted against decisions to admit Russia to the Rio Games and allow them to compete as neutrals at Pyeongchang.\nBut Pengilly left the Games last week after he was involved in an altercation with a security guard at the IOC hotel and will not be able to vote in the decision on Russia’s status.\nRussia, once a winter sports powerhouse, have won only a trickle of medals and none of them gold until Thursday morning, and are in 20th place in the medals standings, behind countries such as Poland, Ukraine and even Britain.
