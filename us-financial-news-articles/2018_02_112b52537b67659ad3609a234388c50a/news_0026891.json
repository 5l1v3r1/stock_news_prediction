So I was able to take other competitors’ sleds down the tracks and see how it felt.” \nThe confidence that had been quietly accumulating exploded on Saturday, when Mazdzen came within a whisker of the medal positions after two solid runs in the preliminaries.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann \nBut it was his blazing third run that set the platform to a breakthrough silver in his third Games, beating the track record that Germany’s defending double champion Felix Loch had set only moments before. WILD CELEBRATIONS \nIt lifted Mazdzer to second in the standings, while wiping the smile off Loch’s face as he stood in the leaders’ booth. \nA small mistake on his last run allowed Gleirscher into the gold medal position but Mazdzer’s medal was guaranteed, triggering wild celebrations from an entourage of friends and family at the finish-line terrace.

We had a huge contingent here from the U.S. and the best part about them is they’re here for you no matter what,” said Mazdzer. \n“In between runs, I was just hanging out with them. It was so motivating.” \nHis triumph had echoes of team mate Erin Hamlin’s breakthrough four years ago in Sochi, when she became America’s first individual Olympic luge medallist despite achieving little in the World Cup events prior to the Games. \nThe light in the cave is now blinding for Mazdzer who will be able to continue his 16-year love affair with luge, for all its frustrations. \n“But it’s tough because you give your entire life for luge and when you don’t do well -- if you’re not at the top you get nothing,” he added. \n”Now I‘m up there. Oh my God, honestly it came down to, I need to do well at the Olympics to keep going. \n“And now I can keep going.” Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:09:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
