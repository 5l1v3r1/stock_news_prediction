Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, as well as the lieutenant governors of New York and Washington states, have told the Atlanta-based carrier that it can move its headquarters to their states if Delta no longer feels welcome in Georgia.\nOn Monday, Georgia Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, who is running for governor, said on Twitter that he would “kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with [the] @NRA.”\nI will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA . Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.\n— Casey Cagle (@CaseyCagle) February 26, 2018 \n\nVirginia, New York and Washington officials all tweeted at Delta with a lifeline.\n“Hey @delta--Virginia is for lovers and airline hubs. You’re welcome here any time,” wrote Northam said Tuesday morning.\nHey @delta --Virginia is for lovers and airline hubs. You're welcome here any time. https://t.co/BxxnOhEpt6 \n— Ralph Northam (@GovernorVA) February 27, 2018 \n\n“.@Delta, if Georgia politicians disagree with your stand against gun violence, we invite you to move your headquarters to New York,” Cuomo added Tuesday afternoon.\n. @Delta , if Georgia politicians disagree with your stand against gun violence, we invite you to move your headquarters to New York. https://t.co/BHvyPECWSe \n— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) February 27, 2018 \n\n“.@Delta, as one of your most frequent flyers, know that the NY LG admires your principled stance,” New York Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul said Monday afternoon. “Let's continue our great relationship. NY is open for business & [loves] Delta - move HQ to where you're appreciated?” \n. @Delta , as one of your most frequent flyers, know that the NY LG admires your principled stance.

We will be requesting that the NRA remove our information from their website.\n— Delta (@Delta) February 24, 2018 \n\nThe company also professed its neutrality in a statement Saturday: “Out of respect for our customers and employees on both sides, Delta has taken this action to refrain from entering this debate and focus on its business. Delta continues to support the 2nd Amendment.”\nDelta Air Lines is not the only corporation to break ties with the National Rifle Association following the Florida shooting. Competing carrier United, as well as major businesses like MetLife and Enterprise Rent-A-Car, have ended discount programs for NRA members.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T18:55:19.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
