Derrick Favors chipped in 19 points and seven rebounds.\nKyle Anderson scored 16 points while Pau Gasol scored 15 points and collected 15 rebounds for his 12th double-double to lead the Spurs. San Antonio (35-23) lost to Utah for the third time this season.\nThe Spurs played without leading scorer and rebounder LaMarcus Aldridge, who sat out because of a sore right knee.\nThe first quarter belonged to Ingles. He scored 10 of Utah’s first 15 points, punctuated by a dunk off of a steal that put the Jazz ahead 15-10. That turned out to be the biggest lead for either team until late in the second quarter.\nSan Antonio took a four-point edge midway through the second quarter. The Spurs went up 38-34 behind an 8-0 run fueled by a pair of baskets apiece from Bryn Forbes and Murray.\nUtah quickly answered with a 20-4 run to take a double-digit lead before halftime. Jae Crowder fueled the spurt with back-to-back baskets that put the Jazz back in front again. Mitchell and Ingles scored baskets on five consecutive possessions -- highlighted by back-to-back driving layups from each player -- to finish off the spurt and give Utah a 54-42 lead.\nSan Antonio rallied in the third quarter. The Spurs went ahead on an 11-1 run and took a 66-61 lead on a 3-pointer from Davis Bertans.\nUtah struggled to answer with another rally after converting just 4 of 22 field-goal attempts in the third quarter. San Antonio took advantage and built up an 83-70 lead early in the fourth quarter on a pull-up jumper from Forbes.\nThe Jazz chipped away at the deficit. Ingles and Mitchell buried back-to-back 3-pointers to tie it at 87.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:37:19.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
