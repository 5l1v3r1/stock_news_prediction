The astronaut told Super Express: “I will not comment on stupid ideas.”\nThe government press office did not immediately reply to Reuters questions.\nReporting by Marcin Goclowski; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:27:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
