North Korea bombing, please.”\nThe North Korean leader’s younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, will be in the audience on Friday night, the first member of the country’s ruling family to visit the South. She and the North’s ceremonial head of state will be on hand to watch teams from North and South march behind a unified flag.\nReporting by Jane Chung; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T10:05:53.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
