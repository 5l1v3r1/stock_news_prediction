Since Sunday’s election, the party now has 14 seats.\nReporting by Enrique Andres Pretel; Editing by Sandra Maler and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T04:11:12.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
