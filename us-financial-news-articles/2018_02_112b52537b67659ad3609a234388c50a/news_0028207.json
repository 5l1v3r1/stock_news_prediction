Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports \nThe victory was a remarkable comeback by Potter, who incurred a fractured right ankle in a “freak accident” in 2014 when he slipped on a path. \n“I had the first surgery in 2014 and then I had another surgery in 2015 to have all the screws and plates removed,” he said.

To come back from that it’s just unbelievable right now. \n“It still gets sore at the end of the day, but I can swing the golf club and can I get around 18 holes, so I feel good about that.” \nWhile Potter celebrated victory, joint runner-up Mickelson’s winless drought since the 2013 British Open continued, though he drew positives from three birdies in the final five holes for a 67. \n“I gave it a shot on the back nine,” he said. \n“It was nice to feel the nerves and make a couple of birdies coming down the stretch. Right now I‘m hitting it as well as I have in a long time.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Adelaide, South Australia; Editing by Toby Davis/Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T01:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T02:21:22.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
