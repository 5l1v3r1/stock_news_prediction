Business investment growth also remains relatively weak despite very favorable conditions, as heightened uncertainly is weighing on business investment,” it said.\nReporting By Jan Strupczewski, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T01:40:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
