Ardern announced her pregnancy to much fanfare from labor and women’s rights groups on Jan. 19.\nThe center-right National Party still captured the most support, mostly unchanged at 44.5 percent.\nLabour’s rise was largely on the back of plummeting results for its coalition partner, the nationalist New Zealand First Party, whose support almost halved to 3.8 percent.\nLabour was cast into government in October after striking a coalition deal with New Zealand First in the country’s German-style proportionate voting system.\nThe arrangement also relied on backing from the progressive Green Party, whose support slipped 0.3 points in the latest poll to 6 percent.\nThe center-left coalition government, which brought an end to almost 10 years of National’s center right rule, planned to pour money into social services and housing and strike a more protectionist stance by tightening up foreign investment rules.\nReporting by Charlotte Greenfield; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T01:07:06.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
