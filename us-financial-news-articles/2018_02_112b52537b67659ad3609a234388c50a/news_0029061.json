Under the NCIB, the Bank may repurchase shares through the facilities of the TSX and alternative Canadian trading systems or by such other means as may be permitted by a securities regulatory authority, including private agreements or share repurchase programs under exemption orders issued by securities regulatory authorities (Exemption Orders). Any purchases made under an Exemption Order will generally be at a discount to the prevailing market price. All repurchased shares will be cancelled.\nThe timing and amount of purchases under the NCIB are subject to regulatory approvals and to management discretion based on factors such as market conditions. To date, the Bank has completed the purchase of 8 million common shares for cancellation since the commencement of its current NCIB.\nSOURCE BMO Financial Group", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T02:01:59.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
