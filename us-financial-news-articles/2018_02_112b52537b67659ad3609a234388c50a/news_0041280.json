The three agencies share federal-level responsibility for election security precautions.\nA U.S. official familiar with the planned briefings said state officials would be given classified examples of recent attempted and successful interference by hostile parties in U.S. election systems, as well as advice on possible security enhancements.\nDirector of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned this week that Russia and other foreign entities are likely to attack U.S. and European elections this year and beyond, adding that Moscow believes such efforts have recently undermined U.S. democracy.\n“Frankly, the United States is under attack,” Coats told a U.S. Senate committee.\nHe said he had seen evidence that Russia is targeting mid-term congressional elections in November, when Republican majorities in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are at stake, as well as state government races.\nPresident Donald Trump has previously questioned spy agency assessments that Russia tried to influence the 2016 presidential election to help him beat his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\nThe official familiar with the meetings this weekend said they would also include discussions of foreign attempts to use social and mainstream media to influence American voters.\n“We’re trying to arm them with information which they can use to take action,” the official said.\nReporting by Mark Hosenball and Dustin Volz; Editing by Alistair Bell and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T00:42:19.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
