Eventually the state could reduce its stake to 25 percent, from 51 percent, CEZ said.\nCEZ estimated the transformation would increase the group’s value by 65 billion crowns ($3.2 billion), eliminating a share “discount” associated with uncertainties over the future nuclear construction.\nThe split would also eliminate the risk of lawsuits from CEZ minority shareholders, it said.\nNew Prime Minister Andrej Babis, though, has opposed a CEZ split, saying it would cost taxpayers, consumers and companies, but has not commented on the latest presentation. Lawmakers are expected to give a recommendation on how to proceed by the end of March.\nCEZ, which has a market capitalisation of $13.7 billion, has said any nuclear expansion would need direct or indirect state participation. Other options include providing guarantees to a CEZ unit to build the new blocks or having the state take over the project.\nDetails from the presentation were first reported in Czech media by newspaper Hospodarske Noviny and magazine Respekt.\nCEZ cancelled a tender for the multi-billion expansion of one of its two nuclear power stations in 2014 after failing to get price guarantees from the government.\n$1 = 20.2730 Czech crowns Reporting by Jan Lopatka and Jason Hovet; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:35:10.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
