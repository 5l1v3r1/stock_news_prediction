At this level, they don’t provide competition for the equity market. We still have a long way to go before they’re competitive to the equity market. This is something going to be watched very closely by investors in all asset classes,” Krosby said. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 172.25 points, or 0.69 percent, to 25,085.02, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 6.92 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,702.06 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 18.95 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,096.93.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 2.02 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.40 percent. \nEmerging market stocks .MSCIEF lost 0.32 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.44 percent lower. \nIn the energy market, oil prices fell 2 percent. U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 2.5 percent to settle at $61.79 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 dropped 2 percent to $65.51. U.S. data showed an unexpected build in refined products, fanning fears of oversupply headed into the slow-demand season. \n(Graphic: Global market selloff in February, reut.rs/2BahEeN ) \nLike many others, BlackRock analysts described the rout as a buying opportunity, seeing the leveraged products moves as essentially driven by jitters over recent equity gains on one hand, and the possibility of higher interest rates on the other. \nStrategists also point out that the improving global economic outlook is a positive for stocks overall. DOLLAR UP, GOLD SLIPS \nThe U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies amid the gains on Wall Street. \nThe dollar index .DXY rose 0.76 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.82 percent to $1.2275. \nGold slipped as the U.S. dollar strengthened. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.9 percent at $1,313.67 per ounce.
