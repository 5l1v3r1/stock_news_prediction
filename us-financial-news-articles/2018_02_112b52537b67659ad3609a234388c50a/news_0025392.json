( on.ft.com/2BREJUO ) \nEuropean Commission officials rejected the City of London’s proposal to strike a post-Brexit free-trade deal on financial services, a major blow to Britain’s hopes of keeping full access to EU markets for one of the world’s top two financial centers. \nBritain is currently home to the world’s largest number of banks and hosts the largest commercial insurance market. About 6 trillion euros ($7.35 trillion), or 37 percent, of Europe’s financial assets are managed in the UK capital, almost twice the amount of its nearest rival, Paris. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) said earlier this month that it could move more than 4,000 jobs out of Britain if Brexit talks result in a divergence of regulations and trade agreements between Britain and the European Union. \nIn the short term the bank will move between 500 and 1,000 jobs after Britain’s formal exit from the EU, scheduled for March 29, 2019. \nAbout 10,000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years if it is denied access to Europe’s single market, a Reuters survey in September found. \n($1 = 0.8167 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T23:33:27.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
