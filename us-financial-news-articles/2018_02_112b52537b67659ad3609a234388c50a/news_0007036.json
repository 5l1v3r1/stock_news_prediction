Bilateral trade was $4.4 billion in 2015, according to latest data.\nThe high level of Chinese investment is evident from the skyscrapers that have shot up in the capital Phnom Penh, and the hotels and casinos that are being built to serve Chinese buyers in the resort city of Sihanoukville.\nOfficials at the National Bank of Cambodia could not be reached for comment.\nReporting by Prak Chan Thul; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:04:17.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
