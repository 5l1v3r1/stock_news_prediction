Davidson & Co’s analyst Tom Forte.\nEBay is adapting to the likes of online crafts retailer Etsy Inc’s ( ETSY.O ) model by taking control of the payment process on its marketplaces from PayPal, Forte added.\n“But to be clear, there will always be a place for PayPal on eBay — it just will be less prominent,” said Forte.\nSome analysts said they were surprised by eBay’s estimate of the benefits from taking payments intermediary service in-house. The company said it would add $500 million to operating profit after the PayPal deal expires in mid-2020.\nTransactions through eBay account for roughly 13 percent of total payments processed by PayPal, whose shares sank more than 8 percent in response on Thursday.\nPayPal might be able to fill the hole created by eBay thanks to its strong growth rate, although that is not certain at this point, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said.\nEBay’s backing for Adyen could turn the smaller payment processor into a “much more robust competitor” to PayPal over time, Palmer added.\nOther analysts, however, said PayPal, which has been eBay’s preferred provider for the past 15 years and will remain a payment page option on the platform for the foreseeable future, had the scale to ride out the blow.\n“Over time, given the recent agreements with Visa ( V.N ) and MasterCard ( MA.N ), PayPal will be able to scale and expand margins,” Wedbush Securities analysts said in a client note.\nAt least 13 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on eBay’s shares.\nEBay’s stock climbed 15 percent on Thursday, recording its biggest one-day gain since 1998, the year of its market debut.\nReporting by Muvija M and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:39:02.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
