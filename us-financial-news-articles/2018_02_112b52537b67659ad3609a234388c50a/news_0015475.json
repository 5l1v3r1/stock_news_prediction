It will be a different game than we played before. It is always special, when you play the derby. \n“I think Arsenal will be tough to play because they have good quality, talented players and are one of the best teams in the Premier League.” \nPochettino was pleased with the return of defender Toby Alderweireld, who played 90 minutes in Tottenham’s 2-0 FA Cup replay win over Newport County on Wednesday. \nIt was the 28-year-old Belgian’s first appearance since picking up a hamstring injury in November and the manager confirmed a late decision will be made on whether the centre back will start against Arsenal. \nSpurs, currently fifth in the league, have an opportunity to open up a seven-point advantage over sixth-placed Arsenal.
