Pendlebury and Conyers retained a share in Harmonic’s revenue, according to Smith. \nThe firm has been searching for a strategic partner for the past two years but the weakening performance and falling revenue from investor redemptions and low-fee products offered made it harder for a partner to come on board, said Smith.
