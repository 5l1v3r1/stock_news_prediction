Exxon reports earnings on Friday. \nShell’s shares were however 1.5 percent lower at 1200 GMT, compared with a 0.16 decline in the FTSE 100 index, as its fourth quarter cash flow was lower than anticipated by analysts. \nThe cash growth was driven by a sharp recovery in oil prices in the second half of 2017, as the benchmark Brent price reached a three-year high of $70 a barrel. \nBut it was also due to a sector-wide drive to reduce costs to adapt to a world of “lower for longer” oil prices, as Shell and others cut thousands of jobs, lowered spending and brought in new technology to simplify field designs and operations. \nAs a result Shell can now generate more cash than it did with oil prices above $100 a barrel and in November it raised its cash flow outlook from $25 billion to $30 billion by 2020, assuming an oil price of $60 a barrel. \nFree cash flow -- cash available to pay for dividends and share buybacks -- rose to $27.6 billion from a negative $10.3 billion in 2016.

The BG deal seems to be paying off and the rationale for it is being proved right,” Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at Allianz Global Investors, said. \nShell in the fourth quarter scrapped its scrip dividend, in a sign that it is confident of being able to maintain around $15 billion in annual dividend payments without resorting to scrip or borrowing after a three-year oil price downturn. \nVan Beurden said the company planned to start a three-year, $25 billion share buyback programme “as soon as possible” as the company focuses first on reducing debt. ASSET SALES \nShell’s oil and gas production in the fourth quarter rose from the previous quarter to 3.756 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) from 3.657 million boed, but on a yearly basis, it fell 4 percent as a result of asset sales. \nProduction was expected to come down by 270,000 boed in 2018 as a result of divestments, including the sale of a North Sea portfolio to Chrysaor and its stake in Woodside Petroleum. \nBut Shell also plans to double its shale production in the United States, Canada and Argentina in the next 5-10 years from the current 275,000 barrels per day, Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said. \nCapital expenditure in 2017 was $24 billion, slightly lower than the $25-$30 billion range Shell set until 2020. \nShell’s fourth-quarter profit, based on a current cost of supplies (CCS) and excluding identified items, rose by 140 percent to $4.3 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts. \nShell said its gearing dropped to 24.8 percent from a peak of 29.2 percent in the third quarter of 2016 as it cut its debt to $74.65 billion. \nAnd while it took a $2 billion charge due to new U.S. tax rules, Shell expects a longer-term boost.
