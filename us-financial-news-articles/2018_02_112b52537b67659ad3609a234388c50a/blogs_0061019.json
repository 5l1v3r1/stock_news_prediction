And we had a fabulous experience,\" Roberts told reporters on a call.\n\"The cab driver was incredibly knowledgeable about the difference between Virgin and Sky in every feature. We were learning a lot there. Then when we to the Sky store, we spent at least an hour going through every feature and comparing it to our own... We were really terribly impressed.\"\nLiberty Global-owned Virgin Media is a British rival to Sky.\nRoberts said that while the experience wasn't the deciding factor in moving forward with the bid, it reiterated the media group's value to the chief executive.\n\"It was another reminder for me how impressive Sky is, and how lucky we would be at Comcast to be able to combine together.\"\nAnother element in Comcast's thinking was Sky's success earlier this month in winning the rights to show Premier League soccer matches for a fee well below analyst expectations, boosting its future earnings and lifting its shares.\nThe offer is a huge statement of intent from the mild-mannered media mogul Roberts, 58, who took over as head of the cable and entertainment conglomerate from his father, Ralph, who founded the company in 1963.\nThe younger Roberts became Comcast's president in 1990 and CEO in 2002, having spent his whole career at the company.\nHe told reporters that he had taken a \"keen interest\" in Sky for many years. He said Sky's chief executive Jeremy Darroch had shown him an early preview of the Sky Q TV platform box, and that several people had worked as executives for both Comcast and Sky.\nWhile Fox's 39 percent stake in Sky and the agreed takeover by Murdoch has produced complications around the company, it also presented the opportunity to bid, and Roberts said that his London visit was a reminder of Sky's fundamental value.\n\"Frankly there's nothing as great in the United States,\" he said.\n\"Seeing it again, and listening to the passion of the sales and looking at the product... all those things combined to reinforce what a number of us have known for years â€” that this is a jewel.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T16:39:02.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
