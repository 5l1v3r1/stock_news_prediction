The authorities deny that and say those killed were all dealers who put up violent resistance.\nLast week, Amnesty International in the Philippines said “meaningful investigations” into such killings had failed to take place.\nA prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in the Hague earlier this month started a preliminary examination into a complaint accusing Duterte and at least 11 officials of crimes against humanity. Duterte has welcomed that.\nRoque said he had a lawyer in mind who could do the job instead of Callamard, but would not say who.\nDuterte has previously said he would welcome a probe by Callamard on the condition she agreed to have a public debate with him.\nShe irked the government in May last year when she gave a speech at a policy forum during a visit in an unofficial capacity.\nReporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T08:12:46.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
