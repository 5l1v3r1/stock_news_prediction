Designed by Construction Robotics, this robot mason is named SAM 100, short for \"Semi-Automated Mason.\" According to Construction Robotics, the bot can place between 300 and 400 bricks an hour, compared to a human which can only lay around 60 to 75 bricks an hour. \nLast year, the construction industry began going through a boom , however the industry is facing a severe labor shortage. As skilled laborers are aging out of the workforce, the gap is expected to widen. Robot workers like SAM 100 could help alleviate some of that strain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T16:00:46.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
