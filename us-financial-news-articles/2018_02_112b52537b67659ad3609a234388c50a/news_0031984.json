He said the group may ask the entire appeals court to rehear the case, or appeal to the Supreme Court.\nSchneiderman, in a statement, said the decision “affirms that Citizens United can no longer shroud its biggest donors in secrecy,” and was “a victory for all those who believe in fairness” in the non-profit sector.\nThursday’s decision largely affirmed U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein’s August 2016 ruling dismissing most claims.\nIt also dismissed a claim that Schneiderman’s decision to enforce the disclosure requirement more aggressively without saying he was doing so was a due process violation.\nThe court said no advance notice was needed because charities were already expected to follow the law.The case is Citizens United et al v. Schneiderman, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-3310.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Phil Berlowitz and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:19:05.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
