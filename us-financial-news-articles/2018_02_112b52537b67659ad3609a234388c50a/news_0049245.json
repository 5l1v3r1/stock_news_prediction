The panel last year released rival insurer AIG ( AIG.N ) from the label and agreed this month to drop its earlier appeal against a court decision releasing MetLife from the designation.\nFSOC did not provide any further information on the review, which is likely to last several months.\nThe regulatory panel also discussed recent volatility in the financial markets, including fluctuations in cryptocurrency futures and the impact on financial institutions, it said in the notice.\n”Council members noted that they continue to monitor market\ndevelopments,” the notice added.\nReporting by Michelle Price; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T01:35:44.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
