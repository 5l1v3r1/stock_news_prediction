McFarland, Jr., that is expected to be effective in March 2018.\nMr. McFarland joined the TowneBank organizers operating from the Aston family garage on a part-time basis in the fall of 1998 and joined the bank full time on March 1, 1999. He has served as the company’s Chief Financial Officer since that time.\n“Clyde has played an extraordinary role in the birthing and growth of Towne into the $10 billion asset company it is today,” said G. Robert Aston, Jr., the company’s founding Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “During our careers together at two different banks, Clyde and I have worked side by side for nearly thirty years. His impact on the success of Towne as well as his contribution to the personal and professional success of so many people in our company, including yours truly, cannot possibly be overstated,” added Aston.\nIn order to fully ensure a high level of continuity in the financial management of the company as it plans for the next decade of growth, Mr. McFarland will be retained by the company on a consulting basis through March 2022 to assist with those efforts. He will also serve as a member of the TowneBank Outer Banks Board of Directors in Southern Shores, North Carolina where he maintains a seasonal residence.\n“Here at Towne, we are blessed with a deep and extraordinarily talented financial management and leadership team.
