Our Development team continued its track record of leadership and innovation in HCM with the introduction of Xander™, our “People First” artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Xander uses a portfolio of advanced AI technologies, including natural language processing and machine-learning algorithms, to analyze emotions as well as statistics when reporting on employee data for employers. Xander can instantly analyze free-form text from employees’ open-ended survey answers and decipher more than 100 emotions, 70 workplace themes, and the overall sentiment of an individual employee or group. This information gives managers invaluable insights that expand the predictive and prescriptive capabilities already in UltiPro to aid company leaders in their employee- and culture-related decision-making. Ultimate introduced UltiPro Connect, the new hub of our partner ecosystem that was engineered to create seamless, automated integrations between our UltiPro product and third-party solutions and services.

The National Customer Service Organization named Ultimate the Customer Service Organization of the Year. Ultimate won three Stevie Awards for Customer Service, including the People’s Choice Award for Favorite Customer Service. Fortune ranked Ultimate #7 on its 2017 100 Best Companies to Work For list, making this Ultimate’s sixth consecutive year to appear on this respected list. People magazine ranked Ultimate #2 on its list of 50 Companies That Care. Forbes ranked Ultimate #7 on its 2017 list of the 100 Most Innovative Growth Companies. Forbes, in partnership with Just Capital, named Ultimate to its list of The Just 100: America’s Best Corporate Citizens, after analyzing 1,000 publicly traded companies to determine the companies with the best and most just business behavior based on seven metrics. CIO.com ranked Ultimate #1 on its list of 10 Best Places to Work for Women in Technology. Indeed ranked Ultimate #2 on its list of Best Companies to Work For in the U.S., and Glassdoor ranked Ultimate #10 on its list of Best Places to Work in 2018.

Recurring revenues were 85% of total revenues for the 2017 year, as compared with 84% of total revenues for the 2016 year. Ultimate’s total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 19%, as compared with those for the fourth quarter of 2016. Ultimate's total revenues for 2017 increased by 20%, compared with those for 2016. Ultimate’s annualized retention rate, on a rolling 12-month basis, was approximately 96% for our recurring revenue cloud customer base as of December 31, 2017. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, Ultimate generated $214.0 million in cash from operations compared with $159.5 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016. Our operating cash flow margin for 2017 was 22.7% compared with 20.4% as of December 31, 2016. Free cash flow was $136.4 million as of December 31, 2017, compared with $90.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Our free cash flow margins, excluding acquisitions, expanded to 14.5% for 2017, from 11.5% for 2016. We do not include cash used for acquisitions in our computation of free cash flow and the related margin because we do not acquire businesses on a predictable or regular basis.\n2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the federal government passed the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced our corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 740, \"Income Taxes\" (\"ASC 740\"), requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we adjusted the statutory federal and state income tax rates to our deferred tax assets and liabilities. As a result of the statutory rate decreases, we had a reduction in our net deferred tax asset balance of $8.7 million. We recorded $8.8 million of the $8.7 million reduction in our net deferred tax asset balance to our provision for income taxes in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations and $0.1 million to comprehensive income.\nStock Repurchases\nThe combination of cash, cash equivalents, and corporate marketable securities was $165.1 million as of December 31, 2017, compared with $97.9 million as of December 31, 2016.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we used $68.0 million to acquire 342,652 shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value common stock (\"Common Stock\") to settle employees’ tax withholding obligations associated with their restricted stock that vested during the period. We have 1,342,005 shares available for repurchase under our Stock Repurchase Plan.\nFinancial Outlook\nUltimate provides the following financial guidance for 2018:\nFor the first quarter of 2018:\nRecurring revenues of approximately $229 to $231 million, Total revenues of approximately $269 to $272 million, and Operating margin, on a non-GAAP basis (discussed below), of approximately 18%.\nFor the year 2018:\nRecurring revenues to increase in excess of 20% over 2017, Total revenues to increase in excess of 18% over 2017, and Operating margin, on a non-GAAP basis (discussed below), in excess of 21%.\nOperating margin expectations were determined on a non-GAAP basis using the methodologies identified under the caption “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” in this press release.\nWe have not reconciled our forward-looking operating margin on a non-GAAP basis to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. Such reconciliation would require unreasonable effort at this time to estimate and quantify with a reasonable degree of certainty various necessary GAAP components, including, for example, those related to stock-based compensation or others that may arise during the year. In particular, stock-based compensation is impacted by factors that are outside of the Company’s control and can be difficult to predict. The actual amount of stock-based compensation expense, for the year ending December 31, 2018, will have a significant impact on our operating margin on a GAAP basis.\nImmaterial Correction of Prior Period Financial Statements\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, as part of the evaluation of net deferred tax assets for implementing the Tax Act, immaterial errors were discovered in the reporting of the GAAP deferred income tax expense and related deferred tax assets, associated with the stock-based compensation expense for our named executive officers for prior periods through September 30, 2017. Since the amount of the error in any prior period was not material, we have retrospectively revised our financial statements to reflect this immaterial correction for these prior periods. The revisions include a decrease to GAAP net income for 2017 and 2016 of $1.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, as a result of the increases to our GAAP income tax expense for both years. For all prior periods affected, there was no impact on previously reported cash flows, pre-tax income and non-GAAP results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release are, and certain statements on the teleconference call may be, forward-looking statements within the meaning provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are made only as of the date hereof.
