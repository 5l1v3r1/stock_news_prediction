We have a lot of quality, experience, talent and youth. And on top of all that, we still have (Lionel) Messi.” \nThe Argentine forward was rested against Espanyol but came on from the bench to set up Pique’s goal with a perfectly placed free kick. \nWith Messi and Suarez in lethal form up front and Valverde’s organised defensive unit shutting teams out at the back, it will take something special to beat the Catalans.
