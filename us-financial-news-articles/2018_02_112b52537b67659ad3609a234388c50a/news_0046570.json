The firm says it is a novel device, different from other e-cigarettes that are often already subject to regulations.\nKazlauskas said Philip Morris had been notified of its possible violation of Lithuanian advertising law, and that the regulator was expected to issue its final ruling in a month.\nA woman walks past an iQOS shop in Vilnius, Lithuania December 6, 2017.
