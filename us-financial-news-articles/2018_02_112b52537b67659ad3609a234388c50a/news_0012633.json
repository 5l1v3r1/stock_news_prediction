We know their middle order is inexperienced and we want to cash in on that.” SOFT OPTIONS \nThe home side were captained by 23-year-old Aiden Markram in just his third ODI game with both experienced batsmen Faf du Plessis and AB de Villiers missing with finger injuries. \nThey made a cautious start, losing their first wicket two balls shy of 10 overs with just 39 on the scoreboard as Hashim Amla (23) was dismissed. \nThe introduction of the spinners proved the catalyst for South Africa’s collapse, with Chahal picking up the wickets of innings top-scorers JP Duminy and debutant Khaya Zondo, who both scored 25. \n“There were a couple of soft options (shots), starting with myself, so I am going to have to lead from the front and do better going forward,” Markram said.
