Access is patchy and can be revoked at short notice.\nThe government officials said that the mutual recognition plan was still favoured by London because it would retain access for firms based in Britain to the EU’s single market while allowing some flexibility from EU rules.\nThe announcement could also ease the concerns in the finance industry that the government does not have a plan for the sector, the officials said.\nOne of the government officials said there were reasons to believe that Britain’s favoured outcome was possible.\n“The EU has never struck a deal with someone before where it has already had the exact same regulatory equivalence,” the official said.\n“Secondly the commercial imperatives are 180 degrees different from a normal trade agreement. Normally we start from a status quo and say ‘wouldn’t it be great if we could get closer’.”\nThe Financial Times newspaper reported the government’s plan to endorse the mutual recognition plan earlier on Friday.\nA spokeswoman for the finance ministry declined to comment on the reports which she said were speculation.\nA final decision on the best model to pursue has not yet been taken, the government officials said.\nBritain’s vast financial services sector looks set to be one of the most divisive areas in the Brexit negotiations. Britain wants a generous deal while the EU insists that Britain’s red lines -- such as ending the free movement of workers from the EU -- make that impossible.\nBritain is home to the world’s largest number of banks and hosts the largest commercial insurance market. About six trillion euros ($7.5 trillion), or 37 percent, of Europe’s financial assets are managed in the UK capital, almost twice the amount of its nearest rival, Paris.\nAdditional reporting by Carolyn Cohn; Writing by William Schomberg; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T14:16:47.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
