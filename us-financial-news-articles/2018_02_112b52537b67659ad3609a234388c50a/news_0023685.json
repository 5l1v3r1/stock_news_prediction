[EIA/M]\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Monday it expected world oil demand to climb by 1.59 million bpd this year, an increase of 60,000 bpd from the previous forecast, to 98.6 million bpd.\nOPEC and other producers including Russia have been reducing supplies since 2017. The cuts are scheduled to last through 2018.\nSeasonality may also be affecting prices, analysts said.\n“A driving force behind the next few weeks of pricing vulnerability stems from the current peak in U.S. refinery maintenance season,” Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.\nThe private American Petroleum Institute is due to publish crude inventory estimates on Tuesday, while the U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration releases weekly inventory data on Wednesday.\nAdditional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T03:18:15.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
