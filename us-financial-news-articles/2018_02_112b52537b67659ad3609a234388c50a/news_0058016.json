His victory here last year earned him the world’s number one ranking.\nBut for him to defend his title, he will have to fight off every top 50 player except for Jason Day, Hideki Matsuyama, Rory McIlroy, Henrik Stenson, and Brooks Koepka, making it as deep a field as one will find ahead of the Masters.\nAmong the other top players in the field this week are world number two Jon Rahm, who finished third here a year ago, and reigning Player of the Year Justin Thomas, fresh from his Sunday triumph at the Honda Open and showing no signs of slowing down.\nJohnson, Rahm and Thomas, who have been grouped together for the opening two rounds, will tee off on Thursday from the 10th tee at 12:51 ET (1751 GMT).\nPhil Mickelson, who won the event in 2009, will tee off with plenty of confidence as he has earned top-10 finishes in each of his last three starts, including a share of second place at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.\nWorld number five and former champion Justin Rose, who won the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai last October, returns to action after a four-week break.\nThe Englishman, who came within a whisker of winning the U.S. Masters last April where he fell in a playoff to Sergio Garcia, edged Johnson in Shanghai and is vying to become only the third man in history to claim back-to-back WGC titles.\nLast year’s runner-up, Briton Tommy Fleetwood, is coming off a fourth-place finish at the Honda Classic and will be eager to return and seek his first PGA Tour win.\nFleetwood has been grouped with Masters champion Sergio Garcia of Spain and Swede Alex Noren.\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T21:23:45.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
