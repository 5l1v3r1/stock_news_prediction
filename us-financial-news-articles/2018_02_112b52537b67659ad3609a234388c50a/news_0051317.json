Daimler said in April 2016 the Justice Department had asked it to investigate its emissions certification process.\nA Justice Department spokesman did not immediately comment.\nDaimler has said in financial filings it faced ongoing investigations by U.S. and German authorities into excess diesel emissions that could lead to significant penalties and recalls.\nSoftware-based engine management systems are illegal if they are not declared to U.S. regulators and if designed to evade anti-pollution tests.\nIn Europe, carmakers have legally made use of a “thermal window,” a temperature threshold allowing carmakers to throttle back emissions management systems to protect the engine from damage.\nThe Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in May accusing it of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014. The government is seeking “substantial” civil penalties to settle the suit.\nGerman prosecutors searched Daimler premises in May 2017 as part of an ongoing fraud probe related to false advertising and possible manipulation of exhaust-gas after-treatment in diesel cars.\nStuttgart prosecutors said on Monday two Daimler employees were being investigated as part of the probe.\nIn May, Daimler said it had dropped plans to seek U.S. approval to sell 2017 Mercedes-Benz U.S. diesel vehicles. The company faces ongoing U.S. lawsuits from investors.
