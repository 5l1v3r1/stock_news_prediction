Now the next one, it would be nice. \n”But the new faces are also really strong. \n“The two Russians, Semen (Pavlichenko) and Roman (Repilov), and the Austrian guy Wolfgang (Kindl) and the Italian, Dominik (Fischnaller)... I would say that these are the guys who can get a medal and we’ll see on Sunday which one I get, maybe.” \nWith Loch and reigning women’s champion Natalie Geisenberger defending their titles at Pyeongchang, the German team has its usual dynastic feel.

REUTERS/Edgar Su COLD COMFORTS \nHackl, known affectionately as the ‘Speeding White Sausage’ during his competitive days, remains a part of the technical set-up while Loch’s father Norbert, who competed in luge at the 1984 Sarajevo Games, is the team’s head coach. \nThe Germans have been thrilled with the bone-chilling cold in Pyeongchang, which has seen the luge track record beaten during training in the leadup. \n“The track is really, really good. Fast,” said Loch, who also won a team relay gold for Germany at Sochi. \n”At the moment the conditions are perfect. The track crew have done a really good job. Minus seven, minus eight (degrees Celsius), that’s the perfect conditions. \n“We are under the track record so that’s a good sign.” \nLoch joked about seeing his first luge tracks from a baby “stroller” but in a new Olympic era for the sport, he counts as something of an old master, though two years shy of 30. \nFor the first time since 1984, the Olympic men’s luge medallists will not include either Hackl or Italian two-times Olympic champion Armin Zoeggeler. \nThe Italian great Zoeggeler claimed bronze behind Russian silver medal winner Albert Demchenko at Sochi, the pair becoming the first lugers to claim Olympic medals in their forties. \nAsked whether he saw himself competing as a middle-aged Olympian, Loch snorted with laughter. \n“No, no, no. Not so long,” said Loch, a father soon to welcome his second child. “I’ll be at the next Olympics (at Beijing) and then we will see.” Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T07:47:55.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
