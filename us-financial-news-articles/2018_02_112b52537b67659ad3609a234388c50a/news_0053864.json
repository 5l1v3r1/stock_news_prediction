Until his retirement, Jeremy will shift his focus to executing critical elements of the Company’s new strategy. Jeremy will partner with the president of Integer’s Advanced Surgical and Orthopedics product line to focus on improving profitability. He will also focus on Integer’s customer strategic imperatives of driving sales force excellence and market focused innovation. As a result of Jeremy’s new areas of focus, the presidents of Integer’s Cardiac Rhythm Management & Neuromodulation and Cardio & Vascular product lines will now report directly to Joseph Dziedzic.\nPayman Khales has joined Integer as president of the Cardio & Vascular product line. Payman will be responsible for accelerating sales and profitability growth for the product line.
