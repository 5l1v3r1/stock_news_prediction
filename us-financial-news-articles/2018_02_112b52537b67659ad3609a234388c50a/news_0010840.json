We are trying to get further details,” Khan added. \nAnother officer, Javed Akbar Riaz, told Reuters that Chen had an employee ID from Cosco. \nThe shipping company could not be reached for comment in Karachi on Monday. \nTens of thousands of Chinese nationals have come to Pakistan, but the new arrivals face dangers, creating a headache for Pakistani security officials. \nIslamic State’s abduction and killing last June of two Chinese nationals in the southwestern province of Baluchistan highlighted the security risks that have put off many Western companies. \nKarachi, Pakistan’s largest city, still has a reputation for gang shootings and other violence, despite a paramilitary crackdown that began in 2013 and sharply reduced killings. \nHospital officials said Zhu was admitted in a critical condition, but later died.
