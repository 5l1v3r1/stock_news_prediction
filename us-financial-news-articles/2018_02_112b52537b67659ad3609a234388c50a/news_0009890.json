Working in laboratories owned by the tech giant, LaChappelle came into contact with a new 3D printer machine from Stratasys that could print in color and to precise design s .\n“So that really was the obvious printer for this device and what has really allowed us to get the human-like element in there,” LaChappelle said .\nTraditionally , patients visit doctors over several weeks to help design a new prosthetic. Now, Unlimited Tomorrow can post a scanner mounted to an iPad to the patient. With the aid of a friend or family member, the patient scans both their good arm and the stump at the point of their missing limb.\nLaChappelle said the information is then formatted using CAD design software and a printed arm, could, theoretically, be available the same day. He added that the process could reduce costs per prosthetic from as much as $100,000 to as little as $5,000.\nOnly one device has so face been created and is worn by Momo, the girl who showed interest at the art fair.\nWeighing less than a pound and with a battery life of three to four days, the user feedback has been reportedly positive. But the challenge is to make the prosthetic commercially viable.\n\"So far, from testing every socket that we have created fits like a glove from the start,\" LaChappelle said.\nThe inventor added that the ability to match skin tone and replicate blemishes is a huge improvement on current prosthetic devices and the addition of paintable fingernails was psychologically important for young girls.\nScaling up The design is to be refined for mass production and Stratasys will print 100 arms at no cost within the next 18 to 24 months.\nMichael Gaisford, director of healthcare solutions at Stratasys told CNBC that the challenge of creating prosthetic arms for children who are still growing was significant, but important to resolve.\n\"Children are some of the people who will benefit most from an effective prosthetic,\" he said. \"Because of the importance to self-esteem and secondly to learn the skills that they need to be productive and engage in schoolwork and play. It's vital for development.\"\nThe funding platform Unlimited Tomorrow has so far raised $355,000 from 411 investors on Indiegogo. It was after he used the fundraising platform that LaChappelle received attention from industrial companies.\nJonathan Cohen, chief enterprise solutions officer at Indiegogo, said like other Fortune 500 companies do, LaChappelle has used the funding platform to validate his product.\nCohen said crowdfunding has also been leveraged to work with the best brands and get the story to market.\n\"So, instead of raising 25 to 100 million, he is raising a million dollars for operations and partnering with the world's best enterprise brands to create the next 100 arms,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T00:22:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
