Throughout this time, change has come in the form of name, ownership and acquisitions, but the company has remained true to its manufacturing heritage. Today, the company is redefining its identity and position in the industry with a new name and brand mark. Now known as \"AxleTech,\" the company's new brand emphasizes the \"tech\" in its name, recognizing its focus on and investments in being a technology company that provides advanced powertrain systems, axles, brakes, components and aftermarket parts for heavy-duty commercial and defense applications.\n\"AxleTech is a technology company. Now our brand identity is catching up,\" said Bill Gryzenia, CEO, AxleTech. \"We have a long, rich history, but to have a successful future, we need agility and speed. We're accomplishing this through new partnerships, expertise, solutions, thinking and technology.\"\n\"Our previous brand served us well for almost two decades as we built upon our reputation for custom engineering and manufacturing. Given our broader transformation and capabilities, we have purposely emerged as a technology leader for commercial and defense vehicles. We want our brand to reflect that,\" said Mary Petrovich, chairman of the board, AxleTech. \"This new identity represents the relentless work of our entire global team that has thrust AxleTech into a leadership position for the next mobility era.\"\nSince 2015, when the company was acquired by The Carlyle Group, AxleTech has expanded its engineering expertise and invested significant capital in new product development. Armed with this, AxleTech is using new technology and assets to develop e-axles, new independent suspension systems, variable-track axles and more for the most powerful vehicles in the world.\nThe branding process led to many discoveries about its culture and heritage: a company-wide, relentless will to win; limited bureaucracy that fosters speed and nimbleness; and a foundation of humility and caring. These key traits inspire employees to quickly develop and bring innovative powertrain systems solutions to market. For example, AxleTech's electronic drivetrain propels the Proterra Catalyst ® EZ Max, which recently shattered a world record by traveling over 1,100 miles on a single charge.\nThe new identity was designed to represent AxleTech's influence on systems and technologies Between the Wheels, represented by the circles within the A and H in the logo. A dramatic change in colors reinforces the company's focus on technology (slate gray) and new powertrain solutions, including e-axles (signified by green). \"International\" was eliminated from the name because it was unnecessary as AxleTech has operations in North America, Europe, India, Asia and South America.\nAbout AxleTech\nAxleTech is a leading technology company that engineers, designs, manufactures, sells and services powertrain solutions for on- and off-highway heavy-duty commercial vehicles. With industrial roots established in 1919, the company's nearly 800 worldwide employees drive the company to develop advanced powertrain systems, axles, brakes, components and aftermarket parts for global customers. Headquartered in Troy, Michigan, the company has locations in Oshkosh, Wisconsin; Chicago; Saint-Étienne, France; Osasco, Brazil; Pune, India; and Shanghai.
