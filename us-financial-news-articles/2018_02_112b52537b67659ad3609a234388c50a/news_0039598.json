Because the resolution, signed by President Donald Trump on Feb. 28, 2017, was passed under the Congressional Review Act regulators can never enact similar requirements in the future.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert and Susan CornwellEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:34:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
