In response, a pro-Ramaphosa faction of the ANC said it would “defend” the building, raising the prospect of clashes between different camps of the ANC. \nZuma has been deserted by prominent allies since Ramaphosa became leader of the only party to govern South Africa since the end of white minority rule in 1994. \nRamaphosa, 65, is in a strong position to become the next president and has been lobbying for Zuma’s removal. \nZuma has not said whether he will step down voluntarily before his second term as president ends next year. Opposition parties and some in the ANC want him to go before his State of the Nation address to parliament, scheduled for Thursday.
