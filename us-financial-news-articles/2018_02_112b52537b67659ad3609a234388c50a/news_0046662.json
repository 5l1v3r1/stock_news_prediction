As a result, some market participants briefly interpreted that as an indicator that monetary stimulus will come to an end earlier than previously thought.\n\"Inflation expectations in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2018 showed average inflation expectations of 1.5 percent, 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent for 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.
