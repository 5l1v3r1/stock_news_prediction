Doha denies the charges and says the countries aim to curtail its sovereignty.\nWashington is hoping to lay the groundwork for a summit by the summer.\n“We would hope the dispute is resolved before the summit to allow maximum focus on other strategic concerns like Iran,” another U.S. official said.\nQatar is host to U.S. and international forces at Al Udeid Air Base, which is home to the Combined Air Operations Center. The center coordinates an array of data and intelligence from satellites, drones, radar and U.S. planes flying over hot spots in the Middle East and bombing Islamic State positions.\nReporting by Yara Bayoumy, Jonathan Landay, Steve Holland and Warren Strobel; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T03:17:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
