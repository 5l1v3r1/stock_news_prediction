The pair help kids select a main dish, side and drink, with each turn of the menu's three-part pages creating a new scene in the French countryside or city, as Elle and Pierre enjoy picnics, riding trains, dancing – even parachuting.\n\"We wanted to create a new way for kids to engage with the dining experience and empower them to make their own choices,\" said Mimi's Senior Director of Marketing Tiffany McClain. \"Our new kids menu is a fun and interactive way to help children review the menu. They can find the items they like and give their order to the server independently and even nonverbally.\"\nThe menu features new items such as French Toast Dippers, freshly baked Kids Waffle, Kids Cheeseburger or Cheese Quesadillas, as well as longtime favorites Puppy Dog Griddle Cakes, Sliced Grilled Chicken Breast, crispy Chicken Tenders, and Kids Fettuccini with Pomodoro Sauce.\nAlong with their main dish, kids can also select new beverages with their meal, like Honest Kids Appley Ever After or Super Fruit Punch. Last, they can add healthier items to their meals, such as GoGo squeeZ Applesauce and Yoplait Go-Gurt Strawberry Yogurt, for $0.99 each.\n\"GoGo squeeZ is thrilled to partner with a fun and exciting brand such as Mimi's. Our mission at GoGo squeeZ is to make it easier for families to be healthier and happier. We hope kids will be excited about this addition to the Mimi's kids menu,\" said GoGo squeeZ Chief Marketing Officer Helene Caillate.\nThe entire kids menu is available all day, for kids 12 years and younger. Mimi's also offers all-day breakfast, every day.
