The NSC estimates traffic fatalities in Texas have jumped 7 percent from 2015 to 2017, though the number of deaths fell slightly from 2016 to 2017.\nSeparately, Hersman says drivers continue to focus on smartphones, in-car infotainment systems and other distractions when they should be focused on the road.\n\"We know it's happening even though distracted driving data is hard to come by,\" she said. \"Police reports on accidents often don't report if the driver was distracted and in many accidents, people don't self-report themselves.\"\nWhile the latest estimate on traffic deaths is a sobering reminder of the dangers on American roads, there is some encouraging news in the report.\nFor example, the NSC estimates traffic fatalities in New York fell 3 percent last year and have dropped 15 percent over the last two years. Safety advocates say the decline may be due to New York City's push to eliminate traffic deaths by lowering speed limits, adding bike lanes and more pedestrian shelters.\n\"Changes like those being made in New York can save lives,\" Hersman said", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T07:06:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
