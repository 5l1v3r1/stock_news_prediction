Lower oil revenues led to dollar shortages, since crude sales are the country’s main source of dollars.\nAfrica’s largest economy emerged from recession in the second quarter of last year as crude prices recovered and militant attacks against Niger Delta oil production facilities ended.\nSuccessful debt sales, including multiple Eurobond offerings last year, have helped Nigeria to accrue billions of dollars in foreign reserves.
