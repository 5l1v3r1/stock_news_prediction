Nasrallah said Lebanese officials must tell the United States to listen to Lebanon’s demands in order that “we hold Hezbollah back from Israel”. “In the oil and gas battle, the only card (the Lebanese) have is the resistance,” Nasrallah said, in a reference to the Hezbollah movement. If Lebanon’s Higher Defence Council asked Hezbollah to stop the Israelis, Nasrallah said the group would be “ready to stop them within hours”.
