We are very worried about the number of jobs that will remain in Brussels after Lufthansa’s decision. We have not heard about their plans so far which causes a lot of uncertainty,” Van Hoof told Reuters. \nUnion representatives have said they would consider strike action depending on the outcome of Lufthansa’s decision. \n“It will not only be the brand that will change, it’s the business model: the employment, the conditions,” Filip Lemberechts, secretary of the CGSLB union, said. \nBrussels Airlines emerged out of SN Brussels Airlines which was created in 2002 in the wake of the bankruptcy of Sabena. \nThis went bust after Swissair, which then owned a 49 percent stake, failed to inject the necessary funds and a Brussels court later held the Swiss airline responsible for its failure. \nSwissair later also collapsed and its successor Swiss International Airlines was taken over by Lufthansa.
