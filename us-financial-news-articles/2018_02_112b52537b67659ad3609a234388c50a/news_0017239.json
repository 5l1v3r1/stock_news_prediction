The company flagged last month that it was considering listing the business, seeking to raise a reported $18 billion.\nSoftBank has long relied on its domestic telecoms business, which makes up a third of overall sales but two-thirds of profit, as a stable source of cash that can be diverted to its growing number of investments around the world.\nFounder and CEO Masayoshi Son established the more than $93 billion Vision Fund, the world's largest private-equity fund, which has funnelled more than $9 billion into global startups since its inception in 2016, Thomson Reuters data showed.\nSeparately on Wednesday, the company reported a 2.8 percent fall in third-quarter operating profit, due in part to higher costs. It did not release a forecast for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertain factors.\n($1 = 109.1500 yen)\n(Reporting by Sam Nussey Editing by Christopher Cushing)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T13:47:29.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
