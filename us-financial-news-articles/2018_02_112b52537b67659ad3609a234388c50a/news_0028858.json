An instant tutoring session is a new construct,\" Marshall said.\nA French tutor who didn't speak English Cohn got the idea for the company when he had a bad experience with a tutor while in high school: He was struggling in French but got a tutor who spoke almost no English.\nThe legacy tutoring business has required students to go to a physical retail location — and only after securing an appointment.\nThe experience was inconvenient, expensive and one-size-fits-all, Cohn said in an interview.\nHe started Varsity Tutors in 2007 while still a student at Washington University in St. Louis. After he handed out flyers on campus and in coffee shops, demand took off immediately from students who needed help fast.\nThe company now has 500 employees.\n\"Our original business model was similar to Netflix's early DVD-by-mail business — you go to our website and request a tutor to come to your home,\" said Cohn.\nNow, the tutoring is done online.\nTo date, the company has provided 100,000 students with more than 3 million hours of instruction, according to Cohn.\nVarsity Tutors' newest offering, called Instant Tutoring, aims to connect students with one of its 40,000 on-demand tutors in more 150 subjects in as little as 15 seconds.\n'Freaking out for a couple of hours' But Cohn's path from student to well-funded entrepreneur hasn't been a straight line.\nThe early growth of the company happened while he was still taking college classes and interviewing for a job at the now-defunct investment bank Bear Stearns.\nThe work, \"80 to 100 hours a week,\" he said, almost overwhelmed him.\n\"I ended up having a small breakdown and freaking out for a couple of hours about how I would handle it all,\" he said.\nThen in the summer of 2011 came a key moment when he decided to quit his job as \"a junior VC\" and devote himself full time to his own company.\n\"The spouse of one of my 10 full-time employees said, 'My wife gives 100 percent working for this company. Why don't you?'\" Cohn recalled.\n\"That's when it struck me that I was letting my fear get in the way of making the leap. I had become the primary thing holding back the business.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T14:11:34.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
