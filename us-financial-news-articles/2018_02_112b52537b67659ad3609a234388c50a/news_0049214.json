Bulgarian business online publication Capital put the deal at 320 million euros.\n“Inercom’s offer is significantly above the fair market value of the assets sold, as determined in an independent appraisal, and brings a positive return on the investments in the Bulgarian assets” CEZ said in a statement.\nInercom Bulgaria, part of a group that operates six photovoltaic energy installations with an installed capacity of 23 megawatts and is active in the construction sector, declined to comment.\nThe deal is pending the approval of Bulgaria’s anti-trust authority.\nSpeaking at a parliamentary energy commission prior to the announcement, Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova said the deal should also get the nod of the financial and the energy regulators, as CEZ controlled significant energy assets.\n“What is important to us is that security of supplies and quality of services be guaranteed,” Petkova said.\nA source familiar with the process said Inercom was holding talks with an international bank to partially finance the deal. Capital said the small company planned to secure half of the funds needed with a credit from two other unidentified companies.\nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which arranged a 116 million euros syndicated loan to CEZ Bulgaria in 2016, has the right to call the loan as result of the change of ownership and is yet to decide how to proceed.\nCEZ, which started the process of offloading its Bulgarian assets last January, said the sale would not affect its ongoing international arbitration with Bulgaria.\nThe Czech company has already agreed the sale of its Varna power plant in Bulgaria to Bulgaria’s SIGDA OOD.\nReporting by Robert Muller and Jason Hovet in Prague and Tsvetelia Tsolova in Sofia; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T18:50:01.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
