More complete viewer totals will be released later Monday. \nThe initial tally marked the lowest overnight rating since 2010, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Last year’s game, in which the Patriots stormed from behind to topple the Atlanta Falcons in overtime, attracted an audience of 111.3 million, also down from the year before. The record for the most-watched Super Bowl was in 2015, when 114.4 million tuned in. \nThis year’s game was close throughout, with Eagles quarterback Nick Foles leading his team to its first Super Bowl victory and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady heaving a last-second pass that fell incomplete. A ratings point equals 1 percent of U.S. TV households, which total more than 116 million. \nThe Super Bowl draws TV’s biggest live audience of the year, and advertisers paid more than $5 million for 30 second commercials.
