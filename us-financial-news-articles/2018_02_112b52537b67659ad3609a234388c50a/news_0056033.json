The labor market across almost all dimensions “can be cautiously interpreted as consistent with...full employment.”\nReporting by Howard Schneider and Jason Lange; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T19:19:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
