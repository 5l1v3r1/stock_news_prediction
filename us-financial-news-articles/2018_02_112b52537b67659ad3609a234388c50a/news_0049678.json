This includes an organic growth projection of 10%-14% before any impact of foreign currency. Gross margin is expected to be 55.5%-56.5% on a GAAP basis, and adjusted gross margin is expected to be 56%-57%. Income from operations is expected to be $26.5-$28.5 million on a GAAP basis, and adjusted income from operations is expected to be $40-$42 million. We expect an income tax rate of approximately 28% on a GAAP basis and an income tax rate of approximately 19% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income is expected to be $14-$15.5 million on a GAAP basis, and adjusted net income is expected to be $30.5-$32 million. Fully diluted GAAP EPS for the year 2018 is expected to be in the range of $0.31-$0.35 and adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.68-$0.72.\nOur non-GAAP guidance for the year 2018 excludes the following items:\n$10.7 million estimated intangible amortization expense; $0.6 million in cost of goods and $10.1 million in G&A. $2.7 million estimated acquisition and integration expenses (G&A) associated with the Spectrum acquisition. $4.2 million of non-cash interest expense (Other Income/Expense) related to our debt financing.\nOur non-GAAP guidance for the year 2018 includes:\nAn income tax increase of $1.2 million, representing the tax impact of acquisition costs and intangible amortization.\nAll reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted (non-GAAP) guidance are detailed in the tables included later in this press release.\nConference Call\nRepligen will host a conference call and webcast today, February 22, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EST, to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and corporate developments.

In addition, a webcast will be accessible via the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website. Both the conference call and webcast will be archived for a period of time following the live event. The replay dial-in numbers are (877) 344-7529 from the U.S., (855)-669-9658 from Canada and (412) 317-0088 for international callers. Replay listeners must provide the passcode 10117070.\nN on-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement our financial statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance are included in this release: revenue growth rate at constant currency, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, adjusted income from operations and adjusted operating margin, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted other expense, adjusted income tax benefit and adjusted earnings per diluted share (EPS). The Company provides revenue growth rates in constant currency to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation in order to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance to its past revenue performance. To calculate revenue growth rates in constant currency, the Company converts actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP financial results and/or non-GAAP guidance exclude the impact of: contingent consideration related to the Company’s June 2014 asset purchase agreement with Refine Technology (Refine contingent consideration was triggered by the achievement of annual XCell™ ATF system sales milestones through the year 2016) and its April 2016 acquisition of Atoll GmbH, acquisition costs related to the Company’s acquisitions of Atoll GmbH, TangenX Technology Corporation, and Spectrum Lifesciences, LLC (formerly known as Spectrum, Inc., inventory step-up charges related to the acquisition of Spectrum, intangible amortization costs, non-cash interest expense, and in the case of EBITDA, cash interest expense related to the Company’s May 2016 convertible debt issuance. Also excluded are tax benefits associated with valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, the impact on tax of intangible amortization, tax benefits associated with variable integration expenses and tax benefits associated with tax reform. These costs are excluded because management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, nor do the resulting charges recorded accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financial measures is included as an attachment to this press release. When analyzing the Company’s operating performance and guidance investors should not consider non-GAAP measures as substitutable for the comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Repligen Corporation\nRepligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) is a global bioprocessing company that develops and commercializes highly innovative products that deliver cost and process efficiencies to biological drug manufacturers worldwide.
