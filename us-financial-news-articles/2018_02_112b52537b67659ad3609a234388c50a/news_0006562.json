Colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980, while many blacks were landless.\nTwenty years later, Mugabe authorized the violent invasions of many white-owned farms, justifying them on the grounds that they were redressing imbalances from the colonial era.\nMugabe, 93, resigned in November after the army and his ZANU-PF party turned against him.\nEarlier this month a government document showed that Zimbabwe is considering establishing a special tribunal to determine the value of compensation and how to pay it to white farmers who have lost their land since 2000.\nMany white farmers challenged their evictions legally but lost. Under Zimbabwe’s constitution all agricultural land belongs to the government.\nReporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:10:01.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
