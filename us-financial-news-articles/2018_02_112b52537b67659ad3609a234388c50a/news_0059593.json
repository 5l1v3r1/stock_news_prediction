Spectators and models were shielded from the worst of the freezing weather at the Paris Fashion Week event on Tuesday. But the styles, by house designer Anthony Vaccarello, featured plenty of bare legs, as mini black leather shorts were paired with sleek jackets and sheer tops for a chic, rock-and-roll look. Slideshow (7 Images) Thigh-grazing dresses in an array of flowery patterns, some with structured shoulders and billowing sleeves, closed the catwalk show. Elsewhere, shaggy coats and longer gowns made an appearance, including some with spectacular curved necklines. Men donned capes and leather jackets; others wore close-cut suits, in black or deep blue velvet, and echoed the sexy, party feel of the collection with sparkling jackets. The French label - named after its founder Yves Saint Laurent and owned by luxury conglomerate Kering - unveiled its collection on the first full day of Paris Fashion Week, which runs until March 6. Other stalwarts of the French fashion calendar, including LVMH couture house Dior, are also showcasing their latest looks.
