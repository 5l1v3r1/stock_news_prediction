In return, drivers get rebates for state fuel taxes. As of the end of 2016, only about 700 people were participating in the program, which is intended to gather data and generate consumer feedback.\n\"The program offers tangible evidence that a tax on vehicle miles traveled is a promising alternative to relying on fuel taxes,\" the report said.\nTrump last week called for using $200 billion in new federal spending over 10 years in an effort to stimulate $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending, largely through states shouldering most of the costs and relying on unspecified spending cuts to pay for repairs.\nThe report also boosted the idea of driverless cars, saying widespread use of them could lift economic growth and create jobs.\nThe idea of a transportation tax, however, could prove controversial with Trump's fellow Republicans . Many of the party's lawmakers dislike the idea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T19:55:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
