The improvement in 2017 was largely due to the lowering of the corporate tax rate to 21% that resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed on December 22, 2017. The impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided a $30.5 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, total insurance revenues, from both premiums and contract charges, increased along with net realized investment gains compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these was a decline in net investment income, reflecting the low interest rate environment, and increased policyholder benefits and operating expenses.\nNet income totaled $51.5 million or $5.32 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, up from $22.3 million or $2.30 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. The improvement in 2017 primarily resulted from the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as mentioned above. In addition, the improvement in 2017 reflected increased insurance revenues, from both premiums and contract charges, as well as lower policyholder benefits. Partially offsetting these was a decrease in net investment income, reflecting the low interest rate environment, and increases in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and operating expenses.\nKansas City Life Insurance Company (OTCQX: KCLI) was established in 1895 and is based in Kansas City, Missouri. The Company's primary business is providing financial protection through the sale of life insurance and annuities. The Company operates in 49 states and the District of Columbia.
