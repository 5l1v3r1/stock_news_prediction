These auctions are going to happen regardless of who wins the presidency,” Joaquin Coldwell said.\nAround 90 exploration and production contracts have been signed with oil majors including Chevron Corp and Italy’s Eni SpA. Joaquin Coldwell expects that number to increase to more than 100 by the time President Enrique Pena Nieto’s term ends.\nPena Nieto is barred by law from seeking a second six-year term.\nJoaquin Coldwell, who also serves as chairman of Pemex’s board of directors, described the energy reform as “irreversible” as its major tenets are enshrined in the constitution, and would require a super-majority in Congress to reverse.\nA participant holds a bid during an auction of deepwater oil and gas fields in Mexico City, Mexico January 31, 2018.

Companies can also take disputes to international arbitration.\n“These contracts are bullet-proof,” said Joaquin Coldwell, who served as chairman of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party before taking the helm of the energy ministry.\nHe added that the already-signed contracts are likely to bring in some $150 billion, saying that it would be “complete nonsense” to forgo such investment.\nA late January deepwater oil auction that saw Anglo-Dutch major Royal Dutch Shell win nine contracts is alone forecast to bring $93 billion in investment.\nMexico's Secretariat of Energy Pedro Joaquin Coldwell smiles after an interview with Reuters in Mexico City, Mexico February 8, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso Mexican crude oil production hit a record 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2004, but has consistently dropped since then to total about 1.9 million bpd last year.\nJoaquin Coldwell said $640 billion in investment over the next 15 years will be needed to push output to its peak.\nReuters has reported that the Mexican government is studying the possibility of stepping in to replace Venezuela’s oil program Petrocaribe if the government of President Nicolas Maduro were to fall.\nBut in the interview, Joaquin Coldwell downplayed the possibility.\n“It would be very hard for Mexico to assume such a responsibility since our own oil production has been declining,” he said, emphasizing that the Petrocaribe analysis has mostly been led by the foreign ministry.\nLate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez launched Petrocaribe in 2005, offering discounted supplies to a dozen countries using low interest rates and allowing members to pay for crude oil with goods such as food and clothing.\nBut since then, the amount of oil distributed by the program has dwindled.\nReporting by Ana Isabel Martinez; Writing by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:13:12.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
