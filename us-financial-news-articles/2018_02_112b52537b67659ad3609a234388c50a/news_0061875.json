Broadcom has put forward six nominees for election to Qualcomm’s 11-member board in a shareholder vote scheduled for March 6, as a way to force deal negotiations with Qualcomm.\nIn a letter to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs proposed a meeting focused on price as soon as convenient for both parties.\nWhile the two companies have not yet resolved their disagreements on how to address potential antitrust hurdles, Qualcomm said they had made progress on that front.\n“If the discussion is truly coming down to price alone, then we would call this progress,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.\nA sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd, who announced on Monday an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/Files Broadcom cut its bid last week by 4 percent to $117 billion after Qualcomm’s decision to raise its own bid for NXP Semiconductors NV to $44 billion, a potential deal-breaker for what would be the biggest ever technology merger.\nQualcomm’s shares rose 2.4 percent to $64.79 in early trading on Monday, still well below Broadcom’s latest offer of $79 per share.\nQualcomm also softened its approach to Broadcom’s commitments on regulatory approval for the deal, saying the path forward did not require a “hell or high water” commitment.\nQualcomm, however, urged the Singapore-based chipmaker to provide more clarity regarding its plans for Qualcomm’s licensing business, which Broadcom has been unwilling to reveal.\n“We are willing to jointly select a law firm with antitrust expertise that you would fully brief on your licensing plans,” Qualcomm said.\nIn a meeting with Broadcom on Friday, Qualcomm proposed a reverse termination fee of 9 percent of enterprise value if Broadcom fails to win regulatory approvals.\nBroadcom had previously proposed a $8 billion breakup fee. The company was not immediately available for comment.\nReporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Bill Rigby\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T14:17:00.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
