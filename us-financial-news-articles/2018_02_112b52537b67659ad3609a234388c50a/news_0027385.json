A police spokesman said he was not immediately able to comment. Britain’s parliament is currently in recess. News website MailOnline and the Press Association news service said the incident involved a suspect package. A Reuters correspondent in parliament said there was no sign of a broader security alert in the building. Police have increased security at parliament after an Islamic State-inspired attacker killed five people a year ago by driving a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and then stabbing to death a police officer in the grounds of parliament.
