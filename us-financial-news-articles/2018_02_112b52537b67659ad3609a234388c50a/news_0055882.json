The adjusted net loss 1 for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $14 million, or $0.33 per diluted share. For the full year of 2017, the CRC net loss was $266 million, or $6.26 per diluted share. The adjusted net loss 1 for the full year of 2017 was $187 million, or $4.40 per diluted share.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180226006509/en/\n4Q17 Earnings Infographic (Graphic: Business Wire)\nAdjusted EBITDAX 1 for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $222 million and $761 million for the full year of 2017. Cash provided by operating activities was $23 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $248 million for the full year of 2017. Capital investments for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $139 million and $371 million for the full year of 2017, of which $14 million was funded by CRC's joint venture (JV) partner Benefit Street Partners (BSP) in the fourth quarter and $96 million for the full year. For the full year of 2017, CRC was free cash flow 1 neutral after working capital and excluding capital that was funded by BSP.\nQuarterly Highlights Include:\nProduced 126,000 BOE per day Invested capital of $139 million, of which JV partner BSP funded $14 million Drilled 37 wells with internally funded capital and 44 wells with BSP and Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) capital Generated adjusted EBITDAX 1 of $222 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDAX margin 1 of 39%\nFull Year Highlights Include:\nProved reserves of 618 MMBOE, organically replacing 119% of reserves from the capital program, excluding price revisions Organic F&D costs of $6.82 per BOE, excluding price revisions Invested capital of $371 million, of which JV partner BSP funded $96 million Drilled 110 wells with internally funded capital and 119 wells with BSP and MIRA funded capital Generated adjusted EBITDAX 1 of $761 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDAX margin 1 of 36%\n1 See Attachment 2 for explanations of how CRC calculates and uses the non–GAAP measures of adjusted EBITDAX, adjusted EBITDAX margin, PV-10, adjusted general and administrative expenses, free cash flow, production costs (excluding the effects of production sharing-type contracts (PSC)) and adjusted net loss, and for reconciliations of the foregoing to their nearest GAAP measure as applicable. VCI is calculated by dividing the net present value of the project's expected pre-tax cash flow over its life by the net present value of the related investments, each using a 10 percent discount rate.\nTodd Stevens, CRC's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"In 2017, we followed a strategic plan to focus on projects that offered the best value creation, to live within cash flow and to emphasize disciplined growth, and I am pleased to report that we delivered on all fronts. We replaced 119% of our production, despite a limited capital program. We leveraged our portfolio flexibility through JV partnerships to accelerate and de-risk our actionable inventory. As we have done every year since our inception, we continued to live within our cash flow, investing approximately $240 million of CRC development capital in 2017 with a VCI 1 of 1.7 or fully-burdened returns of 30%. In addition, we took steps to meaningfully strengthen our financial position with a new credit amendment that provides a clear runway and a path to further de-lever. In 2018, we expect to build upon this solid momentum as we extend our track record of disciplined execution into a mid-cycle commodity environment and capture the significant upside that lies ahead. By remaining dedicated to our strategy centered on optimizing CRC’s world-class resources, driving operational execution and strengthening our balance sheet, we expect to deliver meaningful value creation for our shareholders in 2018 and beyond.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the CRC net loss was $138 million, or $3.23 per diluted share, and the adjusted net loss 1 was $14 million or $0.33 per diluted share. The adjusted net loss 1 excluded $116 million of non-cash derivatives losses and a net $8 million charge for other unusual and infrequent items.\nTotal daily production volumes averaged 126,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day for the fourth quarter of 2017. Oil volumes averaged 80,000 barrels per day, NGL volumes averaged 16,000 barrels per day and gas volumes averaged 179,000 thousand cubic feet (MCF) per day. These results reflect approximately 1,300 BOE per day of negative PSC effects due to higher realized prices in the fourth quarter compared to expected prices, as well as a 700 BOE per day quarterly impact due to the California wildfires that occurred in December 2017.\nRealized crude oil prices, including the effect of settled hedges, increased by $11.44 per barrel to $56.92 per barrel from the prior year comparable period. Settled hedges decreased realized crude oil prices by $2.95 per barrel. Average realized NGL prices registered $44.03 per barrel and realized natural gas prices were $2.77 per MCF.\nProduction costs for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $227 million, or $19.64 per BOE, compared to $17.50 per BOE in the prior year comparable period. The industry practice for reporting PSCs can result in higher production costs per barrel as gross field operating costs are matched with net production. Excluding the PSC effects, per unit production costs 1 for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been $18.31. The increase in unit based production costs was driven by an increase in energy costs, a ramp-up of downhole maintenance activity in line with stronger commodity prices and lower production volumes, but was partially offset by a more efficient use of energy. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $68 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted general and administrative expenses 1 for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $67 million compared to $61 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase in adjusted G&A expenses 1 was a result of the timing of grants coupled with the higher costs of performance-based bonus and incentive compensation plans due to better than expected results.\nCRC reported taxes other than on income of $33 million and exploration expense of $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCapital investment in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $139 million, consisting of $125 million of internally funded capital and $14 million of BSP funded capital. Approximately $95 million was directed to drilling and capital workovers.\nCash provided by operating activities was $23 million.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nFor the full year of 2017, the CRC net loss was $266 million, or $6.26 per diluted share. The adjusted net loss 1 was $187 million, or $4.40 per diluted share, which excluded $78 million of non-cash derivative losses, $21 million of gains from asset divestitures, $4 million of net gains on early retirement of debt and a $26 million net charge from other unusual and infrequent items.\nTotal daily production volumes averaged 129,000 BOE per day for the full year of 2017. Oil volumes averaged 83,000 barrels per day, NGL volumes averaged 16,000 barrels per day, and gas volumes averaged 182,000 MCF per day.\nRealized crude oil prices, including the effect of settled hedges, increased $9.23 per barrel to $51.24 per barrel from $42.01 per barrel in 2016. Settled hedges decreased 2017 realized crude oil prices by $0.23 per barrel compared with a $2.29 per barrel increase in 2016. Realized NGL prices increased 60% to $35.76 from $22.39 per barrel in 2016. Realized natural gas prices increased 17% to $2.67 per MCF compared with $2.28 per MCF in 2016.\nProduction costs for the full year of 2017 were $876 million, or $18.64 per BOE. Per unit production costs, excluding the effect of PSCs 1 , were $17.48 per BOE. The increase in production costs of $76 million from the prior year was driven by an increase in energy costs and a ramp-up of downhole and surface maintenance activity in line with stronger commodity prices, but were partially offset by a more efficient use of energy. While higher natural gas prices increase CRC's production costs for power and steam generation, they result in a net benefit due to higher revenue generated from natural gas sales. G&A expenses were $259 million for the full year of 2017. Adjusted G&A expenses 1 for the full year of 2017 were $254 million compared to $228 million in 2016. The increase in adjusted G&A expenses 1 was a result of the timing of grants coupled with the higher costs of performance-based bonus and incentive compensation plans due to better than expected results.\nCRC reported taxes other than on income of $136 million and exploration expense of $22 million for the full year of 2017.\nCapital investment in 2017 totaled $371 million, consisting of $275 million of CRC internally funded capital and $96 million of BSP funded capital. Approximately $266 million was directed to drilling and capital workovers. The Company's MIRA joint venture funded an additional $58 million of investment.\nCash provided by operating activities for the full year of 2017 was $248 million. The Company was free cash flow 1 neutral after working capital and excluding capital that was funded by BSP.\nOperational Update\nCRC operated an average of nine rigs during the fourth quarter of 2017 and drilled 81 wells, including those drilled with BSP and MIRA capital, which consisted of 75 development wells (36 steamflood, 25 waterflood, 13 primary and one unconventional) and six exploration wells (five steamflood and one primary). Most of the drilling activity was directed toward steamfloods and waterfloods, which have different production profiles and longer response times than typical conventional wells. As a result, the full production contribution is not typically experienced in the same year that the well is drilled. In the San Joaquin basin, CRC operated seven rigs and produced approximately 88 MBOE per day for the fourth quarter. The Los Angeles basin had one rig directed toward waterflood projects, and contributed 26 MBOE per day of production in the fourth quarter of 2017. The impact of the production sharing agreements in Long Beach decreased production by 1,300 BOE per day in the fourth quarter due to fewer cost-recovery barrels as a result of higher oil prices than initially expected. The Ventura basin activity included one rig focused on conventional projects and produced approximately 6,000 BOE per day for the fourth quarter. The California wildfires negatively impacted production by approximately 2,200 BOE per day in December 2017 and production remained affected by approximately 1,200 BOE per day in January 2018 due to third party power and access issues related to the fires and subsequent mudslides. First quarter of 2018 production guidance reflects a 400 BOE per day reduction primarily due to these issues, a 600 BOE per day impact for PSC effects, as well as other factors. CRC had no development drilling activity in the Sacramento basin and continues to focus on oil weighted projects.\nBalance Sheet Strengthening Update\nDuring February 2018, CRC entered into a midstream joint venture with an affiliate of Ares Management, L.P. For more details on the transaction, please see CRC's press release and Form 8-K dated February 7, 2018.\nYear-End 2017 Reserves and PV-10 Value 1\nCRC's proved reserves totaled 618 MMBOE as of the end of 2017, up from 568 MMBOE at year-end 2016. Excluding positive price revisions, the Company organically replaced 119% of proved reserves. This strong reserve replacement ratio (RRR)** was achieved with a limited, well executed capital program for the year, in addition to positive performance revisions primarily in Huntington Beach and Buena Vista Area. A total of approximately 34 MMBOE of additions were related to extensions and discoveries in several CRC fields and another 22 MMBOE was added through positive performance revisions. All-in 2017 Finding and Development (F&D) costs were $3.94 per BOE in 2017, including price revisions. Organic F&D costs were $6.82 per BOE in 2017, which exclude price revisions.\nSummary of Changes in Proved Reserves Based on the SEC Price Deck* (Million BOE)\nBalance at December 31, 2016 568 Revisions Related to Performance 22 Extensions and Discoveries 34 Sales (8 ) Revisions Related to Price 49 Production (47 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 618 2017 Organic Finding and Development Cost** $ 6.82 *Calculated using the first-day-of-the-month twelve-month average Brent oil price of $54.42 per barrel and NYMEX natural gas price of $2.98 per Million British Thermal Units (MMBTU), before adjustments for gravity, quality and transportation costs, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations.\n** See calculation of RRR and F&D on Attachment 3.\nThe present value of CRC's proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $4.5 billion on a pre-tax basis, discounted at 10% (PV-10 1 ).\n2018 Capital Budget\nWith stronger expected cash flows, CRC estimates its 2018 capital program will range from $425 million to $450 million, which includes approximately $100 to $150 million in JV capital. CRC's 2018 capital program may grow further through the use of cash on the balance sheet, additional tranches from existing JVs as well as potential new JVs. CRC’s direct investment level will be largely directed to waterflood and steamflood investments which will drive enhanced production into 2019.\nCredit Facility Amendment\nCRC entered into its seventh amendment of the 2014 Credit Facility in November 2017. This amendment received unanimous approval from all 29 lenders and financial institutions and became effective after the closing of a new $1.3 billion first lien secured term loan facility (“2017 Term Loan”). Net proceeds were used to pay the $559 million remaining balance of the 2014 Term Loan, reduce the balance of the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and pay accrued interest. The amendment extended the maturity date of the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility to June 30, 2021 and modified some of its covenants. Subsequent to the amendment, CRC was able to eliminate the springing maturity features related to the 5% notes due January 15, 2020 and the 5 ½% notes due September 15, 2021 by buying back $65 million of principal of the 5% Notes and $35 million in principal of the 5 ½% Notes. For more details on the amendment, please see the Company's Form 8-K disclosure dated November 17, 2017.\nConference Call Details\nTo participate in today’s conference call scheduled for 5:00 P.M.

Therefore, management uses measures called adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted general and administrative expenses, both which exclude those items. These measures are not meant to disassociate items from management's performance, but rather are meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing our performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted general and administrative expenses are not considered to be alternatives to net income (loss) or general and administrative expenses, respectively, reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We define adjusted EBITDAX as earnings before interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; exploration expense; other unusual, out-of-period and infrequent items and other non-cash items. We believe adjusted EBITDAX provides useful information in assessing our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and is widely used by the industry, the investment community and our lenders. While adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure, the amounts included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure is a material component of certain of our financial covenants under our 2014 revolving credit facility and is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance, such as our cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. Adjusted EBITDAX should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

PV-10 differs from Standardized Measure because Standardized Measure includes the effects of future income taxes on future net cash flows. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure should be construed as the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. Standard Measure is prescribed by the SEC as an industry standard asset value measure to compare reserves with consistent pricing, costs and discount assumptions. PV-10 facilitates the comparisons to other companies as it is not dependent on the tax-paying status of the entity. Attachment 3 Organic Reserve Replacement Ratio (1)\n2017 Organic proved reserves added - MMBOE Extensions and discoveries 34 Revisions related to performance 22 Total (A)\n56 Production in 2017 - MMBOE (B) 47 Organic reserve replacement ratio (A)/(B) 119 % (1) The organic reserve replacement ratio is calculated for a specified period using the proved oil-equivalent additions from extensions and discoveries and performance-related revisions, divided by oil-equivalent production. There is no guarantee that historical sources of reserves additions will continue as many factors fully or partially outside management's control, including commodity prices, availability of capital and the underlying geology, affect reserves additions. Management uses this measure to gauge the results of its capital program. Other oil and gas producers may use different methods to calculate replacement ratios, which may affect comparability. Finding and Development Costs (2)\n2017 Costs incurred - in millions (A) $ 382 Organic proved reserves added - MMBOE (B) 56 Organic finding and development costs - $/BOE (A)/(B) $ 6.82 (3) Proved reserves added including price related revisions, net - MMBOE (C) 97 All in finding and development costs - $/BOE (A)/(C) $ 3.94 (4) (2) We believe that reporting our finding and development costs can aid investors in their evaluation of our ability to add proved reserves at a reasonable cost but is not a substitute for required GAAP disclosures. Various factors, primarily timing differences and effects of commodity price changes, can cause finding and development costs associated with a particular period's reserves additions to be imprecise. For example, we will need to make more investments in order to develop the proved undeveloped reserves added during the year and any future revisions may change the actual measure from that presented above. In addition, part of the 2017 costs were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves from prior years to proved developed reserves. In our calculations, we have not estimated future costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves added in 2017 or removed costs related to proved undeveloped reserves added in prior periods. Our calculations of finding and development costs may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. (3) We calculate organic finding and development costs by dividing the costs incurred for the year from the capital program (including development, exploration costs and asset retirement obligations) by the amount of oil-equivalent proved reserves added in the same year from extensions and discoveries and performance-related revisions. (4) We calculate all-in finding and development costs by dividing the costs incurred for the year from the capital program (including development, exploration costs and asset retirement obligations) by the amount of oil-equivalent proved reserves added in the same year from extensions and discoveries, performance-related revisions and price-related revisions less the amount of oil-equivalent proved reserves sold in the same year.
