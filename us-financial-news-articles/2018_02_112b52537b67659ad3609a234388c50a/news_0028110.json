Job cuts could prove hard for banks given the trust they have lost in recent scandals, according to Julia Angrisano, national secretary of the Australian Finance Sector Union.\n“Rather than going through this stage with a sledge-hammer to shed tens of thousand of jobs, we think that this is an opportunity for banks to deal with disruption in the right way, re-skilling and re-training their workforce,” Angrisano said.\nNAB last year said it would cut 6,000 jobs over the next three years in a bid to save A$1 billion by 2020 through automating processes while also creating 2,000 new staff positions over the same period.\nBranches are a key focus for cost-sensitive executives as more people bank online.\n“It’s likely we will see branch layouts, sizes and experiences evolve, but they continue to play a pivotal role in the experience our customers have,” NAB’s chief operating officer, Antony Cahill, said in an email to Reuters.\nA spokeswoman for Westpac said the bank believed staffing numbers would fall, but that it was taking a gradual approach. ANZ representatives did not respond to emailed questions about staff cuts. A spokesman for CBA declined to comment beyond Narev’s remarks last week.\n($1 = 1.2849 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Paulina Duran in SYDNEY.
