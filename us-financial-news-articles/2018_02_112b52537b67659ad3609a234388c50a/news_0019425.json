For the quarter ended December 30, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $(52,000), or $(0.03) per share, on revenue of $1,117,000, compared to a net loss of $(695,000), or $(0.38) per share, on revenue of $632,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nCommenting on corporate performance, Carl H. Guild, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of TCC, said, \"During the Company’s first quarter ended December 30, 2017, our financial performance improved significantly but did not achieve the profitability we are targeting for fiscal 2018. The Company continues to work to capture several significant international orders, which are progressing, albeit more slowly than expected. We anticipate additional orders in our voice encryption product line in support of continuing U.S. government activities in Afghanistan during the remainder of fiscal 2018, but the timing is unpredictable. Our new HSE6000 SEAL radio encryption system is participating in field operational testing currently scheduled to conclude by June. The SEAL is designed specifically for multi-user, joint operations in the air, land and sea battle zones.\n\"TCC is committed to returning to profitability in fiscal 2018. We continue to closely monitor and reduce operating expenses as appropriate, while strategically investing in business development efforts, developing productive relationships and expanding our sales channel network.\"\nAbout Technical Communications Corporation\nFor over 50 years, TCC has specialized in superior-grade secure communications systems and customized solutions, supporting our CipherONE ® best-in-class criteria, to protect highly sensitive voice, data and video transmitted over a wide range of networks.
