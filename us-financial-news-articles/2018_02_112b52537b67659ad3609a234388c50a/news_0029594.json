Macquarie declined to comment.\nPetrobras has committed to a $21 billion two-year divestment plan to reduce its debt, which at $91 billion is the largest among oil majors, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nFILE PHOTO: Aerial view of state oil company Petrobras' Urucu oil and natural gas plant in Brazil's Amazon jungle, located some 650 km (404 Miles) from the Amazonas state capital of Manaus, Brazil December 6, 2004. REUTERS/Jamil Bittar/File photo TAG owns 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) of pipelines in northeast Brazil.\nTo comply with Brazil’s audit court rules, Petrobras may choose up to two of the three bidders for a final round if the leading proposals are very close in value or choose a winner immediately, the sources added.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of state-run oil company Petrobras is pictured in the company headquarters in Vitoria, Espirito Santo, Brazil, February 10, 2017. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File photo The consortia may not change their components before the final bidding round, according to the sources.\nMacquarie, the world’s largest manager of infrastructure funds, has partnered with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, known as CPPIB, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd and two Brazilian investment firms.\nMubadala has partnered with EIG Global Energy Partners LLC. It is unclear whether French energy firm Engie has partners.\nBanks have been eager to finance the bids, one of the sources added, considering Brazilian interest rates at record lows and the very stable nature of the gas pipeline network.\nBanks are also optimistic on growth prospects after first results obtained by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc, leader of a group that paid $5.2 billion last year for another gas pipeline unit sold by Petrobras, Nova Transportadora do Sudeste (NTS).\nAccording to financial statements submitted by one of NTS’s shareholders, the company had net income of 1.3 billion reais during the first nine months of 2017.\nEditing by Daniel Flynn and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T09:30:01.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
