That ensures Deutsche Bank can keep control even if its shareholding falls below the 75 percent usually needed to dominate German stock corporations, possibly as part of a merger of the unit with a peer.\n“We want to unlock the full potential of Deutsche AM to facilitate growth,” unit head Nicolas Moreau has said, and earlier this month said that it is making progress preparing for the offering.\nThe listing is expected to help the unit attract and retain talent by awarding bonus shares to staff. It will also enable the unit to use its shares to fund acquisitions.\nThe business is looking for ways to strengthen its so-called alternative products offerings, especially in areas such as structured credit and real estate asset management. It also want to bolster its distribution network and expand in countries such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.\nDeutsche Asset Management had 3,800 staff managing 700 billion euros invested worldwide at the end of 2017. The unit’s adjusted pretax earnings rose 5 percent to 747 million euros last year.\nEditing by Maria Sheahan, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:37:40.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
