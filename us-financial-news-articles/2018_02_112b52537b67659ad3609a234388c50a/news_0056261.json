Many of those changes take effect for 2018, which means that the 2017 tax year will be the last in which filers will submit their documents under the old law.\n\"There are overlooked deductions that are going away, including unreimbursed employee expenses and job-search expenses,\" said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA with TurboTax.\nshow chapters Intuit CEO talks tax season 10:55 AM ET Fri, 23 Feb 2018 | 03:57 To make things more interesting, Congress also recently extended for 2017 the availability of certain tax breaks that would have otherwise expired at the end of 2016.\nHere are the deductions and credits you should consider taking before you file your taxes.\nExclusion for forgiven debt Generally, if a lender cancels all or part of your debt, that amount is considered to be income.\nHere's an exception: Filers who had a loan modification, foreclosure or short sale last year can exclude the amount of debt forgiven on their principal residence from gross income in 2017. This break, which would have expired, was among the \"tax extenders\" Congress recently approved.\nMortgage insurance premiums This break, which allows homeowners to deduct the amount they've paid for mortgage insurance, was set to expire at the end of 2016. Congress renewed it retroactively for 2017 tax returns.\nDaniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images A 'For Sale' sign stands in a vacant lot near new homes in Dunlap, Illinois. Borrowers who itemize their deductions on Schedule A may apply.\nDeduction for qualified tuition costs Here's another break that's back, thanks to the tax extenders. If you or your child are in college, you may be able to deduct tuition, books and supplies for your studies by up to $4,000 .\nRoom and board, along with other personal expenses, do not qualify for this break.\nAlternatively, you may take one of the education credits for your costs: the American opportunity tax credit , which is worth up to $2,500 per eligible student, or the lifetime learning credit , which is worth up to $2,000 per tax return.\nBe aware that you can't claim an education credit and the tuition deduction for the same expenses.\nEnergy efficiency incentives Finally, Congress extended access to credits for energy-saving home improvements.\nThe credit for \"nonbusiness energy property\" is for homeowners who added certain efficient windows, doors and insulation . It's subject to a lifetime limit of $500.\nTim Pannell | Mint Images RF | Getty Images The \"residential energy property credit\" is also around for the 2017 tax year. It applies to homeowners' purchase of qualified solar water heaters, geothermal heat pumps and other alternative energy equipment.\nFilers should know that the IRS is still updating its systems to process returns claiming these energy-efficiency credits and certain other \"tax extenders.\"\nAt the moment, the agency is ready to handle returns that have claimed the extended breaks for mortgage insurance, discharged residence debt and qualified tuition.\nProperty taxes Did you know that you can deduct property taxes on all of the homes you own — and not just your principal residence?\nBe aware: This break is due for some major changes. Starting in 2018, the deductibility of property taxes will be subject to the new $10,000 cap on state and local taxes or SALT.\nOwners of multiple homes will feel the limitation on this tax break keenly.\n\"That $10,000 cap is per taxpayer,\" said Greene-Lewis — not per home. \"The 2017 tax year is the last year you can claim full value of property taxes.\"\nTax prep, investment fees and more Going, going, gone.\nThis is the last year you can take miscellaneous itemized deductions , including those for tax preparation and investment fees and unreimbursed employee expenses. You can deduct these costs to the extent they exceed more than 2 percent of your adjusted gross income.\nGetty Images Georgina Gracia-Leacock, tax preparer and office manager, speaks with Orren Hercules as he arrives to prepare his taxes at an H&R Block office in Brooklyn, New York. This tax break is on its way out.\nCasualty losses Here's another casualty of the tax overhaul: This year is the last time you can claim a deduction for personal losses that you sustained in a given year due to an event such as a natural disaster, fire or accident.\nThe total amount of your losses on personal property must exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income.\nStarting in 2018, however, you can claim a loss only if it occurs in a disaster that's declared by the president. This provision expires after 2025.\nWhat tax pros say you should do before heading their way\nFive ways people try to cheat on their taxes\nWhy your big tax refund isn't always good news", "external_links": ["https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/nonbusiness-energy-property-credit-section-25c-at-a-glance", "https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/form-982-reduction-of-tax-attributes-due-to-discharge-of-indebtedness-and-section-1082-basis-adjustment", "https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/llc", "https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1892/text?q={", "https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-benefits-for-education-information-center", "https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1", "https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/three-popular-tax-benefits-retroactively-renewed-for-2017-irs-ready-to-accept-returns-claiming-these-benefits-e-file-for-fastest-refunds", "https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/residential-energy-efficient-property-credit-section-25d-at-a-glance", "https://www.irs.gov/publications/p529/ar02.html#en_US_2016_publink100026974", "https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/aotc", "https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sca.pdf"], "published": "2018-02-26T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T15:42:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
