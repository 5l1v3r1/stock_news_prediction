Things are all over the place. The market is trying to find a bottom to this madness,” said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group.\n“Now we are having acute attention on what happens in the bond markets, so when yields move up there is an unsettling feeling in the equity market.”\nThe market’s main gauge of volatility, the CBOE Volatility Index, fell to 29.82 on Thursday, more than twice what it was a week ago but down off a two-and-a-half year high above 50 points hit on Tuesday.\nInvestors are still weighing whether the sharp swings this week are the start of a deeper correction or just a temporary bump in the nine-year bull market, spurred by concerns over rising interest rates and bond yields.\nBy 12:24 p.m. ET (1724 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 499.18 points, or 2.01 percent, at 24,394.17, the S&P 500 was down 44.5 points, or 1.65 percent, at 2,637.16.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was down 129.01 points, or 1.83 percent, at 6,922.98.\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the financial, consumer discretionary and industrials leading the decliners.\nBoeing was down 3 percent and Home Depot fell 3.2 percent, weighing the most on the Dow, while JPMorgan was among the top drags on the S&P.
