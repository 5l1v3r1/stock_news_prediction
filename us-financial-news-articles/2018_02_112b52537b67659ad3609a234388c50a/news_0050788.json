Flour mills are transforming, switching to special flour as diets change,” he told Reuters.\n“China will not export high-protein wheat, but higher (domestic) output will take care of some of its own demand which is (typically) met through imports,” the Singapore trader said.\nChina is the world’s top consumer, producer and importer of wheat. It grows several types of high-protein wheat, including Shiluan 02-1 which is deemed similar to U.S. hard red spring wheat, known worldwide for its quality.\nTighter supplies last year of high-protein wheat lifted Minneapolis Grain Exchange prices to a three-year peak in July.\nThe market has since eased after U.S. and Canadian spring crops made it through scorching growing seasons in better condition than expected, but top quality supplies remain tight in key exporting nations.\nStill, even with reduced demand from China there will be Asian imports of high-protein U.S. and Canadian spring wheat, according to trade sources.\n“Some mills use Canadian or U.S. wheat for some special types of flour, which they will continue to buy,” said one trader.\nChina’s overall wheat imports are forecast to be about 4 million tonnes in 2017/18, compared with 4.41 million tonnes a year ago, according to the USDA.\nAustralia’s main wheat crop is harvested in November-December, while China has two crops - the winter wheat crop, which is gathered in May-June, and the spring crop that is harvested in August-September.\nReporting by Naveen Thukral and Hallie Gu Editing by Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:49:50.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
