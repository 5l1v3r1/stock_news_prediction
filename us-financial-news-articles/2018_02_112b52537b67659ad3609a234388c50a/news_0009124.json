He is very well-respected as an economist in addition to being a central banker. Moreover, Ireland has not had that position (before).\"\nLane has been governor of the Irish central bank since November 2015, when Ireland was trying to recover from its sovereign debt crisis.\nHowever, there's long been speculation that Spain's De Guindos could take the position in Frankfurt, Germany. He has previously run for other European seats, but withdrew from running a second time for the Eurogroup presidency at the end of last year. This was seen as a signal that he is seeking the ECB vice president role.\n\"Constancio has been on the board for 7.5 years and has proved to be one of the intellectual forces within the ECB.\" -Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank \"Spain has not been represented on the six-member Executive Board of the ECB since Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo ended his eight-year term of office in May 2012,\" Michael Schubert, senior economist at Commerzbank, said in a note.\n\"Spain's government representatives have therefore repeatedly called for a Spaniard to take over from the current ECB vice president Constancio.\"\nHowever, some members of the European Parliament, which also has a say on ECB appointments, are reticent in appointing a former minister given that the ECB needs to keep its independence from politics.\n\"Constancio has been on the board for 7.5 years and has proved to be one of the intellectual forces within the ECB. Strong communication skills (as he/she needs to attend the regular press conferences) are key,\" Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank told CNBC via email.\nHe added that despite lacking a central banking background, de Guindos is the most likely choice.\nWhy does this vote matter?

With such appointments, European policymakers try to distribute several seats across different member states .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T16:43:54.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
