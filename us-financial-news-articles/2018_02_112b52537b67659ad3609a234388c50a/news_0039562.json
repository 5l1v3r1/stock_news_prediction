But he did”.\nWithin three months of his meeting in slippers, Yun was on the national team. Now he has gold in his sights.\n“He has loved Ironman since he was young, he’s his role model,” Kim Joon-ho, a childhood friend of Yun‘s, said as he watched the heats on Thursday.\n“He’s called Ironman because he’s so fast.”\nAdditional reporting by Jane Chung; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:57:04.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
