China has lodged “stern representations” with the United States over the sanctions, whose targets include a Taiwan passport holder, as well as shipping and energy firms in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. China “demands the U.S. side immediately stops such relevant mistaken actions to avoid harming bilateral cooperation in the relevant area”, the ministry said in a short statement.
