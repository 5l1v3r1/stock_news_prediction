Lubbers always denied the accusations and resigned from the post two years later.\nBorn in Rotterdam on May 7, 1939, Lubbers became a successful manager in the family engineering firm. That role drew him into an employers’ association and ultimately national politics.\nHe served four years as economics minister in a center-left coalition from 1973 and later as parliamentary spokesman for the Christian Democrats.\nHe gained an unexpected reputation as a crime-fighter when, in 1986, he twice chased and caught thieves trying to break into his wife’s car. In the late 1980s, an assailant leaped into his car with a knife. Lubbers, unharmed, shoved him out of the door.\nHe was a practicing Roman Catholic, but that did not stop him from telling then Pope John Paul during a 1985 visit to the Netherlands that many Dutch Catholics found his conservatism threatening.\nFluent in English, French and German, Lubber had three children with his wife Ria.\nReporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T19:19:01.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
