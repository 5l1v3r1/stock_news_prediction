(NASDAQ: BGCP) (\"BGC Partners\" or \"BGC\"), a leading global brokerage company servicing the financial and real estate markets, and its publicly traded subsidiary Newmark Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: NMRK) (\"Newmark\"), today updated the details regarding their fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference calls.\nBGC and Newmark have decided to coordinate the timing of their financial results press releases for the benefit of both companies' investors. This is because BGC consolidates Newmark's results as its \"Real Estate Services\" segment, which will make up a substantial portion of BGC's consolidated revenues and earnings. Both companies therefore believe that their financial results should be made public at the same time. This simultaneous release will enable all investors and analysts to have all relevant information readily available at the same time. Newmark and BGC expect to maintain this practice until the completion of the proposed spin-off. 1 The change in schedule is purely for the convenience of investors.\nBGC and Newmark are now both expected to issue advisory press releases regarding the availability of their quarterly and full year financial results before 8:00 a.m. ET on Friday, February 9, 2018.

Details of both calls and the related press releases are provided later in this document.\nPreliminary Revenues for the Fourth Quarter\nBGC's consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 will be above the high-end of the range of its previously stated guidance. Newmark generated over 50 percent of the consolidated company's revenues.\nBGC Earnings Conference Call Details\nBGC Partners plans to issue an advisory press release regarding the availability of its consolidated quarterly and full year financial results by 8:00 a.m. ET on Friday, February 9, 2018.
