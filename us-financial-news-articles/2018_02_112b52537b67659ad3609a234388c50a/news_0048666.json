About 57% said as much, versus 28% who thought it to be a reflection of inadequate gun control laws. \nMeanwhile, some 51% said armed teachers could have helped prevent the Parkland shooting, against 42% that leaned the other way. Schools across the country have been considering whether or not to arm some educators as a way to protect against mass shootings. An Eastern Ohio school board agreed to arm some members of staff in the hopes of boosting security, the Ohio Dispatch reported . \nAt the same time that Florida students are pleading Congressional leaders to implement more gun control , a seventh grader in Jackson Township, Ohio was found injured by a self-inflicted gunshot wound early Tuesday . Authorities are still unclear as to whether the incident was an accident, and no others have been reported injured.
