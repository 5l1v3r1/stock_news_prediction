Rumours that German giants could consider similar deals are definitely food for thought after the arguably successful spin-off of Ferrari from Fiat Chrysler two years ago. The only thing seriously keeping Barclays' enthusiasm in check (they are neutral on the sector) is the fact it could take some time given the complexity of the process in Germany. \"This is not to say that we don't believe structural changes will happen, just that we urge investors not to base investment decisions on expectations of a quick turnaround,\" Barclays cautions. Here are a couple of recent headlines: Continental still has no concrete plans for potential break-up Daimler open to alliances, partial listing of mobility services And here is a Ferrari: (Julien Ponthus) CAUTION IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY (0927 GMT) There's been a lot of talk about how volatility-linked products may have contributed to the correction seen earlier this week, and Hermes Investment Management is urging investors to remain cautious about leveraging positions too far. “Gearing is fine as long as implied volatility remains low, but given we anticipate further shocks with sharp surges in volatility, those same investors will be forced to cut their positions, leading to self-reinforcing position shedding,\" Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes Investment Management, says in a note. Murray also notes that their correlation surprise indicator hit a new high during the last quarter, adding that investors should be wary about making assumptions as to cross-asset relationships. \"Traditional methods of portfolio diversification that rely principally upon historical measures of correlation have become less effective,\" Hermes' Murray says. (Kit Rees) Opening snapshot: financials help limit STOXX losses (0812 GMT) European shares are down in early dealing, with commodity stocks leading losers but M&A newsflow in the insurance sector and well-received results from some banks are boosting the financial sector, helping limit the STOXX decline to 0.3 percent. The UK's FTSE is down 0.3 percent ahead of the Bank of England policy meeting. Telecoms are also in the spotlight with TDC up 20 percent after the Danish telecoms operator turned down an indicative takeover bid from Australia's Macquarie and three pension funds. Here's your snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) WHAT'S ON THE RADAR FOR THE EUROPEAN OPEN (0748 GMT) European shares’ recovery rally looks set for an abrupt ending on Thursday with futures pointing to losses of 0.7 to 0.9 percent after weaker trading on Wall Street and in Asia. Earnings, which took a back seat earlier this week amid the global market turmoil, are coming in thick and fast with several big European banks and industrial firms reporting. Societe Generale and Commerzbank both reported declining profits, blaming weak markets and restructuring, while Italy's UniCredit swung to a profit in 2017. Oil major Total, whose shares fell sharply this week as crude prices tumbled, reported soaring profit, raising its dividend and planning a share buyback. And as we detailed just now, some surprising M&A news should liven up the insurance sector. (Helen Reid) M&A NEWSFLOW PUTS INSURERS IN FOCUS (0743 GMT) Insurance stocks are definitely on the watchlist with some interesting M&A newsflow that could liven up the session with Swiss Re set to lead the dance after surprise news that Japan's SoftBank is in talks to buy a minority stake in the Swiss reinsurer. \"Yesterday’s announcement is totally surprising,\" says Baader Bank Helvea analyst Daniel Bischof. \"However, given SoftBank’s technology-vision, Swiss Re makes sense as a target given its extraordinary research & development capabilities which distinguish Swiss Re from competition and make the company a knowledge powerhouse,\" he added. Swiss Re shares are seen up 5 percent following the news. The deal is reported to be worth 10 billion or more. Still in the sector, a source-based Bloomberg report said yesterday that Bermuda-based insurer XL Group attracting interest from rivals including Allianz SE of Germany. goo.gl/XHHosw And there are also some earnings updates. Zurich Insurance reported better-than-expected earnings as the insurer dealt with a raft of natural catastrophe losses and a sluggish investment environment.

Results from UK companies including Thomas Cook, TalkTalk, DFS Furniture, and Sophos, are just hitting the wire. M&A activity could also liven up today's session with Swiss Re's shares seen opening up 5 percent after the reinsurer said it was in talks with SoftBank on a potential minority stake. (Helen Reid) EARNINGS, BANK OF ENGLAND IN FOCUS (0644 GMT) Nevertheless there are other events in Europe today which should grab investors' attention, with results still rolling in from big corporate players. Banks are at the forefront today with Societe Generale reporting forecast-beating results despite quarterly profit plunging on tax-related and restructuring costs. Commerzbank also flagged a 51 percent decline in Q4 profit, blaming weak markets and its overhaul. Other notable results include truck maker Volvo, which reported record profit, and Swiss engineering group ABB, which gave a brighter outlook for the year. We'll also be closely watching the Bank of England's rate decision and inflation report - particularly considering the past week's jitters over inflation. SocGen analysts expect the BoE to slightly raise growth and inflation forecasts. \"The MPC will be happy to see that the money market is now taking seriously its message of further tightening,\" they write. \"However the market has brought forward the expected timing of rate increases compared to its view three months ago quite aggressively, and even though we expect the tone of the report to be slightly more hawkish, we think it might not be enough to validate the current Overnight Index Swap curve.\" (Helen Reid)", "external_links": ["https://goo.gl/XHHosw"], "published": "2018-02-08T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:56:13.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
