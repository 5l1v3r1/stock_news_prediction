Falk, MD, to the firm’s Physician Advisory Council.\nA practicing anesthesiologist and critical care physician, Dr. Falk serves as Director of Performance Improvement, Quality and Safety at Penn Medicine (University of Pennsylvania). He is also an Associate Professor of Clinical Anesthesiology and Critical Care at the University of Pennsylvania. He brings a wealth of experience, including past positions as post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and surgical intensive care unit (SICU) medical director, and years of experience improving healthcare value and outcomes.\n“Our Physician Advisory Council uniquely enables us to foster alignment between physicians and hospital leaders with insights from practicing clinicians,” said Lumere CEO Hani Elias, JD, MPH. “With Dr. Falk’s background, we’re now able to provide even more in-depth guidance to our clients as they tackle issues related to device and drug selection for anesthesiology and critical care, two areas that offer significant opportunities.”\nAccording to Dr. Falk, he’s eager to help Lumere’s clients optimize patient care. “Healthcare costs have been spiraling out of control for a number of years, partly due to the vast array of devices and therapies we have to choose from,” he said. “However, the reality is that patient outcomes have not improved at the same pace. Lumere allows physicians to work with their hospitals to refocus on providing the right solutions and making the best decisions about patient care.”\nDr. Falk joined the faculty of Penn Medicine in 2006. He received his medical degree from The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences and completed his fellowship with the Clinical Clinic Foundation.\nAbout Lumere\nLumere is at the forefront of clinical decision making for drugs and devices, offering evidence-based solutions and services for all providers that improve care and reduce cost across the patient journey.
