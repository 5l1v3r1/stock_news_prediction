Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier on Friday Moscow wanted guarantees that rebel fighters will not shoot at Damascus residential areas.\nA resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain or France. Russia has cast 11 vetoes on possible Security Council action on Syria since its civil war began in 2011.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:14:33.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
