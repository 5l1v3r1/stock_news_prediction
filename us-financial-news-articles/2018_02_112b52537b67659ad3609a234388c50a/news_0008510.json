An army officer who spotted the assailant hit him with his vehicle, but the Palestinian escaped and troops launched a search, the military said. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli had died of his wounds, making the announcement at a weekly meeting of legislators from his right-wing Likud party. \nTensions have risen in the West Bank since U.S. President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Dec. 6, breaking with decades of U.S. policy that the cityâ€™s status must be decided in peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. \nEast Jerusalem was captured by Israel in a 1967 war, and Palestinians want it for the capital of a future state. Israel considers all of Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital, a claim that is not recognised internationally.
