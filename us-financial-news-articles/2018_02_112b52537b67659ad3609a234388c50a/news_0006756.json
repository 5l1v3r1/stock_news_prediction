This is the point that is to be reached. We are now working for this,” he told reporters in Istanbul.\nErdogan is due to see the pope on Monday in what will be the first visit to the Vatican by a Turkish president in 59 years.\nThe two men are also expected to discuss the situation in Syria and Iraq as well as humanitarian aid and refugees.\nTurkey last month sent troops into neighboring Syria to attack Kurdish YPG fighters near its southern border. Turkey sees the militia as a terrorist group and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), and has shrugged off criticism at home and abroad over the operation.\nDemonstrations are expected in Rome to mark Erdogan’s visit and some 3,500 police and security forces will be on duty. In an interview with La Stampa newspaper, Erdogan dismissed the likely protests.\n“I don’t speak to people who support terrorism. I only speak to those who fight it,” he was Quote: d as saying.\nThe Turkish leader is also due to meet Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni on Monday, as well as local business leaders.\n“You are only 11th when it comes to the number of foreign companies active in Turkey, we need to improve that,” he told La Stampa.\nAdditional reporting by Daren Butler in Istanbul; Writing by Crispian Balmer; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T21:48:21.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
