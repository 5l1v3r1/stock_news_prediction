The price of the benchmark 10-year JGB futures gained 0.05 point to 150.68.\nThe market was supported by Bank of Japan’s bond-buying programme as it purchased more than 7 trillion yen ($65.8 billion) of JGBs every month.\nThe BOJ bought a total of 1.03 trillion yen JGBs on Thursday, maintaining the amount of its purchase in three categories based on maturity, over one- to three-years, three- to five-years and five- to 10-years.\nIts buying in 5-10 year bonds attracted selling of 1.3328 trillion yen, less than two previous operations in the same maturities, highlighting limited selling interests.\nThe 20-year yield was flat at 0.560 percent, while the 30-year yield ticked up 0.5 basis point to 0.790 percent, after hitting a three-month low of 0.785 percent on Wednesday.\nThe five-year yield was steady at minus 0.095 percent .\n$1 = 106.46 yen Reporting by Tokyo Markets Team; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T10:27:44.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
