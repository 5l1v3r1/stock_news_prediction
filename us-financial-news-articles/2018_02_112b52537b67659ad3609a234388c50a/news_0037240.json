A person familiar with the matter said the payment would be close to $1.5 billion.\nReporting by Michael Shields, editing by John Revill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T10:31:57.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
