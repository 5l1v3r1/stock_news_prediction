When he tried to stop the referee from allowing the kick at goal - we can’t have that in the game,” he said. \n“That’s borrowed from another sport and I really hope World Rugby doesn’t allow that to creep into the game because it shouldn’t be part of the game. ”All we say is just to be respectful. At times players lose their cool, but that was a contrived bit of behaviour,” said Jones. \n“It’s not great for the game and I’ve said something to World Rugby about it, I feel that strongly. ”We’ve got to respect the integrity of the referee in the game because we’ve got one of the most difficult games to referee. And the game only gets more complex. \n”It doesn’t get any easier. There’s more density around the ball. The players are bigger, faster and stronger. There’s quicker decisions from the referee to make.” \nBoth England and Wales made winning starts last weekend to their respective Six Nations campaigns.
