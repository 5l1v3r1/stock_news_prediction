This is the fourth time the healthcare communications company has been recognized for this award. This thirteenth annual program was created by the Hartford Business Journal and Best Companies Group.\n“Maintaining a positive company culture is a priority at Clarity,” said Amy Dickman, Director of Human Resources, Clarity Software Solutions, Inc. “In fact, it’s one of the five core values that drive our business every day. We’re proud to be recognized as one of the Best Places to Work and strive to make Clarity a place where our team wants to be.”\nThis survey and awards program was designed to identify, recognize, and honor the best employers in Connecticut, benefiting the state's economy, workforce, and businesses. The list is made up of 45 companies split into two categories: 27 small/medium-sized companies (15-199 US employees) and 18 large-sized companies (200 or more US employees). Clarity has been named one of this year’s Best Places to Work in Connecticut in the small/medium category.\nTo be considered for participation, companies had to fulfill the following eligibility requirements:\n- Be a for-profit, not-for-profit business or government entity;\n- Be a publicly or privately held business;\n- Have a facility in Connecticut;\n- Have at least 15 employees in Connecticut;\n- Be in business a minimum of 1 year.\nCompanies from across the state entered the two-part survey process to determine the Best Places to Work in Connecticut. The first part consisted of evaluating each company's workplace policies, practices, philosophy, systems, and demographics. The second part consisted of an employee survey to measure the employee experience. The combined scores determined the top companies and the final ranking. Best Companies Group managed the overall registration and survey process in Connecticut, analyzed the data, and determined the final rankings.\nThe ranked companies will be recognized at a special awards ceremony in February, and the actual rankings will be published in the March issue of the Hartford Business Journal .\nFor more information on the Best Places to Work in Connecticut program, visit www.BestPlacestoWorkinCT.com .\nAbout Clarity Software Solutions, Inc.\nClarity Software Solutions, Inc. provides technology driving healthcare engagement through multimodal communications.
