Even then, SPD grassroots members will still need to vote on any deal.\n“It’s not yet possible to say how long it will last - we did good groundwork yesterday but there are still important issues that need to be resolved,” Merkel, in office for 12 years, said before heading into negotiations at the SPD headquarters.\nAsked on ARD television if the negotiations could still fail, senior conservative Reiner Haseloff said: “I don’t think so. I hope not. I can’t think of any topic that is insurmountable.”\nThe parties agreed on Sunday to invest more than two billion euros in social housing by 2021, to spend up to 12 billion euros on expanding broadband and to channel 33 billion euros to municipalities for various projects including childcare.\nThey have also ticked off migration, energy and agriculture in recent days too but the most contentious issues - labour rules and healthcare have yet to be resolved.\nAs he arrived for talks, SPD leader Martin Schulz said the sides had edged closer on many issues but remained at odds over an SPD demand to abolish fixed-term employment contracts and its call to replace Germany’s dual public-private healthcare system with one insurance system for all.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) arrives for coalition talks at the Social Democratic Party (SPD) headquarters in Berlin, Germany, February 4, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt HEALTH AND LABOUR Healthcare and labour policy are crucial for the SPD as it tries to convince its 443,000 members - many of whom oppose forming another awkward partnership with Merkel after their party suffered its worst postwar result in September’s election.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) makes a statement before the coalition talks at the Social Democratic Party (SPD) headquarters in Berlin, Germany, February 4, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt “I think agreements are possible but they still haven’t been reached,” Schulz said. “Ultimately it’s necessary to take the time you need to create a stable foundation for a stable government.”\nThe conservatives have rejected SPD calls for sweeping reform of health insurance and talks are now expected to focus on improving public healthcare, such as by changing billing rules for doctors, who earn more by treating private patients.\nIn labour market policy, Merkel’s bloc does not want to ban fixed-term contracts, but has offered to prevent the repeated renewal of such contracts as a compromise.\nSPD negotiator Manuela Schwesig, aware of the need to push through distinctive SPD policies to sell the deal to the party at large, said: “We’ve promised our members that we’ll negotiate until the other side squeals, and we’ll do that.”\nThe parties plan to negotiate until midnight (2300 GMT) at the latest on Sunday and if they do not manage to conclude talks by then, they will resume at the SPD headquarters on Monday, sources said.\nIf the parties negotiate late on Sunday night, it could be too late to call together the 91 politicians who need to be there to be informed about a coalition deal before a deal is made public.\nadditional reporting by Thorsten Severin; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T11:38:47.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
