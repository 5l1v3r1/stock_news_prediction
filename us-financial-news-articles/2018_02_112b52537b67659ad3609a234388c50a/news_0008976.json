The Dow Jones industrial average traded higher shortly after the open before turning negative again, trading down as much as 900 points early Tuesday.\nMonday was the worst day for the Dow and S&P 500 since August 2011 as well as the biggest single-day point drop for the Dow in history. The Dow broke below 25,000 and erased its 2018 gains.\nCashin said last week that the wage number in January's stronger-than-expected jobs report was unhelpful to an already worried stock market.\nBefore the jobs report, investors were concerned about rising interest rates and political risk, Cashin said, including the release of a Republican memo alleging FBI bias against President Donald Trump .\nOn Monday afternoon, Cashin said the market \" snapped like a twig \" and the roller-coaster ride is probably not over.\nCashin began his career at Thomson McKinnon in 1959. In 1964, at age 23, he became a member of the NYSE and a partner in P.R.
