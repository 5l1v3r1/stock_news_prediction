They are likely to be a significant factor in a general election the junta has promised for November.\nCritics say the military, which took power in a 2014 coup that removed Yingluck Shinawatra’s government, wants to end the family’s political influence - something that is reflected in a new, military-backed charter, party laws and restrictions on political parties.\nThaksin and Yingluck visited China and Japan this month and met at least 30 members of parliament from their Puea Thai party in Hong Kong on the weekend, party members said after returning to Thailand.\nThe two were spotted in a Singapore hotel on Tuesday, meeting a group of unidentified men, and were in the city state on Wednesday, party sources said, adding they were having “business meetings”.\nPolitical observers say their Asia tour is a sign that their party is gearing up for the election.\nA spokesman for the junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order, said it was not focused on the two Shinawatras.\n“Monitoring those who have an arrest warrant is the job of relevant agencies. We are not concerned about this,” the spokesman, Piyapong Klinpan, told Reuters.\nFormer telecommunications tycoon Thaksin was prime minister from 2001 to 2006 when he was overthrown in a military coup supported by the Bangkok-based establishment.\nHe left Thailand in 2008, shortly before a court convicted him of corruption and sentenced him to a two-year jail term. He said the conviction was politically motivated.\nFILE PHOTO: Ousted former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra arrives at the criminal court in Bangkok, Thailand, September 29, 2015. REUTERS/Chaiwat Subprasom/File Picture He is based in Dubai.\nYingluck was elected prime minister in 2011 but was forced from office by a 2014 court ruling, shortly before the military ousted her government.\nYingluck fled from Thailand in August, weeks before the Supreme Court found her guilty of negligence in mismanaging a rice-buying scheme and sentenced her to five years in prison.\nShe is based in Britain and has not spoken publicly since she left Thailand.\nSeveral Puea Thai members told Reuters Thaksin did not discuss politics when he met party members of parliament in Hong Kong.\n“We didn’t talk about politics because we know better than Thaksin what’s going on. He’s been out of the country so long,” said Wattana Muagnsook, a former commerce minister.\nHe said met Thaksin for a meal.\nPhumtham Wechayachai, Puea Thai’s secretary-general, said the party has not held meetings because a junta ban on political gatherings was still in place.\nLawmakers might be trying to play down meetings with Thaksin because they fear legal action.\nLegislation on political parties that took effect in October prohibits those “who are not party members” from “controlling or directing” a party.\nThaksin led the Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party before a court dissolved it in 2007. He is not a member of its reincarnation, the Puea Thai party.\nReporting by Aukkarapon Niyomyat, Amy Sawitta Lefevre, Panarat Thepgumpanat and Patpicha Tanakasempipat; Writing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T10:22:21.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
