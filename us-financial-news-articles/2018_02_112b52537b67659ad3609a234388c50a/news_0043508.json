The damage is ongoing for these individuals. It will never end. Time and again people begged you to stop. Time and again you ramped up the pressure.”\nAt least three of the victims, who ranged in age from early teens to people in their 30s, tried to take their own lives. Falder, a graduate of Cambridge University, also secretly filmed adults he knew when they were in the shower using hidden cameras he had installed at a number of locations.\n“Dr Matthew Falder thought he wouldn’t be caught,” said NCA operations strategic lead Matthew Long. “He would stop at nothing to exploit (the victims), to make them feel sad, humiliated and unhappy. Ultimately that has devastated some people’s lives.”\nReporting by Michael Holden; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:00:07.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
