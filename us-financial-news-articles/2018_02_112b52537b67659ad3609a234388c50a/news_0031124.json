But we knew that everyone within the organization who is related to that process could benefit through the tool.\nWeiner, who joined Microsoft's senior leadership team as part of the $26.2 billion acquisition in 2016, said the program has led to positive results for the group:\n\"And so we went back to the drawing board and thought through that business model and are now able to effectively reduce the cost, procedure cost per user while materially expanding the footprint within the organization, and the net result is more budget being allocated to LinkedIn,\" he said.\nIn other words, by lowering the cost per user, LinkedIn found that companies are buying access for more users, and thereby increasing the overall amount of money they're spending with the company.\nMicrosoft executives repeatedly called out LinkedIn growth on its fiscal second-quarter earnings call last month.\nLinkedIn has now seen revenue acceleration three quarters in a row, Weiner said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T03:44:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
