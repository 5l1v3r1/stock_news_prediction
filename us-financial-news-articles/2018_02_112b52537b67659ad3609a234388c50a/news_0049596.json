That’s what has given the market a reason to see a little bit of a positive future,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth in New York.\n“After yesterday’s Fed minutes, the market is watching some of these Fed presidents’ speeches more closely,” said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. “People are just looking for any clue they can about rate hikes going forward, so they are taking every word that these guys say to heart.”\nBenchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yields <US10YT=RR > slipped from their four-year high hit in the previous session. The notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.9207 percent, from 2.941 percent late on Wednesday.\nBond prices, which usually move inversely to yields, pared gains after the U.S. government sold new seven-year notes to slightly soft demand, the final sale of $258 billion in debt this week.

The Japanese yen JPY= strengthened 0.96 percent versus the greenback to 106.75 per dollar.\nOil prices rose to two-week highs, boosted by the weaker dollar and data showing a surprise draw in U.S. crude inventories and the weaker dollar.
