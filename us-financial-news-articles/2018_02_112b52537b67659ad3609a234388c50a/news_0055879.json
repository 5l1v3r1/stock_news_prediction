In some cases, data speeds were slowed by nearly 90 percent, the FTC said.\nAT&T had argued that it was exempt from FTC regulation because it is a common carrier. A three-member appeals court agreed, and the FTC appealed to a full panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. That larger court ruled for the agency and revived the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit has been closely watched because critics warned that the prior ruling could leave internet service providers without a U.S. regulator. The Federal Communications Commission in December voted 3-2 to end the net neutrality rules that were designed to ensure a free and open internet and transfer oversight of ISPs to the FTC.\n\"Todays decision on jurisdiction does not address the merits of the case. We are reviewing the opinion and continue to believe we ultimately will prevail,\" AT&T spokesman Marty Richter said.\nBoth FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai praised the decision.\nOhlhausen called it \"good news for consumers.\"\n\"It ensures that the FTC can and will continue to play its vital role in safeguarding consumer interests including privacy protection, as well as stopping anticompetitive market behavior,\" she said in a statement.
