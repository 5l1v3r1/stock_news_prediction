REUTERS/Marco Bello At a political rally later in the day, Maduro said he would not be bowed by Tillerson’s comments.\n“We will not give in. They don’t know what we are made of,” Maduro said.\nCALLS FOR MILITARY ACTION Venezuela’s opposition leaders have long urged the military to take action against Maduro. Maduro claims the United States and opposition parties are part of an international right-wing conspiracy to oust him and get their hands on the OPEC nation’s oil wealth.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has himself suggested possible military intervention in Venezuela, though that was widely rejected in Latin America. Trump has imposed individual and economic sanctions on Venezuela’s government, accusing it of rights abuses and corruption. [nL2N1LZ261] [nL2N1M305Q]\nOn Thursday, Tillerson referred to the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, which is widely seen in Latin America as a justification for U.S. armed intervention in the region, saying it was “as relevant today as it was the day it was written.”\nDiscussing Venezuela, the top U.S. diplomat said militaries in Latin America often “handled” transitions from bad governments, but insisted he was not advocating “regime change.”\n“If the kitchen gets a little too hot for him, I am sure that he’s got some friends over in Cuba that could give him a nice hacienda on the beach and he could have a nice life over there,” Tillerson said, referring to 55-year-old Maduro, who has a close relationship with Cuba’s communist government.\nSenior military leaders have consistently stood by Maduro, whom critics accuse of turning Venezuela into a dictatorship and wrecking its economy.\nBut discontent among the rank-and-file, especially at their own economic penuries, is evident.\nThere have been some small uprisings against Maduro from within the security forces. A National Guard captain led an attack on a barracks but was later arrested. A police helicopter pilot, Oscar Perez, who lobbed grenades at government buildings, was tracked down and killed last month.
