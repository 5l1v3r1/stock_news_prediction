The ONS said the industrial and construction data did not alter this estimate.\nThe economy continued to expand at this pace in the three months to January, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated on Friday.\nThe buoyant world economy has been a boon for British exporters, who are in the midst of a sweet spot before Britain’s exit from the European Union, BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Thursday.\nDeputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Friday that he would not be shocked if British interest rates needed to go up twice this year.\nHowever, ONS data showed Britain’s goods trade deficit with the rest of the world widened to 13.6 billion pounds ($18.8 billion) in December. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller shortfall of 11.6 billion pounds.\nThe ONS linked the large deficit to rising crude oil prices and higher imports.\nFor 2017 as a whole, the total trade deficit including services narrowed by 7 billion pounds to 33.6 billion pounds.\nBritish trade minister Liam Fox said the figures showed demand for British goods and services was higher than ever.\nSeparately, the ONS said construction output jumped 1.6 percent on the month, helped by an upturn in infrastructure projects. The Reuters poll suggested construction output would be flat.\n($1 = 0.7168 pounds)\nEditing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:02:40.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
