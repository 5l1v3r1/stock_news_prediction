Wall Street gave up earlier gains on Thursday as the U.S. Treasuries market started February on a sour note. The 10-year yield hit a near four-year peak after economic indicators seemed to confirm the Federal Reserve's inflation outlook. The local share price index futures fell 0.2 percent or 16 points to 6,021, a 72.1-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark climbed 0.9 percent on Thursday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was flat in early trade.
