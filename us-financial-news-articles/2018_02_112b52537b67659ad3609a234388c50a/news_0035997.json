REUTERS/Peter Nicholls “WRANGLING AND TURMOIL”\nMany business leaders, anxious to preserve cross-border supply chains, support that approach to Brexit.\n“Businesses are becoming increasingly worried at the lack of detail coming from government, and this speech (by Johnson) does not make its plan any clearer,” said Stephen Phipson, head of EEF, a manufacturing industry group.\nJohnson said it would be “mad” to end up with a settlement that does not allow Britain to enjoy the economic freedoms of leaving the EU, though he said he was happy for Britain to remain subject to EU law during a planned transition period after March 2019, to give businesses greater certainty.\nIt remains to be seen which side of the debate May will eventually back. She is due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday as London and the rest of the EU try to agree on the terms of a transition deal to smooth Britain’s exit.\nJohnson accused some British “Remain” supporters of seeking to reverse Brexit, possibly through a second referendum, saying this would greatly exacerbate Britain’s political divisions.\n“If there were to be a second vote I believe that we would simply have another year of wrangling and turmoil and feuding in which the whole country would lose,” he said.\nJohnson’s aides billed Wednesday’s speech as a chance for him to show a path for “an outward-facing, liberal, and global Britain following our exit from the EU”.\nThey say Johnson has become increasingly worried that what he sees as his Brexit legacy - a promise to return millions of pounds to Britain’s state-funded health service - is being squandered by an indecisive May.\nAdditional reporting by Elizabeth Piper.
