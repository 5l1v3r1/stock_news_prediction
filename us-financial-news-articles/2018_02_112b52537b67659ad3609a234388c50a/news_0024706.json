For the full year, revenue is expected in the range of USD 615-655 million with an EBIT in the range of USD 50 to 70million. For 2019, current planning foresees revenues in the range of USD 700-760 million and an EBIT in the range of USD 70-100 million. Our guidance is based on an average exchange rate of 1.20 USD/Euro.\nGrowth in the fourth quarter was driven by increased revenues in all of X-FAB’s key end markets, namely automotive, industrial and medial, each contributing to a strong overall growth in 2017. Year-on-year, the automotive business grew by 19% driven by the adoption of more electronics in cars with X-FAB manufacturing about 500 different products for the automotive market. Industrial sales, representing about 600 different products, grew by 32%, whereas medical sales increased by 75% with about 60 different products. Revenues relating to CCC products dropped by 11% compared to 2016, which was mainly caused by capacity constraints. As more technologies become available in the factory in France, X-FAB will be in a better position to support the demand going forward.\nThe expected revenue decrease in the first quarter of 2018 is due to weaker sales in RF-SOI as well as the lower amount of calendar days of the first quarter. The drop in RF-SOI is in line with the typical seasonality of the mobile market as seen in previous years. The RF-SOI business is expected to go up again in the second quarter of 2018. Over the year, X-FAB’s core business is also expected to increase further based on the strong demand in X-FAB’s key end markets. The capacity expansion currently being implemented at the Malaysian factory will support this growth and also help to reduce the amount of outstanding orders which could not be completed due to capacity constraints.\nThe integration of X-FAB France progressed well. In the fourth quarter, the first prototyping of automotive products based on X-FAB’s 180nm high-voltage process with embedded flash was launched. Automotive production is planned to start towards the end of 2018 after successful qualification and respective approvals.\nThe capacity expansion of the Malaysian fab is on track. All equipment is now installed and in the process of being qualified. The additional capacity of 4,000 wafer starts per month is expected to become fully effective in the second quarter of 2018.\nIn the fourth quarter, X-FAB Texas recorded its first SiC production revenues while working with eleven customers on implementing their proprietary version of SiC technologies and components.\nAt a constant USD/Euro currency exchange rate, fourth quarter revenues dropped by 4% year-on-year and grew by 10% quarter-on-quarter. Without X-FAB France as well as the subcontracted business, revenues increased by 17% year-on-year and by 10% compared to the previous quarter.\nRevenue Breakdown per Quarter\nin millions of USD Q1 2016 Q2 2016 Q3 2016 Q4 2016 Q1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 Y-o-Y Growth\nAutomotive 46.2 52.9 55.9 56.0 54.5 59.3 66.5 70.2 19% Industrial 11.8 11.3 14.9 12.7 15.2 16.5 16.7 18.5 32% Medical 2.7 2.6 4.1 3.5 4.6 4.5 6.6 6.9 75% Subtotal core business 1 60.6 56.9%\n66.8 56.4%\n74.8 58.2%\n72.2 45.3%\n74.3 50.2%\n80.3 57.6%\n89.8 64.0%\n95.6 62.0%\n24% CCC 2 24.8 25.5 29.8 30.5 30.9 24.4 18.8 24.2 -11% Others 0.7 0.7 0.3 0.7 0.7 0.5 0.8 0.9 Subtotal 1 86.1 80.8%\n93.0 78.5%\n105.0 81.6%\n103.4 64.9%\n106.0 71.7%\n105.2 75.5%\n109.4 78.0%\n120.7 78.3%\n14% X-FAB France 3 0.0 0.0 0.0 31.6 26.5 31.0 30.9 33.4 Subcontracted business 20.4 25.5 23.6 24.3 15.4 3.2 0.0 0.0 Total revenues 106.5 118.5 128.6 159.3 147.9 139.3 140.3 154.1 13% 1 Without X-FAB France and Subcontracting Business\n2 Consumer, Communications & Computer\n3 X-FAB France business is predominantly CCC with a small amount of Automotive and Industrial business\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, prototyping revenues as indicator for future business came in at USD 15.3 million. For the full year, prototyping revenues totaled USD 54.4 million, an increase of 28% compared to previous year. Prototyping revenues in the core market segments, i.e. automotive, industrial and medical, typically convert into production revenues within four to five years after initial prototyping.\nCommenting on the development of X-FAB’s MEMS business, Rudi De Winter added: “I am delighted about our MEMS business, which is well on track for strong growth in 2018 based on various applications in all 4 of our end markets. In the fourth quarter, we launched production of a new generation MEMS microphone, setting new standards with respect to technical performance. The market for MEMS microphones is growing strongly due to the increased number of microphones per smartphone, the increased use of headphones with noise cancellation, as well as the wider adoption of voice input for various smart applications.”\nFX Sensitivity\nThe weaker US-Dollar has created a headwind with respect to profitability. The average exchange rate for the fourth quarter 2017 deteriorated by 10 cents compared to the same quarter last year. Despite the effect, the operational result increased by 44%. Relating to the financials as per year-end 2017, an evolution of the USD/Euro exchange rate from 1.10 to 1.20 would translate into a net positive effect on the financial result by about USD 8 million, while on a yearly basis it would have a negative effect of USD 12 million on the operational result. At a constant USD/Euro exchange rate of 1.05, the EBITDA margin for 2017 would have come in at 20.2%, above the guidance of 19% as provided at the IPO. The actual exchange rate for 2017 is at 1.129 with a corresponding EBITDA margin of 18.2%.\nProcedures of the independent auditor\nThe statutory auditor, KPMG Bedrijfsrevisoren - Réviseurs d’Entreprises, represented by Herwig Carmans, has confirmed that the audit procedures, which have been substantially completed, have not revealed any material adjustments which would have to be made to the condensed consolidated financial information included in this press release.\nX-FAB Quarterly Conference Call\nX-FAB’s fourth quarter results will be discussed in a live conference call on Monday, February 12 th , 2018 at 6.30 pm CET.
