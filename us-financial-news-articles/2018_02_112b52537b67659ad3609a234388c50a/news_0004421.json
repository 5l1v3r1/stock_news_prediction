That would be up from 7.7 million tonnes that China brought in from the United States last year.\nSinopec, which leads China’s shale gas sector developing the country’s largest commercial discovery, is however struggling to break even in the nascent business, said Ma Yongsheng, a vice president of the state group.\n“If without government subsidy, our shale gas business is on the verge of being loss-making,” Ma told Reuters on the sidelines of the industry outlook briefing.\nThe full cost of producing each cubic metre of gas at its flagship shale project Fuling, in the southwestern mountainous region of Chongqing, was around 1.1 yuan, Ma added.\nSinopec has said it pumped a record 6 billion cubic metres of gas from Fuling last year, out of the country’s total shale output of around 9 bcm.\nChina’s natural gas output last year was nearly 150 bcm.\nReporting by Chen Aizhu; Writing by Josephine Mason; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:58:43.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
