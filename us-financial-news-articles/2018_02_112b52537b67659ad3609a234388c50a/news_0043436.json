Jordan McLaughlin posted his fourth double-double of the season and seventh career with 13 points and 11 assists.\nTres Tinkle scored 16 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for Oregon State (13-13, 5-9), which dropped its 21st straight road game and fell to 0-7 on the road in conference play. Drew Eubanks also scored 16, as he and Tinkle were a combined 14-of-25 from the floor.\nThe Beavers shot 47.1 percent but misfired on 12 of 15 3-point attempts. Second-leading scorer Stephen Thompson Jr. was held to seven points and missed all six 3-point attempts.\nStewart surpassed his previous season high with an alley-oop dunk with 9:56 left for a 50-46 lead. A little over a minute later, he picked up his fourth foul and sat, but USC built a 61-51 lead when he returned about five minutes later.\nThe Trojans took their first double-digit lead when McLaughlin connected with Metu for an alley-oop with 4:04 remaining. Tinkle’s jumper snapped a drought of roughly five minutes without a basket for the Beavers, but McLaughlin hit two free throws with 83 seconds left for a 66-55 lead.\nThe Trojans held a 26-20 lead on two free throws by Metu with 5:08 remaining but settled for a 32-30 halftime lead after Tinkle’s basket with 51 seconds remaining. The Beavers had a chance for the tie or halftime lead, but Stephen Thompson committed a turnover with one second remaining.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:52:39.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
