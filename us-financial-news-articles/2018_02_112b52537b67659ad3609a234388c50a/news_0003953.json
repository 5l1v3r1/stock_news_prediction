(“Athene”) (NYSE: ATH) was awarded the “North America IPO of the Year” by Thomson Reuters’ International Financing Review (IFR) - 2017 Review of the Year for its US $1.2 billion Initial Public Offering (IPO) in December 2016.\nAthene was lauded for their “heroic endeavor” launching their IPO in early December of 2016 amid equity market volatility resulting from political and regulatory uncertainty.\nJim Belardi, CEO of Athene Holding, Ltd., stated “I am pleased that Athene has been recognized with one of the most prestigious awards in the global capital markets. Despite what was one of the slowest IPO markets since 2009, we were confident that investors would recognize that Athene is a disciplined, opportunistic and growth-oriented retirement services company that combines unique capabilities on both sides of the balance sheet. The result was a landmark transaction – the third largest U.S. IPO in 2016 – and we have continued to create shareholder value.”\nIFR also noted a contributing factor for Athene receiving the award was an “eight-day IPO roadshow that included over 60 meetings with more than 250 investors. The deal was more than seven times oversubscribed, allowing for an upsize and helping to produce a 10.1% opening day gain. Athene took aggressive steps by fully exercising an overallotment option and priced two follow-ons within six months of the IPO. Those two deals were unprecedented in their pace so quickly after a large IPO.”\nBankers at Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all nominated Athene for “North America IPO of the Year.”\nOver 900 of the world’s most senior and successful investment banking professionals gathered at the awards dinner on January 30, 2018, to celebrate capital markets excellence. Winners are selected by IFR’s editorial team, based on a company’s performance throughout the Awards year. The Awards year runs from November 2016 to November 2017.
