If you haven’t got an availability of people to come and pick and pack and plant and grade those fruit, vegetable and flowers you will potentially see the sector shrinking,” she said.\nBatters said there were technologies that would eventually replace migrant workers but it would not happen overnight.\n“We have the technology to pick a strawberry but it is slow so in order for it to be comparable to the human hand it will take significant investment,” she said,\nShe said it may be difficult to justify such investment given there had been no increase in the price of fruit and vegetable in the last 15 years.\nBritain’s decision to leave the EU has also created uncertainty about future access to the most important market for its exports.\n“Europe has been an absolutely crucial market for British farmers because it is 500 million people on our doorstep so clarity on what that trade deal looks like is essential.”\nBatters said Britain must become more serious about exploiting opportunities in the global marketplace.\n“If we compare ourselves with Germany and the Republic of Ireland you’ve had governments there that are ambitious about stretching beyond the European boundaries and really getting their produce out across the world.”\nFarmers, who currently receive about three billion pounds ($4.2 billion) a year in support payments, will have to compete with sectors such as health and education for funds once Britain leaves the EU.\nBatters said EU support for agriculture had provided significant benefits for consumers.\n“It has actually been very good at keeping food affordable for everyone and I think that is hugely important going forward,” she said, adding people in Britain now spend about 12 percent of their income on food compared to 25 percent in the 1980s.\nBatters also said Britain needed to have one overarching policy even agriculture is the responsibility of devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n“It is absolutely vital that we leaving one bureaucratic conglomerate and we want to make sure the four countries do work as one nation,” she said.
