A curfew has been imposed parts of the city.\nIndia accuses Pakistan of training and arming militants and helping them infiltrate across the Line of Control that divides the Kashmir region. Pakistan denies the allegations.\nThe South Asian neighbors have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part.\nAdditional reporting and writing by Rupam Jain in New Delhi; Editing by Tom Lasseter and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T10:45:28.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
