That always sets the bar and then they forget about you so it is tough to have a run that holds,” added Corning, who was made to wait 40 minutes before his run due to a delay related to technical difficulties. \n“I did expect it to hold a little longer than it did because that run had all the biggest tricks that all the other guys did. I landed them pretty well and my rail section is more technical than some of the people sitting in the top positions.” \nNorway’s Marcus Kleveland scored 83.71 to qualify in first from heat one, yet it was a difficult heat for the Americans, with Corning’s compatriot Ryan Stassel also struggling and finishing in 17th place. \nBoth Corning and Stassel will have the chance to respond to the disappointment in the big air competition later in the Olympics. \nCorning is first in the FIS World Cup rankings in big air.
