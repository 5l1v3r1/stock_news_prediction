We are ranked sixth in the world, so my immediate focus and the big ticket is to fix things as soon as possible.” \nErasmus said it was right to look at players abroad who fit the SA Rugby selection criteria of having played 30 or more times for the Boks, but added locally-based talent should still receive preference. \n“Our biggest asset is that we have a tremendous amount of players, and if we utilise those players well, then we can become one of the big powers in world rugby again,” Erasmus said. \n“We have to make sure that the best talent here (domestically) will play, but if there is a player outside of that with more than 30 caps, who is fit, still wants to play and is conditioned suitably with the timing of the seasons, then we will certainly consider those players.” Reporting by Nick Said; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:33:21.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
