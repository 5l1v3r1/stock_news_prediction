REUTERS/Samrang Pring The Japanese ballot boxes were worth $7.5 million.\n“Our Japanese friends have never abandoned us,” NEC’s Chairman Sik Bun Hok told reporters on Wednesday.\nThe daughter of CNRP opposition leader Kem Sokha, who has been jailed on treason charges, urged Japan to explain its support for the July election.\n“Japan has to explain to at least half of the entire Cambodian population why it is supporting an artificial election,” Kem Monovithya told Reuters.\nCambodia needs 30,000 ballot boxes, said Sik Bun Hok, adding that Chinese equipment for the general election, including ballot boxes and booths, was due to arrive in March.\nChina is Cambodia’s biggest aid donor and its backing has bolstered veteran Prime Minister Hun Sen in the face of criticism of over what his opponents say amounts to his destruction of democracy. Hun Sen is expected to extend his 33-year rule at the elections.\nReporting by Prak Chan Thul; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T07:07:09.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
