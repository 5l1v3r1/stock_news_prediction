A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long on U.S. dollars.\nThe figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).\nReporting by Christina Martin in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Aaron Saldanha, and Chris Thomas; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T15:00:10.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
