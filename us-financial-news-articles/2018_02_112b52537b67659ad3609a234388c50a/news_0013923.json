Power standard product revenue increases 14 .0 % Introduced 4 new advanced OLED display drivers and achieve d a total of 18 new smartphone design wins\nCEO Comments : \"Revenue and gross profit margin in the fourth quarter topped the mid-point of our guidance range despite a typically soft seasonal period, a slowdown in the China smartphone market that affected our Display business, and an industry-wide increase in wafer prices that began in the second half of 2017, which kept a lid on gross profit,\" said YJ Kim, Chief Executive Officer.\n\"Revenue in our Foundry and Power businesses edged higher sequentially in the fourth quarter, while revenue in the Display business, including OLED drivers, declined due to general market factors.\" Mr. Kim said, \"Based upon our current business visibility, we anticipate a sharp rebound and steep growth in our OLED business in the first quarter of 2018 and remain confident that our OLED revenue this year is on track to exceed 50% growth as compared to 2017 or clearly exceed $100 million.\" CEO Kim added, \"Overall, we made significant operational progress across the board in 2017 and have set a solid foundation for MagnaChip's growth in 2018.\"\nCFO Comments :\n\"Gross profit margin of 27.6% for the 2017 calendar year increased approximately 5 percentage points over 2016, operating income of $39.2 million increased substantially from $2.7 million in 2016, and Adjusted EBITDA of $78.7 million increased 93.3% from $40.7 million in 2016,\" said Jonathan Kim, Chief Financial Officer. \"The sharp improvement in our financial results stemmed primarily from the success of our business strategy to improve product mix, achieve a higher utilization rate, increase manufacturing efficiencies and reduce expenses by implementing a substantial headcount reduction plan.\" CFO Kim added, \"We remain fully committed in 2018 to focus on the overall profitability of MagnaChip, continue to optimize our product portfolio, and to manage the business in order to maximize opportunities for revenue growth.\"\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial Review\nTotal Revenue\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $174.6 million, down 3.3% as compared to $180.5 million from the fourth quarter a year ago, and down 1.2% as compared to $176.7 million from the third quarter of 2017. Total revenue for the full year 2017 was $679.7 million, down 1.2% from $688.0 million in 2016.\nSegment Revenue\nFoundry Services Group revenue in the fourth quarter was $80.6 million, up 3.6% year-over year, and up 0.3% from $80.4 million in the prior quarter.

The Standard Products Group gross profit margin was 25.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 21.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 26.9% in the third quarter of 2017.\nOperating Income, Net Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA\nOperating income, on a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter was $7.6 million, as compared with $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $15.5 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nNet income, on a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter was $43.7 million or $1.28 per basic share and $0.99 per diluted share, as compared with a net loss on a GAAP basis of $49.8 million or $1.42 per basic share in the fourth quarter of 2016, and compared with net income of $5.6 million or $0.16 per basic share and $0.15 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarter of 2017, totaled $9.1 million or $0.27 per basic share and $0.23 per diluted share, as compared with Adjusted Net Income of $1.6 million or $0.05 per basic share and $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016, and compared with Adjusted Net Income of $11.4 million or $0.33 per basic share and $0.28 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the fourth quarter was $20.5 million or 11.8% of revenue, as compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 million or 7.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016, and compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $24.7 million or 14.0% of revenue in the third quarter of 2017.\nManagement believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in conjunction with GAAP results, can provide a meaningful understanding of the factors and trends affecting MagnaChip's business and operations and assist in evaluating our core operating performance. However, such non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or as a better indicator of our operating performance than measures that are presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included in this press release.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $128.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter, about flat with $128.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2017.\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our operating segments:\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nNet Sales\nFoundry Services Group\n$\n80,629\n$\n77,809\n$\n320,089\n$\n273,961\nStandard Products Group\nDisplay Solutions\n53,671\n64,796\n209,539\n281,967\nPower Solutions\n40,241\n37,718\n149,836\n131,468\nTotal Standard Products Group\n93,912\n102,514\n359,375\n413,435\nAll other\n39\n139\n208\n573\nTotal net sales\n$\n174,580\n$\n180,462\n$\n679,672\n$\n687,969\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nAmount\n% of\nNet Sales\nAmount\n% of\nNet Sales\nGross Profit\nFoundry Services Group\n$\n25,564\n31.7%\n$\n23,592\n30.3%\nStandard Products Group\n23,748\n25.3\n22,358\n21.8\nAll other\n39\n100.0\n139\n100.0\nTotal gross profit\n$\n49,351\n28.3%\n$\n46,089\n25.5%\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nAmount\n% of\nNet Sales\nAmount\n% of\nNet Sales\nGross Profit\nFoundry Services Group\n$\n95,458\n29.8%\n$\n69,412\n25.3%\nStandard Products Group\n92,227\n25.7\n87,194\n21.1\nAll other\n208\n100.0\n(380)\n(66.3)\nTotal gross profit\n$\n187,893\n27.6%\n$\n156,226\n22.7%\nF ourth Quarter 2017 and Recent Company Highlights\nMagnaChip:\nDeveloped a multi-level thick IMD (Inter-Metal Dielectric) process for a capacitor with ultra-high breakdown voltage, which is useful for electric vehicles and for applications in the industrial, communications and healthcare markets. Announced it now offers a 0.35-micron 700V Ultra-High Voltage process technology (UHV) that reduces mask counts, manufacturing time and cost for power-related AC-DC products. This UHV process technology offers 700V nLDMOS, 700V JFET, and 5.5V CMOS devices suitable for manufacturing AC-DC converter ICs and LED driver ICs. Hosted its annual Foundry Technology Symposium in Hsinchu, Taiwan in October 2017 to showcase the Company's latest technology offerings and provide a wide-ranging overview of its manufacturing capabilities, specialty technologies, target applications and end-markets. The event drew record attendance.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Outlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018, MagnaChip anticipates:\nRevenue to be in the range of $158 million to $164 million, down sequentially 7.8% at the mid-point of the projected range, due to typical seasonal factors and ongoing portfolio optimization activities. The guidance for the first quarter compares with revenue of $174.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $161.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. An increase in silicon wafer prices, a lower fab utilization rate due to seasonal factors and product portfolio optimization activity will result in gross profit margin to be in the range of 26% to 28%. This compares to 28.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 25.7% in the first quarter of 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call\nMagnaChip will hold a conference call on February 6 at 5 p.m. EST to discuss the fourth quarter and 2017 financial results.
