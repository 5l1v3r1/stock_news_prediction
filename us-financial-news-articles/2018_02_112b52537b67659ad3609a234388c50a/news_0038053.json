Its shares were up 3.4 percent.\nThe Australian financial index rose to its highest in a little more than a week, led by Suncorp Group Ltd climbing as much as 3.3 percent.\nThe insurer recovered from a sell-off on Thursday after it reported a fall in half year profit due to a hailstorm in Melbourne.\n“We will have to wait and see in the next couple of hours because when the global guys in Asia come in, I would expect them to buy the banks a bit more, so they would probably go higher,” Somasundaram said.\nMoving in the other direction, materials accounted for Friday’s biggest losing sector, after driving Thursday’s gains.\nThe sector index fell the most in a week, though losses for mining majors BHP and Rio Tinto were relatively modest at 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.\nAcross the Tasman Sea, New Zealand shares were on track to end the week marginally higher largely thanks to industrials and telecom stocks.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.5 percent, or 36.33 points, to 8,099.6.\nAuckland International Airport Ltd gained the most in a month and was the biggest contributor to index gains, up 2.7 percent, after reporting favourable results.\nReporting by Aaron Saldanha in Bengaluru; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T04:10:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
