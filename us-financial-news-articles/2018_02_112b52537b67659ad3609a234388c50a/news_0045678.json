REUTERS/Dominic Ebenbichler Sundby increased the lead to over five seconds before handing back to Klaebo for the final lap and his young team powered up the first hill and away from the rest of the field.\nIn the end he was unthreatened, turning the final corner and gliding across the line at a leisurely pace for his second gold. Sundby now has two gold medals and one bronze to show for his efforts in Korea.\n“This guy (Klaebo) inspires me. He has come in last season and in this season, maybe showing us how modern cross-country skiing should be,” Sundby said.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “He is a talent everybody looks up to at moment but he is only 21 years old so I hope I have one advice or two to give him in the next few years,” he said.\n“But for sure he has taken cross-country skiing to another level.”\nBolshunov opened enough of a gap over the last 200 meters to claim sliver comfortably. Sweden, after a promising start, fell away late on as Halfvarsson was outsprinted for the bronze by Jouve.\nSpitsov said he did not expect to end up on the podium collecting a silver medal at all because he does not consider himself a strong sprinter.\n“In a way we are happy. We were close,” he told reporters.\n“In the last climb it was a good run from Johannes and there was a big gap, so big that I could not reach.”\nReporting by Philip O'Connor, Additional reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Ed Osmond/Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T13:18:39.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
