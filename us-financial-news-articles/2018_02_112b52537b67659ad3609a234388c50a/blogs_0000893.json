But Facebook told us point-blank that it doesn't expect to see any sort of long-term slowdown in daily active user growth,\" Cramer said.\nMoreover, the actual improvements will reduce the number of advertisements and viral content on Facebook. The company's Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg , said on the post-earnings conference call that they could lead to \"more monetization opportunities\" â€” music to Cramer's ears.\n\"A better user experience does translate to more users, which translates into, guess what? More money,\" the \"Mad Money\" host explained. \"The truth is, there's no immutable law of the universe that says things have to go wrong.\"\nApple Cramer saw similar negativity seeping into the market narrative after Apple reported what he saw as \"a phenomenal quarter.\"\nKnowing that tech hawks were worried about its iPhone production, the company gave positive guidance on its next quarter, predicting steady demand and strong pricing.\n\"The bear case, once again, failed to pan out, particularly with all the money [Apple's] got and what they're going to do with it, and it was right to hold it, not trade it, at least for now,\" Cramer said.\nAmazon The e-commerce giant's quarter gave investors everything they could have wanted from its retail, web service and advertising lines of business, the \"Mad Money\" host said\n\"I think its stock can romp now from the $1470s, where we're going to be when we're going home tonight, to the $1500s in a short period of time. I'd be a buyer anywhere below $1500,\" Cramer said.\nAlphabet Alphabet delivered what was perhaps the most mixed quarter of the bunch, but Cramer still believed in the Google parent's story despite its weaker-than-expected results.\n\"I was a tad disappointed, but then again, it had run up so much in anticipation of a blowout quarter that there was a letdown for certain,\" Cramer said. \"My take? Don't lose hope, don't lose sleep, it's doing well.\"\nFinal thoughts \"If you don't want to miss these moves, you need to stop assuming that the default state is for everything to be horrible,\" Cramer concluded. \"Sometimes, I almost feel like it's my job to be upbeat. But the reality is that I am not being upbeat. I'm merely being empirical. I'm telling you the facts. This is not a glass-half-full, glass-half-empty situation. The glass, to me, is overflowing and anyone who tries to tell you different, I think, is simply being rigorous or worse, quite disingenuous.\"\nWATCH: Cramer analyzes tech titans' earnings show chapters Cramer tackles Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet earnings as tech giants report      20 Hours Ago | 12:11 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Facebook, Alphabet and Apple. \nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
