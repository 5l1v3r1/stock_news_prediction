He’ll be pushing the medical staff to come back as soon as possible.” \nPalace, 14th in the league table and three points clear of the relegation zone, have been plagued by injuries in recent months. \nWinger Bakary Sako was ruled out for the rest of the season with a fractured ankle and the loss of Zaha left Christian Benteke, Andros Townsend and new signing Alexander Sorloth as Hodgson’s attacking options. \n“Quite frankly I can’t remember a time when I’ve had this many players injured at a club,” Hodgson added. \n“These things happen. We certainly haven’t been too lucky of late with injury, but the players have kept battling on and will try to get results.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T18:48:40.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
