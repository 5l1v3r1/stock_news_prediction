The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 107.09 yen, sliding from 107.43 yen earlier in the day. \nExporters were also battered, with Honda Motor falling 1.4 percent and TDK Corp dropping 1.1 percent. \nAs oil prices extended declines into a second day, the mining sector was hit. Inpex Corp tumbled 3.5 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co slumped 4.0 percent. \nThe broader Topix dropped 0.3 percent to 1,784.81.
