The bank did not respond to emailed questions on the matter.\nTubagus Haeru, an official at the Coordinating Maritime Affairs Ministry, which is overseeing the cleanup project, said previous attempts to clean the river had been expensive and had not worked.\n“Ministries have been working by themselves, local governments working by themselves and the community has been working by itself,” Haeru told Reuters.\nResearch carried out by the Blacksmith Institute in 2013 found levels of lead in the Citarum at more than 1,000 times U.S. standards for drinking water, while aluminium, manganese and iron were significantly higher than recommended levels.\n“The fact is the Citarum is still like that, and several media have been saying it’s the dirtiest river in the world,” Haeru said.\nThe latest cleanup effort began earlier this month and involves police, military, government departments, organisations and the public in the 25 districts the river passes through.
