The only time direct talks between the government and the Taliban have been held, in 2015, they broke down almost immediately.\nIn the past two weeks, the insurgents have issued two statements, including what they called an open letter to the American people, calling for talks with the United States to find a peaceful solution.\nThere has been a very cautious reaction. By focusing on talks with Washington, diplomats say the Taliban have sought to push forward their claim that they, rather than the Western-backed government, represent the Afghan people.\n“It’s the Taliban who have refused to engage in direct negotiations with the Afghan government ... the legitimate recognised government for the international community,” Alice Wells, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, said.\nACCEPTING NEGOTIATIONS The new U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, announced last year and based around stepped-up support for the army and greatly increased air strikes against the militants, is intended to pressure the Taliban into talks.\nU.S. and Afghan officials say it is hitting them hard but that any talks must be between the government and the Taliban.\n“Whatever door the Taliban knock on for peace talks, they will be referred back to talk to the Afghan government and Afghan people,” Tahiri said.\nWestern diplomats say that even neighbouring countries with better relations with the Taliban than the United States and its NATO allies have been increasingly pressing for talks to end the violence and instability.\nTwo senior members of the Taliban, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said the recent statements reflected a concern not to be seen by friendly powers to be obstructing peace.\nOne said the movement had no desire to “waste time in useless talks” with Kabul but added: “There is a growing demand and pressure from some of our friends around the world that we should negotiate with the Afghan government.”\nEarlier this month, the Russian foreign ministry complained that Washington was ignoring its offer of brokering talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.\nAfghan officials also say that Pakistan’s increasing fear of international isolation over allegations that it supports the Taliban may be persuading it to put pressure on the insurgents to show more willingness to compromise.\n“Our understanding is that Pakistan is pushing their leaders to show some willingness for talks because Pakistan is under enormous international pressure,” one senior Afghan official who is close to the process said.\nU.S. Permanent Representative to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison said on Saturday some contacts with the Taliban were already underway “in a very beginning stage”, aimed largely at exploring a framework for possible discussions.\nAdditional reporting by Jibran Ahmad in PESHAWAR and Jonathan Landay in WASHINGTON; Editing by Alexander Smith\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T18:47:23.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
