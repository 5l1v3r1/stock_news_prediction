It reported $78.35 billion in the previous year.\nMaestri also detailed the company’s plans for its cash. He said the company, which has about $163 billion in cash net of debt on its balance sheet, plans to balance its cash and debt. He did not say whether that would come in the form of returning capital to shareholders or capital expenditures.\n“Over time, we are trying to target a capital structure that is approximately net neutral. We will have approximately the same level of cash and debt on the balance sheet,” Maestri said. “We’re going to take that (cash net of debt) balance down from $163 billion to zero.” (Reporting by Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Bernard Orr)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T07:40:07.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
