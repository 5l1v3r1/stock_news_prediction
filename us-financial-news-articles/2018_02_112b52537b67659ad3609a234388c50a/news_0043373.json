The inclusion of the Beverage Can Acquisition for a full year increased revenue by €1,301 million compared with the prior year. Revenue growth also reflected higher selling prices driven by the pass-through of higher input costs, partly offset by adverse currency translation effects of €102 million, which were largely attributable to unfavorable movements in the US dollar and British pound. Adjusted EBITDA increased by €182 million, or 16%, to €1,340 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Growth reflected a full year contribution from the Beverage Can Acquisition, as well as synergy realization and cost reductions, partly offset by higher input costs and unfavorable currency translation effects.\nFourth Quarter\nGroup\nRevenue of €1,789 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 represented a decrease of 2% at actual exchange rates and, at constant currency, increased by 1% compared with the same period last year. The reduction in revenue was attributable to €58 million adverse currency translation effects, partly offset by 1% organic growth. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of €285 million decreased by 7% at actual exchange rates, compared with the same period last year. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 3%, with growth in three of our four divisions, more than offset by a decline in Glass North America.\nMetal Packaging Europe\nRevenue increased by 4%, to €684 million in the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, compared with the same period last year. Growth reflected 4% organic growth, partly offset by €1 million negative currency translation effects. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of €98 million increased by 1% at constant currency compared with the same period last year, reflecting continued synergy realization.\nMetal Packaging Americas\nRevenue of €435 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, was in line with the same period last year. Organic revenue growth of 6%, as a result of the pass through of higher input costs and favorable volume/mix, was offset by negative currency translation effects of €29 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased by €1 million to €58 million, compared with the same period last year and by 9% on a constant currency basis. Growth in Adjusted EBITDA primarily reflected higher volumes and continued cost efficiencies, partly offset by currency translation effects of €4 million.\nGlass Packaging Europe\nRevenue declined by 2% to €333 million in the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, compared with the same period last year, mainly reflecting lower glass engineering revenues. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by 3% to €68 million, compared with the same period last year, as a result of cost savings.\nGlass Packaging North America\nRevenue decreased by 14% to €337 million in the fourth quarter, compared with the same period last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue was 8% lower, due mainly to lower volumes, in particular in the beer and wine end markets. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 28% to €61 million in the fourth quarter, compared with the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA at constant currency was 23% lower than the prior year as a result of lower volumes, increased freight costs and higher input costs compared with the same period last year.\nWe have now completed the review of our Glass North America division. The main conclusions are as follows:\nClosure of the Milford, Massachusetts, production facility, as announced in January; We intend to pursue growth opportunities in stronger performing end markets, such as food, wine and spirits. In order to avail of these opportunities, we will convert production capacity from the mass beer sector to these alternative end markets; This will result in a reduction in overall production capacity, but an even greater reduction in our mass beer capacity; Targeted investment in Glass North America's network, including state of the art inspection equipment, to enhance our competitive position and enable differentiation through a focus on innovation, quality and service; Revision of our freight and logistics infrastructure and arrangements, where rates remain at elevated levels, to optimize costs and ensure effective recovery.\nThese initiatives are expected to lead to a restoration of appropriate profitability in Glass North America, through an increased focus on improved manufacturing performance, so as to bring it into line with our European Glass business.\nFinancing Activity\nIn December, the Group closed a committed five year $850 million Global Asset Based Loan Facility. The new facility, secured by trade receivables and inventories, reflects the Group's increased scale following the Beverage Can Acquisition in 2016.\nEarnings Webcast and Conference Call Details\nArdagh Group S.A.
