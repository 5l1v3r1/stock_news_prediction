Excluding items offset in fuel and transportation expense and the effect of a 2016 legal settlement, operating revenues were $325.4 million for the quarter and $1,267.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 2% decrease and a 4% increase from $332.8 million and $1,223.7 million in the comparable 2016 periods; Net income of $84.2 million for the quarter and $297.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 5% and a 2% decrease from $88.2 million and $302.2 million in the comparable 2016 periods. During the second quarter of 2017, the Partnership sold its Flag City Processing Partners, LLC subsidiary, which owned the Flag City processing plant and related assets, to a third party for approximately $63.6 million, including customary adjustments. The Partnership recognized losses and impairment charges of $47.1 million on the sale. Excluding the impact of the Flag City sale, Net income would have been $344.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017; Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $205.5 million for the quarter and $791.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 4% and a 1% decrease from $213.8 million and $803.0 million in the comparable 2016 periods. Excluding the impact of the Flag City sale, EBITDA would have been $838.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017; and Distributable cash flow of $110.6 million for the quarter and $600.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 14% decrease and an 18% increase from $128.3 million and $507.3 million in the comparable 2016 periods. Excluding the impact of the Flag City sale, distributable cash flow would have been $536.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCompared with the fourth quarter of 2016, the Partnership's fourth quarter of 2017 results were unfavorably impacted by the restructuring of contracts with Southwestern Energy on the Partnership's Fayetteville and Greenville laterals and decreases in storage and parking and lending revenues, partly offset from revenues from recently completed growth projects.\nFor the full year 2017, the Partnership's results were impacted by the items discussed above, the sale of the Flag City processing plant and related assets and a 2016 legal settlement.\nCapital Program\nGrowth capital expenditures were $570.5 million and maintenance capital expenditures were $137.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nThe Partnership has scheduled a conference call for February 12, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time to review the quarterly results, current market conditions and distribution amount. The earnings webcast may be accessed via the Boardwalk website at www.bwpmlp.com .

EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of the Partnership's financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to assess the Partnership's operating and financial performance, ability to generate cash and return on invested capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream portion of the natural gas and natural gas liquids industry. Distributable cash flow is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of the Partnership's financial statements as an approximation of net operating revenues generated by the Partnership, that when realized in cash, will be available to be distributed to its unitholders and general partner.\nEBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of another company.\nTax Notification\nThis release is intended to be a qualified notice under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b). Brokers and nominees should treat 100% of Boardwalk's distributions to foreign investors as being attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, Boardwalk's distributions to foreign investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable tax rate.\nAbout Boardwalk\nBoardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (NYSE: BWP) is a midstream master limited partnership that primarily transports and stores natural gas and liquids for its customers.
