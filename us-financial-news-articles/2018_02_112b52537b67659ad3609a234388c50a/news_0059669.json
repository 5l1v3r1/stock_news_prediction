We see ourselves as playing a complementary role to existing exchanges,” said APEX chief executive Eugene Zhu, who was a former chief executive at China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE).\nAPEX said that its palm olein contract will complement the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange’s benchmark crude palm oil futures contract and DCE’s refined, bleached and deodorized palm olein futures contract.\nReuters reported in August that APEX plans to offer a range of products “related to the Chinese economy.”\nPalm oil comprises more than 70 percent of China’s edible oil imports of about 5 million tonnes a year. The country is the world’s second-largest palm oil buyer after India.\nCrude palm oil futures are most widely traded on Bursa Malaysia and those prices are considered the global benchmark. Indonesia and Malaysia produce nearly 90 percent of the world’s palm oil.
