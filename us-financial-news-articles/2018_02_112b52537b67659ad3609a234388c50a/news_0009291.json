The authorities encouraged people to leave their cars at home and use public transport instead.\n“I have just left home but have already fallen over because the snow has not been cleared from the pavements,” said Lilya Belkina, a Moscow resident.\n“It is very difficult to cross the road.”\nReporting by Andrew Osborn, Gennady Novik and Valery Stepchenkov; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T17:24:02.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
