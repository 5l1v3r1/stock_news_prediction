The deal also gave the employees an option to buy the remaining stake in future years.\nBut with Frère Group reducing its holding to 51 percent, banks that had once extended some $2.5 billion in credit to the trading firm lost interest in fully funding the entity, a source close to the matter said, declining to be named.\nOfficials from AOT Energy and Frère Group did not respond to requests for comments.\nTrading shops such as AOT Energy need lines of credit to fund operations.\nAmid the turmoil, at least two executives and some traders have left or are leaving the firm, including Lance Perdue, managing director for AOT Energy Americas and U.S. finance chief Anthony Askalany, several sources said on Friday.\nBoth Perdue and Askalany were based in Houston.\nThe firm also will shut a recently opened shared-services office in Poland, which provides back office support to trading offices, a source said.\nTwo sources added that there would also be departures in Europe, although it was not immediately clear how many people would be affected.\nCommodity trading firms and banks posted major losses in 2017 due to muted client activity and wild fluctuations across energy markets. Bonuses across the industry were low, and some hedge funds have chosen to exit energy trading.\nReporting by Liz Hampton in Houston; Additional reporting Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Lisa Shumaker\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T01:36:54.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
