She said the information was signed off by Anoj Singh, former Eskom chief financial officer on behalf of the utility’s CEO.\nBrown said Singh had told her that no payments were made to Trillian, a consultancy linked to the Gupta family.\nBrown said when she became aware that she had been misled, she ordered Eskom’s board to take disciplinary action against “those who conspired to mislead me, Parliament and the country.”\nKhulu Phasiwe, Eskom’s spokesman, said Singh and others were suspended by the board after Brown’s instruction. Singh was suspended by Eskom in July 2017 and formally resigned his post in January.\nSingh did not answer a call made to his cell phone.\nTyrone Seale, Ramaphosa’s acting spokesman, said the presidency was still studying the Public Protector’s report.\nZuma’s business associates include three brothers from the Gupta family who have been accused of using their political connections to win contracts at state firms, including Eskom, and influence cabinet appointments.\nZuma and the Gupta brothers deny wrongdoing.\nEarlier this week, South Africa’s parliament said it would launch an investigation into allegations of influence-peddling against mines minister Mosebenzi Zwane. Zwane has denied any wrongdoing.\nSeparately, a South African court found Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba violated the constitution over a decision he made while home affairs minister. Gigaba has said he would challenge the ruling.\nReporting by Tanisha Heiberg and Nqobile Dludla; Editing by James Macharia\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T00:10:38.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
