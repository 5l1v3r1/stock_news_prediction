It has to be got right. The party and the country are looking for clear direction, and formulation of the British position must take as long as it requires,” he said.\nMay’s cabinet of top ministers is not alone in being deeply divided over life after Brexit. The rifts are mirrored across Britain where the debate over plans to leave the EU after the June 2016 vote has become increasing angry and divisive.\nSeveral groups, and even a new party, are being formed on all sides of the debate, representing beliefs ranging from pressing for a Brexit reversal or a second referendum, to those accepting Brexit but differing over whether Britain should be in or out of the bloc’s existing trading arrangements.\nA draft document published on Wednesday incensed some hardline Brexit campaigners, with Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg writing in the Telegraph newspaper that to avoid the “perversion of democracy” that he believed it suggested, Britain must be able to sign trade deals during transition.\nMay’s spokesman said it was long government policy to be able to agree and sign such deals during the time-limited period.\nThe EU is also taking an increasingly tough stance. On Thursday, sources in Brussels rejected a proposal made by May in her Florence speech last year for “managed divergence” from EU rules.\nBut May’s spokesman was unruffled.\n“We’re in a negotiation,” he said. “We’ve set out our position, the Commission will set out theirs. It’s a negotiation.” (Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Alison Williams)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:30:40.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
