Mario Hezonja also had 13.\nPhiladelphia was cruising and even received a rare 3-pointer from Trevor Booker to give it a 95-75 lead early in the fourth. It was only Booker’s fifth trey all season and just his second as a member of the Sixers.\nThe 20-point lead was more than enough for the Sixers to hold on, though it wasn’t always pretty down the stretch.\nOrlando did manage to get within 11 at 108-97 with 3:22 left following a 13-2 run.\nHezonja hit a pair of free throws with 2:15 remaining and suddenly the lead was sliced to 108-99.\nBelinelli came back with a clutch jumper to put Philadelphia back up 110-99.\nTimothe Luwawu-Cabarrot also added a big basket for a 112-101 advantage with 1:01 left.\nThe Sixers held an 87-71 lead after the third when T.J. McConnell’s layup landed through the net at the buzzer.\nBelinelli’s nifty driving layup gave the Sixers a 51-33 lead with 3:46 left in the first half. Covington followed with his fourth 3-pointer and a commanding 54-33 advantage.\nOn the Sixers’ next possession, Simmons dropped in a right-handed hook to cap a 10-0 run and push their lead to 56-33.\nThe Sixers led 58-40 at halftime thanks in large part to Embiid’s 19 points and eight rebounds.\nOrlando held an early nine-point lead before the Sixers’ surge began.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T19:57:50.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
