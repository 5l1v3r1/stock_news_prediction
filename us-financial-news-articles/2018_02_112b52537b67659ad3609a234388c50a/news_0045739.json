More than 20 banks were invited to join at the next level to underwrite 28 percent of the deal, the sources said.\nBlackstone is seeking credit approval by Friday, they said, adding that there could be six to seven tiers of commitments. Blackstone declined to comment.\nThe deal consists of a $8 billion-equivalent term loan B (TLB), which is split between $5.5 billion and $2.5 billion-equivalent in euros.\nThe Thomson Reuters logo is seen on the company building in Times Square, New York, U.S., January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly The financing also includes $3 billion-equivalent of secured bonds split between $2 billion and $1 billion-equivalent in euros, and $2.5 billion-equivalent of unsecured bonds split between $1.8 billion and $700 million-equivalent in euros, the sources said.\nThe company will also place a $750 million revolving credit facility.\nThe final splits could be subject to change, depending on investors’ demand for the deal, sources said.\nAdditional funding comes from $1 billion in preferred equity, $3 billion of cash equity that Blackstone is contributing, and $2.5 billion of existing equity, based on the $20 billion valuation, that will be rolled over.\nLeverage is expected to be around 4.5x through the secured debt and 5.6x total, after Ebitda adjustments.\nEditing by Tessa Walsh\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:40:42.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
