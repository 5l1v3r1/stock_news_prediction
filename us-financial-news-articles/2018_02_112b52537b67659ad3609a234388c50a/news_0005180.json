As we enter this next chapter, I am honored to shepherd CHEHALEM’s legacy.”\n“No one understands more how special the CHEHALEM brand is, how much passion and rigorous work it has taken, how much collaboration with other Willamette Valley pioneering wineries has gone on, than Bill,” said Peterson-Nedry. “I take comfort knowing he will respect its heritage in a way that no one else could.”\nPeterson-Nedry planted Ridgecrest beginning in 1980, making it the first vineyard planted in what would become the Ribbon Ridge AVA. He was also instrumental in the development of organizations such as the Oregon Wine Board, Willamette Valley Wineries Association, Oregon Pinot Camp, International Pinot Noir Celebration, and industry groups focusing on defining Oregon’s AVAs and famed wine varieties. The transition in ownership will reduce the workload for Peterson-Nedry, who turned 70 years-old in December, allowing him to devote his full attention to managing his 48 vineyard acres in Ribbon Ridge, crafting wines for RR - a small winery he created 16 years ago - and continue his involvement with Oregon wine industry initiatives.\nSince purchasing his family’s second-generation farm in 1993, Stoller has evolved the property to become the largest contiguous vineyard in the Dundee Hills AVA of Oregon’s Willamette Valley while passionately being a steward of the land and community. Stoller Family Estate was the first winery in the world to achieve LEED Gold certification, and fifth Oregon winery to receive B Corp certification, the latter in large part due to its LIVE and Salmon Safe certifications and community involvement in the City of Dayton and Yamhill County. The ownership change allows the two brands, under the leadership of President Gary Mortensen, to leverage economies of scale while distinguishing autonomy.\n“CHEHALEM is not Stoller, and we like that,” said Mortensen. “Each winery has its own history and future, with one common thread: both wineries are committed to, and known for, producing unique, world-class wines. I look forward to leading the exceptional staff at CHEHALEM and further advancing the brand.”\n###\nAbout Stoller Family Estate\nStoller Family Estate is one of the most highly regarded vineyards and wineries in Oregon. Pioneering Oregonian and Founder Bill Stoller purchased his family’s second-generation farm in 1993 with the vision of cultivating an enduring legacy for the land and Oregon wine industry. Over the last 20 years, he has patiently transformed the 398-acre property into the largest contiguous vineyard in the Dundee Hills that has become synonymous with producing exceptional wines. Stoller Family Estate features the world’s first LEED® Gold certified winery, three guest homes and a state of the art tasting room with panoramic vineyard views. Stoller Family Estate has been named one of Oregon’s Most Admired by the Portland Business Journal for three consecutive years, and best tasting room on the West Coast by USA Today 10Best Reader’s Choice poll in 2016.
