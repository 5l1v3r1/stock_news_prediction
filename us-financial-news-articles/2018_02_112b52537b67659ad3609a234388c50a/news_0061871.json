Nevada holds a two-game lead over second place Boise State (22-6, 12-4) with two games remaining but owns the head-to-head tiebreaker by virtue of sweeping the season series with the Broncos.\nPrentiss Nixon, who was 1-of-18 from 3-point range in his two previous games, finished with 27 points and nine rebounds and was 7-of-16 beyond the arc for Colorado State (11-19, 4-13). Anthony Bonner scored 19 points and forward Nico Carvacho added 13 points and 14 rebounds for the Rams, who lost their third straight game and for 10th time in 11 games.\nColorado State, coming in off a 33-point home loss to Boise State that was the team’s worst in nine years, trailed just 40-38 at halftime and later led 58-57 after a 3-pointer by Nixon with 12:41 remaining. But Nevada answered with an 11-3 run capped by a 3-pointer by Iowa State transfer Hallice Cooke to take a 68-61 lead with 9:35 to go.\nThe Rams closed to within 68-66 after a 3-pointer by Nixon, but the Wolf Pack then pulled away with a 10-0 run capped by two free throws by Caleb Martin. The Rams never got closer than six points the rest of the way.\nCody Martin narrowly missed garnering Nevada’s first triple-double since 1979 when Johnny High accomplished the feat against Southern Oregon.\nThe Rams were coached by Jase Herl, who began the season as the team’s No. 2 assistant but was named interim coach for reigning Mountain West Coach of the Year Larry Eustachy, who was placed on administrative leave by the school on Feb. 3 for a “climate assessment” of the program.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:52:20.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
