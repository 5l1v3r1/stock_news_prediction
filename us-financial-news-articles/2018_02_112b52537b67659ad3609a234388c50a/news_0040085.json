(A complete list of individuals newly-elected to the Academy can be found below.)\nThe Membership of the Academy is central to its mission – to advance solutions to challenges facing the nation by increasing public understanding of how social insurance contributes to economic security. The Academy’s work encompasses established social insurance programs – Workers’ Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid – as well as related areas of healthcare policy, long-term services and supports, paid leave, other social assistance programs, and private employee benefits.\n“We are excited to welcome our newest cohort of Members, who reflect the evolving concerns of the Academy. While the traditional structure of social insurance works well for a majority of today’s workforce, changes are needed to address the needs of those in various employment relationships. We are increasingly focused on the changing risks that American workers and their families face, due to the forces of globalization and technology.” – William Arnone, CEO\n“Our newly-elected Members include some of the nation’s leading experts and most creative problem solvers in social insurance and inequality, which is the Academy’s overarching theme and a critical challenge for our country.” – Shaun O’Brien, Membership Committee Chair\nThose elected to Membership in the Academy have distinguished themselves by improving the quality of research, administration, or policymaking in an area of social insurance. Academy Members make significant contributions to the Academy’s research, education, and leadership development initiatives by volunteering their time on study panels, committees, at conferences, and in other Academy programs.\nProspective Members are nominated by current Academy Members in recognition of their significant and ongoing professional contributions to the field of social insurance.
