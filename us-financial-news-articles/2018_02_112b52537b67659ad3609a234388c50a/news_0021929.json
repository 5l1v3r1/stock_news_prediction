The S&P&rsquo;s correction is the fifth of this bull market, according to Yardeni Research. The last bear market was during the 2008 financial crisis.\n“We’re cheap now, but it’s just a matter of much more cheaper we have to get to attract buyers,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth.\nWorld stocks were also on track for their worst week since 2011, knocked by a 4 percent decline in Chinese stocks.\nWith Wall Street’s quarterly earnings season more than half-way through, 78.3 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so afar have beaten profit expectations, above the 72 percent beat-rate in the past four quarters.\nChipmaker Nvidia was up about 9 percent in premarket trading after its upbeat results and forecast.\nExpedia shares sank 16 percent after the online travel services company said costs would outpace revenue growth this year as it battles rivals for market share.
