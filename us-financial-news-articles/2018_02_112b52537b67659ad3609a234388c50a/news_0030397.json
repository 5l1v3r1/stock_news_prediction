REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini Capacity in Spain has increased in recent years as operators have moved from destinations in the Middle East and North Africa in the wake of attacks on tourists.\nThe number of international tourists visiting Spain broke records for a fifth straight year in 2017, climbing 8.9 percent year-on-year to 82 million.\nOne threat to Ryanair’s rapid expansion plans are relations with pilots. While strike threats in December were averted by a pledge to recognise labour unions for the first time, the airline has so far only managed to reach a recognition agreement with one of the seven unions with which it is in talks.\nO‘Leary said Spain’s SEPLA pilots’ union had not yet responded to offers of a pay rise and terms for union recognition and Ryanair was considering bypassing the union and offering the increase directly to pilots - something it has done in Ireland.\n“With SEPLA we’re trying to say: let’s have a vote on the Spanish pilots’ pay increase, even when we’re trying to finalise the agreement. If you don‘t, we’ll offer it directly to the Spanish pilots,” he said.\nSEPLA last week said it would launch a legal action against Ryanair and said it had been naive to think management wanted to change “toxic labour relations.”\nWriting by Conor Humphries; Editing by David Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T20:36:33.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
