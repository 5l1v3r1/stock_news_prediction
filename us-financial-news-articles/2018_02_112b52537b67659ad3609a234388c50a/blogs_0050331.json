Khosla, who bought the property in 2008, put up a gate to close the beach after the purchase. In August, a California court of appeals affirmed a lower court ruling against him. \nKhosla’s 151-page petition asks the nation’s top court to uphold what he says are his property rights. He describes the case as a “textbook physical invasion of private property.” \nMark Massara, a lawyer for the group of surfers who fought to keep the beach open, said the potential ramifications of the case if Khosla’s legal theory is upheld “are frankly catastrophic” for California beach users. \nThis case involves a stretch of private property along the California coast known as Martins Beach, in San Mateo County.
