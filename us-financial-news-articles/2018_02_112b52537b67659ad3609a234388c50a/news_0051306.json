They have been unable to wear national uniforms or have the Russian anthem played at medal ceremonies.\n“We firmly believe that we have completely fulfilled the conditions ...,” delegation chief Stanislav Pozdnyakov told reporters after he and Medvedeva put their case to the IOC.\nPozdnyakov said he had told the IOC executive board that his athletes had fully complied with a code of conduct that the IOC had set as a condition of restoring Russia’s Olympic status, despite two Russian athletes failing doping tests at the Games.\nAfter the presentation, the board deliberated for hours, finally agreeing to resume talks on Sunday morning.\nPyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Opening ceremony – Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 9, 2018 - A volunteer carries the flag of the Olympic Athletes from Russia.

The closing ceremony starts at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT).\nThe inconclusive talks suggest the board remains undecided, meaning Russia could be waiting right up until the start of the ceremony before it knows whether it can unpack its flag and dress its athletes in national uniform.\nIce Hockey - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Semifinal Match - Canada v Olympic Athletes from Russia - Gangneung Hockey Centre, Gangneung, South Korea - February 19, 2018 - Fans wave flags before the match. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon The two Russian doping cases, involving a medal-winning curler and a bobsledder, make it very tough for the IOC to lift the suspension, despite a large body of support within the organization for ending Russia’s Olympic punishment.\nDespite Russia’s appeal to the IOC, some of its athletes were losing hope of getting their flag back.\n“As we’ve got two doping cases I don’t think they will allow us to be at the closing with the flag,” alpine skier Anastasia Silanteva told Reuters.\nPozdnyakov said he had apologized to the IOC for the doping cases, calling them isolated incidents of athlete negligence rather than anything systematic.\nHe said he had told the IOC that Russia had substantially reformed its anti-doping system, though more work lay ahead.\nHe has previously said Russians are focused on retrieving their flag more than winning medals in Pyeongchang.\nAdditional reporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T14:47:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
