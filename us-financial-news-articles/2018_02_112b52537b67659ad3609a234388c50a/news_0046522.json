It added that it was committed to seeking “viable solutions for the affected staff”.\nIts planned relocation follows in the footsteps of other firms that have decided to quit Italy to cut costs, including U.S. conglomerate Honeywell, which has said it will close its Atessa factory in Italy and, like Embraco, move to Slovakia.\nThe tax wedge, which measures the gap between what employers take home in pay and what it costs to employ them, is 47.8 percent in Italy against 41.5 percent in Slovakia, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nBusinesses in Italy say suffocating bureaucracy and a lethargic legal system also deter investors.\nAdditional reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels; editing by Andrew Roche and Steve Scherer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:08:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
