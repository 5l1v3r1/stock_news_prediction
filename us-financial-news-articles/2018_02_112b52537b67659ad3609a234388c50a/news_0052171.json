It said that Mr. Weaver asked why, and was given no reply.\nAn HHS spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment on Mr. Weaver’s letter late Thursday. She said Wednesday that Mr. Weaver was no longer the nominee.\nRelated\n‘People Are Dying Here’: Federal Hospitals Fail Tribes (July 2017) Mr. Weaver had faced growing scrutiny from members of the U.S. Senate, who would have had to confirm him in the job, after a series of reports in the Journal about his qualifications .\nThe Journal reported that Mr. Weaver had described his roles as a patient-registration clerk at a Missouri hospital as a series of leadership positions, and that his last employer said he left the company’s finances in trouble at the time he departed. Mr. Weaver, through an HHS spokesman, has denied the characterization that he left the firm’s books in disarray.\nIn his letter Thursday, Mr. Weaver described what he said were “slanderous reports” in the news media, but didn’t mention the Journal articles. Mr. Weaver didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment about his nomination or those allegations from the Journal beginning in mid-December. He didn’t respond to requests for comment Thursday.\nSpokespeople for the HHS said Mr. Weaver had held a variety of roles at the hospital and went on to become a successful businessman.\nThe Trump administration so far hasn’t provided any public account of Mr. Weaver’s withdrawal as a nominee.\nMr. Weaver told the recipients of his letter that he discussed the “coerced withdrawal” with his wife and advisers over the weekend, and sought unsuccessfully to reverse his decision to withdraw on Tuesday.\n“The past few days I have been fighting a battle to reclaim the nomination to no avail,” the letter said.\n“I could not believe that such a decision was forced upon me with a 2 minute deadline,” it said. “Some in DC both in and out of government and even a small group from Indian Country made the decision for me and you that I was not the right person to lead IHS.”\nWrite to Christopher Weaver at christopher.weaver@wsj.com and Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T04:26:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
