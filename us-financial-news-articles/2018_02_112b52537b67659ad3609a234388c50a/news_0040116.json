The common currency surged to a three-year high of $1.2556 on Friday before slipping to post a loss of 0.7 percent.\nThe euro’s strength has played a large role in weakening the dollar this year. Focus was on economic indicators due this week, such as Wednesday’s euro zone purchasing managers’ index and Friday’s German gross domestic product numbers, and whether they could propel the common currency higher again.\nThe pound was a shade higher at $1.4045 after losing 0.5 percent on Friday.\nThe Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to $0.7932 after losing 0.5 percent the previous day.
