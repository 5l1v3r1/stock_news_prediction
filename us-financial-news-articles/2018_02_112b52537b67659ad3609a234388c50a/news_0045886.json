And Sinclair said it does not plan to acquire Tribune station KSWB in San Diego.\nSinclair said that not acquiring the Chicago, San Diego and New York stations will shrink its national audience reach by about 8 percentage points.\nSinclair has agreed to sell stations in markets where it overlaps with Tribune, but has not yet identified which stations it will sell in some markets. Many of the stations it plans to sell are current Tribune stations.\nSinclair said in the filing that to meet other ownership limits it will divest one or more stations in eight markets: Seattle; St. Louis; Salt Lake City; Oklahoma City; Greensboro-High Point-Winston Salem, North Carolina; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Richmond, Virginia; and Des Moines-Ames, Iowa.\nSinclair said it is asking the FCC for consent to retain two stations in each of three markets in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Indiana.\nThe FCC said last month it was pausing its informal 180-day timetable for completing its review of the transaction to evaluate Sinclair’s offer of divestitures.\nIn November, the FCC voted to remove key roadblocks to increased consolidation among media companies, potentially unleashing new deals among TV, radio and newspaper owners as they seek to better compete with online media.\nThe Republican-led FCC voted 3-2 to eliminate the 42-year-old ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market.\nIt also voted to make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market, and for local stations to jointly sell advertising time and for companies to buy additional radio stations in some markets.\nIn April, the FCC voted to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters could buy, including Sinclair.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T06:13:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
