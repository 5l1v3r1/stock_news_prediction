A person building a house or opening a restaurant or business should not have to wait years for authorisations and licences any more,” he said.

No more amnesties,” Grasso said. \nIf the centre-right wins enough votes to be called on to form a government, the parties have decided that whoever gets the most votes will name the prime minister. Berlusconi cannot run himself due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction.
