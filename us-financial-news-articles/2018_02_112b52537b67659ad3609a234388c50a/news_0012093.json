Sources told Reuters this week that Bank of America Merrill Lynch arranged the $1 billion debt sale.\nThe new private placement was upsized to $1.38 billion from the original amount of $1.3 billion, said the spokesperson.\nBoth the bonds, due in February 2020, pay 135 basis points over the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate.\nQNB has recently used various types of debt instruments, including Kangaroo and Formosa bonds, to refill its coffers in an effort to diversify funding resources amid the embargo imposed on Qatar by other Arab states.
