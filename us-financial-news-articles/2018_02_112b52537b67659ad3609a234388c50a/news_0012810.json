(NASDAQ: CAMT) (TASE: CAMT), today announced its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights of the fourth quarter 2017\nSemiconductor revenues were $25.8 million, up 20% year-over-year, ahead of the upper end of the previously issued guidance range and a record for the semiconductor segment; GAAP operating income of $3.7 million, representing 14.3% operating margins; non-GAAP operating income of $3.8 million, representing 14.8% operating margins GAAP net income from continued operations of $3.3 million; non-GAAP net income of $3.5 million; up 333% and 303% year-over-year, respectively; First quarter revenue guidance of $26-27 million, represents approximately 25% year-over-year growth\nHighlights of the full year 2017\nSemiconductors revenues of $93.5 million; 18% year over year increase; GAAP operating loss of $3 million; non-GAAP operating income of $10.4 million; GAAP net income from continued operations of $1.7 million; non-GAAP net income of $9.6 million; Year-end net cash balance of $43.7 million;\nForward Looking Guidance\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues are expected to be between $26-27 million, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 25%. The Company expects continued double-digit growth in revenues in 2018, with overall improvement in non-GAAP operating margins.\nDue to the completion of the sale of Camtek's PCB business at the end of the third quarter of 2017, the results of this unit ceased to be consolidated into Camtek's financial statements. However, they are accounted for as discontinued operations in the full year 2017 results, as well as in the comparative periods. Following the sale of the PCB business, the Company recorded a one-time income of $12.5 million to GAAP net income in 2017. In addition, Camtek paid a one-time legal settlement during 2017 amounting to $13 million. These amounts are excluded from the non-GAAP results. The reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP results appears in the tables at the end of this press release. The comparisons to 2016 results below include the results only of the continuing operations.\nManagement Comment\nRafi Amit Camtek's CEO commented , \"We are proud to present strong financial results for 2017. The highlight of the year was the strategic steps we took of evolving into a pure-play semiconductor capital equipment company.\"\nContinued Mr. Amit , \"We are optimistic with regards to the year ahead. Our cash and strong balance sheet put us in a strong position, which enables us to capitalize on potential growth opportunities. Furthermore, we started the year with our highest ever backlog level, and we have already seen some strong and early order momentum. Accordingly, we expect double-digit revenue growth in 2018, and combined with our strong operating leverage, we expect to enjoy a strong year of profitability.\"\nThe financial results and the comparison to 2016 below include only those of the continuing operations:\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $25.8 million. This compares to fourth quarter 2016 revenues of $21.5 million, a growth of 20%.\nGross profit on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the quarter totaled $12.3 million (47.7% and 47.8% of revenues, respectively). This is compared to $10.1 million (46.9% of revenue) on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter 2016. The variance in the non-GAAP gross margin between quarters is a function of the product and sales mix delivered in the quarter.\nOperating profit on a GAAP basis in the quarter totaled $3.7 million (14.3% of revenues), compared to an operating profit of $1.1 million (5.1% of revenues) in the fourth quarter 2016.\nOperating profit on a non-GAAP basis in the quarter totaled $3.8 million (14.8% of revenues), compared to $1.2 million (5.6% of revenues), in the fourth quarter 2016.\nNet income on a GAAP basis in the quarter totaled $3.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2016.\nNet income on a non-GAAP basis in the quarter totaled $3.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $0.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2016.\nCash and cash equivalents, as of December 31, 2017 were $43.7 million compared to $19.7 million as of December 31, 2016. During the quarter, Camtek received $24 million in proceeds from the sale of its PCB business and paid out $5.0 million as a dividend payment to shareholders.\nFull Year 2017 Results Summary\nRevenues for 2017 were $93.5 million. This compares to revenues of $79.3 million in 2016, a growth of 18%.\nGross profit on a GAAP basis totaled $45.5 million (48.7% of revenues), compared to $32.5 million (41.0% of revenues) in 2016. The gross profit on a GAAP basis in 2016 includes a $4.9 million effect of the FIT re-organization including the write-off of inventory and other one-time expenses.\nGross profit on a non-GAAP totaled $45.6 million (48.7% of revenues), compared to $37.5 million (47.3% of revenues) in 2016.\nOperating loss on a GAAP basis totaled $3.0 million, compared to operating profit of $2.0 million (2.5% of revenues) in 2016. The operating loss in 2017 included a one-time expense of $13 million due to a settlement payment. The operating profit in 2016 included a $4.1 million expense due to the reorganization of the Printar business unit.\nOperating profit on a non-GAAP basis totaled $10.4 million (11.1% of revenues), compared to $3.3 million (4.1% of revenues) in 2016.\nNet income on a GAAP basis totaled $1.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $0.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in 2016.\nNet income on a non-GAAP basis totaled $9.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share.

These statements are only predictions and may change as time passes. We do not assume any obligation to update that information. Actual events or results may differ materially from those projected, including as a result of changing industry and market trends, reduced demand for our products, the timely development of our new products and their adoption by the market, increased competition in the industry, price reductions as well as due to risks identified in the documents filed by the Company with the SEC.\nThis press release provides financial measures that exclude: (i) settlement expenses; (ii) changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; (iii) share based compensation expenses, (iv) discontinued operations, and (v) revaluation of liabilities with respect to the acquisition of Printar and reorganization costs with regard to the FIT activities, and are therefore not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when evaluating the business internally and therefore felt it is important to make these non-GAAP adjustments available to investors.
