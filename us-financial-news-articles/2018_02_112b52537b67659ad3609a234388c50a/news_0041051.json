The bailout fund is to become such an emergency backstop which, should it ever be used, would get repaid by banks later.\nEuropean Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici told the news conference details of the backstop arrangement would be agreed by ministers in March so that it could come into operation from the start of 2019.
