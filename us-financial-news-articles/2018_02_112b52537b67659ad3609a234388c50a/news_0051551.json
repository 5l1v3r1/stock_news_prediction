Its creation led many countries around the world to describe Maduro as a dictator, a charge Maduro dismisses as part of a campaign against him by the United States. \nThe former bus driver and union organizer is broadly unpopular due to a crippling economic crisis that has left millions unable to afford basic food items and fueled an exodus of migrants. \nThe best-known opposition leaders are either barred from holding office, in jail for leading protests, or in exile to avoid arrest. The main opposition coalition has said it will not participate in the vote, though other candidates could break with the coalition and run on their own. \nMaduro says the country is the victim of a U.S.-backed economic war and that the opposition’s refusal to participate is due to fear that they will lose. \nReporting by Deisy Buitrago; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T20:36:28.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
