The law protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought illegally to the U.S. as children from being deported. \nFour separate bills addressing DACA failed in the Senate on Feb. 15. Among them were a bipartisan bill from the so-called Common Sense Coalition, which allowed \"Dreamers\" a pathway to citizenship and secured border wall funding, and Trump's preferred plan, which took the harshest line on immigration and secured the fewest votes. \nIn the days following the votes, Trump claimed that Democrats have forgotten about the Dreamers. Trump Tweet DACA \nWhile the Trump administration deals with another immigration setback, the debate on gun reform rages on , galvanized in large part by the survivors of a Florida high school shooting that killed 17 students and adults. \nTrump has considered raising the minimum age to buy guns, banning bump stocks, strengthening background checks and focusing on mental illness in response to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The National Rifle Association, the foremost advocacy group for gun owners and manufacturers, opposes raising the minimum age. \nTrump has also continued to voice his approval for arming \"gun-adept\" school teachers â€” which he has claimed could total around 20 percent of the total population. \nThe president has also weighed in on the apparent failures of local and federal law enforcement officials to stop the shooter, both before and during the attack. \nTrump criticized the Broward County Sheriff's Office in the wake of reports that they hesitated to enter the school to engage the gunman. \n\"You don't know until you test it, but I think, I really believe I would have run in there even if I didn't have a weapon ,\" the president said. \nIn a Saturday interview on Fox News , Trump weighed in on House Intelligence Committee Democrats' newly released rebuttal to an incendiary GOP memo. The Democratic response, which purports to defend the FBI and Justice Department against allegations of surveillance abuse, was \"nothing but a confirmation\" of the GOP memo, he said.
