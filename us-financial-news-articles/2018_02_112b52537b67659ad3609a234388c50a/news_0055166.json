A six-month long state of emergency was imposed by the government the next day, with the intention of quelling civil unrest. \nThe state of emergency prohibits, among other things, the distribution of potentially sensitive material and unauthorized demonstrations or meetings. \nHailemariam remains in office until a new prime minister is appointed. \nEthiopia is, in essence, a one party state led by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, a coalition comprising of parties representing different regions of the country.

Meanwhile, Hailemariam’s party, the Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement, is the weakest in the coalition.
