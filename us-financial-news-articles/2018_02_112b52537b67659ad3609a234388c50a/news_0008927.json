The hat highlighted below is on the auction website for $500.\nAnother similar hat has 18 offers with a \"current bid\" $101 , with nearly three days left on the auction.\nA hat that the seller claims is signed by Musk, is listed for almost $10,000 . As of publishing, there are no public offers.\nYet another seller is aiming to get $12,000 — without the John Hancock of the iconic entrepreneur — but has no public bids.\nAs for the flamethrowers, since The Boring Company has not yet shipped the products, the sellers are auctioning rights to the \"preorder.\" One, originally listed for $999.99 is no longer available .\nAnother had been listed for $1,200.\nA third flamethrower, listed with a starting price of $18,700 , is still available for sale as of 4:45 p.m. on Monday, but no bids have been made .\nMusk seems to enjoy touting the swag on social media.\nFor example, when he first released The Boring Company caps, he instagrammed a photo of one with the caption, \"best hat ever.\" More recently, he posted a video of himself using a flamethrower, which ended with him breaking into a fit of giggling.\nAnd when The Boring Company customs regulations forbid shipping something called a \"flamethrower,\" Musk announced the company would get around the rule by dubbing the gadget, \"not a flamethrower.\"\nMusk's humor seems to be doing nothing but propelling demand.\nSee also:\nElon Musk invited 10 people who bought Boring Company hats to tour the LA tunnel\nElon Musk's Boring Company sells all of its flamethrowers in less than a week\nElon Musk says he's 'capping' production of Boring Company hats at 50,000 (that's $1 million worth)\nshow chapters Billionaire Elon Musk responds to unhappy Tesla customer 1:59 PM ET Mon, 18 Sept 2017 | 00:50 Like this story?
