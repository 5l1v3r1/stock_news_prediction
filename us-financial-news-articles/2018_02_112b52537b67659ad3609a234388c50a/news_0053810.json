Beijing will institute the rule in the Yellow River from April 1 to June 30 this year, Xinhua reported this week. Other water bodies, such as the Yangtze River and Pearl River, could also see annual bans. \nPeter Kovalev / TASS / Getty Images Even amid massive consumption of marine resources, biodiversity isn't entirely at risk. \n\"Significant regions of the ocean are not heavily fished, and these areas may offer opportunities for low-cost marine conservation, creating 'buffer-zones' which conservationists say help marine species to regenerate,\" the study said. \nWell-enforced policy can play a significant role in curbing over-exploitation, the authors found, adding that they hoped the study's high-resolution information on global fishing will pave the way for improved ocean management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T03:23:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
