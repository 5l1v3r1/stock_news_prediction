Goalie Devan Dubnyk made 22 saves in the victory.\nIt didn’t take long to see the Wild were destined to continue their hot streak. Zucker deflected Ryan Suter’s point shot past Jake Allen to open the scoring on a power play just 2:57 into the game. Then Granlund doubled the lead at 7:13 when Staal’s shot ricocheted off him and into the cage.\nAfter Vladimir Tarasenko gave the Blues a jolt of life at 9:59, which snapped his team’s goal-scoring drought at 150 minutes and 23 seconds, Granlund potted his second goal of the game at 11:17 of the high-scoring opening frame. That spelled the end of Allen’s night, the victim of three goals on eight shots.\nSt. Louis received a bit of life when Alex Pietrangelo scored 15 seconds into the second period to cut the Wild lead to 3-2, but it was pretty much all Minnesota from that point onward.\nStaal scored his first goal of the game at 8:19 of the middle frame, burying a rebound to make it 4-2, then Mikko Koivu converted a beautiful feed from Charlie Coyle at the 17:07 mark to make it a 5-2 affair.\nTarasenko netted his second of the game at 18:32 of the middle frame, but any Blues hopes for a comeback were dashed when Jared Spurgeon restored the Wild’s three-goal edge with 16 seconds remaining in the period.\nStaal scored a pair of third-period goals to give him seven goals and 12 points in a five-game scoring spree.\nHutton stopped 20 of 25 shots in his relief appearance for the Blues, who have lost five straight games in regulation and are winless in seven (0-6-1).\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:05:11.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
