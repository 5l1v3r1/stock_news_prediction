He added that he believed that if he were in the same situation, he would have run into the school “even if I didn’t have a weapon.”\nAn armed sheriff’s deputy who was assigned as the school resource officer resigned rather than face suspension. He was found to have stayed outside the building during the attack instead of going in to confront the gunman, according to Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.\nTrump has called the deputy, Scot Peterson, a “coward.”\nJoseph DiRuzzo, an attorney for Peterson defended his actions in a statement, saying he had remained outside because he believed the gunfire was occurring outside the school.\nInvestigators are also looking into reports from the neighboring Coral Springs Police Department that three other sheriff’s deputies who were outside the school during or just after the shooting failed to enter immediately.\nMoreover, Israel has acknowledged his investigators are examining whether his office mishandled two telephone tips in 2016 and 2017 that warned Cruz was collecting weapons and might be inclined to commit a school shooting.\nIsrael, a Democrat first elected sheriff in 2012, has come under sharp criticism from 74 Republican state lawmakers calling for him to be removed or suspended from office.
