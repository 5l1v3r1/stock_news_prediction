The Stars are 6-1-0 in their past seven games and 12-4-1 in their past 16 matches.\nSt. Louis, which owned a 29-16 edge in shots in the match, has lost three in a row and is now 8-5-1 in its past 14 games.\nAfter a scoreless first period in which the Stars managed just three shots on goal, Dallas broke through 2:42 into the second. Mattias Janmark scored on the power play as he fired a pass that deflected off a defender into the net behind St. Louis goaltender Jake Allen. John Klingberg and Martin Hanzal were credited with assists on the goal.\nThe Blues ended up outshooting Dallas 12-7 in the second period -- and 20-10 through the first two periods -- but had nothing to show for that advantage.\nDallas added an insurance goal midway through the third period as Johns beat Allen on the short side with a slap shot from near the boards after a pass from Jamie Benn. Marc Methot was also given an assist on the score.\nMethot had missed 41 of the Stars’ 42 games since Nov. 6 because of a knee injury.\nBrayden Schenn brought the Blues to within 2-1 when he beat Bishop for an unassisted goal on a power-play opportunity with 1:14 to play in regulation.\nDallas returns to the ice on Sunday at San Jose while the Blues’ next match is also against San Jose, on Feb. 20 in St. Louis.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:30:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
