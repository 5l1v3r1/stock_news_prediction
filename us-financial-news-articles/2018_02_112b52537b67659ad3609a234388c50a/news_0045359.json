UBS put the miss down to bigger than expected foreign exchange losses.\nSantos shares fell 2.2 percent to A$5.065, underperforming a small gain in the broader market.\nTribeca Investment Partners analyst James Eginton said the fall was due partly to the earnings miss and possibly because Gallagher said there had been no contact with Harbour.\nFor predators eyeing Santos, the big prize would be its stake in the PNG LNG project, run by ExxonMobil Corp, in Papua New Guinea, which is set to double exports under a plan broadly agreed by the project partners.\nGallagher said Santos is looking to buy into one of the gas fields, P‘nyang, that is set to supply the PNG LNG expansion to match its 13.5 percent equity stake in the project.\nSantos could also revive its dividend this year, given net debt is on track to fall below $2 billion by end-2018, a year ahead of target, but the company would stay disciplined.\n“I don’t think we want to be jumping ahead of ourselves and drinking our own Kool-Aid until we get there,” he said.\nReporting by Sonali Paul; additional reporting by Aaron Saldanha in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T07:07:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
