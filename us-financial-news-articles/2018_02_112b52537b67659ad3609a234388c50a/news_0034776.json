Did you’re (sic) papa teach you to cheat for the medal.”\n“If I find you, you will die,” wrote another on-line user before Boutin was forced to block her accounts.\nShort-track speed skating is the host nation’s favorite winter sport, with Koreans having won more medals there than in all other winter sports combined.\nFeb 13, 2018; Pyeongchang, South Korea; Kim Boutin (CAN) celebrates winning bronze in the women's short track speed skating 500m finals during the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Gangneung Ice Arena.
