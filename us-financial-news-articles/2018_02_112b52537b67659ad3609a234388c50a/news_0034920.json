I planned it in a way that suited me very well, and I‘m delighted that it turned out the way it did,” she said.\nEven though the race went according to plan, Nilsson revealed that Falla had caused her problems.\n“I felt the whole time in the long hill that Maiken was close to me, so I wanted to keep pushing the whole time, and I did,” she said.\n“I thought that it might finish in a spurt and I felt very strong in that today. That wasn’t what happened, but if it had happened, I would have been looking forward to that spurt.”\nFaced with a battery of microphones and cameras immediately after her victory, Nilsson stilt had not had a chance to plan her celebrations.\n“We’ll see - I’ve never won an Olympic gold before, so we’ll have to see how it turns out,” she said with a broad smile.
