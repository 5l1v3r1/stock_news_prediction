He was later replaced as Romania captain. \nNastase appealed against his sanctions and the independent tribunal announced on Wednesday that it had reduced the bans by eight months each. Nastase can now attend ITF team events from April 23 this year and work at them from April 23, 2020. \nHowever, his initial $10,000 fine has been doubled to $20,000. \nNastase can still be involved in men’s Association of Tennis Professionals and Women’s Tennis Association events as they lie outside of the ITF’s jurisdiction. \nNastase was heard speaking in Romanian to one of his team members about Williams’ baby during the draw for his country’s Fed Cup tie against Britain. \n“Let’s see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk?” the former French Open and U.S. Open champion was quoted as saying by multiple media outlets. \nNastase also put his arm around Keothavong at a news conference ahead of the tie and asked for her hotel room number. \n(This version of the story corrects to make clear in lead and para six that an independent tribunal, not the ITF, conducted the appeal) Reporting by Matt Westby; Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T17:54:49.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
