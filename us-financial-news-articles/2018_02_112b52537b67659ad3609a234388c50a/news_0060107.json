Man Group said strong client demand for emerging market debt, managed accounts in its fund of funds unit, FRM, and computer-driven strategies, combined with FX movements and the January 2017 acquisition of Aaalto, helped add $12.8 billion. “Man has a strong product shelf that continues to generate material new client demand... and indeed management commentary points towards an ongoing healthy pipeline,” said a note from analysts at Credit Suisse. Adjusted profit before tax was $384 million in 2017, up from $205 million in the prior year. Man Group said it expected ongoing costs associated with the European Union’s MiFID II regulation to add around $10-$15 million in costs from 2018 onwards.
