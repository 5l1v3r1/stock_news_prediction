NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE \nThe ANC called off a special meeting of its executive body on Zuma scheduled for last Wednesday after the president and Ramaphosa agreed to hold talks on a handover of power. \nThe party has only said that the talks were “constructive”. Related Coverage South Africa's Ramaphosa says working to resolve issue of Zuma's future \nANC spokesman Pule Mabe said the executive committee’s meeting on Monday had been brought forward from next weekend, because of the urgency of the leadership issue. \nZuma, who no longer holds a top position in the party, has not said whether he will resign voluntarily before his second term as president ends in the middle of next year. \nZuma also faces another no-confidence vote against his leadership in parliament on Feb. 22, brought by the ultra-left Economic Freedom Fighters party.
