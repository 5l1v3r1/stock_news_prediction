Higher network depreciation and amortisation from infrastructure investments also hurt earnings.\nUnderlying net profit, which excludes exceptional items, fell 8 percent.\nRegional affiliates in which Singtel owns stakes, such as India’s Bharti Airtel and Indonesia’s Telkomsel, are facing increased competition in their home markets, leading to lower profit contributions to Singtel in the quarter.\nSingtel’s revenue climbed 4.4 percent to S$4.6 billion, helped by stronger performance at its Group Digital Life unit, which includes services such as data analytics and digital marketing, and its Australian consumer business.\nSingtel said it maintained its full-year results forecast.
