It was unclear whether they would be prepared to shift their stance, despite growing international pressure.\nHowever Ghani, who recently helped launch the latest stage in a major regional gas pipeline from Turkmenistan, said the momentum for peace was building from neighbouring countries that increasingly saw the necessity of a stable Afghanistan.\n“The Taliban show awareness of these contextual shifts and seem to be engaged in a debate on the implications of acts of violence for their future,” he said.\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani poses for a group photo during a peace and security cooperation conference in Kabul, Afghanistan February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Omar Sobhani POLITICAL OFFICE Ghani said a framework for peace negotiations should be created with the Taliban recognised as a legitimate group, with their own political office to handle negotiations in Kabul or another agreed location.\nTaliban officials have acknowledged that they have faced pressure from friendly countries to accept talks and said their recent offers to talk to the United States reflected concern that they could be seen to be standing in the way of peace.\nSlideshow (6 Images) There was no immediate response to Ghani’s offer although one Taliban official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was being studied by senior Taliban leaders.\nGhani said the process would be accompanied by coordinated diplomatic support including a global effort to persuade neighbouring Pakistan, which Kabul has regularly accused of aiding the Taliban, of the advantages of a stable Afghanistan.\nHe renewed an offer of talks with Pakistan, which rejects the accusations and points to the thousands of its citizens who have been killed by militant groups over the years.\nIn return for Ghani’s offer, the Taliban would have to recognise the Afghan government and respect the rule of law, including the rights of women, one of the priorities for Afghanistan’s international partners.\nIn addition, Taliban prisoners could be released and their names removed from international blacklists, while security arrangements could be made for Taliban agreeing to join a process of reconciliation. Former fighters and refugees could be reintegrated and provided with jobs.\nThe United States last year stepped up its military assistance to Afghanistan, notably through a sharp increase in air strikes, with the aim of breaking a stalemate with the insurgents and forcing them to the negotiating table.\nWhile the U.S. military says the strategy has hit the Taliban hard, they still control or contest much of the country and continue to inflict severe casualties on Afghan forces.\nThey also claimed responsibility for two major attacks in Kabul last month that killed or wounded hundreds of civilians.\nAdditional reporting by Jibran Ahmad in PESHAWAR; Editing by Nick Macfie\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T08:01:55.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
