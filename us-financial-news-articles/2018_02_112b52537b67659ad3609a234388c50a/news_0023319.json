In the U.S., which contributes 29 percent of the group’s vehicle sales, it sees sales inching up 1.2 percent. U.S. INCENTIVES, INVENTORIES STING \nAs growth has slowed in the U.S. Nissan has been selling vehicles at bigger discounts than many of its rivals to shift stocks of older models, while also offering incentives on popular models like its Rogue SUV crossover. \nThat has stung profitability in North America and, along with other hefty costs related to vehicle inspections at home and inventory adjustments, prompted the automaker to downgrade its full-year operating profit on Thursday. \nNissan cut its operating profit forecast by 12 percent for the year ending March to 565 billion yen ($5.15 billion) from 742 billion yen last year. That would mark Nissan’s lowest profit since 2014. \nFor the third quarter, Nissan said operating profit halved to 82.4 billion yen, much lower than a mean estimate of 154.03 billion yen from nine analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nIt took a 41.8 billion yen hit on U.S. marketing and sales expenses, which include incentives, while costs related to improper procedures for final vehicle inspections in Japan had a negative impact of 39.6 billion yen. \nOperating profit in North America fell 37 percent in part because the company said it was unable to reduce its discounts as planned, due to the need to shift older models as newer ones hit the market. \nIt expects to sell 5.78 million vehicles in the year to March, down from a previous forecast for 5.83 million units, due to lower sales in Japan and Europe, although it expects stronger sales in China. \nA change in U.S. income tax policy late last year resulted in a positive impact of 207.69 billion yen on net profit. This one-time boost would vault net profit to a record high of 705 billion yen for the year, the company said.
