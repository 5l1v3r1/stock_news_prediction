The volatility on the foreign exchange markets remains a point of attention,” Smets told a news conference in Brussels in remarks embargoed until Friday.\nSmets, governor of Belgium’s central bank, said that as long as the stronger currency was supported by economic fundamentals, it did not pose a problem.\n“Only if, as we said last time after our monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt, this volatility becomes excessive, when certain levels are breached because of overshooting, because of a devaluation policy to increase competitiveness, can problems occur,” he added.\nSmets noted the strong euro did not help the ECB in reaching its target of bringing annual inflation close to but below 2 percent. Euro zone inflation was 1.3 percent in January.\n“A priori the (inflation) target is not aided by the appreciation of the euro,” Smets said.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:43:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
