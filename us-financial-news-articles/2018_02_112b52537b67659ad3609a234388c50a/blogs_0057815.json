GE reports first-quarter earnings on April 20. \nGE is adopting the new accounting standards as the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating GE over its accounting for long-term service contracts. \nGE also is facing potential legal action by the U.S. Department of Justice over allegations that its GE Capital unit and now-defunct WMC Mortgage Corp. unit violated U.S. law in connection with subprime mortgages, according to the filing. \nThe Financial Times first reported that GE plans to restate earnings.
