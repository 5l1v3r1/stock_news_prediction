The government hopes to raise 12.2 billion reais from the process. The proposal to end payroll tax breaks to improve revenue has been stuck in Congress for months.\nA second source in the economic team said ending the tax breaks was opposed by industries that will put pressure on lawmakers as they campaign for re-election in October.
