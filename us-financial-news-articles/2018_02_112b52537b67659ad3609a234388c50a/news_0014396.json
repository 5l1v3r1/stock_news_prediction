(Photo: Business Wire)\nMuñiz, a community leader of over twenty five years, founded MEIT in 1992 to pursue contract work in engineering and space. He launched the company with limited funds and landed his first prime contract with the Air Force nearly a year later. The company still has this contract today, as well as other work for the DOD and NASA throughout the country.\nIn addition to expanding company services to engineering services and solutions, modeling and simulation, space systems, design and integration, and IT/cyber services and solutions, Muñiz has always offered a helping hand to the community in various ways. Through MEIT, Muñiz has mentored other companies; given selflessly to organizations supporting STEM, the Hispanic-community, veterans, and his alma-mater Texas A&M University; and has served on various boards from education to technology.\nMurphy, who has been named as the company’s new Executive Chairman of the Board, has a tenure of over twenty years with the company. Previous roles in the company include Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Deputy Chief Executive Officer to Muñiz, and Chief Administrative Officer. Murphy also owns and operates Alpha Space Test and Research Alliance, an MEIT spin-off company.\n“I could not be happier than to leave the company in the hands of my daughter, Stephanie,” said Muñiz. “She and I have worked alongside each other now for over two decades. She understands the intricacies of the industry, is a poised leader and embodies the spirit of the company.”\n“It is an honor to follow in my father’s footsteps by serving the company and our employees as the executive chairman of the board,” stated Murphy. “I look forward to leading the company into the future with the support of our CEO, David Cazes, who has led our strategic growth over the last five years. Together, we will continue to strengthen and grow the company.”\nMurphy’s first line of business as Executive Chairman of the Board is to solidify company leadership within these new roles and to continue to lead a company with strong core values into the future.\nAbout MEI Technologies, Inc.\nMEI Technologies, Inc.
