Total number of subscribers decreased 1 percent in 2017 to 46.6 million dinars.\nZain said its Saudi Arabian unit recorded annual net profit for first time since inception and Iraqi returned to profit as customer base rose 16 percent.\nOman Telecommunications (Omantel) bought a 21.9 percent stake in Zain last year, making it the company’s second largest shareholder after Kuwait’s sovereign wealth fund, the Kuwait Investment Authority.
