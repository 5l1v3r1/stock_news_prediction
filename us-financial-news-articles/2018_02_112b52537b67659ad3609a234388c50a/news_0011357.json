It is also adding new production lines in Japan.\nAiming to reduce its dependence on Tesla, Panasonic recently partnered with Toyota Motor Corp to develop and supply batteries for electric vehicles.\nPanasonic also took control of Spanish auto parts maker Ficosa International SA last year, a deal that has helped lift the Japanese firm’s earnings.\n($1 = 109.9300 yen)\nReporting by Sam Nussey, Makiko Yamazaki and Yoshiyasu Shida; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Edwina Gibbs and Miral Fahmy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T10:32:16.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
