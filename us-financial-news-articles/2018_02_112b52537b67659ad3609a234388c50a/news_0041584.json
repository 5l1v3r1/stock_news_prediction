A Facebook page promoting Texas independence riddled with grammatical mistakes.\nThe U.S. indictment centered on a Russian troll farm only scratches the surface of the agency that allegedly produced content to sway the presidential election — and glosses over how unconvincing some of its stunts could be.\nMany of the more eye-popping accounts of the Internet Research Agency's activities have come from former employees.\nOne, Alan Baskaev, told Russian television channel Rain that the agency made a video that looked like a U.S. soldier shooting a Quran and hired actors in an abortive bid to fake a sex tape of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nThe AP couldn't confirm Baskaev's sex tape story. A video of a purported soldier firing at a Quran was posted to an American gun forum in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T23:52:48.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
