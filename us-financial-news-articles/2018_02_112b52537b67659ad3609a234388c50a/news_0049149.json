The British pound GBP= was 0.14 percent lower at $1.3975.\nThe Canadian dollar CAD= weakened to a nearly two-week low against its U.S. counterpart as oil prices fell.\nReporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; editing by Jonathan Oatis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T06:07:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
