There is no automaticity in this process,” Tusk said.\n“(European Commission President) Jean-Claude (Juncker) also presented the idea of a merger of our two posts, but there was no appetite to take this forward. Above all, because it would substantially reduce the role of Member States in the EU.”\nKnown from the German as the Spitzenkandidat, or lead candidate, system, it was introduced, against leaders’ wishes, for Juncker’s appointment in 2014.\nParliament has passed a resolution that it will withhold its required confirmation from any Commission president who is not a Spitzenkandidat for a party -- though that decision will be one for the next legislature elected in EU-wide voting in May 2019.\nJuncker himself has thrown the Commission’s weight behind the Spitzenkandidat idea, whose supporters describe it as an enhancement of EU democracy.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron talks with Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel during a European Union leaders informal summit in Brussels, Belgium, February 23, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman But Tusk rejected that argument, saying EU laws aimed for the Commission head to get “double legitimacy” from leaders and parliament -- both democratically elected. Limiting the choice for leaders by parliament would reduce democracy, not enhance it, he argued.\nThere was also no support among the leaders for Juncker’s idea to downsize the Commission, as all 27 members want their own commissioner.\n“The ideas presented by Juncker of merging the top jobs and cutting down the Commission are dead. The funeral was at the summit today and it was a silent one,” one EU diplomat said, saying not a single leader spoke in favour of the proposals.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker during a European Union leaders informal summit in Brussels, Belgium, February 23, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman POWER PUSH While Parliament is pushing for more power in Brussels as a way of improving the EU’s image as a democratic project, many national leaders insist that they are more representative of people’s wishes than a legislature for which less than half of the electorate bothered to vote.\nMany are also concerned that limiting the choice of the influential head of the Commission to those free to campaign for the EU election restricts their ability to nominate, for example, serving heads of government to the post.\nJuncker will step down in November next year. The Council should nominate his successor after the May 2019 elections in time for the new Commission president to name a line-up of commissioners to be confirmed by Parliament.\nAt Friday’s summit, leaders agreed with Parliament’s proposals for reducing its size and reallocating some seats after Britain leaves the Union in March 2019.\nLeaders also backed an initiative by French President Emmanuel Macron to allocate some British seats to new, pan-European constituencies would not be considered for next year but should be studied for the 2024 elections. Many states are sceptical of the notion of “transnational lists”.\nMacron’s proposal to launch “citizens’ consultations” on the future of the EU ahead of the 2019 election was accepted by all leaders except Hungary. Macron will launch that project on April 17 in Strasbourg.\nReporting by Alastair Macdonald, Jan Strupczewski, Gabriela baczynska and Samatha Koester; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:11:15.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
