Medical costs typically rise faster than inflation, and most insurers typically report annual increases of 6 percent, plus or minus 100 basis points. \nCordani was responding to analyst questions about a new healthcare venture announced by JPMorgan Chase, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon.com Inc Corp, saying they needed to address too-high healthcare costs that were hurting business.
