Yes, it has come during an already complicated period,” Barnsley’s chief executive Gauthier Ganaye said. \n“It will make things more difficult short term, but our club is full of resources and it is certainly not dependent on one man alone.” \nHeckingbottom will begin his Leeds tenure with Saturday’s Yorkshire derby against Sheffield United in the league at Bramall Lane. \nLeeds, three-times English champions, lie 10th in the second-tier standings and have not recorded a league win since Dec. 26.
