His talks were also expected to cover the sensitive U.S.-China economic relationship after recent tit-for-tat actions that have raised fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. \n“Both sides reaffirmed President Trump’s and President Xi’s commitment to keep up pressure on North Korea’s illegal weapons and nuclear programs,” State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a news briefing. \nNauert said Tillerson and Yang “agreed on the importance of continuing a constructive and productive relationship aimed at cooperation on mutual challenges and addressing our differences forthrightly.” \n“They discussed the need to achieve a fair and reciprocal bilateral economic relationship and shared approaches to stemming the flow of deadly narcotics,” Nauert said, adding that the two looked forward to continuing discussions at an annual diplomatic and security dialogue in the first half of 2018. \nYang said at the start of his meeting with Tillerson that he would seek to “push forward our very important relationship.” \nBeijing and Washington share concerns about North Korea’s development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States. \nChina has backed successive rounds of U.N. sanctions on North Korea, but has been wary of U.S. efforts to toughen these further and has been accused by U.S. officials of not fully implementing existing U.N. steps. \n“We expect, we hope that China will do more, because we know they can do more in terms of adhering to U.N. Security Council resolutions,” Nauert said. \nThe latest trade data shows China’s massive goods surplus with the United States narrowed last month, but not to the extent necessary to appease Washington. \n“Our president has made very clear our concerns about trade imbalances,” Nauert said. \nU.S. President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels last month and is considering recommendations on import restrictions for steel and aluminium or other trade sanctions against China over its intellectual property practices. \nIn response, at the weekend, China’s commerce ministry launched an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probe into imports of sorghum from the United States. \nTillerson upset Beijing last week when he accused China of behaving like an imperial power in Latin America. \nChina’s   said earlier on Thursday that Beijing hoped North and South Korea could maintain the momentum of their current rapprochement and gradually open the door to peace. \nWashington has welcomed a resumption of intra-Korean talks that has led to North Korea’s participation in   open in South Korea on Friday. \nBut both the United   have said they have no plans to meet during the Olympics, dampening hopes that the Games will help ease tensions.
