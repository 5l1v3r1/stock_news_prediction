Goals by Ryan Sessegnon and Aleksandar Mitrovic in each half gave Fulham a deserved win at Craven Cottage and kept them firmly in the hunt for promotion. Aston Villa moved to within a point of second-placed Cardiff with a 4-2 win at Sheffield Wednesday while Derby County remain fourth after a 3-3 draw at Reading. Fulham, unbeaten in the league since the turn of the year, are fifth, five points adrift of Cardiff who host sixth-placed Bristol City on Sunday.
