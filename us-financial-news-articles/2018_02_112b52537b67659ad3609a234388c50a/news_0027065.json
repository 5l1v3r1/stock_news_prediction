Zuma’s tenure as president officially runs until mid-2019.\n“The National Executive Committee of the ANC will be meeting tomorrow to discuss this very matter, and because our people want this matter to be finalised, the NEC will be doing precisely that,” Ramaphosa told a rally in Cape Town on Sunday.\nThe ANC leader said on Wednesday he and Zuma were holding direct talks over the transfer of power.\nZuma has not said in public whether he will step down voluntarily. His spokesman could not be reached for comment.\nThe rand has tended to strengthen on signs that Zuma could be ousted before his second term as president ends next year, and might firm more if the NEC demands that he go.\nZuma survived calls last year by some members of the NEC for him to quit. But analysts say this time around a bigger section of the party wants him out.\nIn 2008, shortly after taking the party’s helm, Zuma engineered the ousting of Thabo Mbeki from the presidency.\nSince Zuma became president in 2009, he has been dogged by scandal. He is fighting the reinstatement of 783 counts of corruption over a 30 billion-rand (now $2.5 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s when he was deputy president.\nSome within the ANC and the opposition say the Gupta family, friends of Zuma, have used their links with the president to win state contracts and influence cabinet appointments. The Guptas and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing.
