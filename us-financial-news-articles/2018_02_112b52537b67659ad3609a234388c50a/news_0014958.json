Buyers in 15 of the 27 metropolitan areas surveyed saw no change, while growth in eight areas was offset by declines in the remaining four.\nIn Toronto, which represents 25.5 percent of the overall market in Canada, prices stalled for the sixth time in seven months.\nCompared to December 2016, Toronto prices gained 4.7 percent, down from the year-over-year peak of 9.9 percent in April 2017, when the provincial government announced measures to cool the market in the city and surrounding areas. Statscan said higher mortgage rates may also have helped moderate prices.\nIn Vancouver, another hot market where authorities have intervened, prices edged up by 0.2 percent. Builders cited strong demand as the main driver.\nThe new housing price index excludes apartments and condominiums, which the government says are a particular cause for concern and which account for one-third of new housing.\nReporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:45:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
