Critics say the practice skews elections while intensifying political polarization.\nPennsylvania has long been seen by experts as one of the worst offenders. The 7th Congressional District, in particular, has been derided as \"Goofy Kicking Donald Duck\" for its bizarre, twisting outline.\nThe court gave lawmakers until Friday to submit a map to Wolf, who has until Feb. 16 to accept or reject it. Otherwise, the court will draw its own map with an independent expert.\nRepublicans have held 13 of the state's 18 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives since the current map went into effect for the 2012 election, despite Pennsylvania's status as a closely divided swing state.\nNew districts will likely increase Democratic chances to win several seats. The party needs to capture 24 seats nationwide to retake control of the House in November elections.\nRepublicans criticized the court's majority for waiting until Wednesday to issue an opinion fully outlining its legal reasoning.\nRepublicans have also not ruled out filing a federal lawsuit challenging the court's authority to draw its own map. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected an emergency appeal from Republican lawmakers challenging the state court's ruling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T15:07:00.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
