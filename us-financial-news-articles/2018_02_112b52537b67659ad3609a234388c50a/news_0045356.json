It was just the second loss for the Hogs in 16 home outings.\nKnox scored 12 of his points in the second half as the Wildcats turned what had been a tight battle into a comfortable victory. They outrebounded the Razorbacks 46-29 with their 18 offensive rebounds leading to 16 second-chance points.\nThe Hogs went without a field goal for nearly eight minutes in the second half to go from a 68-65 deficit to an 83-70 hole with 2:33 left in the game.\nArkansas guard Daryl Macon led all scorers with 26 points.\nAfter falling behind by double digits in less than three minutes, Kentucky fought back to a 20-20 tie approaching the midpoint of the first half. The Wildcats took their first lead 35-34 on forward PJ Washington’s jumper.\nThe score was tied in the last minute of the first period before Washington’s steal led to a layup and free throw with 18 seconds left that gave the Wildcats a 43-40 lead. However, Macon’s 3-pointer at the buzzer made it a 43-43 deadlock at the break.\nKentucky established early command of the boards with 23 rebounds to 17 for Arkansas before halftime.\nThe two teams went back and forth in the opening minutes of the second half and were tied five times just over five minutes into the period.\nThen, after Arkansas assumed a 61-56 lead on guard Anton Beard’s 3-pointer, the Wildcats responded with a 9-0 run that led to a 22-4 spurt and 78-65 lead with just under seven minutes left in the game.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:44:09.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
