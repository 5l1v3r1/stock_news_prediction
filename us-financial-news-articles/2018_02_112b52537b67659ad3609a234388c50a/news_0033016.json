They declined to be named as the talks were private.\nTerms under discussion were not immediately available, but Flipkart would be valued at more than the $12 billion figure given when Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp’s ( 9984.T ) Vision Fund took roughly a fifth of the firm last year for $2.5 billion, they added.\nA spokesman for Flipkart said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. An India-based representative for Walmart declined to comment.\nFILE PHOTO: Men walk past the logo of Walmart outside a store in Monterrey, Mexico February 12, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File Photo A deal with Walmart would give Flipkart much needed muscle in its fight against Amazon, which has committed to investing $5 billion in India as it expands aggressively, including into online grocery deliveries.\nFor Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart, a deal would open a new front in its efforts to take on Amazon, giving the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer access to an e-commerce market that Morgan Stanley has estimated will rapidly grow to be worth $200 billion in a decade.\nIt would be part of a huge e-commerce push that has seen Walmart acquire a slew of start-ups including paying roughly $3 billion for online retailer Jet.com. Last month it also said it was partnering with Japan’s Rakuten Inc ( 4755.T ) in online grocery deliveries.\n“As large as they are, Amazon has eaten away a significant chunk of their revenues and I think... they view India as the largest market possibly for this (taking on Amazon),” one of the sources said.\nWalmart has for years tried to enter India but has remained confined to a ‘cash-and-carry’ wholesale business amid tough restrictions on foreign investment. It currently operates 21 such stores in India.\nExisting investors in the Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart also include U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management, China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd ( 0700.HK ), online marketplace eBay Inc ( EBAY.O ) and software giant Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ).\nReporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T10:50:07.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
