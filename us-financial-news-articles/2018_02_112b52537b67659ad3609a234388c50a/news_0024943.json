(NYSE: IRS; BYMA: IRSA), the leading real estate company in Argentina announces today its results for the second quarter of FY 2018 ended December 31, 2017.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first semester of FY 2018 was ARS 7,166 million (ARS 1,459 million from the center of operations in Argentina and ARS 5,707 million from the center of operations in Israel), increasing by 38.0% compared to the same semester of 2017 (20% of increase in the center of operations in Argentina and 44% in the center of operations in Israel). Net result for the six months' period registered a gain of ARS 10,831 million compared to a gain of ARS 6,816 million in fiscal year 2017, mainly explained by a higher result due to a change in the fair value of investment properties due to the impact of the tax reform implemented in Argentina and for the effects of the exchange rate on them, offset by the loss recorded in our center of operations in Israel as a result of the partial debt swap made by Discount Corporation Ltd. (\"DIC\"). Tenant Sales in our malls grew by 22.6% during the first semester of FY2018 while the average rent of the office portfolio reached USD/sqm 26.9. Adjusted EBITDA of the rental segment increased by 18.6% in the compared semester. We reached 99.1% occupancy in our shopping malls, 93.2% occupancy in our offices and 71.5% in our hotels' portfolio. In October 2017, we have sold in the secondary market 10.2 million shares of IRSA Commercial Properties for a total amount of USD 138.2 million. In December, 2017, IRSA acquired, through Dolphin, the remaining 31.7% of IDBD held by IFISA reaching 100% stake in IDBD's share capital.\nFinancial Highlights\n(In millions of Argentine Pesos)\nIIQ18\nEnded December 31, 2017\nIncome Statement\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n(adjusted)\nRevenues\n43,040\n36,831\nConsolidated Gross Profit\n13,763\n11,206\nNet result from changes in the fair value of investment properties\n11,502\n3,470\nConsolidated Profit from Operations\n15,957\n6,182\nProfit For the Period\n10,831\n6,816\nAttributable to:\nIRSA's Shareholders\n8,918\n3,835\nNon-Controlling interest\n1,913\n2,981\nEPS (Basic)\n15,51\n6,67\nEPS (Diluted)\n15,40\n6,62\nBalance Sheet\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n(adjusted)\nCurrent Assets\n79,912\n65,492\nNon Current Assets\n180,626\n165,750\nTotal Assets\n260,538\n231,242\nCurrent Liabilities\n48,052\n46,434\nNon Current Liabilities\n154,680\n137,472\nTotal Liabilities\n202,732\n183,906\nNon-Controlling Interest\n27,221\n21,472\nShareholders' Equity\n57,806\n47,336\nIRSA Inversiones y Representaciones S.A.
