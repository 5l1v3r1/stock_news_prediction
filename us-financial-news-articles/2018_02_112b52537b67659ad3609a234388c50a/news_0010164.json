Owen Farrell, George Ford and Jack Nowell added one apiece and Farrell kicked four conversions and a penalty. \nDespite the scoreline, Italy, who took the wooden spoon in the last two years, were refreshingly positive and replied with two tries of their own from Tommaso Benvenuti and Mattia Bellini with Tommaso Allan kicking a conversion and penalty. \nEngland lost scrumhalf Ben Youngs in the first half when he suffered a knee injury.
