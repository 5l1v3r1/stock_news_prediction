Terms of the transaction are not being disclosed.\nMackevision’s creation, visualization and production services are used for online product configurators, digital and print catalogues, virtual showrooms, point-of-sale kiosks and augmented and virtual reality experiences, as well as broadcast video and feature films. Mackevision has developed a differentiated ability to leverage engineering data to construct ‘digital twins’ of complex physical products. By applying the latest techniques in CGI, visual effects and AR/VR, Mackevision can generate nearly any type of visual content from these twins – effectively turning engineering data into truly immersive product experiences and virtual applications.\nFounded in 1994, Mackevision has a team of more than 500 employees and is headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany, with offices in Munich and Hamburg as well as in the United States, United Kingdom, China, South Korea and Japan.\n“Mackevision has a deep roster of highly relevant creative and technical talent in emergent capabilities, and operates with mature offerings on a global scale,” said Jamie Posnanski, global content practice lead, Accenture Interactive. “It’s rare to find this combination in the market.

The acquisition of Mackevision will help Accenture Interactive significantly accelerate its ability to envision, create and operate XR solutions at scale for its clients and help drive the future of the XR market which, according to industry analyst firm IDC, is predicted to rise to $162 billion by 2020.*\nAbout Accenture\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.
