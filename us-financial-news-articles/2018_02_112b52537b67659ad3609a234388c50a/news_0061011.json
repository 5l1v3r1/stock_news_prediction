They face allegations ranging from misappropriation of state properties to unexplainable assets.\nTwo of Rajapaksa’s sons, Namal and Yoshitha, have been arrested and released on bail over money-laundering allegations.\nOne of his brothers, Basil, who headed the economic development ministry, has also been arrested at least three times, twice over suspicion of misuse of anti-poverty funds and once over suspicion of laundering money. He is free on bail.\nAll the Rajapaksas deny wrongdoing.\nThe government has yet to fulfill the promises it campaigned on. Those include a new constitution aimed at devolving some powers to provincial governments dominated by ethnic minorities, facilitate an international probe into alleged war crimes in the final phase of Sri Lanka’s war against the Tamils, and fiscal discipline efforts sought by the International Monetary Fund.\nNationwide elections are not due until 2020.\nReporting by Shihar Aneez, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T18:35:21.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
