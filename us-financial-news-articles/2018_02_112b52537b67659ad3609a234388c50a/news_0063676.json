IHOP aims to raise $5 million to honor its 60th anniversary of serving up fresh flapjacks. \n“At IHOP, we think doing good is delicious. Every stack of pancakes we serve on our signature day counts toward helping our charity partners improve the health and lives of millions of children and families across the country,” IHOP president Darren Rebelez said in a statement. \nThe free pancake deal for National Pancake Day 2018 will extend to IHOP locations in Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam and Mexico.
