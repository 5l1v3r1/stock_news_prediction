It will be a good learning base for us,” Furber said, adding that what it develops in India will also be relevant for other emerging markets such as Africa that are yet to look at electrification.\nThe move by Cummins comes when India has set an ambitious target to electrify all new vehicles in the country by 2030, and it wants to push the electrification drive through mass public transport like buses and taxis.\nFurber said once India develops regulations for electric vehicles and customers begin to adopt them, Cummins will start investing in setting up manufacturing in the country.\nThe engine maker’s local unit said in September that commercial vehicle makers in India have asked it to look into electric mobility solutions.\nCummins has said it globally plans to invest $500 million over the next three years to develop an electrified powertrain product line, and the engineers in India will also do work for other global markets.\nReporting by Aditi Shah, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T20:49:13.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
