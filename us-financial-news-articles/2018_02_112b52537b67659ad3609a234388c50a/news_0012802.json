Slovenians can now retire at the age of 60. \nShe also said Slovenia’s largest bank, Nova Ljubljanska Banka, must be partly privatised, as agreed with the European Commission in 2013 in exchange for state aid. And the government should not keep a majority stake, she said, because no government can resist politically influencing its bank. \nSlovenia plans to sell 75 percent of the bank and keep a stake of 25 percent to have a say in key business decisions. HIGH TAXATION \nSmuc said that people with the highest wages pay taxes on wages and personal income that together reach a rate as high as 70 percent, which is not acceptable. \n”It is hard to attract professionals from abroad after they calculate what would be the difference between their gross and net income,“ she said. ”On top of that, young Slovenians are leaving the country, also due to high taxes. \nShe rejected public-sector demands for a large increase in wages, saying most public services have not improved enough in recent years to warrant the increases. \nWaiting on an exam at a doctor-specialist has lengthened and the average waiting time for a construction permit is about 270 days, 43 days more than 10 years ago. \nNext week, police, nurses and teachers are planning separate strikes to demand higher wages. In January, about 30,000 other public servants held a one-day strike for wage increases . \nSmuc said the public-sector wage bill should not increase by more than 4.4 percent this year, as the government’s budget plan calls for. \nThe government expects the economy to expand 3.9 percent this year, boosted by higher exports and investments. The European Commission earlier on Wednesday raised its forecast for growth to 4.2 percent from an earlier 4 percent.
