Maybe the new management is less inclined to do so,” he said.\nAnalysts at Agency Partners also said that there was possibly “a bit of conservatism in overall guidance”.\nThe company said sales of the Eurofighter Typhoon jet would fall this year as it finishes filling older orders.\nIt said its Applied Intelligence division, which provides governments with defences against cybercrime, would only break even after a restructuring.\nWoodburn has made a number of organisational changes since taking the helm, including cutting 2,000 jobs to reflect lower Typhoon production.\nSince announcing the cuts, however, BAE has struck a deal with Qatar to sell 24 Typhoons, and Woodburn said more sales could follow.\n“The opportunity book for Typhoon is as good as I’ve seen it in the last two years and probably as good as it’s been in quite some time,” he told reporters on a call.\nBAE aims to win orders from Belgium and Malaysia as well as existing customer Saudi Arabia.\nNone of those potential deals were counted in BAE’s guidance, Woodburn noted.\nBAE said its 2017 underlying earnings per share rose 8 percent to 43.5 pence, meeting forecasts, helped by growing demand for its advanced precision kill weapon rockets as well as a rise in orders for the U.S.-built F-35 jet.\nReporting by Sarah Young; editing by Paul Sandle and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T14:13:22.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
