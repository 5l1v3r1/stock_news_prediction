(“Okta”) (NASDAQ: OKTA) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $300 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “notes”) in a private offering (the “offering”) to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Okta also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $45 million aggregate principal amount of the notes.\nThe notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Okta, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Okta’s Class A common stock or a combination thereof, at Okta’s election. The interest rate, conversion rate and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering.\nIn connection with the pricing of the notes, Okta expects to enter into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its Class A common stock with one or more financial institutions, which may include one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates (the “option counterparties”). The convertible note hedge transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the notes sold in the offering. Okta also expects to enter into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which Okta will sell warrants for the purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, of up to the same number of shares of its Class A common stock. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to Okta’s Class A common stock upon conversion of any notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Okta is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of the Class A common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Okta expects to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions and additional warrant transactions with the option counterparties.\nOkta expects that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will purchase shares of Okta’s Class A common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Class A common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Okta expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Class A common stock or other securities of Okta in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so following a conversion of the notes or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could also cause a decrease or avoid an increase in the market price of the Class A common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following a conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes.\nOkta expects to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described above (after such cost is partially offset by the proceeds to Okta of the warrant transactions described above), and to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering of notes for general corporate purposes. While Okta may use a portion of the proceeds for acquisitions, Okta does not have any specific planned acquisitions at this time.\nThe notes will only be offered to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Neither the notes nor the shares of Okta’s Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, or will be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\nThis announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.\nAbout Okta\nOkta is the leading independent provider of identity for the enterprise.

It also securely connects enterprises to their partners, suppliers and customers.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “ ” the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding the proposed terms of the notes, the size of the notes offering, including the option to purchase additional notes to the initial purchasers, the extent, and potential effects, of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the potential dilution to Okta’s Class A common stock, the conversion price for the notes and the expected use of the proceeds from the sale of the notes, and other statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts.
