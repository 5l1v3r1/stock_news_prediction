Images of the Mercedes-powered FW41 were shown on a big screen at a launch in London, without the car being physically present. Those who had hoped to see it in the flesh will have to wait until testing in Barcelona on Feb. 26. The car is the first under Lowe’s guidance, with the Briton joining from dominant Mercedes last March with plenty of expectation. “No pressure, Paddy,” joked deputy principal Claire Williams.

Sirotkin, 22, replaces retired Brazilian Felipe Massa. Slideshow (3 Images) The gulf between Williams and fourth-placed Force India, who have the same Mercedes engines and operate on a similar budget, ballooned to 104 points least year from 35 a season earlier. McLaren, now with Renault engines after ditching Honda following three dismal seasons together, and Renault’s own works team are also expected to be breathing down their necks. Williams were, however, the only team outside Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull to finish on the podium last season thanks to Stroll’s third place in Azerbaijan. The Canadian, now 19, was the youngest rookie podium finisher in the sport’s history and also the youngest front row starter. “I am a different person to where I was last year,” said Stroll. “I learned from the tough times... and I enjoyed the good times.” Poland’s Robert Kubica, who had been hoping to return to the starting grid for the first time since a 2011 rally accident partly severed his right arm, will be the team’s reserve and development driver. The season starts in Australia on March 25.
