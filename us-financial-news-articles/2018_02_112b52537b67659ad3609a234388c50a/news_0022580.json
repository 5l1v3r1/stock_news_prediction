Australian world number 10 Jason Day was also in the mix after carding a three-under-par 69 at Spyglass Hill.\nThe event, which features a 54-hole cut before the final round is contested at Pebble Beach, is wildly popular given the celebrities that compete alongside some of golf’s biggest names.\nAmong the non-golf celebrities competing this week are actor Bill Murray, Justin Verlander of the World Series champion Houston Astros, Canadian ice hockey great Wayne Gretzky and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T02:47:26.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
