The fourth quarter 2017 net income includes $150 million related to the gain on the sale of Glass Mountain Pipeline, which was offset by approximately $120 million of non-cash write downs related to the held for sale assets of SemMaterials Mexico and SemLogistics. Additionally, SemGroup recorded a deferred tax expense adjustment of $18 million primarily due to the U.S. tax rate change.\nAdjusted EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $111.5 million in fourth quarter 2017, compared to $90.7 million in third quarter 2017 and $66.2 million in fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled to net income below.\nFor full-year 2017, SemGroup reported net loss of $17.2 million, compared to net income of $2.1 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $328.3 million in 2017 and $282.8 million in 2016.\n\"Our higher fourth quarter results include a full quarter of secure cash flow contributions from our new Gulf Coast assets in addition to strong results from our Canadian business,\" said SemGroup President and Chief Executive Officer Carlin Conner. \"Since last June we have added, on a full-year basis, almost $200 million of high-quality Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we have raised nearly $800 million in the last few months with announced sales of non-core businesses and a preferred equity transaction, the proceeds of which we plan to use to fully pay the second HFOTCO payment by the end of the first quarter and to fund future growth. The five percent dividend increase we announced today coupled with our earnings outlook for 2018 underscore the dependability of future cash flows from our transformed portfolio and the success of our recent funding initiative. Looking ahead, we are focused on fiscally disciplined, value-adding growth as we enhance our strategic positions in Canada, the Mid-Continent and on the Gulf Coast.\"\nRecent Developments\nLast week, SemGroup announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its SemLogistics business unit, a petroleum storage facility in the United Kingdom, to Valero Logistics UK Ltd, a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation. In addition to the sale price, the agreement provides for potential earnout payments to be made to SemGroup if certain revenue targets are met in the four years following close of the transaction. SemGroup intends to use proceeds from the sale toward its capital raise plan and to pre-fund capital growth projects. The SemLogistics sale is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2018, subject to the receipt of certain governmental approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nSegment Profit\nStarting with the fourth quarter 2017, SemGroup revised its segment reporting performance measure from segment Adjusted EBITDA to segment profit. SemGroup management believes segment profit is a valuable measure of the operating and financial performance of the company's operating segments. Segment profit is defined as revenue, less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and operating expenses, plus equity earnings and is adjusted to remove unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and to reflect equity earnings on an EBITDA basis. A summary of segment profit to Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 and 2017 can be found on SemGroup's website.\nThe amounts reported for Corporate and Other for 2016 and 2015 have been recast to include SemGroup's former U.K. and Mexico segments which, subsequent to our acquisition of HFOTCO, are no longer expected to be significant for separate presentation. Corporate and Other is not an operating segment.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, Segment Profit: 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 Crude Transportation $ 41,641 $ 29,434 $ 34,585 $ 133,505 $ 119,726 Crude Facilities 14,116 15,494 8,806 41,967 47,039 Crude Supply and Logistics (1,507 ) 13 (1,693 ) (7,801 ) 24,003 HFOTCO 33,032 — 28,504 61,536 — SemGas 14,539 19,227 15,555 67,805 66,530 SemCAMS 23,668 10,511 16,704 76,274 53,264 Other and eliminations 8,153 9,523 8,421 33,237 39,534 Total Segment Profit $ 133,642 $ 84,202 $ 110,882 $ 406,523 $ 350,096\nSelect Operating Statistics 1Q 2017 2Q 2017 3Q 2017 4Q 2017 Crude Transportation Transportation Volumes (mbbl/d) 179 182 190 193 White Cliffs Pipeline Volumes (mbbl/d) 111 107 105 92 Crude Facilities Cushing Terminal Utilization % 100 % 94 % 94 % 100 % HFOTCO Average Terminal Utilization % N/A N/A 98 % 99 % SemGas (1) Total Average Processing Volumes (mmcf/d) 287 277 265 252 SemCAMS (2) Total Average Throughput Volumes (mmcf/d) 414 349 414 452 (1) SemGas volumes include total volumes processed - Northern Oklahoma and Sherman, Texas\n(2) SemCAMS volumes include total volumes processed - K3, KA and West Fox Creek facilities\nPerformance by Segment Profit - Fourth Quarter 2017 vs. Third Quarter 2017\nCrude Transportation's increase was driven by a full quarter contribution from Maurepas Pipeline partially offset by lower White Cliffs Pipeline volumes. Crude Facilities recognized approximately $5 million related to a take-or-pay deficiency at Platteville. HFOTCO contributed $33 million in its first full quarter as a SemGroup asset. SemGas reflects lower Mississippi Lime volumes in the fourth quarter. SemCAMS reflects a $3.5 million increase due to a take-or-pay deficiency recognition and producer recoveries, coupled with an increase in volumes.\nFunding Initiative\nSemGroup has raised approximately $790 million from asset sales and a preferred equity transaction. In December, SemGroup closed on the sale of its 50 percent ownership in Glass Mountain Pipeline, LLC for approximately $300 million. In January, SemGroup closed on the private placement of $350 million of preferred shares with investment funds managed by Warburg Pincus, CIBC Atlantic Trust and Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. In addition, SemGroup is selling its SemMaterials Mexico and SemLogistics businesses for an estimated combined proceeds of $140 million, with expected close in March and by the end of the third quarter 2018, respectively.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Dividend\nIn accordance with the Board of Directors' annual year-end review of the company’s financial performance, business outlook and dividend policy, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of $0.4725 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend of $1.89 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 19, 2018 to all common shareholders of record on March 9, 2018.\nBased upon current outlook for growth, the company is targeting at least a 5 percent annual dividend growth rate through 2019.\n2018 Guidance\nSemGroup expects full-year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $385 million and $415 million.\nSemGroup does not provide guidance for net income, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA, because Net Income includes items such as unrealized gains or losses on derivative activities or similar items which, because of their nature, cannot be accurately forecasted. SemGroup does not expect that such amounts would be significant to Adjusted EBITDA as they are largely non-cash items.\nSemGroup is forecasting 2018 capital expenditures of $350 million, including approximately $40 million related to maintenance projects.\nEarnings Conference Call\nSemGroup will host a conference call for investors at 11 a.m. Eastern, Feb. 26, 2018. The call can be accessed live over the telephone by dialing 855-239-1101, or for international callers, 412-542-4117. Interested parties may also listen to a simultaneous webcast of the conference call by logging onto SemGroup's Investor Relations website at www.semgroupcorp.com . A replay of the webcast will be available following the call. The fourth quarter and full-year 2017 slide deck will be posted under presentations.\nAbout SemGroup\nBased in Tulsa, Okla., SemGroup ® Corporation (NYSE:SEMG) is a publicly traded midstream service company providing the energy industry the means to move products from the wellhead to the wholesale marketplace. SemGroup provides diversified services for end-users and consumers of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, residual fuel oil and asphalt. Services include purchasing, selling, processing, transporting, terminalling and storing energy.\nSemGroup uses its Investor Relations website and social media outlets as channels of distribution of material company information. Such information is routinely posted and accessible on our Investor Relations website at www.semgroupcorp.com , our Twitter account and LinkedIn account.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nSemGroup’s non-GAAP measures, Adjusted EBITDA and Total Segment Profit, are not GAAP measures and are not intended to be used in lieu of GAAP presentation of net income (loss) and operating income, respectively, which are the most closely associated GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for selected items that SemGroup believes impact the comparability of financial results between reporting periods. In addition to non-cash items, we have selected items for adjustment to EBITDA which management feels decrease the comparability of our results among periods. These items are identified as those which are generally outside of the results of day to day operations of the business. These items are not considered non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, but do erode comparability among periods in which they occur with periods in which they do not occur or occur to a greater or lesser degree. Historically, we have selected items such as gains on the sale of NGL Energy Partners LP common units, costs related to our predecessor’s bankruptcy, significant business development related costs, significant legal settlements, severance and other similar costs. Management believes these types of items can make comparability of the results of day to day operations among periods difficult and have chosen to remove these items from our Adjusted EBITDA. We expect to adjust for similar types of items in the future. Although we present selected items that we consider in evaluating our performance, you should be aware that the items presented do not represent all items that affect comparability between the periods presented. Variations in our operating results are also caused by changes in volumes, prices, mechanical interruptions and numerous other factors. We do not adjust for these types of variances.\nTotal Segment Profit represents revenue, less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and operating expenses, plus equity earnings and is adjusted to remove unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and to reflect equity earnings on an EBITDA basis. Reflecting equity earnings on an EBITDA basis is achieved by adjusting equity earnings to exclude our percentage of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from equity earnings for operated equity method investees. For our investment in NGL Energy, we exclude equity earnings and include cash distributions received. Segment profit is the measure by which management assess the performance of our reportable segments.\nThese measures may be used periodically by management when discussing our financial results with investors and analysts and are presented as management believes they provide additional information and metrics relative to the performance of our businesses. These non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they excludes some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Management compensates for the limitations of our non-GAAP measures as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most comparable GAAP measure and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results. Because all companies do not use identical calculations, our presentations of non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters contained in this Press Release include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
