Serbia must conclude and irreversibly implement a legally binding agreement with Kosovo,” Hahn told a news conference in Belgrade. \nHe stopped short of saying whether Serbia must fully recognize Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008 almost a decade after a NATO bombing campaign ended a crackdown by Serbia against independence-seeking ethic Albanians there. \nKosovo has been recognized by 115 countries, including 23 out of 28 EU members, but its UN membership is being blocked by Serbia’s allies Russia and China. \nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who met Hahn and appeared alongside him at the news conference, praised EU strategy as an opportunity for integration for Serbia, which is still reeling from isolation and devastating wars in 1990s. \nVucic, a former Serb nationalist who changed his views in the past decade to become a supporter of closer integration with Europe, described a deal with Kosovo as a “mountain of obstacles” which could be achieved only if “everybody loses something”. A plebiscite would be needed, he said. \n“The people will have to decide, ... whether they see their future in Europe, for which we will have to pay a costly price, or we can go on like this, at Europe’s tail.” \nOn Wednesday, Aleksandar Vulin, the defense minister and Vucic’s top ally, said Belgrade and Pristina should partition Kosovo. \nBefore it joins the EU, Serbia will also have to solve open border issues with Croatia and Bosnia, its foes from the 1990s wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia. \nBelgrade will also have to reform its slow and unwieldy judiciary, improve rule of law, tackle the freedoms of the media and safeguard minority rights. \n“If we solve ... problems we will accelerate like a rocket,” Vucic said.
