The company has promised “an extensive and impartial investigation into all of the facts.” \nMarciano’s office didn’t immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment. \nIn an interview with Time Magazine earlier this week, Upton said about her experiences with Marciano: “It took a huge toll on my confidence and self-worth. I wanted to quit modeling. I constantly blamed myself after it happened: What am I doing to invite someone to treat me like that or grab me like that?” \n“The culture of complacency and tolerance in our industry needs to stop,” she said. “The people around in the corporate offices or around the harassers every day know of every time they do this. They’re the ones who need to speak out.” \nGuess shares are down about 8 percent for the year, having cratered following Upton’s initial accusations on Jan. 31. The stock is up about 16 percent from a year ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T22:42:31.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
