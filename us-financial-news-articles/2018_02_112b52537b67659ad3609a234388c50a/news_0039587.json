Revenue rose 21 percent to a record $395.8 million while cloud revenue surpassed $100 million.\nAnalysts had expected earnings of $1.32 per share on revenue of $394.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nFor 2018, Nice forecast adjusted EPS of $4.40-$4.60 and revenue of $1.43-$1.454 billion. Analysts were forecasting adjusted EPS of $4.48 on revenue of $1.44 billion.\nFor the first quarter Nice estimates adjusted EPS of 97 cents to $1.03 and revenue of $328-$338 million.\nNice has been banking on analytical tools, which allow companies to assess large amounts of data to spot fraud and security threats, to deliver faster growth.\n“Our addressable market has increased five-fold,” Nice CEO Barak Eilam said. “Cloud, which now represents approximately 30 percent of our total revenue, is expected to grow to more than 50 percent of our total revenue in the years to come.”\nAnalytics will continue to expand with the addition of artificial intelligence, he said, adding the company expects to continue to grow operating income at a double digit rate.
