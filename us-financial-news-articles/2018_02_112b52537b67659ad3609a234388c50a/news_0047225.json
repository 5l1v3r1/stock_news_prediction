Adherence to (the) agreement has been relatively good,\" Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ bank, said in a report on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:34:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
