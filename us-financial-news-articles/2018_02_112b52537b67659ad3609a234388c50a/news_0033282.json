Net unit growth also saw a decline at 1.1%, compared to 1.8% in 2016. The source of this information, Technomic's 2018 Top 500 Chain Restaurant Advance Report, is the industry's leading chain performance tracker, providing a one-year sales forecast by menu category, an expanded outlook and opportunities section, as well as key themes to help navigate the current industry landscape.\nThe advance report is available for purchase prior to the full report's publication at the end of March at https://www.technomic.com/available-studies/industry-reports/top-500 .\n\"Chains today are facing increasingly challenging business conditions, with most publicly held chains seeing mixed same-store sales results in 2017,\" said Joe Pawlak, Technomic managing principal. \"Among these challenges lie the rise of retail foodservice and other meal options. Additionally, consumers are becoming accustomed to a stronger deal environment, forcing operators to lessen their margins to stay competitive.\"\nKey report findings include:\n2017 sales growth was heavily driven by limited-service chains, up by 4.1% Fast casual is once again the leading subsegment, with 8.9% sales growth in 2017 Full service sales growth slowed from 1.4% growth in 2016 to 0.5% in 2017 One of the fastest growing chains, Walk-On's Bistreaux & Bar, is also new to the rankings\nOther new entrants into the Top 500 chain rankings include Jinya Ramen Bar, bartaco and Naf Naf, who all grew their sales by over 20%. Out of the twenty fastest-growing chains, half of them are fast-causal concepts, proving that this subsegment is still the bright spot in the industry. Exceptional sales growth was also seen from the fine-dining subsegment which experienced a 3.8% increase, with growth led by Texas de Brazil Churrascaria, Ocean Prime, STK and Fogo de Chao.\nNote: The results reported here are preliminary and subject to revision.\nTo purchase or learn more about this and other industry reports from Technomic, please visit Technomic.com or contact one of the individuals listed below.\nContacts:\nPress inquiries: Joe Pawlak, (312) 506-3940, jpawlak@technomic.com\nPurchasing details: Patrick Noone, (312) 506-3852, pnoone@technomic.com\nAbout Technomic\nTechnomic Inc., a Winsight company, delivers a 360-degree view of the food industry.
