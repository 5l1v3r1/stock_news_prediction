REUTERS/John Sibley \nAs the music for his short program - Chopin Ballade No. 1 - began to play, he executed a few moves of his routine, skated to the center of the ice, bowed and left the rink. But even that was enough for one Japanese wire service to issue an alert. \nTo reporters he said only “I look forward to your support” before disappearing. Slideshow (2 Images) \nOn Sunday, when Hanyu arrived in South Korea, Hanyu said he was looking forward to competing. \n“I’ve had to miss a lot of events, and that was really frustrating for me. I‘m glad to finally be here,” he said. \nAsked about the chances of a golden repeat, he said: “I’d be lying to myself if I said I wasn’t thinking about this. I do want to win back-to-back golds, but that isn’t my only goal.” \nHanyu, whose fans follow him around the world shouting “Yuzu!” and showering the ice with flowers and stuffed animals, is set for a longer practice on Tuesday. \nThe men’s singles competition begins on Friday with the short program to be decided on Saturday.
