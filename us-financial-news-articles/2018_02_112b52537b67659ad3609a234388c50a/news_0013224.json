But it does not have to be like that.” \nWithout the tunnel, passenger traffic between the cities is expected to grow from 9 million in 2017 to 14 million by 2050. With the tunnel, the traffic would grow to 23 million, of which 10 million would still be transported by ferries. \nThe feasibility study estimated the tunnel would cost 13-20 billion euros, hoping that 40 percent of the costs would come from the European Union. \nA 2015 Helsinki report had a smaller price tag for the project, 9-13 billion euros. \nThe governments said they would evaluate the results in more detail during the spring. \nA rival project, led by Angry Birds maker Rovio’s former executive Peter Vesterbacka, is seeking Chinese funding for a tunnel that would take a different route and open earlier than the governments’ plan. \nThe Finnish government, however, said it was focused on its own plan. \n“We have one project ... there will be room for innovation, but we have just one project,” said Anne Berner, Minister of Transport and Communications. \n($1 = 0.8100 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T16:22:20.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
