In response to the #OscarsSoWhite social media campaign, it has broadened its white, old and male-dominated membership to invite more women and people of colour into its 8,000-strong ranks. \nAddressing the class of 2018 nominees at an annual luncheon, Bailey said the 90-year-old Academy was reinventing itself with programmes committed to inclusion and diversity ”in today’s era of a greater awareness and responsibility in balancing gender, race, ethnicity and religion.’ 90th Oscars Nominees Luncheon– Arrivals – Los Angeles, California, U.S., 05/02/2018 – President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences John Bailey. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni \nAs a 75-year old white man, Bailey said he was gratified that “the fossilised bedrock of many of Hollywood’s worst abuses are being jack-hammered into oblivion.” \nNominees for this year’s Oscars, to be handed out in March, include female director Greta Gerwig and African-American director Jordan Peele, Rachel Morrison as the first Oscar-nominated female cinematographer, four black actors, and movies that range from female-driven stories to romantic fantasy, war films and contemporary reflections on race. Slideshow (6 Images) \nBailey did not directly refer to the sexual misconduct scandal that has jolted Hollywood and led to dozens of actors, directors, producers and agents being fired, forced to step down or dropped from creative projects. \nThe Hollywood awards season has consequently been dominated by passionate speeches about female empowerment, calls for equal pay and better opportunities for women in front of and behind the camera, and solidarity with victims of sexual harassment. \nThe Oscar winners are voted on by the 8,000 members of the Academy of Motion Pictures and will be handed out at a ceremony in Hollywood on March 4.
