Lieberman’s leading privileged identity and credential management technology combined with Bomgar’s superior privileged access and session management capabilities significantly improves enterprises’ ability to fight cyberattacks.\nATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bomgar, a leader in secure access solutions , today announced that it has acquired Lieberman Software , a provider of best-in-class privileged identity and credential management software. Lieberman’s Rapid Enterprise Defense™ (RED) Suite focuses on the critical elements of enterprise cybersecurity, systems configuration, and privileged identity management that enable organizations to successfully prevent cyberattacks as well as quickly remediate compromised environments. With the acquisition, Bomgar will now offer a comprehensive Privileged Access Management (PAM) platform that provides unparalleled protection against the most pervasive and dangerous cyber threats.\nRemote access is the most common attack pathway for hackers, and the majority of today’s data breaches involve a stolen privileged credential. Bomgar gives organizations the ability to proactively address these threats by providing the most comprehensive approach to securing access to critical systems and ensuring that the credentials to those critical systems are actively managed and protected. The acquisition of Lieberman Software significantly accelerates Bomgar’s mission to help organizations connect fearlessly by adding advanced technology to discover, manage, and protect privileged credentials while simultaneously identifying and neutralizing attacks.\n“The addition of Lieberman Software underscores our commitment to delivering world-class secure access solutions that significantly enhance the security posture of our customers without forcing them to compromise business agility or sacrifice productivity,” said Matt Dircks, CEO of Bomgar. “Lieberman Software is a company with deep security DNA, a portfolio of best-in-class security solutions, and a long list of highly-satisfied customers. We’re excited to welcome the Lieberman team to the Bomgar family, and look forward to providing the exceptional products and service that both Bomgar and Lieberman customers have come to enjoy. With our combined technologies, we will deliver a true defense-in-depth PAM solution with a quick time to value, rapid deployments, and a winning user experience.”\n“We’re thrilled to join Bomgar and add our solutions and expertise to its leading Secure Access platform,” said Philip Lieberman, founder and CEO of Lieberman Software. “Lieberman’s customers and partners will continue to benefit from our innovative privileged identity and credential management solutions, with the added value of Bomgar’s secure remote and privileged access technology. As a combined company, we can further lead the market in developing modern PAM solutions that solve the most complex enterprise challenges.”\nAccording to Gartner, “Through 2021, organizations with privileged access management (PAM) tools will have at least 50% lower risk of impact by advanced threats as compared to their peers without PAM tools. 1 ” Bomgar currently offers a seamless integration between Lieberman’s credential management functionality and Bomgar’s privileged session management capabilities. The acquisition will result in a single PAM offering with market-leading capabilities for:\nPrivileged Account Auto-Discovery : Reliably discover and secure the widest range of privileged accounts across enterprises.
