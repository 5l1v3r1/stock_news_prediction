Chief Financial Officer Robert Doyle explained the rate will moderate in the second half.\nDomain’s acting CEO, Nick Falloon, who also chairs both Domain and Fairfax, said some “truly impressive” candidates had applied for the permanent position vacant since Antony Catalano abruptly quit in December.\nHe gave no timeline on the recruitment process.\nDomain declared an interim dividend of 4 cents per share.
