While Ryanair says talks are ongoing in seven countries, only British union BALPA has signed a recognition agreement.\n“We expect some adverse publicity ... and some disruptions,” O‘Leary told a news conference in Lisbon. “We had a strike in Germany on Dec. 22... we expect the next one will be in Ireland - or maybe it will be in Portugal - during Easter week.”\nNo flights were cancelled during the four-hour Dec. 22 strike.\nIrish pilot union FORSA/IALPA has not announced plans to strike, but it has said pilots had rejected an offered raise and that Ryanair was refusing the union’s demand to be recognised as the exclusive body for collective bargaining.\nPortuguese cabin crew union, SNPVAC, have said they will decide this week when to strike, with a maximum of three days in late March and three days in early April, union official Fernando Gandra told Reuters on Wednesday.\nThe strike was motivated by “worsening labour conditions, a lack of respect for the dignity of the cabin crew ... and threats over sales objectives,” he said. Ryanair says it offers staff some of the best conditions in the low-cost sector.\nO‘Leary said he was making “significant progress” in talks with Portuguese pilots union SPAC, but that management would only open talks with cabin crew after agreement had been reached with pilots.\nHe said management had offered a pay increase directly to Portuguese pilots, bypassing the union, and that 75 percent of pilots had accepted the offer.\nRyanair last year flew 130 million passengers from 87 bases across Europe, including four bases in Portugal and four in Ireland. It says it operates around 20 percent of Portugal’s 28 million annual flights and 48 percent of Ireland’s 18 million.
