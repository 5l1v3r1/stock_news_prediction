This remarkable performance demonstrates the value of our underwriting discipline, our portfolio construction with highly diversified and profitable business segments and our gross-to-net strategy. Together these have enabled us to deliver positive returns to our shareholders in a year marked by high frequency of severe catastrophes.”\nMr. Clarke also added: “We have started 2018 on a very positive note, with strong execution at the January renewals where we benefited from pricing improvements across a broad span of our portfolio with a double-digit rate increase in North America Property Cat rates along with improving profit margins in most of our Specialty lines and other P&C segments globally. We have leveraged opportunities to expand our business relationships with our clients and brokers and further improve our portfolio, with double digit year-on-year growth in Non-Life renewable treaty premium. I am very confident that we will continue to build on these achievements to deliver great results in 2018.”\nPlease click here to access the PartnerRe News page for the full release.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221006144/en/\nPartnerRe Ltd.\nJaime Masters, +1 441 294 5209\njaime.masters@partnerre.com\nSource: PartnerRe Ltd.", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221006144/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fpartnerre.com%2Fnews%2F&esheet=51762307&newsitemid=20180221006144&lan=en-US&anchor=click+here&index=1&md5=a069e6300c6116bc10fbdca3dffbaaec"], "published": "2018-02-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T01:14:49.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
