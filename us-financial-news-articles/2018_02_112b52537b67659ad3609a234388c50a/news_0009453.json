Washington, for example, set up a social media network for Cubans called ZunZuneo even after Gross had been jailed. It ran from 2010 to 2012. \nIn the case of Gross, he imported banned satellite communications devices and other high-tech gear in his luggage and helped install it at Jewish centres in Havana, Santiago and Camaguey during five trips to Cuba in 2009. \nGross noted Cuba had vastly expanded internet access of its own volition during his time in jail. \nThe U.S. government should discuss the issue of internet directly with Cuba, providing details for example of how it could boost economic growth, he said. \n“There are so many things that could be happening in a positive and constructive way,” he said. \nSince Obama’s detente for example, various U.S. telecoms companies have reached deals with Cuba to provide roaming to their customers on the island. \nAsked if it had invited Cuban officials to the first public meeting on Feb. 7 of the task force, the U.S. State Department said it was “open to the public as space allows.” \n“Federal Advisory Committees, such as this task force, provide objective advice in a transparent manner from a variety of perspectives, and are accessible to the public,” it said. \nGross said he would return on vacation to Cuba “in a heartbeat” if Cuban officials let him, to meet up with the families of his former fellow inmates and explore the country.
