He estimated that earnings fell by around 5 percent due to the higher oil price. \nVietnam Airlines JSC, which is also unhedged, said fuel surcharges were now being applied in a move that would push up fares but could gradually lead to lower demand from passengers. \n“Especially for passengers traveling for tourist purposes when they see it (fares) past a certain level they say no,” Vietnam Airlines CEO Duong Tri Thanh said. \nThe carrier had budgeted for an average jet fuel price of $75 a barrel this year but it has already gone past $80, he said. Jet fuel <0#JETSGSW:> is more expensive than a standard barrel of oil due to refining costs. \nOther airlines in the Asia Pacific region have put in place hedging programs to help insulate the financial impact of an oil price rise. \nAustralia’s Qantas Airways Ltd, which hedges a substantial amount of its fuel requirements, expects its fuel bill will rise by A$200 million ($158.82 million) this year. \nThe airline, however, has forecast it will report record-level first-half earnings of up to A$950 million as it adds more fuel-efficient jets and cuts costs elsewhere in its business. \n“Despite fuel prices being higher than last year, we are digesting fuel very well at the moment,” Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said. \nIrish low-cost carrier Ryanair said earlier that it expects higher oil prices to push up short-haul airfares in Europe, but not until 2019. \n($1 = 1.2593 Australian dollars) \n(This version of the story corrects spelling of Vietnam Airlines CEO’s name in paragraph 8) Reporting by Jamie Freed; additional reporting by Brenda Goh Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Louise Heavens", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T04:07:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
