It also said it aims to double that this year to more than 1 billion pounds and to reach more than 5 billion pounds in 2022.\nBAT reported full-year revenue up 37.6 percent at 20.29 billion pounds ($28.17 billion), shy of an expected 20.55 billion pounds, according to analysts at RBC Capital Markets.\nExcluding the impact of last year’s acquisition of Reynolds American and a weak pound, adjusted organic revenue rose 2.9 percent, also below analyst estimates. Adjusted volumes of cigarettes and tobacco heating products, meanwhile, fell 2.6 percent, which BAT said was less than the decline across the industry as a whole.\nThe contribution of BAT’s Glo tobacco-heating product was small last year because it had been present in only a few markets and faced capacity constraints, BAT said, adding that it plans to bring it to 14 additional markets this year.\nAdjusted earnings per share rose about 10 percent to 284.4 pence, excluding the impact of a gain related to the Reynolds deal and a deferred tax credit. That was ahead of estimates.\nThe company is again aiming for high single-digit earnings growth in 2018, in line with its ongoing ambitions, skewed toward the back half of the year, said Jerome Abelman, director of legal and external affairs.\nEarnings will gain a 6 percent lift from the change in U.S. corporate tax, though the company expects half of this to be reinvested in the rollout of next-generation products.\nBAT shares were down 4.8 percent to 42.35 pounds at 1023 GMT.\nReporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:41:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
