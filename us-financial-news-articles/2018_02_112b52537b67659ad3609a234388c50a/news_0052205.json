Once the buyer was able to secure the necessary entitlements for the site, the deal was closed at $28.5 million.\nThe buyer plans to develop the site into 220 residential units with approximately 7,000 sq. ft. of retail space. The property was previously home to Tower Car Wash and a Chevron gas station. Located on a triangular plot at the corner of Mission Street and South Van Ness Avenue, the design carves out a mid-block passage in the center of the site, connecting the two major roads with a retail-lined corridor.\n\"We were excited to be involved in putting this deal together with the right buyer and seller and help facilitate more housing opportunity that our city desperately needs,\" said Hans Hansson, President, Principal and Founding Partner of Starboard Commercial Real Estate.\nFor more information on Starboard Commercial Real Estate and to review current property listings, please visit www.starboardnet.com .\nAbout Starboard Commercial Real Estate\nStarboard Commercial Real Estate is the largest independently owned commercial real estate company in San Francisco, California.
