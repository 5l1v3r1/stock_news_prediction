The shipper supports restricting assault rifles to the military and opposes allowing civilians to use them. ( bit.ly/2EUzRvH )\n“While we strongly support the constitutional right of U.S. citizens to own firearms subject to appropriate background checks, FedEx views assault rifles and large capacity magazines as an inherent potential danger to schools, workplaces, and communities when such weapons are misused,” FedEx said.\nAs for discounts, it added that “FedEx has never set or changed rates for any of our millions of customers around the world in response to their politics, beliefs or positions on issues.”\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2EUzRvH", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:26:52.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
