(NASDAQ:IRTC), a leading digital health care solutions company focused on the advancement of cardiac care, today reported financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Highlights\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 54% to $98.5 million over 2016 Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased 51% year-over-year to $28.2 million Gross margin for the full year 2017 was 71.9%, a year-over-year improvement of 450 basis points Exited the year with 86 sales representatives\n\"I’m pleased with the progress our team made throughout 2017 in not only achieving, but in many cases, surpassing the goals we set for the year. I am also very proud of the influence we continue to make on the clinical practice of diagnosing and managing patients with cardiac arrhythmias,” said Kevin King, CEO. \"Overall trends in our business remain very encouraging and we see increasing opportunity to grow our share of the ambulatory monitoring market through further expansion of our sales organization, continued penetration in large hospital networks, and making progress with payor contracting. In addition, we believe there is a real opportunity to further extend the market for our Zio service by addressing additional patient populations with unmet clinical needs and we look forward to the results of several ongoing clinical trials in 2018.”\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nRevenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased 51% to $28.2 million, from $18.7 million during the same period of the prior year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased volume of the Zio XT service.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $20.5 million, or 72.7% gross margin, up from $12.9 million, or 69.1% gross margin, for the same period of the prior year.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $31.1 million, an increase of 80% compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by selling, general and administrative expenses used to expand the company’s sales force, SOX 404 compliance related expenses and increases in the company’s stock based compensation expenses.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.1 million, compared to $6.3 million for the same period of the prior year.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 54% to $98.5 million, from $64.1 million in 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased volume of the Zio XT service.\nGross profit for the year was $70.8 million, or 71.9% gross margin, up from $43.2 million, or 67.4% gross margin, in the same period of the prior year.\nOperating expenses for the year were $98.1 million, an increase of 67% compared to the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by selling, general and administrative expenses used to expand the company’s sales force and support the growth in operations.\nLoss from operations for 2017 was $27.3 million, compared to $15.6 million from the prior year.\nCash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments were $105.4 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAccounting Standards Update: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update entitled Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The company adopted the standard January 1, 2018 and it is using the modified retrospective approach recognizing the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance as an adjustment to its opening accumulated deficit balance, which will have no effect on the company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2017. Prior periods will not be restated.\nThe adoption will result in a change to net revenue primarily due to the recognition of bad debt expense related to the patient responsibility of both contracted and non-contracted claims as a reduction of gross revenue rather than as a component of selling, general and administrative and, to a lesser extent, due to timing differences in its recognition of revenue related to non-contracted third-party payor claims as a result of changing from recognition based on the earlier of notification of the payor benefits allowed or when payment is received to the accrual basis based on historical experience.\nFor comparison purposes, the following table is provided:\nEstimated Topic 606 Impact (Unaudited) Year ended December 31,\n2017\n(in millions) 2014 2015 2016 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Total Cumulative Accrual revenue / cash receipts, net $ 0.8 $ 2.6 $ (0.8 ) $ (1.1 ) $ (0.7 ) $ (0.2 ) $ (0.2 ) $ (2.2 ) $ 0.4 Bad debt expense (0.2 ) (0.7 ) (1.1 ) (0.3 ) (0.6 ) (0.6 ) (1.4 ) (2.9 ) (4.9 ) Total revenue adjustments 0.6 1.9 (1.9 ) (1.4 ) (1.3 ) (0.8 ) (1.6 ) (5.1 ) (4.5 ) Sales, general & administrative expense (0.2 ) (0.7 ) (1.1 ) (0.4 ) (0.8 ) (0.7 ) (1.5 ) (3.4 ) (5.4 ) Net income (loss) adjustments $ 0.8 $ 2.6 $ (0.8 ) $ (1.0 ) $ (0.5 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (1.7 ) $ 0.9\nGuidance for Full Year 2018\niRhythm projects revenue for the full year 2018 to range from $126 to $131 million, inclusive of Topic 606, which represents 35-40% growth over the company’s prior year, also inclusive of Topic 606. Gross margins for the full year 2018 are expected to range from 70% to 72% and operating expenses for the full year 2018 to be between $124 and $129 million.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\niRhythm’s management team will host a conference call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. PT / 4:30 p.m. ET.
