Specifically, management has defined core earnings as: GAAP net income adjusted to (i) eliminate the impact of quarterly mark-to-market changes on the fair value of long-term investments (and associated derivatives) related to changes in benchmark interest rates and credit spreads, (ii) include the cumulative net gains or losses on long-term investments accounted for as trading securities under GAAP that were sold during the period presented, net of any gains or losses from derivatives associated with the investments sold, and (iii) include the hypothetical income taxes associated with core earnings adjustments.\nManagement utilizes this core earnings measure internally as one way of analyzing Redwood's performance over multiple periods, as it believes it provides useful comparative results absent the impact of certain quarterly mark-to-market changes and other items that management believes are not reflective of core results. Core earnings should not be utilized in isolation, nor should it be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or other measurements of results of operations computed in accordance with GAAP. A further discussion of core earnings is included in the fourth quarter Redwood Review.\n(3)\nAdjustments eliminate the mark-to-market changes on the fair value of loans held-for-investment, trading securities, other investments, and associated derivatives that are primarily related to changes in benchmark interest rates and credit spreads. Details on the components of investment fair value changes, net, are included in the Appendix of the fourth quarter Redwood Review.\n(4)\nAdjustment includes the cumulative net gains or losses on long-term investments accounted for as trading securities under GAAP that were sold during the period presented, net of any realized gains or losses from derivatives associated with the investments sold. Cumulative gains and losses are calculated by multiplying the difference between the sales price and original purchase price by the face value of the securities sold.\n(5)\nWe apply estimated effective tax rates to core earnings adjustments occurring within Redwood's taxable REIT subsidiaries to estimate the hypothetical income tax expense or benefit associated with those adjustments.\n(6)\nConsistent with the calculation of net income per diluted common share for GAAP purposes, non-GAAP core earnings per diluted common share is calculated following the \"two-class\" method. Additional information on the calculation of core earnings using the \"two-class\" method can be found in Table 2 in the Financial Tables section of the fourth quarter Redwood Review.\nREDWOOD TRUST, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets (1)\n31-Dec\n30-Sep\n30-Jun\n31-Mar\n31-Dec\n($ in millions, except share and per share data)\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\nResidential loans\n$\n5,115\n$\n4,185\n$\n3,905\n$\n3,472\n$\n3,888\nReal estate securities\n1,477\n1,356\n1,219\n1,166\n1,018\nMortgage servicing rights\n64\n63\n64\n111\n119\nCash and cash equivalents\n145\n258\n217\n222\n213\nOther assets\n240\n269\n251\n243\n245\nTotal assets\n$\n7,040\n$\n6,131\n$\n5,655\n$\n5,214\n$\n5,483\nShort-term debt\n$\n1,939\n$\n1,238\n$\n1,295\n$\n564\n$\n792\nOther liabilities\n149\n166\n152\n135\n148\nAsset-backed securities issued\n1,165\n944\n693\n728\n773\nLong-term debt, net\n2,575\n2,574\n2,336\n2,621\n2,621\nTotal liabilities\n5,828\n4,922\n4,476\n4,049\n4,334\nStockholders' equity\n1,212\n1,209\n1,179\n1,166\n1,149\nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n7,040\n$\n6,131\n$\n5,655\n$\n5,214\n$\n5,483\nShares outstanding at period end (thousands)\n76,600\n77,123\n77,117\n77,039\n76,835\nGAAP book value per share\n$\n15.83\n$\n15.67\n$\n15.29\n$\n15.13\n$\n14.96\n(1)\nCertain totals may not foot due to rounding.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/redwood-trust-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-results-300602422.html\nSOURCE Redwood Trust, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.redwoodtrust.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/redwood-trust-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-results-300602422.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T01:07:58.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
