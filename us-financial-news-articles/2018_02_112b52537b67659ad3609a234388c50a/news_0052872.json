Yeah, sure. And we are going to expand the Buffalo Art Museum without making it bigger.”\nIn the interview, Mnuchin said the economic policies of President Donald Trump and his administration could successfully lift the wages of American workers without triggering overall higher inflation.\nOn CNBC, Gundlach said: “Inflation is inflationary. If inflation is going up in a certain sector, like wages, then all things being equal, inflation is going up. Sure, there could be some other sector that inflation goes down, but that’s not happening right now.” (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Steve Orlofsky)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:08:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
