So I think we need to go lower to generate a level of fear and capitulation that can bring a bottom.\"\nThe market has been on a wild ride since Friday's drop. On Monday, the Dow plunged 1,175 points and on Tuesday it seesawed a total of 1,167.5 points before closing 567 points higher. On Wednesday, the blue-chip index posted its biggest one-day reversal since August 2015.\nThe Dow fell more than 650 points at its lows of the day Thursday.\n\n\"This is about a valuation readjustment,\" Paulsen said. \"We have to find a lower valuation level for stocks and bonds to sustain this bull [market].\"\nWhile some have blamed the sell-off, in part, on concerns about higher interest rates and inflation, Mike Vogelzang, president and chief investment officer of Boston Advisors, points to a \"small corner of the sandbox\" — those who were in short volatility funds.\nTwo in particular have stood out amid the market tumult of the last few days: the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures and the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV).\nBoth trade using leverage and provide inverse returns to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), a key measure of market expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option prices. It's sometimes called the \"fear gauge.\"\n\"They all forgot to take their Ritalin and at the end of the day they took a couple of trillion dollars off of market capitalizations around the world,\" Vogelzang said in an interview with \"Power Lunch.\"\nThat said, he believes some parts of the equity market needed a breather. \n\"At this part of the cycle, this is all about economic momentum, a synchronized global economy, great corporate profits,\" Vogelzang said. \"That's going to eventually trump this volatility trade.\"\n— CNBC's Fred Imbert and Jeff Cox contributed to this report. \nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T20:56:29.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
