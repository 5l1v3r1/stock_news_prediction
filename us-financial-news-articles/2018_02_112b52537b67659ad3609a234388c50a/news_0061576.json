The country was ranked the ninth best country to be a social entrepreneur in a 2016 poll of 45 nations conducted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and funded by Deutsche Bank.\nBut Majidah said the help was short-lived, fuelling concerns in Malaysia as well as elsewhere in Southeast Asia that official encouragement of the sector was stumbling as businesses were found to need more guidance and time than expected to succeed.\n“It was like they were pregnant with us, they gave birth and they left us there,” Majidah told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe 20-million-ringgit ($5 million) plan has so far pushed the number of social enterprises up to about 200, according to the Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Center (MaGIC), a government unit tasked with running the project.\nThis has led to concerns in Southeast Asia’s third largest economy that momentum to build the social enterprise sector is fizzing out with patchy official support and issues like a lack of funding and financial sustainability.\nMajidah received a 30,000 ringgit grant from MaGIC to help kickstart her business and attended one of its programmes where she learned about social enterprises.\n“When we graduated we were very energized. We got to know a lot of people, we were out there and ready to run our business,” she said.\n“But very shortly after that, the whole (social enterprise) department was disbanded. There was little follow up from MaGIC on how my company is doing.”\nFILLING THE GAP Like Thailand and the Philippines, Malaysia is among Southeast Asian countries which have tried to tap the potential of social enterprises - businesses which aim to address social and environmental problems while making a profit.\nRapid economic growth in the region in recent decades has seen nations become wealthier but failed to tackle social challenges such as urban poverty, unequal access to education and environment sustainability.\nThis is where Southeast Asian governments hoped social enterprises could step in to help plug the gap, as most countries have traditionally had low tax models meaning state welfare systems are not comprehensive.\nDespite concerns, MaGIC insisted there has been strong growth in the sector and its initiatives have helped aspiring social entrepreneurs and raised public awareness.\n“We are currently at the three-year mark and are still running initiatives and programs to increase the number of social enterprises,” Chief Executive Ashran Dato’ Ghazi said in a statement to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nIts initiatives include an accreditation scheme which aims to help social enterprises enhance their profile.\nWhile social enterprises should be financially independent, in countries where they have been a success, supportive policies have been seen as vital.\nOne example is Britain, where the government has invested heavily into the sector and the number of social enterprises has grown to 70,000, according to Social Enterprise UK, an organization which represents the sector.\nIts policies include encouraging government procurement officers to consider the social and environmental impact of contracts they award rather than just going with the lowest bid.\nTrying to gain a foothold in the market remains one of the biggest barriers for Malaysian social entrepreneurs, said entrepreneur Mastura Rashid who runs The Nasi Lemak Project.\nMastura sells a traditional coconut rice with spicy shrimp paste dish known as “nasi lemak”, or “fatty rice”, made by poor families living around the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur.\nMastura also received a grant from MaGIC and enjoyed a steady flow of business but she had to cut back her operation last year by reducing the number of delivery orders.\nShe said the orders tended to be for small quantities so the profit made was barely enough to cover costs. She now only focuses on big orders but these are scant.\n“It boils down to the issues of costs and human resources,” she said, adding she needed a strategic rethink to keep her business sustainable.\n‘A REAL NEED TO SOLVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS’\nProblems have plagued other official efforts to help social enterprises in the region.\nIn Thailand, there are an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 social enterprises, according to the Thai Social Enterprise Office set up by the government in 2010 to boost the sector.\nBut momentum slowed after a 2014 military coup and the office has now been dormant for nearly three years.\nIn the Philippines, where the number of social enterprises has more than tripled over the last decade to about 165,000, over half said limited capital was the biggest barrier to grow their business, according to a 2017 study by the British Council and the Philippine Social Enterprise Network.\nSimilarly in Singapore, the government-backed Singapore Center for Social Enterprise - which supports about 400 of these organizations - said in a 2017 report that many struggle to survive beyond the first two to three years of their business.\nSingapore, the Philippines and Thailand were ranked fourth, 20th and 29th respectively in the 2016 Thomson Reuters Foundation poll.\nMajidah, however, was confident that there was appetite for socially responsible products like her tea, even if authorities failed to step up to the plate.\n“There is a very real need to solve social problems in Malaysia. If you have socially-responsible products and looking to recruit single mothers, ex-drug addicts or juvenile delinquents, there is still a need for that,” she said.\n“There are enough caring Malaysians who will support your products.”\nReporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
