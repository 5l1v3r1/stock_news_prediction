That had put several states, which jointly run the program with the federal government, on track to run out of money earmarked for children's health care within months.\nThe budget deal also would devote $6 billion to efforts to fight opioid abuse and would fund community health centers — which provide services for 26.5 million Americans — for at least the next two years.\nThe deal also calls for another $4 billion for veterans' hospitals and $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health.\nThe deal was announced Wednesday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., and the minority leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T20:41:08.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
