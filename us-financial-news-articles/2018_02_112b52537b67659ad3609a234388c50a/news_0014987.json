Intuit Courtesy of Intuit \nEmployees say: “There is a sense of community. Whether it is to answer the call of urgent help needed by a local non-profit or to help one of our own, the company is full of great people who rally together to help. For example, an organization that helps homeless teens had their pantry robbed. One of the Intuit employees found out and started an immediate food drive and everyone started contributing. That’s just one example.” \n“I’m very proud that one of our values is “We Care and Give Back,” this is a genuine value, from the special weeks of service Intuit holds to the fact that we have up to 32 hours a year we can spend on volunteer activities to serve our community.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . \nU.S. headquarters: Mountain View, Calif.
