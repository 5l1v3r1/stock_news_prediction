The company did not respond to Reuters’ requests to speak to him directly. \nA Renault spokesman said: “We do not comment on rumours and speculation.” A French government spokesman did not return calls seeking comment. \nAt least two directors - other than Desmarest - have raised concerns about the recruitment process and its outcome, sources told Reuters. \n“External candidates were not so much as considered,” said a person with knowledge of the matter, even when profiles such as Toyota second-in-command Didier Leroy were put forward by recruitment firms. \nRenault placed Bollore atop its shortlist at the start of the process and blocked attempts by the external advisers to bring Mueller, a German-born BMW veteran, into serious contention, the source said. DIFFERENCES \nDesmarest, 72, had in any case planned to withdraw from the Renault board after the next shareholder meeting in June, a person close to the former oilman told Reuters. He had served on Renault’s board for a decade and chaired its strategy committee. \n“It was going to happen anyway,” the person said. “This is not motivated by polemics or the Ghosn situation.” \nBut the carmaker hurriedly circulated a draft statement among board members on Friday, attributing Desmarest’s sudden exit to a discovered conflict of interest, two sources said. \n“He’s a very discreet man and he’ll go without making a noise,” said one, adding that Desmarest may attend Thursday’s meeting but abstain from voting on Bollore’s nomination. “His goal is not to vote and not to be associated with this.” \nGhosn, 63, had earlier been expected to hand over the reins to a new chief executive and move to a new role overseeing Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi’s three-way carmaking alliance. \nBut the plan foundered on differences with the French state over the alliance’s future shape and direction. Renault currently holds 43.4 percent of Nissan, which in turn controls Mitsubishi Motors via a 34 percent stake. \nRenault now plans to propose Ghosn’s reappointment as CEO to the June shareholder meeting. \nBoth sides have been seeking to avoid a repeat of a bitter 2015 clash in which France raised its Renault stake to swing a shareholder vote and secure double voting rights. \nThe government had also pushed unsuccessfully for a full Renault-Nissan merger on terms that would safeguard French industrial interests.
