(NYSE:WMS) (“ADS” or the “Company”), a leading global manufacturer of water management products and solutions for non-residential, residential, infrastructure and agricultural applications, today announced financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nNet sales increased 8.9% to $320.8 million Net income increased 223.8% to $33.2 million Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) increased 29.0% to $56.0 million\nFiscal 2018 Year-to-Date Highlights\nNet sales increased 6.6% to $1,080.2 million Net income increased 29.1% to $69.6 million Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) increased 1.3% to $183.2 million Cash flow from operating activities increased 19.1% to $138.9 million Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) increased 29.5% to $103.8 million\nScott Barbour, President and Chief Executive Officer of ADS commented, “We executed the fundamentals of our business well this quarter, which resulted in strong revenue growth and margin performance during the period. We once again generated above-market growth in our domestic construction markets, driven by our conversion strategy and double-digit growth of our Allied Products. Favorable pricing, product mix and solid execution drove 280 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on the fundamentals and better execution across all aspects of our operations to drive sustainable improvements in our profitability over time.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nNet sales increased 8.9% to $320.8 million, as compared to $294.7 million in the prior year quarter. Domestic net sales increased 8.9% to $276.9 million as compared to $254.3 million in the prior year quarter, driven by price increases and growth in the construction markets. International net sales increased 8.8% to $44.0 million as compared to $40.4 million in the prior year quarter.\nGross profit increased 12.1% to $77.8 million, as compared to $69.4 million the prior year quarter. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased 70 basis points to 24.3% compared to 23.6% in the prior year, primarily due to price increases and product mix.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) increased 29.0% to $56.0 million, as compared to $43.4 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA increased 280 basis points to 17.5% as compared to 14.7% in the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin was largely attributed to the factors mentioned above.\nThe Company’s third quarter income tax expense was a $7.4 million benefit and reflected the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), including a $14.7 million benefit to income tax expense related to the revaluation of deferred tax attributes and $0.9 million income tax expense on the Company’s deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. The income tax benefit also included a $3.0 million benefit from the year-to-date impact of the change in federal statutory rate.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) was $0.47 based on weighted average fully converted shares of 74.4 million, as compared to $0.16 for the prior year on weighted average fully converted shares of 73.4 million. The $13.8 million net benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax attributes and deemed repatriation of foreign earnings increased Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share by $0.19 on weighted average fully converted shares of 74.4 million. Excluding the impact of the one-time benefit from the Tax Act, Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share increased to $0.28.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures for Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nFiscal Year-to-Date 2018 Results\nNet sales increased 6.6% to $1,080.2 million, as compared to $1,013.1 million in the prior year. Domestic net sales increased 7.9% to $948.3 million as compared to $878.8 million in the prior year, driven by price increases and growth in core construction markets. International net sales decreased 1.7% to $132.0 million as compared to $134.2 million in the prior year.\nGross profit decreased 0.9% to $254.4 million, as compared to $256.6 million the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased 180 basis points to 23.5% compared to 25.3% in the prior year period, primarily due to increases in raw material and operational costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) increased 1.3% to $183.2 million, as compared to $180.8 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 80 basis points to 17.0% as compared to 17.8% in the same period last year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin was largely attributed to the factors mentioned above, partially offset by an increase in net sales.\nIncome tax expense decreased 55.5% to $15.8 million and reflected the estimated impact of the Tax Act, including a $14.7 million benefit to income tax expense related to the revaluation of deferred tax attributes and $0.9 million income tax expense on the Company’s deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. The income tax expense also included a $3.0 million benefit from the year-to-date impact of the change in federal statutory rate.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) was $1.02 based on weighted average fully converted shares of 74.2 million, as compared to $0.80 for the prior year on weighted average fully converted shares of 73.3 million. The $13.8 million net benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax attributes and deemed repatriation of foreign earnings increased Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share by $0.19 on weighted average fully converted shares of 74.2 million. Excluding the impact of the one-time benefit from the Tax Act, Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share increased to $0.83.\nThe Company recorded net cash provided by operating activities of $138.9 million, as compared to $116.6 million in the prior year. Net debt (total debt and capital lease obligations net of cash) was $357.0 million as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of $65.3 million from March 31, 2017.\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nBased on current visibility, backlog of existing orders and business trends, the Company has confirmed its net sales and Adjusted EBITDA targets for fiscal 2018. Net sales are expected to be in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion and Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $195 and $210 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $50 to $55 million.\nWebcast Information\nThe Company will host an investor conference call and webcast on Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

ADS management uses non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results available in the accompanying tables.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share, all non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are not intended to be substitutes for those reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that comprises net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, non-cash charges and certain other expenses. The Company’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by management and the Company’s board of directors to assess financial performance and evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s business strategies. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as the Company’s management and board of directors. In order to provide investors with a meaningful reconciliation, the Company has provided below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income.\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that comprises cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow is a measure used by management and the Company’s board of directors to assess the Company’s ability to generate cash. Accordingly, management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. In order to provide investors with a meaningful reconciliation, the Company has provided below a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities to Free Cash Flow.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated by adjusting our Net income per share – Basic, the most comparable GAAP measure. To effect this adjustment with respect to Net income available to common stockholders, we have (1) removed the accretion of Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries, (2) added back the dividends to Redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders, (3) made corresponding adjustments to the amount allocated to participating securities under the two class earnings per share computation method, and (4) added back ESOP deferred compensation attributable to the shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock allocated to employee ESOP accounts during the applicable period, which is a non-cash charge to our earnings. We have also made adjustments to the weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic to assume (1) share conversion of the Redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding shares to common stock and (2) add shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to our employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of the preferred shares. As such, this measure is included because it provides investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income, Free Cash Flow to Cash Flow from Operating Activities, and Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share to Net income per share – Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures, for each of the periods indicated:\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $ 33,215 $ 10,258 $ 69,648 $ 53,960 Depreciation and amortization 17,852 18,029 55,793 54,065 Interest expense 3,086 4,221 12,620 13,551 Income tax (benefit) expense (7,371 ) 5,986 15,812 35,528 EBITDA 46,782 38,494 153,873 157,104 Derivative fair value adjustments (145 ) (2,237 ) (735 ) (11,297 ) Foreign currency transaction gains (430 ) (601 ) (2,878 ) (1,678 ) Loss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities 1,924 2,138 10,468 3,077 Unconsolidated affiliates interest, tax, depreciation and amortization 637 469 2,060 2,049 Contingent consideration remeasurement 1 (15 ) 33 42 Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) 1,640 (3,413 ) 5,140 2,699 ESOP deferred compensation 2,737 2,323 7,946 7,428 Executive retirement expense (benefit) 73 (170 ) 982 (12 ) Transaction costs 92 - 1,149 - Legal settlement 1,800 - 1,800 - Restatement-related costs 888 6,406 3,390 21,391 Adjusted EBITDA $ 55,999 $ 43,394 $ 183,228 $ 180,803 Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (Amounts in thousands) Domestic International Domestic International Net income $ 29,755 $ 3,460 $ 7,233 $ 3,025 Depreciation and amortization 15,804 2,048 15,911 2,118 Interest expense 3,007 79 4,127 94 Income tax (benefit) expense (9,117 ) 1,746 5,342 644 EBITDA 39,449 7,333 32,613 5,881 Derivative fair value adjustments (145 ) - (2,237 ) - Foreign currency transaction gains - (430 ) - (601 ) Loss (gain) on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities 1,940 (16 ) 1,258 880 Unconsolidated affiliates interest, tax, depreciation and amortization 315 322 275 194 Contingent consideration remeasurement 1 - (15 ) - Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) 1,640 - (3,413 ) - ESOP deferred compensation 2,737 - 2,323 - Executive retirement expense (benefit) 73 - (170 ) - Transaction costs 92 - - - Legal settlement 1,800 - - - Restatement-related costs 888 - 6,406 - Adjusted EBITDA (a) $ 48,790 $ 7,209 $ 37,040 $ 6,354 (a) A portion of the reduction in International EBITDA is related to transfer pricing.
