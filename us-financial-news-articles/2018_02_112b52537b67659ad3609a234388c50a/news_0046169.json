They know that what awaits them will be a smear campaign intended to silence them and destroy their careers.”\nDozens of men have been fired or resigned from jobs in politics, media, entertainment and business over the last few months after facing sexual misconduct allegations, including Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and broadcaster Charlie Rose.\nReporting by Jessica DiNapoli; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T04:31:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
