The biggest number of foreign visitors come from China.\nChinese tourists during the Lunar New Year period, which this year begins on Feb. 15 and lasts until Feb. 21, will “generate about 8 billion baht ($253.9 million) in revenue”, Santi Chudintra, a deputy governor at the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) told reporters on Monday.\nIn 2017, about 255,000 Chinese tourists visited during the Lunar New Year.\nWomen stand to buy curios in front of a shop in Chinatown at Bangkok, Thailand February 4, 2018. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun Thailand’s Tourism Ministry said last month it expected this year’s tourist arrivals to hit a record 37.55 million, with 2.1 trillion baht spending.\nChinese tourists, who accounted for nearly one-third of last year’s record 35 million arrivals, are expected to rise this year to around 10 million from 9.8 million.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Thailand has become increasingly popular with Chinese tourists in recent years. The country is also home to one of the world’s largest ethnic Chinese communities.\nIn late 2016, Thailand launched a crackdown against “zero-dollar” package tours - an arrangement where tourists pay for everything upfront and in theory spend nothing while in the country. The tourism ministry said the campaign, which ended in 2017, was a success.\n($1 = 31.51 baht)\nReporting by Patpicha Tanakasempipat; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T11:58:23.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
