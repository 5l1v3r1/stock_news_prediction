However, markets in the region's biggest economy, Brazil, remained closed for the third day due to Carnival celebrations. Shares of Mexico's America Movil, controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim, were up 4.26 percent after reporting fourth-quarter earnings after market-close on Tuesday. Investors in Latin America's largest telecommunications firm, the company with the biggest market capitalization on the Mexico's main index, focused on 13 percent growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), overlooking the quarterly loss. Shares of Mexican cement maker Cemex were also up, gaining 2.61 percent. The Mexican currency also firmed, up 0.48 percent in a day of volatile trading to reach 18.56 pesos per U.S. dollar. The peso's gains were, in part, due to comments by Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo indicating the government is willing to have the NAFTA trade pact periodically revised, according to analysts at Banco BASE. In Argentina, drought in the heart of the country's Pampas grains belt is likely to persist through the second half of February, further reducing yields of soy and corn in the 2017-18 season, climate experts said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Argentine central bank held its benchmark seven-day interbank lending rate at 27.25 percent on Wednesday, the monetary authority said in a statement, amid an increase in inflation expectations and \"mixed signals\" in prices so far this year.
