Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.2 million or $0.00 per share, as compared to adjusted net income of $1.5 million or $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net (loss) income excludes amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, acquisition costs, other non-recurring charges and the related income tax effect of these adjustments.\nNet loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 includes charges of $2.9 million or $0.05 per share. These charges are comprised of $1.2 million of litigation fees, $1.0 million of one-time CEO compensation payment, and $0.8 million of severance. The net loss benefited from a non-recurring $2.5 million or $0.04 per share tax benefit stemming from enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% from 34% and led to a revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. The fourth quarter 2016 net loss included charges of $7.2 million or $0.13 per share. These charges were comprised of $2.8 million of write down costs related to shutting down the legacy platform, a $2.6 million write off relating to a previous investment and $1.8 million in litigation fees.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.9 million or $0.07 per share, as compared to $5.3 million or $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA excludes provision for (benefit from) income taxes, other (income)/expense, net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, acquisition costs and other non-recurring charges.\nA reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.

The Company generated approximately $10.3 million of cash from operations in 2017 and incurred capital expenditures of approximately $17.4 million.\nFinancial Expectations\nThe Company expects that record contract signings in the fourth quarter of 2017, a solid start to 2018 and improving retention, will lead to increased revenue in 2018. The Company is introducing a 2018 revenue guidance range of $237 million to $243 million, which at the midpoint, calls for a return to double-digit growth.\nInvestments in product, partnerships and customer events will remain a priority, as the Company seeks to extend its industry lead and capture share of a greenfield market opportunity. The Company anticipates continued leverage in gross margin and general and administrative expenses, which will fund the key growth engines of sales and marketing and product development. At the midpoint of its guided ranges the Company expects the 2018 pre-tax loss and adjusted EBITDA to each improve by 17% as compared to 2017.\nThe Company's detailed 2018 financial expectations are as follows:\nFirst Quarter 2018\nGuidance\nRevenue (in millions)\n$56.75 - $57.75\nGAAP net loss per share\n$(0.13) - $(0.11)\nDiluted adjusted net income per share\n$0.00 - $0.01\nDiluted adjusted EBITDA per share\n$0.06 - $0.07\nAdjusted EBITDA (in millions)\n$3.5 - $4.0\nFully diluted share count\n58.5 million\nFull Year 2018\nGuidance\nRevenue (in millions)\n$237.0 - $243.0\nGAAP net loss per share\n$(0.35) - $(0.29)\nDiluted adjusted net income per share\n$0.07 - $0.10\nDiluted adjusted EBITDA per share\n$0.34 - $0.39\nAdjusted EBITDA (in millions)\n$20.0 - $23.0\nFully diluted share count\n59.0 million\nOther Full Year 2018 Assumptions\nEstimated non-recurring litigation expense of approximately $6.0 million ($0.11 per share) Amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately $3.0 million Stock-based compensation expense of approximately $12.5 million Depreciation of approximately $15.0 million Cash taxes paid of $2.0 million to $4.0 million.

the Company updated the methodology for calculating adjusted net income. In 2016, the Company incorporated the GAAP tax\nrate into the calculation, whereas in 2017, the Company now starts the calculation with GAAP pre-tax (loss) income, then adds back\namortization, stock-based compensation, other non-recurring, restructuring, and then applies a standardized 35% long-term projected tax rate.\nThe prior period, December 31, 2016, was adjusted to conform to the current period presentation. A full reconciliation of 2016 adjusted net\nincome under the historical and updated methodologies is available on the Supplemental Fourth Quarter Earnings Presentation that you may\nfind on the investor relations section of the Company's web site at http://www.liveperson.com/company/ir .\nLivePerson, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information to GAAP - (continued)\n(In Thousands)\nUnaudited\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities:\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n3,929\n$\n5,259\n$\n18,400\n$\n19,198\nAdd/(less):\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities\n3,333\n3,147\n(7,092)\n9,528\nProvision for doubtful accounts\n532\n591\n1,895\n1,831\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes\n2,499\n(896)\n(501)\n(5,934)\nDeferred income taxes\n(3,206)\n304\n(2,383)\n467\nAmortization of tenant allowance\n(41)\n—\n(166)\n—\nOther (expense) income, net\n(276)\n(395)\n136\n(530)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n6,770\n$\n8,010\n$\n10,289\n$\n24,560\n(1) Earnings/(loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, other (income)/expense, net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based\ncompensation, restructuring costs, acquisition costs and other non-recurring charges.\nLivePerson, Inc.\nReconciliation of Projected Non-GAAP Financial Information to GAAP\n(In Thousands)\nUnaudited\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2018\nReconciliation of Projected Adjusted EBITDA: (1)\nNet loss in accordance with GAAP\n$(7,400) - $(6,400)\n$(20,300) - $(16,700)\nAdd/(less):\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n700\n3,000\nStock-based compensation\n1,800\n12,500\nDepreciation\n3,400\n14,700\nOther non-recurring costs\n1,500\n6,000\nProvision for income taxes\n3,400 - 3,000\n4,200 - 3,600\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$3,500 - $4,000\n$20,000 - $23,000\nReconciliation of Projected Adjusted Net Income (Loss): (1)\nPre-tax loss in accordance with GAAP\n$(4,000) - $(3,500)\n$(16,100) - $(13,100)\nAdd/(less):\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n700\n3,000\nStock-based compensation\n1,800\n12,500\nOther non-recurring costs\n1,500\n6,000\nPre-tax adjusted income\n100 - 600\n5,300- 8,300\nNon-GAAP income tax effect\n0 - 100\n(1,300) - (2,100)\nAdjusted net income\n$100 - $400\n$4,000 - $6,200\n(1)\nCertain items may not total due to rounding.\nLivePerson, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In Thousands)\nUnaudited\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n56,115\n$\n50,889\nCash held as collateral\n1,451\n3,962\nAccounts receivable, net\n37,926\n31,823\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n7,352\n5,477\nTotal current assets\n102,844\n92,151\nProperty and equipment, net\n34,705\n28,397\nIntangibles, net\n12,366\n16,510\nGoodwill\n80,531\n80,245\nDeferred tax assets, net\n753\n773\nOther assets\n1,600\n1,562\nTotal assets\n$\n232,799\n$\n219,638\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable\n$\n5,481\n$\n7,288\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n48,011\n40,250\nDeferred revenue\n35,563\n27,145\nTotal current liabilities\n89,055\n74,683\nDeferred tax liability\n915\n3,332\nOther liabilities\n2,766\n3,147\nTotal liabilities\n92,736\n81,162\nCommitments and contingencies\nTotal stockholders' equity\n140,063\n138,476\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$\n232,799\n$\n219,638\nInvestor contact:\nMatthew Kempler\n212-609-4214\nmkempler@liveperson.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/liveperson-announces-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-results-300601450.html\nSOURCE LivePerson, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.liveperson.com/", "http://www.liveperson.com/company/ir", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/liveperson-announces-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-results-300601450.html", "http://www.liveperson.com/about/ir"], "published": "2018-02-21T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T23:57:46.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
