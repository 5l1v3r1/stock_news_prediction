The overhaul kept the social element of the app separate from media, with one page devoted to interacting with friends' Snapchat stories and messages, while another runs a feed of video content from media outlets.\nFacebook's monthly user growth is coming from older rather than younger users, the study said.\n\"Snapchat could eventually experience more growth in older age groups, since it's redesigning its platform to be easier to use,\" Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at eMarketer, said in a statement Monday.\n\"The question will be whether younger users will still find Snapchat cool if more of their parents and grandparents are on it. That's the predicament Facebook is in.\"\nFacebook will still be the dominant social network of the two in 2018, however, with 169.5 million U.S. users compared to Snapchat's 86.5 million U.S. users.\nFacebook was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T13:53:02.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
