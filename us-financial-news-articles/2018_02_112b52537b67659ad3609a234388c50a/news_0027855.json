Nielsen Music reported last week that on-demand audio and video streams for all of the songs performed by Timberlake jumped 45 percent on the day after the game, compared to the day before.\nTimberlake, best known for pop tracks like “SexyBack” and “Rock Your Body,” promoted “Man of the Woods” as a country-inspired album that took him back to his Memphis roots.\nBut the album had few fans among music reviewers. Esquire called it “disappointing” and “kind of embarrassing,” while USA Today said the album “can’t pull off its Americana-pop fusion.”\nOn the digital Billboard songs chart, which measures online single sales, Timberlake had three songs in the top 20 - “Say Something” featuring Chris Stapleton, “Man of the Woods,” and his 2016 hit “Can’t Stop the Feeling.” Canadian rapper Drake took the top spot with “God’s Plan,” with more than 55,00 units sold.\nReporting by Jill Serjeant, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T21:51:44.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
