Maxim Buga, a leader of the Cossack community there, said Loginov had been killed around Feb. 7 along with “dozens” of other Russian fighters. \nThe other man killed was named as Kirill Ananiev, described as a radical Russian nationalist. Alexander Averin, a spokesman for the nationalist party he was linked to, told Reuters Ananiev had been killed in shelling in the same fighting on Feb. 7. \nReuters was unable to independently confirm either man’s death. \nGrigory Yavlinsky, a veteran liberal politician who is running for president in elections next month, called on President Vladimir Putin to disclose how many Russians had been killed in Syria and in what circumstances. \n“If there was large-scale loss of life of Russian citizens, the relevant officials, including the commander-in-chief of our armed forces (Putin), are obliged to tell the country about it and decide who carries responsibility for this,” Yavlinsky said in a statement released by his Yabloko party. \nReporting by Maria Tsvetkova; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T23:53:29.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
