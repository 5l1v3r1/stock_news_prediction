The company declined to comment further.\nPratt has not halted production or delivery of the engines, and the Connecticut-based company plans to submit a proposal to European regulators on Friday detailing how to fix the problem, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nIt wasn’t clear how quickly the European Aviation Safety Agency could approve the plan.\nThe problem affects only PW-1100 series engines, not similar Pratt engines for Bombardier, Embraer or Mitsubishi jets, the source said.\nAirbus halted delivery of A320neos after delivering 113 of them. It was not immediately clear which airlines had the largest fleet. Industry sources said 20 Airbus A320neos had been grounded by airlines because of the problem.\nAdditional reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T17:37:33.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
