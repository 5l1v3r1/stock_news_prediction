On Thursday, U.S. stocks rose to pare the week’s losses .\nAs 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have ticked higher this year, equity investors are watching bond markets closely for signs that higher yields are affecting corporate performance.\n“Historically, the probability of loss for the S&P 500 increases when the 10-year Treasury yield rises above 3%,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists in a research note this week.\nIn midday trading in Europe, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields dipped slightly from their levels Thursday, to 2.89%. That benchmark yield has risen from 2.4% at the end of 2017.\nBoards displaying stock information at the Australian Securities Exchange in Sydney early this month.

Automotive supplier Valeo SA was among the worst performing stocks on the index, falling 11% after announcing a 2017 decline in net profit.\nIn European bond markets, German government bond yields continued to tick lower. 10-year bund yields fell to around 0.66%, from around 0.71% Thursday.\nSolid stock gains were seen in many parts of Asia-Pacific. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was recently up 1%, and a gauge of Chinese companies with listings in the city climbed 2%.\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.8% higher to cap its best week since October, and a 1.5% rise gave South Korea’s Kospi its best day since Oct. 10.\nChina’s Shenzen A-Share index was up 0.2%.\n“Asia is in a good position to ride out interest-rates hikes from the Federal Reserve given the prospects of a weaker dollar and a solid outlook for Asian exports,” said Christy Tan, head of markets strategy/research for Asia at National Australia Bank .\nIn foreign exchange markets, the greenback strengthened slightly, with the WSJ Dollar Index up 0.1%.\nOil prices sipped slightly, with Brent crude down 0.5% to $66.06 a barrel, and WTI down 0.4% to $62.50 a barrel.\nWrite to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T05:14:24.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
