But the committee considers it unreasonable that, four years since the review was commissioned, and 18 months since the FCA received the final report, such slow progress has been made towards meeting this objective,” Morgan said. \n“A version of the report is in the hands of third parties, it has been selectively reported by the media,” she said, adding that the FCA had “lost control over the timing or content of further public disclosures” of the report. \nThe watchdog had no immediate comment. \nRBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan had previously said the “vast majority” of firms it dealt with were turned around, though he accepted last week this was not the case. \nThe Treasury Select Committee’s use of its powers to compel the watchdog to publish the report followed the appearance of FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey before the committee on Wednesday. \nThe clash with lawmakers shines a potentially uncomfortable spotlight on Bailey, who is seen as a leading candidate to replace Mark Carney as the Bank of England governor in 2019. \nBailey had told the committee that the regulator would publish the report once its enforcement investigation into RBS had been completed, and those named in the report had had the opportunity to respond to any criticisms. \nThe investigation element was largely complete. “I would like to think we are talking weeks,” Bailey said. \nA summary of the report has already been published. \nBailey said there was requirement for the watchdog to give all those identified in the report a right of reply. “That is the bind we are in,” he said. \nParliament must either change this requirement or risk setting a precedent by publishing the report straight away, he added. \nBritain’s Federation of Small Businesses said “victims have waited months” for the report to be published, with hundreds of former small business owners still yet to receive redress from RBS. \nRBS denied on Tuesday a British lawmaker’s allegation that its executives misled the Treasury Select Committee over the extent to which the bank mistreated small businesses during and after the financial crisis. \nThe bank has set aside 400 million pounds ($555 million) to cover claims relating to its restructuring unit, which handled more than 12,000 troubled businesses between 2007 and 2012.
