The monthly poll closely tracks the Bank of Japan’s key quarterly tankan.\nMonday’s trade data showed exports to China, Japan’s biggest trading partner, jumped 30.8 percent year-on-year in January, due in part to an export surge before the Lunar New Year that happened later than last year. The gain was led by semiconductor production equipment, car engines and hybrid cars.\nShipments to Asia as a whole, which account for more than half of Japan’s exports, grew 16.0 percent in the year to January.\nU.S.-bound shipments rose 1.2 percent in the year to January, led by steel, batteries and medicines, while car shipments declined 3.9 percent. The small rise in U.S.-bound exports followed a 3.0 percent gain in the previous month.\nJapan’s trade surplus with the United States fell an annual 12.3 percent in January to 349.6 billion yen, a second declining month.\nThe overall trade balance swung to a deficit of 943.4 billion yen ($8.87 billion), the first trade deficit in eight months.\n“Net exports may return to growth this quarter,” said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.\n“Looking ahead, the export climate index climbed to a fresh high last month and suggests that external demand remains healthy. We’ve pencilled in a 4.5 percent rise in export volumes this year.”\n($1 = 106.3000 yen)\nReporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Chris Gallagher and Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T07:07:10.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
