It said then that it would follow up with on-site inspections if necessary.\nThe FSA decided to inspect several exchanges after reviewing their reports, Jiji Press said, without identifying the operators. If regulators find problems with their operations they may consider administrative sanctions, Jiji said.\nOfficials at the FSA were not immediately available for comment.\nThe FSA has issued a business improvement order to Coincheck, while Tokyo police, as well as authorities in several countries, are investigating the heist.\nLast year’s explosive rise in the value of digital coins and the flood of new retail investors drawn to the market have rattled global regulators nervous about a sector used largely for speculation. Officials have said cryptocurrencies are used by criminals to launder money.
