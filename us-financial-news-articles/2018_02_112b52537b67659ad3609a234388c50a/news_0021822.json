Japan were doing well, and he planned to invest in more companies that he called \"unicorns.\"\nOne such company he mentioned is Wag, a U.S. venture that connects dog owners with dog walkers online, which Son called the \"dog version of Uber.\"\nA visionary sometimes seen in the company of high-profile figures like Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and President Donald Trump, he has been aggressive in investing in artificial intelligence, the internet of things and renewable energy â€” Son is a relatively vocal opponent of nuclear power, especially after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in northeastern Japan.\nHe said he has had a vision since he was a teen to grow his \"family\" of companies as a web-based structure, to last 300 years. The brands must stay distinct but the companies, connected through investments, will work together and all become No. 1, he said.\nSoftBank also owns the SoftBank Hawks baseball club, which won last year's Japan Series, this country's equivalent of the World Series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T16:29:20.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
