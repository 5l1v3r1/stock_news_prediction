We've got a better idea: Loaded Pasta Chips. üòâ pic.twitter.com/1Fg6hcckRh \n‚Äî Olive Garden (@olivegarden) February 2, 2018 \n\nIn addition to being pretty unique, it‚Äôs also affordable. A dish of the carb-loaded appetite will just set you back $8.99. It‚Äôs available on the menu at least through the summer, although if it takes off in popularity we certainly might see it become a staple on the chain‚Äôs menu right beside those endless pasta bowls . \nIf you do decide to try a plate, you‚Äôll probably want to bring a friend with you to share the snack. According to the restaurant‚Äôs menu , one plate of the chips clocks in at 1,520 calories.
