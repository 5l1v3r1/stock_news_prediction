Police had indicated they would enforce the ruling. \nIn power since 2013 and facing elections in October, Yameen is under international pressure to heed the court decision, while hundreds of protesters have taken to the country’s streets to demand compliance with the order. \nPresident Yameen’s government has had good relations with China and a free trade agreement between the two countries was signed in December, despite criticism from the opposition. \nChina has been striking deals with countries in Asia and Africa in line with its “belt and road initiative” to improve imports of key commodities, upgrade infrastructure and trade routes in the region and boost its diplomatic clout.
