McConnell and Schumer could incorporate their agreement on domestic and military spending into the stopgap measure, which then would have to win passage in the House.\nCongress also faces another looming deadline, as the United States could have trouble paying its bills within weeks if lawmakers do not take the politically painful step of raising the debt ceiling.\nThe third-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise, said negotiations over the debt ceiling were being coupled with the Senate budget talks.\nIMMIGRATION ISSUE\nLawmakers have been struggling to reach a deal on an immigration bill, despite broad public support for helping Dreamers - hundreds of thousands of young Latinos who were allowed to study and work without fear of deportation under a program set up by Democratic former President Barack Obama.\nTrump last year ordered those protection removed by March 5, though a federal court has blocked his administration from ending the program.\nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress are trying to agree on bipartisan legislation that would protect Dreamers and boost border security. Schumer said the Senate could take up the issue next week.\nTrump has said any immigration deal must also include changes to programs for legal immigration that would assess applicants on their skills, rather than their country of origin or ties to U.S. residents. Democrats oppose that idea.
