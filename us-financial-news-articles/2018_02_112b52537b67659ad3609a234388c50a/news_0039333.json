I got married.\n“There’s so many things that changed and if you add all that together it made for a really great combination where I’ve been feeling really happy and grateful.”\nBloemen’s decision proved to be an inspired one.\nHis career in the Netherlands was hanging by a thread due to doubts about his dedication and he spent years bouncing around from one professional speed skating team to another.\nUnlike most countries, speed skating is not a niche sport in the Netherlands, and the astonishing Dutch supremacy on display in Korea is the product of a network of professional teams that allow skaters to race competitively through the year.\n“SOMETHING SPECIAL”\nIf anything, Bloemen is living proof that precisely because of the abundance of talent in the Netherlands the country’s system is - if only rarely - fallible and that late bloomers in the sport can sometimes slip through the cracks.\nBloemen’s story may have begun in Holland, but his resurgence was sparked and nurtured in Canada.\nFaced with a far smaller talent pool than the Dutch, the Canadians have been forced to wring every last ounce of effort from the athletes they do have, and that suited Bloemen perfectly.\nWhen he arrived at the Olympics, he did so as the world record holder in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters and he set both records after moving to Canada.\n“I had a dream and I always felt from deep inside that I was able to do something special on the ice, but I was never able to show it,” he said. “I found that different way and I got way more than I ever would have hoped.”\n“I‘m really grateful for the team that I have around me. I‘m a really happy person and I’ve been so for a long time.”\nBloemen served notice of his intentions when he claimed silver in the 5,000 meters on Tuesday behind Dutchman Sven Kramer. Two days later, he was an Olympic champion in the longest speed skating distance.\n“Imagine that feeling,” he said. “It’s really, really incredible. It’s the biggest stage I’ve ever been on and to win here is the highest you can get.”\nReporting by Simon Jennings; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:17:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
