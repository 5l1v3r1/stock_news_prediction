That vote is due to take place from Feb 20 to March 2. A result is expected on March 4.\nSchulz, 62, is expected to become foreign minister in a new coalition government with the conservatives.\nReporting by Holger Hansen; Writing by Michelle Martin, editing by Thomas Escritt\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T19:21:11.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
