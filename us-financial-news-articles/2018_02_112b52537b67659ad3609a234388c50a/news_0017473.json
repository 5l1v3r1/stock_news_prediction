Authorities seized the cryptocurrencies, along with computers, printers, as well as gold and silver bars inside the home of the alleged fake ID maker. \nStill, investigators didn’t find the alleged ID-maker’s trail using Bitcoin—but rather using Reddit. Simon was allegedly peddling his goods via Reddit—leaving a trail leading to a college student who told regulators that a friend bought a falsified ID using the site. \nThe news comes as criminals are gravitating toward other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin or Monero instead of Bitcoin , as investigators grow more savvy with tracking the “poster child” of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies in general are thought to be favored in criminal transactions, as they are pseudonymous and harder to track. Though even with Bitcoin and its peers, the problem of marketing goods is still difficult for those hoping to erase their trail.
