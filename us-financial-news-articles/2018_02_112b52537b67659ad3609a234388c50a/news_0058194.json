The island's status as an independent nation is complicated by its neighbor China, who regards the island as a renegade province under the One China Policy. As a result, Taiwan is not permitted to be a member of the United Nations or other international organizations. \nLee, as reported by Focus Taiwan, described the proposed vote as the \"most powerful weapon\" that would enable the Taiwanese people to establish a \"normal country.\" \nThe campaign to call a referendum was launched by Kuo Bei-hong, chairman of Formosa Television channel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T18:28:06.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
