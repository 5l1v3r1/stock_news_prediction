Also, KDB, which holds a 17-percent stake in GM Korea, and GM’s local labor union should “share the pain”, it said.\nIt did not give details.\nGM said the three principles are “reasonable,” and pledged to hand in its turnaround plan as soon as possible, the statement said. The GM Korea spokesman did not specifically comment on the principles or the turnaround plan.\nSouth Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said the government will take action after the due diligence is over.\nWhen asked the Gunsan plant will be closed as planned, Kim declined to comment.\nGM’s South Korean labor union on Thursday decided not to go on a strike for the time being, a union source told Reuters. Instead, it will step up calls on the government and parliament to come up with measures to prevent plant shutdowns.\nThe union will also ask the government to allow GM’s union to participate in the due diligence of GM Korea, the source added.\nReporting by Shin-hyung Lee and Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Raju Gopalakrishnan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T14:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:24:00.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
