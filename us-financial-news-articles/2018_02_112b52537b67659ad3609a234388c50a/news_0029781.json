The package, which was shipped from the United States to the northwestern Argentine province of Salta, contained four World War Two helmets, a knife, and a figurine of the imperial eagle all displaying swastikas. It also contained three posters with references to the Third Reich, and two rifles, one a replica. Police raided the home of the individual who picked up the package from a post office, the Ministry said, adding that the person was cooperating with authorities. “There is no room in Argentina for these types of expressions, which make reference to a tragic era in human history,” Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said in the statement. In the 1940s, millions of Jews were murdered by the state in Nazi Germany, a genocide known as the Holocaust, along with others denoted as inferior. After the fall of the Third Reich at the end of World War Two, a number of high-ranking Nazi officials fled to South American countries, including Argentina. Last June, police seized a cache of Nazi artefacts hidden behind a library in the house of an art collector in Buenos Aires.
