In return, it said, he reduced their sentences or paid their fines from his personal funds.\nIn a 21-count federal indictment unsealed a few months after he stepped down, U.S. prosecutors said Boeckmann offered to dismiss the case of two young men in exchange for the defendants being photographed naked or being paddled on their bare buttocks, the indictment said.\nBoeckmann was also accused him of giving sentences of “community service,” where defendants would do work around his home. He was also accused of filing false paperwork to cover up what he did, the indictment said.\nThe most serious of the charges could have brought up to 20 years in prison, U.S. prosecutors have said.\nReporting by Jon Herskovitz, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T02:29:26.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
