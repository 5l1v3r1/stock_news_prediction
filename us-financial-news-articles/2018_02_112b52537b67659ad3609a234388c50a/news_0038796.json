Brink said he was being treated in a hospital.\nThe lockdown at the Massillon school, which has a student body of about 1,400, came at a time of heightened tension following a shooting spree at a Florida high school last week that killed 17 people.\nReporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:05:32.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
