COMMENTARY: A government spokesman indicated that retail sales increased solidly in December 2017 over a year earlier, reflecting the upbeat consumption sentiment amid favourable employment and income conditions. The continued revival of inbound tourism also helped. For 2017 as a whole, retail sales resumed modest growth, having declined on an annual basis since 2014. The near-term outlook for the retail trade stays positive, given the more sanguine economic situation and improving inbound tourism. The Government will closely monitor the situation.
