Buhari was elected in 2015 in part on a promise to rid the country of graft.\n“All mismanaged and misappropriated national assets recovered will be sold off and proceeds paid to the treasury for the benefit of the country,” he said, according to a statement from his spokesman.\nThe presidency statement did not say when the sales would happen, nor provide further details.\nVery few officials from Buhari’s administration have so far been prosecuted despite frequent allegations against them.\nNotable exceptions were his sacking last October of Nigeria’s most senior civil servant, Babachir Lawal, and the former head of the National Intelligence Agency for alleged involvement in corruption.\nReporting by Felix Onuah; Writing by Paul Carsten; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T04:33:14.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
