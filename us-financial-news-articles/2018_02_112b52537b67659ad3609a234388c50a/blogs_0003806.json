Why are you so content with just getting first round?\" \nAlphabet's stock fell as much as 5 percent after hours Thursday after it reported earnings, and shares were down about 4.5 percent on Friday. Investors appeared to be leery of rising costs and reduced margins at the California-based tech company. \nCramer said Alphabet's stock will come back from its fall. \nGoogle's ad business drove the company's growth. Cramer wished that the company could produce numbers as good as Amazon's. The e-commerce giant on Thursday reported strong holiday sales and growth in its ad business . \n\"What an unfortunate thing to report the same day as Amazon,\" said Cramer, host of CNBC's \" Mad Money .\" \"Alphabet is fine, but there is an element that just says, 'enough of fine.' Do you mind blowing away the numbers like everyone else is?\" \nWhat \"saves\" Alphabet are the valuations, Cramer argued. \"It's an incredibly cheap stock.\" \nAlphabet did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. \nâ€”CNBC's Jillian D'Onfro contributed to this report.
