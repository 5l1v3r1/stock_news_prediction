She went on to spend the next 20 years working, and excelling, in virtually every position in property management for a large Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). Prior to joining Lincoln, she ran their $1.3 billion dollar conventional apartment portfolio with over 4,400 homes across Colorado and Southern California.\n“Our residents, our team members and our partners will all benefit from Jill’s commitment to customer service and her strong knowledge of the industry.

The goal has always been to increase the quality of military housing for our nation's servicemen and women. Since its inception more than a decade ago, Lincoln Military Housing now provides more than 36,000 family homes for military members across the US. Lincoln is much more than a property management company. LMH acts as a support system for military families and offers community-building activities and 24-hour maintenance assistance programs, free, to all of their residents. Services are available for members of all branches of service -- Marine Corps, Army, Navy, Air Force, United States Coast Guard, and National Guard.
