(US OTC:ETFM), announced today that 2050 Motors has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Graphene Future, Inc., to produce high-grade graphene material for the electric vehicle battery market.\nThe MOU includes a 20% ownership in Graphene Future, Inc., by 2050 Motors and the exclusive rights to utilize and distribute this graphene product for the next generation electric vehicle battery market worldwide.\n1) Mr. Hedrick stated that: In a 2014 Wall Street Daily article titled \"The Arms Race for Graphene is Officially On\" ( https://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2014/05/21/graphene-smartphones/ ), it states: \"While the world's next super-genius invents a device that will make our smartphones look silly, a quiet war is being waged amidst tech heavyweights like Apple (AAPL), Samsung (SSNLF) and Google (GOOGL).\"\n\"It’s a vicious cutthroat war, too...The battle is over access to a certain wonder material known as 'graphene'...He who controls graphene rules the tech world.\"\nThe article continues, \"What Makes Graphene So Incredible? Graphene is super-conductive [near zero resistance]. It weighs next to nothing. It’s stronger than steel [200 times stronger than steel by weight]. Oh, and it bends, too!\"\n2) The graphene industry is still in its infancy as evidenced by the persistent high cost of quality graphene product. Graphene is the future material for many high-tech industry products such as anode and cathode production for the next generation of high energy density lithium batteries and supercapacitors. It will be possible to have a 20-minute recharge battery in electric vehicles with highway ranges of up to 500 miles per charge.\n3) Mr. Hedrick continues: The present industrial production of graphene requires several chemical processes. These methods have many drawbacks including significant capital investment to build the facilities, they’re expensive to run, utilize huge quantities of very high concentration acids, require stringent safety precautions because of hazardous conditions, and they’re environmentally unfriendly producing huge amounts of toxic chemicals for disposal.\n4) Graphene Future developed a one-step industrial process to produce graphene without any hazardous waste products, it's absolutely safe for its operating personnel, it's inexpensive to produce and only requires a modest capital investment to build the facilities to create high-quality graphene.\nAbout 2050 Motors, Inc.\n2050 Motors, Inc. ( http://2050motors.com/about-us.html ) is a publicly traded company founded to develop and produce the next generation of clean, lightweight, efficient vehicles and their associated technologies.
