But I am not worried about it all.\n“I think I will choose, I need to look at the video but some of the lines I took today were a little bit faster. But I am happy, solid training.”\nDownhill World Cup leader Sofia Goggia appears to be the main threat to Vonn’s hopes and the Italian was not too far off the pace in 1:41.28, the 11th fastest time.\nFeb 19, 2018; Pyeongchang, South Korea; Ramona Siebenhofer (AUT) during training for the ladies' downhill alpine skiing race during the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Jeongseon Alpine Centre. Mandatory Credit: Eric Bolte-USA TODAY Sports Goggia said she thought Vonn remained the race favorite.\n“It’s not about putting that on her, it’s just she has so much experience,” she said.\n“She has 81 World Cup victories, she has 131 podiums etcetera, medals both at world championships and Olympics. It’s like she has already made this, she knows how to do it.”\nAlpine Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Downhill Training - Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 20, 2018 - Ramona Siebenhofer of Austria trains.
