Even though we have a different culture and different customs, we share the same values,” Hui told Reuters TV.\nHui said his film was timely because it was about tolerance and acceptance where humans and monsters could live together.\n“Even a kid in Berlin, if he sees this film, can understand it,” he said.\nReporting By Riham Alkousaa; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:51:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
