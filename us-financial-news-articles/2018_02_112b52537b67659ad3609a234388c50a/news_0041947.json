The men’s slalom, in which Austria’s Marcel Hirscher could win his third gold medal of the Games, will take place as scheduled on Thursday at the Yongpyong mountain. Three of the first four races on the Alpine schedule were postponed because of winds gusting up to 72 kilometers per hour which closed the gondola taking the competitors to the top of the mountain.
