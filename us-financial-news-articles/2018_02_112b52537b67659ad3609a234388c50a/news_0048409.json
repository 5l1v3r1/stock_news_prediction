Seven people took advantage of it—one of whom (the one who tried to get their hands on $20 trillion worth) tried to cash out. \nTech Bureau, which owns the Zaif exchange, has invalidated the transactions and corrected user balances. However, the company is now being investigated by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) about the security of its system as well as other business practices. \nThe added scrutiny comes just weeks after the FSA reportedly raided Tech Bureau to investigate its internal governance structure after the hacking of Coincheck, which saw thieves make off with over $500 million in cryptocurrency.
