It's almost 30 percent of the global addressable market in infrastructure. This is no longer niche, it's fundamental to any infrastructure allocation.\"\nBarry offered an insight into why this shift was taking place. \"What's driving it now, is not that people want to be green, it's not about climate – it's cost,\" he said.\n\"The transformation that's underway, it's fundamentally being driven by economics now,\" he added.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) describes renewable energy as being at the center of the transition to a \"less carbon-intensive and more sustainable energy system.\" Renewables, the IEA states, have \"grown rapidly\" over the last few years, with sharp cost reductions in both solar photovoltaics and wind power.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:21:06.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
