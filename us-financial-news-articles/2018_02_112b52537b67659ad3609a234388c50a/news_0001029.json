( goo.gl/TRuF2Z )\nThe new rate is still dwarfed by the black market rate for greenbacks, currently at 228,000 bolivars per dollar according to website DolarToday, which is used as a reference.\nVenezuela is undergoing a major crisis, with quadruple-digit inflation and shortages of food and medicine. Economists consistently describe the 15-year-old currency control system as the principal obstacle to functioning commerce and industry.\n1 eur = 1.24 dollars Reporting by Caracas newsroom; Writing by Brian Ellsworth and Girish Gupta; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://goo.gl/TRuF2Z", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T23:36:49.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
