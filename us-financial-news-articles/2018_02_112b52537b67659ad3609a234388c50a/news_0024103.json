I don’t think anybody wants to escalate further.” CHAIN OF EVENTS \nSaturday’s chain of events began at 4:30 a.m. (0230 GMT) when an Israeli Apache helicopter shot down an Iranian drone over the northern town of Beit Shean, the Israeli military said. \nThe drone had been sighted taking off from a base in Syria, and was intercepted after it crossed into Israeli territory, spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said. \nIsraeli planes then struck an Iranian installation in Syria from which, the Israeli military said, the unmanned aircraft had been operated. \nThe Israeli military released grainy black and white footage of what it said was the drone’s control vehicle in Syria being destroyed. \nThe F-16 crashed on its return from the mission, coming down in an empty field near Harduf, east of Haifa. \n”We heard a big explosion and then sirens. We didn’t know what was happening, we heard helicopters and planes in the air,” said Yosi Sherer, 51, who was staying at a hostel near Haifa. \nFlights at Tel Aviv’s international airport were briefly halted. \nThe area was quiet by mid-afternoon. \nConricus said missile remnants were found near the crash site: “We don’t know yet if it’s an SA-5 or SA-17, but it’s a Syrian anti-aircraft missile.” The remains of an F-16 Israeli war plane are seen near the Israeli village of Harduf, Israel February 10, 2018.

Iran rejected the Israeli version of events as “ridiculous”. \nDavid Ivry, a former Israeli Air Force chief, told Reuters he believed it was the first time an Israeli F-16 was brought down since Israel began using the jets in the 1980s. AIR SUPERIORITY \nIsrael has long maintained air superiority in the region, mounting air strikes in Syria on a regular basis, targeting suspected weapons shipments to Hezbollah. \nHezbollah said in a statement: “Today’s developments mean the old equations have categorically ended.” Israeli security forces walk next to the remains of an F-16 Israeli war plane near the Israeli village of Harduf, Israel February 10, 2018. REUTERS/Herzie Shapira \nIranian and Iran-backed Shi‘ite forces, including Hezbollah, have deployed widely in Syria in support of Assad. Iran’s military chief warned Israel last October against breaching Syrian airspace and territory. \nNetanyahu, visiting the Golan on Tuesday, peered across the border into Syria and in public remarks warned Israel’s enemies not to test its resolve. \nAn official in the pro-Assad alliance said after the downing of the F-16 that a “message” had been delivered to Israel. But he added: “I do not believe matters will develop to a regional war.” \nThe Israeli military said it did not seek escalation, calling its action a defensive response to an Iranian act of aggression. \n“The tough part is how to continue to walk a tightrope, where neither side wants an all-out war, but no one wants to be the one who absorbed the blow and didn’t respond appropriately,” Uzi Rabi, director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University, told Israel’s Channel 11 television. \nThe U.S. administration has backed Israel’s hawkish stance on Iran, and declared containing Tehran’s influence an objective of its Syria policy. On a visit to Israel last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called Iran the world’s “leading state sponsor of terror”.
