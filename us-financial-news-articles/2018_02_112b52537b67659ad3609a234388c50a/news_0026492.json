I think it is a strong, positive message.” \nRussia, a winter sports powerhouse, were found guilty of tampering with doping samples at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics to give its athletes an edge at their home Games. \nThe country’s sports and anti-doping establishment has been the target of several investigations that recorded systematic manipulation of doping samples, not only in Sochi, but also across many sports and more than 1,000 athletes. \nThe IOC in December banned Russia from the Games and stripped several off their Sochi medals. Russian athletes tried to overturn the IOC’s decision, taking their cases to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \nMany Russians had their appeals upheld at CAS last week but the IOC refused to invite them, saying there was enough evidence or strong suspicion to exclude them. \nAnother 45 athletes and coaches, who had not been named in those investigations and had no previous doping record, had their appeals to be included in the Games dismissed by CAS on Friday, hours before the opening ceremony. \nThe Court ruled the IOC’s refusal to invite them constituted no sanction but rather an eligibility decision.
