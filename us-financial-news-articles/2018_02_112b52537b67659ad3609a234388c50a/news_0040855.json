Combined ratio during the fourth quarter of 2017 was 99.3%, compared to 104.5% during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCARMEL, Ind., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Baldwin & Lyons, Inc. (NASDAQ:BWINA) (NASDAQ:BWINB) today reported results for the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2017. The Company produced fourth quarter net income of $16.5 million, or $1.10 per share, which compares to net income of $4.9 million, or $0.32 per share, for the prior year’s fourth quarter. For the full year of 2017, net income totaled $18.3 million, or $1.21 per share, which compares to net income of $28.9 million, or $1.92 per share, for the prior year.\nNet premiums earned for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 40.4% to $97.1 million compared to the prior year period. For full year 2017, net premiums earned increased 18.9% to $328.1 million. The continued growth in the Company’s commercial automobile and workers’ compensation products as well as growth in the Company’s programs book of business contributed to the increase in premiums earned.\nGross premiums written for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 37.5% to $144.2 million compared to $104.9 million written during the prior year period. Gross premiums written for full year 2017 increased 25.2% to $504.7 million compared to $403.0 million written during the prior year. The increases were primarily driven by continued growth in the Company’s commercial automobile and workers’ compensation products as well as growth in the Company’s programs book of business.\nNet investment income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 42.2% to $5.7 million compared to $4.0 million in the prior year period. Full year 2017 net investment income increased 24.9% to $18.1 million, compared to $14.5 million in prior year. The increase reflects higher interest rates, higher reinvestment yields for core fixed income securities, increased dividends from equity securities, and an increase in average funds invested resulting from positive cash flow.\nUnderwriting operations produced a combined ratio of 99.3% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a combined ratio of 104.5% for the prior year period. The fourth quarter 2017 combined ratio includes $2.7 million (2.8 percentage points) of unfavorable prior year reserve development, predominately related to legacy business lines which are now in run-off, compared to unfavorable prior year development of $3.4 million (5.0 percentage points) during the prior year period. The combined ratio difference between the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 reflects adverse development during the fourth quarter of 2016 related to a number of infrequent, but severe Public Transportation charter bus claims. For full year 2017, the combined ratio was 108.4% compared to a combined ratio of 98.1% for the prior year with the difference primarily related to reserve strengthening in the second quarter of 2017. Prior year unfavorable reserve development in 2017 totaled $19.2 million compared to $13.8 million for the full year 2016.\nBook value per share as of December 31, 2017 was $27.83, an increase of $0.90 per share during the fourth quarter, after the payment of cash dividends to shareholders totaling $0.27 per share. For full year 2017, book value per share increased $1.02 after the payment of cash dividends to shareholders totaling $1.08 per share. The combination of the year-to-date increase in book value of $1.02, plus dividends paid to shareholders of $1.08, represents an annualized total value creation of 7.8% on beginning book value for the full year 2017.\nThe Company's net income, determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) includes items that may not be indicative of ongoing operations. The following table reconciles income before federal income taxes to underwriting income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure that is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31 December 31 2017 2016 2017 2016 Income before federal income taxes $ 10,506 $ 7,067 $ 10,122 $ 43,054 Less: Net realized gains on investments 4,152 6,204 19,686 23,228 Income (loss) from core business operations $ 6,354 $ 863 $ (9,564 ) $ 19,826 Less: Net investment income 5,661 3,982 18,095 14,483 Underwriting income (loss) $ 693 $ (3,119 ) $ (27,659 ) $ 5,343 Income (loss) from core business operations, before federal income taxes, was $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to income (loss) from core business operations, before federal income taxes, of $0.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. Income (loss) from core business operations, before federal income tax benefits, was ($9.6 million) for the full year 2017 compared to income (loss) from core business operations, before federal income taxes, of $19.8 million during the prior year.\nThe Company’s management uses the term income (loss) from core business operations , a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as income before federal income taxes excluding pre-tax realized investment gains and losses . This financial measure is used to evaluate the Company’s performance because the recognition of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and could distort the analysis of trends. The Company believes equity analysts exclude gains and losses on investments in their analysis of the Company’s results.\nThe combined ratios and the components, as presented herein, are commonly used in the property/casualty insurance industry and are applied to the Company’s GAAP underwriting results.\nConference Call Information:\nBaldwin & Lyons, Inc. has scheduled its quarterly conference call for Thursday, February 15, 2018, at 11:00 AM EST to discuss results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nTo participate via teleconference, investors may dial 1-877-705-6003 (U.S./Canada) or 1-201-493-6725 (International or local) at least five minutes prior to the beginning of the call.
