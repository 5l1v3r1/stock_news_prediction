Lenders should be further boosted by a pick-up in lending in 2018 as the government embarks on a stimulus of 72 billion riyals to support private-sector growth over the next four years.\nRiyad Bank’s loans and advances at end-December fell 2.9 percent on year, while deposits dipped 1.5 percent over the same period.\nThe bank has been hit by a contraction in lending and deposits for each quarter since the third quarter of 2016.
