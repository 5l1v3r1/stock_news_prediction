He has argued that economic statistics do not fully capture the fact that consumer prices are held in check by new technologies.\nRieder had forecast three or more rate hikes at the beginning of 2017, at the time a minority viewpoint, and he was ultimately vindicated as the Fed raised rates three times last year.\nOn Wednesday, Rieder said he does not expect that stronger inflation will have “negative macroeconomic implications.” Investors are currently debating whether tax cuts and a bigger U.S. budget deficit will cause the economy to overheat and force the Fed to hike quickly, hurting markets.\nInstitutional shares of Rieder’s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund were up 6/10ths percent this year, as of Tuesday, beating most of its peers, according to Thomson Reuters’ Lipper unit.\nBlackRock oversees more than $6 trillion in stocks, bonds and other assets.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T00:34:05.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
