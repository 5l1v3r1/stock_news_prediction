The warrant involved former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page and was renewed three times since October 2016. \n“We have a responsibility ... to ensure Americans that the FISA process is not being abused, and that’s what we did,” Devin Nunes, the panel’s Republican chairman, told Fox News on Monday. \nTrump, in a post on Twitter on Monday, accused Schiff of leaking “confidential” information. \n“Adam (Schiff) leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!” Trump wrote. \nSchiff responded with his own tweet: “Mr. President, I see you’ve had a busy morning of ‘Executive Time.’ Instead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or...really anything else.” \nTrump denies that his campaign colluded with Moscow to influence the presidential election, while Russia maintains it did not meddle in the vote.
