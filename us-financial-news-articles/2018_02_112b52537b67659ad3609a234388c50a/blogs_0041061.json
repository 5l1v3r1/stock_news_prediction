Around 30 police officers and some protesters were injured, he said.\nMajzooban, a website linked to the Gonabadi Sufis, said some protesters were shot by the police.\nPhotos posted on social media showed Dervishes with faces covered in blood, and burning cars and motorcycles apparently torched by protesters. Online videos showed police firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators.\nSufism is considered one of the most peaceful sects of Islam. Despite being under constant pressure by the Iranian authorities, dervishes have no history of armed clashes with the government.\nAccording to the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI), several Dervishes were arrested in the last two months. It said 10 were injured in the city of Kowar on Jan. 14 after police attacked a rally held to demand the release of Sufi detainees.\nA U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran voiced concern in 2017 about the “targeting and harsh treatment” of members of various Sufi groups, saying they “continue to face arbitrary arrest, harassment and detention, and are often accused of national security crimes such as acting against national security”.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Michael Perry and Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T13:44:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
