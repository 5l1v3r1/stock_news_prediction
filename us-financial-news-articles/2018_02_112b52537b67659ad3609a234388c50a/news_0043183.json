It was approved by Canada in 2016, though construction has been delayed by permitting issues.\nBritish Columbia has defended its proposed rules, saying it has every right to take steps to protect its land and waters, while Alberta says the rules are outside of the province’s jurisdiction as the pipeline is federally regulated.\nThe spat has led to Alberta forming a task force to find new ways to strike back at B.C., while British Columbia has proclaimed April as B.C. Wine Month and has ramped up the promotion of its wine within its borders and abroad.\nReporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:15:57.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
