Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said on the heels of the president's speech that \"I was stunned by the complete and utter disconnect between his words and reality.\"\nCummings, in an emailed statement, said that he, \"More than any other member of Congress,\" has \"tried over and over and over to work with\" Trump on legislation that could help reduce drug prices. Those include a bill that would allow Medicare, the government-run health coverage system for primarily senior citizens, to negotiate directly with pharmaceuticals companies on prices.\nCummings pointed out that he and Rep. Pete Welch, D-Vt., met with Trump last March to discuss rising drug costs and that the two congressmen gave the president a draft of the Medicare bill. Trump \"seemed enthusiastic about the proposal,\" according to Cummings' office.\n\"But all I have heard back is radio silence,\" Cummings said. \"Instead, his actions have gone in exactly the opposite direction — tapping a pharmaceutical executive to lead HHS and giving drug companies one of the biggest tax breaks in history despite their already record profits,\" Cummings said. \n\n\"These aren't just empty promises, they are obvious falsehoods. I must keep up hope that the President will finally change course, and I stand ready to work with him or anyone else should that happen.\"\nIn his State of the Union address, Trump \"made clear lowering drug prices and combating the opioid crisis are priorities for his Administration,\" said a White House representative who didn't want be named. \"The President looks forward to ongoing work with his Cabinet, Congress and local leaders on the best path to tackle these issues.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T00:31:29.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
