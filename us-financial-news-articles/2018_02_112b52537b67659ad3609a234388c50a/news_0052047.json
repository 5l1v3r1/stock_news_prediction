REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui On Saturday, authorities seized a farmhouse, a solar power plant and land that belonged to him.\nAlso on Saturday, India’s Enforcement Directorate, which fights financial crimes, said on Twitter it had taken possession of 21 other properties belonging to Modi worth 5.24 billion rupees ($81 million) in the latest swoop in Mumbai and Pune, another city in western India.\nEarlier in the week, the agency said it had seized luxury cars worth millions of rupees belonging to Modi.\nA lawyer for Modi has denied his client was involved in any fraud.\nChoksi’s firm, Gitanjali Gems ( GTGM.NS ), has also denied involvement in the alleged fraud.\nSeparately, India’s federal police on Thursday registered a case against a Delhi-based jeweler on a fraud complaint filed by Oriental Bank of Commerce, another state-owned bank, a police source said.\nThe lender has alleged the firm, Dwarka Das Seth International, cheated the bank with the help of some of its officials, using letters of credit (LCs) — a loan instrument similar to those used by Modi’s and Choksi’s firms in the alleged fraud.\nReuters was unable to reach the Delhi firm as the phone numbers listed online did not work.\n($1 = 64.7000 Indian rupees)\nReporting by Swati Bhat; Editing by Clelia Oziel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T12:51:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
