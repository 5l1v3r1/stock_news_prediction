Crozz crossover and the I.D. Buzz microbus.\nBischoff said VW will use the Geneva auto show on March 5-7 to give early guidance on what the post-I.D. generation of EVs might look like, but declined to elaborate.\nBischoff belongs to VW’s old guard, having worked a quarter of a century in VW’s design operations and the past decade as head of the core brand’s design.\nHe became famous through a video shot at the 2011 Frankfurt auto show that has since drawn over 2 million hits on YouTube.\nIt showed Bischoff being yelled at by former CEO Martin Winterkorn, who was inspecting a model by South Korean rival Hyundai ( 005380.KS ) and had discovered something that had displeased him.\n“In the past everything was very centralized, very narrow boundaries were set on the road of success,” Bischoff said. “Today is the most exciting time of my career because I‘m allowed to do things that didn’t use to exist that way.”\nReporting by Andreas Cremer; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T14:52:52.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
