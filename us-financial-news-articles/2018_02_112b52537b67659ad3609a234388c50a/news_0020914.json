The law firm said it was also working on claims at supermarket rivals Sainsbury’s ( SBRY.L ) and Asda, the British arm of Walmart ( WMT.N ).\nUnequal pay for men and women is currently a hot topic in Britain’s boardrooms and corridors of power. The resignation last month of Carrie Gracie as China Editor for the BBC led to an investigation into pay differences at the public broadcaster.\nBritish Business Secretary Greg Clark told Sky News he was “surprised” by the scale of the claim against Tesco.\nA Tesco spokesman said the firm had not yet received a claim.\n“Tesco has always been a place for people to get on in their career, regardless of their gender, background or education, and we work hard to make sure all our colleagues are paid fairly and equally for the jobs they do,” he said.\nTesco shares were down 0.9 percent at 1010 GMT.\nLeigh Day said Tesco distribution center staff may earn in excess of 11 pounds ($15.4) an hour, while the most common grade for store staff saw them receive around 8 pounds per hour.\nThis disparity could see a full time distribution worker on the same hours earning over 100 pounds a week - or 5,000 pounds a year - more than female store staff.\nThe law firm said more than 200,000 Tesco employees may be underpaid and estimated shortfalls could reach 20,000 pounds each, meaning the potential bill for Tesco could be as high as 4 billion pounds.\nLeigh Day said it had already started submitting claims on behalf of its clients through conciliation service ACAS, the first stage in the Employment Tribunal process.\nIt said it had been approached by over 1,000 employees and former employees of Tesco.\n“In terms of equal worth to the company there really should be no argument that workers in stores, compared to those working in distribution centers, contribute at least equal value to the vast profits made by Tesco,” said Leigh Day employment lawyer Paula Lee.\nThe firm said it was also representing over 20,000 shop-floor workers in equal pay claims against rival supermarket groups Sainsbury’s and Asda.\n($1 = 0.7147 pounds)\nEditing by Guy Faulconbridge and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T09:13:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
