This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so there’s no reason not to come out,” said Devan Hunt, a 19-year-old University of Minnesota student who was waiting in line to have his picture taken inside a giant, transparent football. \nThere were occasional celebrity sightings, such as television’s Jimmy Fallon popping up periodically, followed by gaggles of fans, their cellphone cameras raised. \nOther fans took turns posing beside a statue of Mary Tyler Moore, the late actress whose eponymous show in the 1970s took place in Minneapolis. \n“Why would I waste the opportunity? It could be 100 degrees and I’d still be out here,” said high school student Stephen Zapata, 17. \nThose who wanted their fun indoors paid $35 for the Super Bowl Experience inside the convention centre, where fans could test their football skills by running through obstacle courses with the ball, kicking field goals or passing the ball deep into baskets.

Now you know you’re watching a dangerous game.” \nSome fans waited to see whether any players from the Eagles or Patriots would kneel during the national anthem, a practise criticized by President Donald Trump. \n“The stage doesn’t get much bigger than this,” said Olivia House, 20, a college student in Minneapolis who said she hoped player protests would spark more dialogue about social justice issues. \nAlso missing from the festivities were the city’s homeless, whose routines were disrupted by the influx of out-of-town visitors and a security operation that established a perimeter around U.S. Bank Stadium. \nHomeless advocates worked with local Super Bowl organizers to mitigate the impact on the homeless and educate them on the changes to come, said Gail Dorfman, an advocate for the homeless an executive director of St. Stephen’s Human Services. \nDan Sherman, a 60-year-old homeless man, who was riding the train to stay warm, said he was concerned about where to go when the train would be closed on game day. \nStill, Sherman said he was enjoying the Super Bowl festivities. \n“The people are in a good mood,” he said. “I‘m in a good mood and I think that’s because of the people of Minnesota.” Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Additional reporting by Chris Kenning; Editing by Lisa Shumaker", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T13:40:30.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
