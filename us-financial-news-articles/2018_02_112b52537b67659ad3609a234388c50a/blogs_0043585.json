Singapore’s SWF GIC managed 63 deals, or 19 percent.\nTogether with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Qatar Investment Authority, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and China Investment Corporation (CIC), they accounted for over 70 percent of the acquisition count.\nTechnology was the most popular sector, accounting for 26.1 percent of total transactions in the first half of 2017, up from 24.3 percent in 2016.\nMore SWFs are sinking money into tech start-ups in an attempt to protect their holdings in mature sectors from new companies such as Airbnb and Uber. Artificial intelligence and virtual reality have also attracted interest.\nReal estate accounted for 23.9 percent of deals in the first half of 2017, up from 21.5 percent in 2016. CIC’s acquisition of pan-European warehouse group Logicor was the biggest deal in the first half of 2017, worth $13.8 billion.\nLogistics companies are considered well-placed to benefit from the growth of companies like Amazon, which use massive warehouses as distribution hubs. Student housing and high- quality office blocks also remained popular with SWFs.\nThe United States, India, Singapore, China, Australia, and Britain were key destinations.\nCapape said it was too early to say whether Britain’s vote to leave the European Union had had an impact on its appeal to SWFs: “They may be benefiting from a low pound. We can’t say it’s a big drop in investments after Brexit.”\nHe noted an uptick in interest in emerging-market infrastructure, which soared from 3 percent of direct investment in infrastructure in 2012 to nearly 30 percent in 2016.\nAt the same time, infrastructure’s share of total foreign direct investment dollars spent rose from 12 percent in 2015 to 20 percent in 2016.\n“Fierce competition for prize assets, coupled with skyrocketing prices, has nudged some SWFs toward emerging and frontier markets,” the report noted.\nDeveloped markets, with exceptions such as Australia and Britain, have failed to satisfy SWF demand for infrastructure and utility plays.\nWith President Donald Trump releasing his long-awaited infrastructure plan on Monday, the United States could offer fresh opportunities.\nBut Capape said some funds might run into opposition on national security grounds. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks, has become more risk-averse under Trump .\n“The criticism that comes from some SWFs when investing in developed markets is that this definition of national security is very loose and it may be used to defend against important assets being controlled by foreigners,” he said.\nReporting by Claire Milhench, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T04:55:51.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
