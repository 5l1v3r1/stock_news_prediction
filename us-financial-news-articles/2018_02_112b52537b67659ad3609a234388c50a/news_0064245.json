(NASDAQ:FOXF) (“FOX” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 29, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Highlights\nSales increased 8.6% to $121.1 million compared to $111.6 million in the same period last fiscal year Gross margin increased 180 basis points to 32.3% compared to 30.5% in the same period last fiscal year; Non-GAAP adjusted gross margin increased 190 basis points to 32.5% compared to the same period last fiscal year The provision for income taxes of $12.4 million included a one-time charge of $9.3 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), or an impact of $0.24 per diluted share, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 81.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Exclusive of the impact of the Act, the effective tax rate was 20.4% Net income was $2.9 million, or 2.4% of sales and $0.07 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.8 million, or 8.8% of sales and $0.26 per diluted share in the same period last fiscal year Non-GAAP adjusted net income was $14.9 million, or $0.38 adjusted earnings per diluted share, compared to $12.0 million, or $0.32 adjusted earnings per diluted share in the same period last fiscal year Adjusted EBITDA was $23.6 million, or 19.5% of sales, compared to $19.8 million, or 17.7% of sales in the same period last fiscal year\n“We are pleased with our finish to fiscal 2017. The strength of our product line-ups for both bike and powered vehicles fueled our financial results for the year,” commented Larry L. Enterline, FOX's Chief Executive Officer. “As we enter fiscal 2018, product innovation remains a key cornerstone of the FOX brand and our success in both bike and powered vehicle products as we continue to deliver differentiated products to our passionate customer base. Our team remains committed to further building the FOX brand presence in our existing vehicle categories and consistently pursuing potential new markets to generate future growth and enhance shareholder value.”\nSales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were $121.1 million, an increase of 8.6% as compared to sales of $111.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This increase reflects a 9.6% increase in sales of powered vehicle products and a 7.5% increase in sales of bike products. The increase in sales of powered vehicle products was due to high demand for on and off-road suspension products including aftermarket accessory packages. The increase in sales of bike products primarily reflects new product introductions, favorable model year spec placements, and strong sell through with certain higher growth OEMs.\nGross margin was 32.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a 180 basis point increase from gross margin of 30.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies in addition to favorable product and customer mix. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted gross margin increased 190 basis points, excluding the effects of acquisition related costs. A reconciliation of gross profit to non-GAAP adjusted gross profit and the resulting non-GAAP adjusted gross margin is provided at the end of this press release.\nTotal operating expenses were $23.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $20.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in operating expenses is primarily a result of acquisition and operating costs relating to Tuscany, strategic investments to support future business growth, and increased patent litigation costs, partially offset by the decrease in acquisition-related compensation due to the conclusion of the Company’s acquisition-related compensation arrangements.\nAs a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 19.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 18.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Non-GAAP operating expense was $19.8 million, or 16.4% of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $17.6 million, or 15.8% of sales, in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Reconciliations of operating expense to non-GAAP operating expense are provided at the end of this press release.\nThe Company’s provision for income taxes was $12.4 million, or 81.3% of pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This includes a one-time impact of the Act of $9.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of the Act, the Company’s effective tax rate was 20.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The cash outlay in 2018 related to the $9.3 million charge is expected to be limited to $2.0 million in withholding taxes as the Company expects to utilize foreign tax credits to satisfy a portion of the impact of the Act.\nNet income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $2.9 million, compared to net income of $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $0.07, compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.26 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $23.6 million, compared to $19.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 19.5%, compared to 17.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of adjusted EBITDA margin are provided at the end of this press release.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income was $14.9 million, or $0.38 adjusted earnings per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $12.0 million, or $0.32 adjusted earnings per diluted share in the same period of last fiscal year. Reconciliations of net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income and the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share are provided at the end of this press release.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nSales for the year ended December 29, 2017 were $475.6 million, an increase of 18.0% compared to the same period in 2016. Sales of powered vehicle and bike products increased 30.5% and 8.2%, respectively, for 2017 compared to the prior year period.\nGross margin was 32.5% for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2017, an 110 basis point increase compared to gross margin of 31.4% in fiscal year 2016. The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies as well as favorable product and customer mix.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $93.8 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2017, compared to $70.8 million in fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.7% in fiscal 2017, compared to 17.6% in fiscal 2016. Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin are provided at the end of this press release.\nThe Company’s provision for income taxes of $21.1 million for fiscal 2017, or 32.8% of pretax income, includes the impact of the Act, as noted previously. The net charge of $9.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, resulted in a 14.5% increase in the Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017.\nNet income in fiscal year 2017 was $43.2 million, compared to $35.7 million in fiscal 2016. Earnings per diluted share for fiscal year 2017 was $1.11, compared to $0.94 in fiscal 2016.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income was $61.5 million, or $1.59 adjusted earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2017, compared to $46.4 million, or $1.23 adjusted earnings per diluted share, in fiscal 2016. Reconciliations of net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income and the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share are provided at the end of this press release.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAs of December 29, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $35.9 million compared to $35.3 million as of December 30, 2016. Total debt was $98.6 million, compared to $66.7 million as of December 30, 2016, reflecting the financing of the Company’s recent acquisition of Tuscany. Inventory was $84.8 million as of December 29, 2017, compared to $71.2 million as of December 30, 2016. As of December 29, 2017, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $61.1 million and $40.8 million, respectively, compared to December 30, 2016 balances of $61.6 million and $36.2 million, respectively. The increase in inventory and accounts payable reflects the growth of the Company’s business, the expansion of its manufacturing facilities, and Tuscany.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company expects sales in the range of $121 million to $127 million and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.30 to $0.35.\nFor the fiscal year 2018, the Company expects sales in the range of $542 million to $570 million and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.66 to $1.84. The Company’s full year 2018 guidance assumes a tax rate of 19%-21%.\nNon-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share exclude the following items net of applicable tax: amortization of purchased intangibles, contingent consideration valuation adjustment, acquisition-related compensation expense including related foreign currency transaction gains and losses, certain acquisition-related adjustments and expenses, litigation-related expenses and offering expenses. Additionally, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share excludes the tax benefit related to the resolution of audits by taxing authorities. A quantitative reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2018 is not available without unreasonable efforts because management cannot predict, with sufficient certainty, all of the elements necessary to provide such a reconciliation.\nConference Call & Webcast\nThe Company will hold an investor conference call today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time).

NASDAQ Global Select Market is a registered trademark of The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. All rights reserved.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), FOX is including in this press release “non-GAAP gross margin”, “non-GAAP operating expense”, “non-GAAP adjusted net income”, “non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share”, “adjusted EBITDA”, and “adjusted EBITDA margin”, which are non-GAAP financial measures. FOX defines non-GAAP gross margin as gross profit margin adjusted for certain acquisition related costs. FOX defines non-GAAP operating expense as operating expense adjusted for amortization of purchased intangibles, contingent consideration valuation adjustments, acquisition related compensation expense, costs of its secondary and shelf offerings, acquisition related operating expenses, and litigation-related costs. FOX defines non-GAAP adjusted net income as net income attributable to FOX Stockholders adjusted for amortization of purchased intangibles, contingent consideration valuation adjustments, acquisition related compensation expense including related foreign currency transaction gains and losses, costs of its secondary and shelf offerings, acquisition related expenses, and litigation-related costs, all net of applicable tax, as well as tax reform legislation impacts. These adjustments are more fully described in the tables included at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share is defined as non-GAAP adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding during the period. FOX defines adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for interest expense, net other expense, income taxes, amortization of purchased intangibles, depreciation, stock-based compensation, offering expense, contingent consideration valuation adjustments, acquisition related compensation expense including related foreign currency transaction gains and losses, litigation-related costs, and certain other acquisition related that are more fully described in the tables included at the end of this press release. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by sales.\nFOX includes these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes they allow investors to understand and evaluate the Company’s core operating performance and trends. In particular, the exclusion of certain items in calculating non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA (and accordingly, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA margin) can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s core business. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, including the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies because other companies may calculate non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin differently than FOX does. For more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, see the tables included at the end of this press release.\nFOX FACTORY HOLDING CORP.
