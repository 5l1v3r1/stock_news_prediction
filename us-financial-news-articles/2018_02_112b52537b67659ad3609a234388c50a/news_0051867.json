The military-appointed legislature changed the election law last month, signaling another delay to early 2019. \nThat sparked a series of anti-junta, pro-election protests that have gained momentum in recent weeks with gatherings taking place in several provinces across Thailand. \nOn Saturday, around 300 activists congregated at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, wearing and distributing paper masks resembling Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to Pinocchio. \nOne of them, Sirawith Seritiwat, said the mask was called Yuth-nocchio - a reference to the infamous fictional character whose nose gets longer every time he lies. \n“Enough with the lies. Time’s up for dictatorship. It’s the people’s time now. We must vote this year,” Sirawith told the crowd. \nActivists also held up three fingers, which they said symbolized their demands in the slogan: “Elections must take place this year. Down with dictatorship. Long live democracy.” \n\nA Pro-democracy activist holds up a mask to mock Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha as Pinocchio during a protest against junta at a university in Bangkok, Thailand, February 24, 2018.

Prayuth and Prawit must go,” he added, referring to another junta leader Prawit Wongsuwan. \nWatana Muangsook, a member of the Puea Thai party which has won every election in the last decade, also came to Saturday’s gathering “to show support” to the activists. \n“People have the right to demand elections,” Wattana said. \nThe junta lodged a lawsuit last week against seven activists for inciting unrest and 43 protesters for illegal gathering after a protest last month at the Democracy Monument in Bangkok that also involved hundreds of activists. \nReporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat; writing by Patpicha Tanakasempipat; editing by Clelia Oziel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T18:57:17.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
