The chair (of FATF) is expected to make a statement some time this afternoon in Paris,” the diplomat said.\nBoth officials spoke on condition of anonymity.\nPakistan’s foreign ministry spokesman declined to confirm or deny the news at a regular news briefing on Friday, saying the FATF would make an announcement on its website.\n“Let the things come out, and then we can comment on the U.S.-Pakistan relationship,” spokesman Mohammad Faisal said.\nA man stands at the entrance of Government Al-Aziz Hospital, previously known as Al-Aziz Hospital, run by the Islamic charity organisation Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) in Muridke near Lahore, Pakistan February 15, 2018. Picture taken February 15, 2018. REUTERS/Mohsin Raza Pakistan was on the list for three years until 2015.\nPAINFUL CONSEQUENCES? Earlier in the week China, Turkey, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) were opposing the U.S.-led move against Pakistan but by late on Thursday, both China and the GCC dropped their opposition, the diplomatic source said.\nSlideshow (2 Images) He added that the financial consequences would not kick in until June, which, in theory, could allow Pakistan time to fix financing issues.\n“But the odds of that, particularly in an election year, seem slim,” he added.\nPakistani officials and analysts fear being on the FATF list could endanger Pakistan’s handful of remaining banking links to the outside world, causing real financial pain to the economy just as a general election looms.\nUnder FATF rules one country’s opposition is not enough to prevent a motion from being successful. Britain, France and Germany backed the U.S. move.\nPakistan has sought to head off its inclusion on the list by amending its anti-terrorism laws and by taking over organizations controlled by Hafiz Saeed, a Pakistan-based Islamist accused by the United States and India of being behind 2008 militant attacks on the Indian city of Mumbai in which 166 people were killed.\nOn Tuesday, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif tweeted that Pakistan had received a three-month reprieve, adding that it was “grateful to friends who helped”.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month ordered big cuts in security aid to Pakistan over what the United States sees as its failure to crack down on militants.\nPakistan rejects accusations that it sponsors Taliban militants fighting U.S. forces in neighboring Afghanistan and says it is doing all it can to combat militancy.\nWriting by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T11:24:51.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
