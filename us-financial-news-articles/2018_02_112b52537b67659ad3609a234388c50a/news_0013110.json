German 30-year bond yields rose to two-year highs at 1.429 percent.\nTwo-year bond yields were down slightly on the day, leaving the German curve out to 10 years at its steepest since mid-2014 .\nBond markets across the world have started 2018 on a weak footing as strong economic data and signs of a pick in inflationary pressures stoke a perception that major central banks could step back from ultra-easy monetary policies sooner rather than later.\nFor now, U.S. bond markets are setting the tone for euro zone peers, said analysts, with many expecting 10-year Treasury yields to test 3 percent soon.\nEuropean Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is expected to speak later on Monday and could use the opportunity to warn against an “unwarranted rise” in borrowing costs, analysts at ING said in a note.\nSouthern European bonds, which have outperformed their top-rated peers in recent weeks, also succumbed to selling pressure with yields up as much as 3 basis points. That in turn pushed out spreads over German peers .\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T10:39:37.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
