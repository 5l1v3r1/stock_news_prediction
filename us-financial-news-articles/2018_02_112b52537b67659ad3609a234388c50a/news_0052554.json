They won gold in Turin in 2006.\nThe German pair of Friedrich and Thorsten Margis shared gold with Canada in the two-man event on Monday after a dramatic dead-heat.\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:01:05.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
