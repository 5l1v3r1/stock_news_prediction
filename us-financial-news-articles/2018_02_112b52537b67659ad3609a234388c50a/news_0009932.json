(NASDAQ:ASFI) (“Asta” or the “Company”) today announced that its Board of Directors passed a resolution declaring a special cash dividend of $5.30 per common share, payable on February 28, 2018, to stockholders of record as of February 16, 2018. The aggregate payment will be approximately $35 million.\nAsta last paid a cash dividend in 2012. In the period since then, the Board of Directors elected to retain cash reserves in the Company in order to finance the Company’s operations and support growth. As a result of the Board of Directors’ review of Asta’s current financial condition, the Board of Directors has determined that the payment of the special dividend is in the best interests of Asta and its stockholders. The Board of Directors has no current plans to implement a quarterly dividend program or pay any other special cash dividend.\n\"We are pleased to return to our stockholders a common dividend of $5.30 a share, which represents 74% of its closing price of $7.20 per share as of February 2, 2018. This dividend provides an immediate benefit to our stockholders, while allowing us to remain well positioned for future growth with ample liquidity for select investment opportunities,\" said Gary Stern, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Stern continued, \"I would like to personally thank our stockholders for the unwavering support and loyalty they have shown to the Company over the last several years.\"\nAbout Asta Funding, Inc.\nAsta Funding, Inc.
