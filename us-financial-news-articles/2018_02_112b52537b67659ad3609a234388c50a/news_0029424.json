The most recent Congressional Budget Office projections have the trajectory leading to a debt-to-GDP ratio of 150 percent by 2047, well past the point where financial crises typically occur.\nIn addition, the budget deficit is likely to swell, with the CBO projecting an increase from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2017 to 9.8 percent in 2047.\nCongress in December passed a tax reform measure likely to cost $1.5 trillion and earlier in the week reached a budget plan that raises spending limits by about $300 billion over the next two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T20:31:37.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
