REUTERS/Darren Whiteside Lagarde said she and Widodo discussed the importance of achieving higher potential growth to help create jobs, adding “This requires mobilizing revenues to finance development spending and support reforms in the product, labor and financial markets.”\nIn its recent annual review of Indonesia’s policies, the Fund said the government should focus on financing infrastructure with domestic revenue in order to avoid a build-up of external debt.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Lagarde, whose visit comes two decades after a painful IMF bail-out imposed harsh austerity on Indonesia, praised the country’s greatly expanded health care system during a hospital visit.\nWidodo also took her shopping at a crowded Jakarta textiles market, along with Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati.\nThe IMF chief on Tuesday will participate in an economic conference , featuring central bankers and other officials from ASEAN countries, focused on new growth models and adjusting to rapidly changing technologies.\nShe also plans to visit the city of Yogyakarta in Java and the island of Bali, where the IMF will hold its annual meetings in October.\nReporting by David Lawder and Maikel Jefriando; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T12:16:32.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
