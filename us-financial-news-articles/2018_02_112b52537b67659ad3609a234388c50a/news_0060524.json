You won't need an Amazon Prime account to watch, either â€” it'll just cost you $64.99, and you'll be able to watch it on all the same devices where you can watch Amazon Prime videos.\nRead more from Recode:\nThe media merger wars are on.

Remember, the company paid $50 million last year to stream \"Thursday Night Football\" games and is in the bidding to get a multi-year contract with the NFL to stream \"Thursday Night Football\" again. Live sports matter to Amazon. Amazon's move to PPV should be another warning to cable companies that Amazon is becoming its own kind of cable company. It already does a lot of what cable companies do, like provide a slate of movies and TV shows, some of them original, for a monthly fee. In that vein, PPV is a natural progression for where Amazon seems to be headed. Amazon declined to discuss deal terms for the UFC arrangement, though it's likely Amazon will get the same cut that cable providers normally get in these kinds of deals. When boxer Floyd Mayweather faced off against Manny Pacquiao a few years ago, for example, the cable providers took in around 30 percent to 40 percent of the subscription revenue, according to the New York Times . That wasn't a UFC fight, but these UFC deals work in much the same way.\nSaturday's UFC 222 is on sale through Amazon beginning Wednesday.\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.
