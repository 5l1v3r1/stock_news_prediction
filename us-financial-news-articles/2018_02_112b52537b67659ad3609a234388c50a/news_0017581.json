I think my level is getting better.” \nWawrinka’s semifinal opponent will be Bosnian qualifier Mirza Basic, who produced a solid display to beat Maximilian Marterer 6-4 4-6 6-3, claiming his second German scalp after eliminating fourth seed Philipp Kohlschreiber on Wednesday. \nWorld number 93 Marius Copil fired down 13 aces to reach his first ATP semifinal with an impressive 6-4 6-4 victory over third seed Gilles Muller – his third consecutive straight sets win. \nThe 6ft 4in Romanian lost only three points on his serve before breaking for a 5-4 lead and wrapping up the opening set, winning the next game to love. \nThe second set was a tighter affair but Luxembourg’s Muller, one of the last of dying breed of players prepared to serve-and-volley, couldn’t find a solution to Copil’s aggression and accuracy. \nCopil will face Slovakian qualifier Jozef Kovalik, who continued his fairytale week with a 7-6(2) 6-4 win over Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis, his fifth successive victory on Bulgarian soil. \nWorld number 187 Kovalik needed all his firepower and mental strength to fend off the resilient Cypriot in a highly charged clash that lasted one hour and 55 minutes and reach his first ATP semifinal. \n“This is the biggest win of my career,” a delighted Kovalik said in a courtside interview.
