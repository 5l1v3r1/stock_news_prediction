[.EU][.N]\nTokyo's .N225 0.65 percent fall had been compounded as the yen JPY= hit a five-month high amid a renewed bout of dollar .DXY weakness which had also helped lift bond and commodity markets after recent turbulence.

A stronger-than-expected reading on price pressures could trigger a fresh wave of selling.\nWorld markets’ main ‘fear gauge’, the VIX volatility index .VIX was nudging higher again after two days of easing back.\nThe currency market remained choppy too.\nBritain's pound was briefly jolted to a session high of $1.3924 GBP= GBP=D4 after headline annual UK inflation came in at 3.0 percent, a tenth of a point above forecasts and holding close to its highest level in nearly six years.\nThe data highlighted the challenge the Bank of England faces as it tries to return price growth to target over the next two years. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies .DXY fell over 0.4 percent to 89.923 as the bears returned.

The Australian dollar was steady at $0.7866 AUD=D4 after rising about 0.6 percent overnight on the back of higher commodity prices and improvement in broader risk sentiment.
