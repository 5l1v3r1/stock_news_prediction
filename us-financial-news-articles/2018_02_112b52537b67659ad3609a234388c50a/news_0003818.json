Since then the shares have rallied, helped by good news from two other studies.\nFurther data from the Mystic trial is due in the first half of this year.\nFourth-quarter core EPS, which excludes some items, increased 7 percent to $1.30 cents on revenue of $5.78 billion, helped by one-off tax gains. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of 84 cents on revenue of $5.46 billion.\nReporting by Ben Hirschler; editing by Keith Weir, Elaine Hardcastle and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T18:27:55.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
