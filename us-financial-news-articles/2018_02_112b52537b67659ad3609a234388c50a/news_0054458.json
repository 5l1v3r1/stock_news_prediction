While it is not a sanctions list, Western banks may be reluctant to deal with Russian companies whose owners are on the list.\nIt also said it had no plans this year for a shares offering.\nThree sources told Reuters in mid February that En+ had invited international banks to pitch for the sale of $1 billion worth of shares.\n“In response to recent speculation in the media regarding a possible follow-on offering of securities by En+ Group, the board of directors of the group resolved that the company has no plan or intention to pursue an equity offering to the market in 2018,” it said.
