The story is similar for other cobalt developers Cobalt Blue, Artemis Resources and Aeon Metals.\nUnder the deal with SK Innovation, the South Korean company will take all of the nickel and cobalt from the Sconi mine, estimated at 12,000 tonnes per year (tpy) of cobalt sulphate and 60,000 tpy of nickel sulphate. The deal also gives SK a six-year extension option.\n“We signed the deal to minimize supply volatility and the long-term supply contract is a way to ensure stable supplies,” an SK Innovation spokesman told Reuters.\nSK Innovation said in November it will invest 840.2 billion won ($777 million) to build an electric vehicle battery plant in Hungary to meet demand from automakers in Europe.\nAustralian Mines said the agreement also includes an option for SK Innovation to buy up to 19.9 percent of its ordinary shares.\nReporting by Melanie Burton; additional reporting by Jane Chung; Editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:17:28.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
