REUTERS/Leah Millis Senator Mark Warner, the committee’s Democratic vice chairman, said he worried about commercialization of surveillance technologies as well as the close relationship between the Chinese government and Chinese technology firms.\n“Some of these Chinese tech companies may not even have to acquire an American company before they become pervasive in our markets,” Warner said.\nWray said the United States needed a more “strategic perspective on China’s efforts to use acquisitions and other types of business ventures” rather than just evaluating one transaction at a time.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Under questioning from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, none of the Intelligence officials said they would use a Huawei or ZTE product.\nLast week, Cotton and Republican Senator Marco Rubio introduced legislation that would block the government from buying or leasing telecoms equipment from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] or ZTE Corp, citing concern the companies would use their access to spy on U.S. officials.\nThe companies did not return calls last week seeking comment on the legislation.\nIn 2012, Huawei and ZTE were the subject of a U.S. investigation into whether their equipment provided an opportunity for foreign espionage and threatened critical U.S. infrastructure - something they have consistently denied.\n“Chinese cyber espionage and cyber attack capabilities will continue to support China’s national security and economic priorities,” said Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence.\n(This story has been refiled to include Cotton’s full name and title at first reference in paragraph 11)\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Frances Kerry and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T17:46:17.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
