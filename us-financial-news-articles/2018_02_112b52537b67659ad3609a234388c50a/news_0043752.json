For instance, “a foreign sovereign will be stripped of jurisdictional immunity when a claim is based upon commercial activity in the United States.”\nSince the 1970s, federal law has permitted lawsuits against, say, a state-owned airline, much as a consumer could sue a private commercial carrier. After Congress diluted sovereign immunity for state sponsors of terrorism, lower courts divided over whether any property the foreign government owned could be seized to satisfy a judgment, or only the same kinds of commercial property already at litigation risk.\nWednesday’s decision adopted the narrower interpretation. The Trump administration, maintaining a longstanding U.S. government position, had urged that approach.\nWhile saying it condemns terrorism and sympathizes with its victims, the Justice Department’s brief argued that “litigation against foreign states in U.S. courts can have significant foreign affairs implications for the United States, and can affect the reciprocal treatment of the United States in the courts of other nations.”\nThe case originated in 1997, when the Palestinian militant organization Hamas orchestrated three suicide bombings in Jerusalem that killed five people and injured 200. In 2003, eight Americans injured in the attacks and their relatives won a $71.5 million federal-court judgment against Iran for providing material support to Hamas.\nThe ancient clay tablets at the University of Chicago have been on loan from Iran since the 1930s.

University of Chicago archaeologists discovered the trove at Persepolis, the Persian capital destroyed by Alexander the Great in 331 B.C.\nThe small clay tablets, some the size of a domino, include cuneiform inscriptions and seals that document mundane activities under the Achaemenid dynasty. “They are vouchers and ledgers from the food exchange,” said David Strauss, a University of Chicago law professor who represented both the university and Iran at the December court arguments.\nThe loan, made by the Pahlavi dynasty that Islamic fundamentalists overthrew in 1979, was intended to allow scholars to research, translate and catalog the tablets. While researchers have had more than 80 years to finish the task, Mr. Strauss said archaeologists don’t move at a 21st century pace.\n“They’ve barely started,” he said.", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-2473?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2473?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2473?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2473?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2473?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2473?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-02-22T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T09:01:01.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
