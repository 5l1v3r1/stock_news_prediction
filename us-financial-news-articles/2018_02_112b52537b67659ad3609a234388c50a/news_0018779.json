A state-backed push towards electric vehicles is also shaking up the market and forcing Ford and others to seek partners and expand local “green” vehicle production.\nReporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T09:55:55.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
