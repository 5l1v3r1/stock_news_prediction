Current CEO and chairman Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi also ran Bradesco Seguros before becoming CEO in 2009, and will remain as chairman. \nPreferred Shares in Bradesco were up 0.75 percent at 38.70 reais in mid-afternoon trading in Sao Paulo, whereas benchmark Bovespa was down 0.6 percent. \nThree Bradesco executive vice presidents, each with more than 20 years at the bank, had also been in the running for the CEO post: investor relations director Alexandre Gluher, retail head Josu√© Pancini and IT executive Mauricio Minas. \nThey were named to Bradesco's board on Monday, as well as Executive Vice President Domingos Figueiredo de Abreu, who oversees loans approval.
