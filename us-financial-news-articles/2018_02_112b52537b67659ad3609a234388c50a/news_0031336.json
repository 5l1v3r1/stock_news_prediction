Sliding toward its worst year since 2003, the greenback, in which gold is priced, was hurt by tensions over North Korea, the Russian scandal surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump’s election campaign, and persistently low U.S. inflation. <FRX/>\nConcerns had begun to recede over the impact of U.S. interest rate hikes and fed into its rally. Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, because higher rates make it less attractive since it does not draw interest.\nMeanwhile, CI Investments Inc sharply increased its holdings in SPDR Gold Trust to nearly 3.9 million shares worth $482.1 million during the fourth quarter, up nearly three times from its 1.45 million shares worth $176.2 million during the third quarter.\nIt doubled its stake in Barrick Gold Corp to 312,762 shares worth $4.53 million, and increased its call options to 183,396 shares worth $6.78 million. This compares with 166,396 calls worth $6.8 million in the third quarter.\nCI Investments increased its holdings in Randgold Resources Ltd to 132,810 shares at a value of $13.13 million during the fourth quarter, up sharply from the third quarter’s 22,210 shares at a value of $2.17 million.\nReporting by Renita D.
