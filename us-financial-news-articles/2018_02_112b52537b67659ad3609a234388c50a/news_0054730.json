PM2.5 in Beijing stood at 34 micrograms in January, down 70.7 percent from a year earlier.\nMongolia has struggled with pollution in its capital, where an influx of out-of-work herders migrating from the countryside has seen the population double in less than two decades.\nThe government has offered subsidies for more-efficient wood- and coal-burning stoves and it is also providing free electricity at night in some districts.\nBut smog levels spike in the bitterly cold winters, especially in poor “ger” neighborhoods, named after the felt tents in which many migrants live.\nMany ger households burn coal or even trash to keep warm and the smog they produce has led to a surge in respiratory and heart disease and stoked anger and protests.\n“Reducing air pollution levels is the only long-term sustainable solution to protecting children’s health,” Heikens said.\n“In the meantime, thousands of children will continue to suffer unless urgent action is taken.”\nReporting by Terrence Edwards; Editing by David Stanway, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T10:02:25.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
