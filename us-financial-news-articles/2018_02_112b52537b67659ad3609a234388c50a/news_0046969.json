The police deny that and say those killed had resisted arrest.\nDuterte had previously said he would appoint dela Rosa as chief of the Bureau of Corrections when he retires from PNP.\nHe gave no details about the reforms he wanted dela Rosa to implement at the PNP. The police deny carrying out illegal killings during the anti-drugs campaign, but openly admit that corruption, abuse of power and insubordination are problems in the force.\nDuterte and dela Rosa are among those named in a complaint by a Philippine lawyer alleging crimes against humanity that the International Criminal Court has started a preliminary examination into.\nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Martin Petty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:39:28.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
