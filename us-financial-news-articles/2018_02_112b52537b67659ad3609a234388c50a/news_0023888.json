Workers told Reuters the United States was keeping on guards to watch the site. \nA Saudi-led coalition intervened in the war in 2015 in a bid to restore Hadi’s government, but little ground has changed hands after three years of fighting. \nThe United States is supporting that coalition by providing intelligence and weapons, and fighting al Qaeda militants in the south, mostly with drone strikes and sometimes commando raids. \nThe United Nations said in 2016 that the war has killed an estimated 10,000 people, displaced more than two million and pushed the country to the verge of famine. No new casualty figures have been released since.
