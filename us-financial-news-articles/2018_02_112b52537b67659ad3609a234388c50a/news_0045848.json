Total debt was reduced to $298 million as of December 31, 2017, including an increase of $21 million in foreign exchange adjustments, down from $357 million at the end of 2016\n“Our goal at the start of 2017 was to position the company for success through and beyond the downturn by maximizing free cash flow, deleveraging the balance sheet, and pursuing our strategic direction. Looking back on the year, our accomplishments to further these objectives included a successful public equity offering, an amendment to our revolving credit facility, meaningful debt reduction and the pending Noralta acquisition.\n“The improving commodity price environment at the start of 2018 should present Civeo with increased occupancy and additional growth opportunities across our core end markets. As we navigate this transitional phase of the cycle, our strategic priorities will not change. We remain committed to the operational execution and financial discipline that have seen us through the worst of the downturn.\n“The fourth quarter of 2017 was consistent with our expectations. We were pleased to announce the Noralta acquisition, enhancing our footprint in the Canadian market and our ability to deliver a complete outsourced accommodations solution. This transaction will help Civeo expand its position as the partner of choice for workforce accommodation services in the Canadian Oil Sands region. While there is still work to be done, including obtaining shareholder approval, we are targeting to close the acquisition in the second quarter,” said Bradley J. Dodson, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Dodson continued, “During the fourth quarter, we saw good occupancy in our Canadian segment as market conditions continued to stabilize. Our U.S. segment benefited from more robust activity in the unconventional plays and fabrication work for Gulf of Mexico customer projects. In Australia, we generated consistent occupancy and solid margin performance despite headwinds associated with the holidays towards the end of the year. Looking ahead to 2018, we remain focused on providing best in class service quality while prudently deploying capital, de-levering our balance sheet, and continuing to generate free cash flow.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Civeo generated revenues of $101.3 million and reported a net loss of $47.6 million, or $0.36 per share. The loss represents a $51.1 million pre-tax loss resulting in part from $27.2 million in impairment charges and $2.3 million in costs associated with Civeo’s announced acquisition of Noralta Lodge. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Civeo produced operating cash flow of $11.3 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $13.3 million, and free cash flow of $8.4 million.\n(EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude impairment charges and certain other costs. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from asset sales. Please see the reconciliations to GAAP measures at the end of this news release.)\nBy comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2016, Civeo generated revenues of $90.9 million and reported a net loss of $15.9 million, or $0.15 per share. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Civeo generated operating cash flow of $13.3 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $17.7 million and free cash flow of $10.1 million.\nThe decline in Adjusted EBITDA and the increase in net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower average daily rates in Canada and continued lower mobile camp activity, partially offset by increased occupancy in Canada.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nFor the full year 2017, the Company reported revenues of $382.3 million and a net loss of $105.7 million, or $0.82 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $63.2 million.\nIn 2016, the Company reported revenues of $397.2 million and a net loss of $96.4 million, or $0.90 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $86.7 million.\nThe decline in revenues and Adjusted EBITDA and increase in net loss in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the Ft. McMurray fire-related revenue in 2016 and lower average daily rates in Canada.\nBusiness Segment Results\n(Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares the quarterly results for the fourth quarter of 2017 to the results for the fourth quarter of 2016. The Adjusted EBITDA amounts discussed below exclude the fixed asset impairment and Noralta-related expenses noted above.)\nCanada\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Canadian segment generated revenues of $63.6 million, operating loss of $36.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $11.4 million, compared to revenues of $62.3 million, operating loss of $5.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 results reflect the impact of a strengthened Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, which increased revenues by $3.0 million. On a constant currency basis, revenues were lower primarily due a decrease in average daily rates, which was partially offset by an increase in average lodge occupancy.\nAustralia\nThe financial performance of the Australian segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue was $28.1 million, operating loss was $3.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to revenues of $26.1 million, operating loss of $2.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $10.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 results reflect the impact of a strengthened Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, which increased revenues by $0.7 million. On a constant currency basis, the Australian segment experienced a 4.8% period-over-period increase in revenues due to increased occupancy at villages in the Bowen Basin partially offset by lower rates resulting from the impact of a contract termination payment in 2016.\nU.S.\nThe U.S. segment generated revenues of $9.7 million, operating loss of $4.1 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to revenues of $2.5 million, operating loss of $4.0 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The revenue increase was primarily due to higher activity in the Gulf of Mexico offshore business.\nIncome Taxes\nCiveo recognized an income tax benefit of $3.6 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 7% in the fourth quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Civeo recognized an income tax benefit of $2.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 15%.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2017, Civeo had total liquidity of approximately $140.0 million, consisting of $107.4 million available under its revolving credit facilities and $32.6 million of cash on hand.\nCiveo’s total debt outstanding on December 31, 2017 was $298 million, a $30 million decrease since September 30, 2017. The decrease resulted primarily from the repayment of the U.S. term loan.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Civeo invested $3.2 million in maintenance related capital expenditures, down from $4.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, which included investments in an enterprise information system.\n2018 Guidance\nFor full year 2018, Civeo expects Adjusted EBITDA to be flat or slightly increased compared to 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, Civeo expects revenues of $100 million to $105 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $11 million to $13 million. Guidance does not account for the impact from the acquisition of Noralta Lodge. The Company will provide an additional full-year 2018 outlook upon close of the Noralta transaction, currently expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018.\nConference Call\nCiveo will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 financial results today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.

The term Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude impairment charges, certain costs associated with Civeo's redomiciliation and its acquisition of Noralta and severance costs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Civeo has included EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental disclosures because its management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information regarding its ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures and provide investors a helpful measure for comparing Civeo's operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Civeo uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to compare and to monitor the performance of its business segments to other comparable public companies and as a benchmark for the award of incentive compensation under its annual incentive compensation plan.

During the third quarter 2017, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.4 million ($3.2 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share), which is included in Impairment expense on the unaudited statements of operations. During the third quarter 2016, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $38.6 million ($28.2 million after-tax, or $0.26 per diluted share), of which $0.9 million is included in Cost of sales and $37.7 million is included in Impairment expense on the unaudited statements of operations. During the first quarter 2016, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $8.4 million ($8.4 million after-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share), which is included in Impairment expense on the unaudited statements of operations. (b) Relates to costs incurred associated with Civeo's proposed acquisition of Noralta Lodge Ltd. The $2.3 million of costs in 2017 ($2.2 million after-tax, or $0.02, per diluted share), which are primarily corporate in nature, are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the unaudited statements of operations. (c) Relates to costs incurred associated with Civeo's redomiciliation to Canada. The $1.3 million of costs in 2016 ($1.2 million after-tax, or $0.01, per diluted share), which are primarily corporate in nature, are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the unaudited statements of operations. (d) Relates to severance costs associated with the termination of executives. The $0.9 million expense ($0.6 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share), which is related to our Canadian segment, is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the unaudited statements of operations. (2) The term Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from asset sales. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for cash flow measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Additionally, Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Civeo has included Free Cash Flow as a supplemental disclosure because its management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information regarding the cash flow generating ability of its business relative to its capital expenditure and debt service obligations.
