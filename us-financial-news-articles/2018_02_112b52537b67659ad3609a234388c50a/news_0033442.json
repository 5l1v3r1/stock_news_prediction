We also grew our adjusted net income faster than sales, at 21% operationally, as we continue to deliver on our long-term value proposition.\n“As we mark our fifth year as an independent company, I am grateful to the colleagues of Zoetis who have placed us firmly on a course for sustainable profitable growth. We continue to drive innovations, lead in customer excellence and simplify our operations,” said Alaix. “As we look to the future, we will remain committed to strengthening our interconnected capabilities in direct sales, R&D and manufacturing, and look for additional investment opportunities to enhance our short and long term growth.”\n“We finished off 2017 with strong revenue and income growth, while almost doubling our operating cash flow for the year,” said Glenn David, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Zoetis. “For full year 2018, we expect operational growth of 5% to 7% in revenue and 20% to 26% in adjusted net income, while we continue to improve our working capital and fund investments that will support our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders.”\nQUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS\nZoetis organizes and manages its commercial operations across two regional segments: the United States (U.S.) and International. Within these segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for livestock and companion animals tailored to local trends and customer needs. In the fourth quarter of 2017:\nRevenue in the U.S. segment was $712 million, an increase of 13% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Sales of companion animal products grew 15%, driven by increased sales in our dermatology portfolio and several other new products, including Simparica ® (sarolaner), our oral parasiticide. This growth was tempered by the prior year’s initial sales of certain products into expanded distribution relationships. Sales of livestock products grew 11%, driven by growth in our cattle and poultry portfolios, which was partially offset by declines in swine products. In cattle, growth was driven by increased sales of premium products, which were supported by favorable weather conditions that drove higher disease risk and incidence and more placements in feedlots, as well as the timing of promotional activities in the prior year. In poultry, growth was driven by increased sales of medicated feed additive products, while lower sales of medicated feed additives drove declines in swine products. Consistent with the year, both cattle and swine products were negatively impacted by livestock producers’ continued implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive. Revenue in the International segment was $740 million, an increase of 16% on a reported basis and 13% operationally compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Sales of companion animal products grew 23% on a reported basis and 18% on an operational basis, resulting primarily from increased sales of our dermatology portfolio and Simparica. Sales of livestock products grew 14% on a reported basis and 11% on an operational basis, driven by balanced growth across our portfolio. New product launches drove growth in our fish portfolio in Norway as well as in our swine portfolio, primarily across Europe. Sales of cattle products grew primarily in Brazil and Canada, while poultry sales grew primarily across Asia Pacific.\nZoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse portfolio through the introduction of new products, lifecycle innovations, business development initiatives, strong customer relationships and entry into new markets and technologies. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company received approvals for new indications and formulations and expanded major product lines into new geographies.\nZoetis continued to expand the availability of its oral flea and tick medication, Simparica, into new markets, with additional approvals in Chile, Panama, the Philippines and Switzerland. The product also received approval in the European Union for the treatment of two additional types of skin mites. Simparica delivers fast and persistent protection from fleas and ticks in dogs, with effectiveness that lasts for a full 35 days, without losing efficacy at the end of the month. Building on the success of the company’s vaccine portfolio, Zoetis’ Vanguard ® Rapid Resp intranasal vaccine line was granted a one-year duration of immunity claim for canine adenovirus type 2 and canine parainfluenza virus, in addition to the product’s prior one-year duration of immunity claim for Bordatella bronchiseptica. Vanguard Rapid Resp is the first and only intranasal vaccine line in the U.S. that has been demonstrated to provide one year of protection against these three important canine infectious respiratory diseases. In the U.S., the company enhanced its medicated feed additives portfolio with an expanded claim for Lincomix ® (lincomycin hydrochloride), a popular feed medication. This new claim gives pork producers more flexibility when treating swine respiratory disease associated with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo), which can be devastating to herds.\nFINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nZoetis is providing full year 2018 guidance, which includes:\nRevenue between $5.675 billion to $5.800 billion Reported diluted EPS between $2.77 to $2.93 Adjusted diluted EPS between $2.96 to $3.10 Reported and adjusted effective tax rate between 21% to 22%\nThis guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of early February.

(b) Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. (c) Exclusive of amortization of intangible assets, except as discussed in footnote (d) below. (d) Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions.

Reconciliations of certain reported to adjusted information for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are provided in the materials accompanying this report. These adjusted income statement line item measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for the corresponding U.S. GAAP line items.

(b) Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses, and adjusted interest expense and other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. (c) We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted net income operational growth to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial measure because we are unable to calculate with reasonable certainty the foreign exchange impact of unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, potential future asset impairments and other certain significant items, without unreasonable effort. The foreign exchange impacts of these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. (d) Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to restructuring and other charges for the supply network strategy. Excludes potential net gains/losses on sales of assets.
