If it weren’t for their professional care, I wouldn’t be here today.”\nWilliams said her C-section wound popped open due to intense coughing endured as a result of the embolism.\nShe had surgery, where doctors found a large hematoma in her abdomen and returned to the operating room for a procedure that prevents clots from travelling to her lungs.\nShe went on to encourage people to donate to charities that help mothers and newborns around the world.\nWilliams, who has won an Open-era record 23 grand slam singles titles, returned to competition nine days ago when she represented the United States in a Fed Cup doubles match.\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T02:25:00.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
