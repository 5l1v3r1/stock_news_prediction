He now estimates an additional C$250 million ($197 million) hit to the company’s 2018 operating income.\nOntario, Canada’s most populous province, raised its minimum wage by 21 percent to C$14 an hour in January. Loblaw had previously said higher labor costs would reduce its 2018 operating income by C$190 million.\nThe Brampton-based company has ramped up its online presence in a highly competitive market and sold all of its gas stations to simplify its business.\nFor the fourth quarter, Loblaw posted a 1.2 percent drop in its retail sales business.\nTotal revenue slipped 0.9 percent to C$11.03 billion.\nNet profit attributable to common shareholders fell to C$19 million, or 5 Canadian cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, from C$201 million, or 50 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. The company recorded $230 million in charges in the quarter.\nExcluding items, the company earned C$1.13 per share that beat the average analyst estimate of C$1.11, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting by Akshara P in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T13:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T14:04:57.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
