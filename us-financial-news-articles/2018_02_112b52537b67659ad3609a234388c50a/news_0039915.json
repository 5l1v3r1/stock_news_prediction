Rights groups have labeled his administration as one of the world’s most corrupt.\nIf judges decide the international court has jurisdiction, then they would then move to hear Equatorial Guinea’s claim on its merits, a process likely to take more than a year.\nReporting by Stephanie van den Berg, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T04:33:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
