Trading in its shares has been suspended since January 19.\nSince late 2016, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has been tightening its approval process for private placements to clamp down on speculative acquisitions, money misuse and irrational share valuations.\nHNA-Caissa is one of many units of HNA Group, an aviation-to-financial services conglomerate which has been scrutinized over its ownership structure recently.\n$1 = 6.2820 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Min Zhang in BEIJING and Lee Chyen Yee in SINGAPORE; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:22:35.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
