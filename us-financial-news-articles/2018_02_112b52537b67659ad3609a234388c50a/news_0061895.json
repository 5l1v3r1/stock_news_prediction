He also praised Apple's ability to retain customers in its iPhone ecosystem. ( tinyurl.com/ycrfcfx6 )\nBerkshire Hathaway disclosed on Feb. 14 that it had increased its stake in Apple by 23 percent, making it the company’s largest common stock investment.\nAlso on Monday, Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported Apple was planning this year to launch its largest-ever iPhone, along with two other smartphones. ( bloom.bg/2HNO4wg )\nApple last year launched a 10th anniversary iPhone with premium features and a $1,000 price tag. But overall iPhone sales missed analysts’ expectations in the December quarter, and the global smartphone market is struggling to grow.\nNew York-based investment management firm Inverness Counsel’s money managers considered reducing clients’ exposure to Apple following its quarterly report on Feb. 1, but ultimately decided not to make changes, said Chief Investment Strategist Tim Ghriskey.\n“You still have a relatively inexpensive stock and an ecosystem that would be extremely hard to replicate,” Ghriskey said. “We concluded that Apple would come out with something and calm the market, and make investors look to the future.”\nSince its quarterly report, nine analysts have raised their price targets for Apple, while six have reduced their targets. The median price target for Apple’s stock has risen from $189.48 to $192.43, which is 7.5 percent higher than Monday’s price.
