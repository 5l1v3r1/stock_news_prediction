Democrats were furious after Trump declassified the Republican document but refused to make public their own memo seeking to debunk it.\nOn Friday, Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of House Intelligence, who commissioned the Republican memo, said it was “gratifying” to see the indictments, calling Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government “a pressing threat to American interests.”\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the panel’s top Democrat, called the indictments “a significant step forward.” He also said the indictment “leaves open the vital question of whether Americans, including any associated with the Trump campaign, knowingly played a role in Russia’s active measures campaign.” (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; editing by Grant McCool)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T00:04:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
