The changes had been due to come into force on Feb. 23, but are now delayed until Oct. 1.\nGiven that the European Parliament and member states don’t have enough time to legally change the start date before March, the delay will apply retroactively from Feb. 23, the ambassadors said.\nConsultants Deloitte say the reform, which revises an existing EU law, introduces conduct rules already in force in the banking and investment sectors, such as checking whether a product is suitable for a customer.\nIt also gives regulators a stronger set of sanctions, such as bans and fines, that go far beyond existing rules.\n“It is crucial that the European insurance industry has sufficient time to implement the required changes from the point at which regulatory certainty is established,” said William Vidonja, head of conduct of business at Insurance Europe, an industry body.
