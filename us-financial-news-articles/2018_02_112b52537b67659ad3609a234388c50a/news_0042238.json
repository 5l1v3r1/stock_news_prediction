At 1003 GMT the bank’s shares were up 1.6 percent.\nWith dividends up by a fifth to 3.05 pence, some analysts were optimistic that the UK’s largest mortgage lender would reward those investors who had kept faith with the bank’s earnings potential despite the regulatory hits.\n“There’s a lot to like in Lloyds’ numbers, with profits rising, costs under control, and prodigious amounts of cash being thrown off to shareholders,” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note.\nA man walks past a Lloyds Bank branch in central London, Britain February 25, 2016.
