But then the conversation turned to Trump and his pending conversation with special counsel Robert Mueller . TONIGHT: #LastWeekTonight ’s @iamjohnoliver encourages Trump to speak with Robert Mueller. Tune in for the whole interview tonight! #JohnOliver #LSSC pic.twitter.com/dtpgpgasGb \n— The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) February 8, 2018 \nOliver initially joked that he doesn’t doubt that Trump “wants to talk,” but he’d have to physically “get through his lawyers first,” as he “would perjure himself before he finished his name.” \nColbert, deciding to taunt Trump into complicity, suggested instead that Trump “would do a good job,” saying that he should speak to Mueller. Then Oliver, doubling down on Colbert’s approach, also looked directly into the camera, saying, “I know I joke around a lot, Mr. President, but I also think you would do an excellent job, and I too think you should do it.” \nOnly time will tell if their flattery works.
