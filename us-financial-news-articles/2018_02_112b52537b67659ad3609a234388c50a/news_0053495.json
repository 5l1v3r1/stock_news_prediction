Governor Mark Carney said there was no need to give a direct commitment on rates as markets - which have largely priced in a May rate hike - had broadly understood the BoE’s message.\nThus an unexpected downward revision to Britain’s fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday only resulted in a temporary bout of sterling weakness.\nAt one point just after 1100 GMT on Friday, the pound suddenly lurched downwards, to as low as $1.3904, but it quickly recovered and by 1600 GMT was trading up 0.1 percent on the day at $1.3971.\nSean Dakin, a dealer at Mizuho bank in London, said headlines around British Health Minister Jeremy Hunt saying Britain could not stay in the EU’s customs union after Brexit might have triggered algorithms to sell sterling, which is why the move had been so sudden and brief.\n“The market is definitely focusing on all these kinds of comments, but it bounced up pretty quickly, so you’d think it was probably algos,” said Dakin.\nAgainst the euro, sterling was up 0.4 percent at 87.98 pence.\n“The key takeaway from the Bank of England (this week) was that policymakers’ tolerance of inflation well above target has ended,” said City Index analyst Ken Odeluga.\n“Sterling uncertainty remains, not least given the relapse of the dollar as its recent revival threatens to fade. But as UK monetary policy catches up with a stronger-than-forecast economy, probabilities for a sustained sterling recovery are rising,” Odeluga added.\nOther data released this week showed wage growth steady in the last three-month period, but the jobless rate unexpectedly ticked higher. Again, the numbers had only a temporary and modestly negative effect on sterling.\nBoE officials are likely to have noted pay jumping 2.8 percent in December alone in the same labour market numbers, though that was still weaker than the 3.0 percent reading of British consumer price inflation for December.\nEditing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:09:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
