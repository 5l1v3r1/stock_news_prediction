HQ’s cofounders have been accused of inappropriate behavior during their time at Vine and Twitter, including behavior towards women that was described by former coworkers as “creepy.” An investigation by HQ investors Lightspeed Venture Partners concluded that the behavior wasn’t bad enough to justify the founders’ removal. \nAccording to Recode, though, their reputation has interfered with the company’s fundraising efforts, even as its live trivia product attracts huge audiences and, according to some observers, points towards the future of live entertainment. The recent destruction of investor value by the misbehavior of men like Steve Wynn and Travis Kalanick appears to have rapidly made investors much more attuned to such concerns. \nRevelations about the hostile environment Kalanick helped foster at Uber were major contributor’s to that company’s disastrous 2017, which gave a significant market share boost to competitor Lyft. HQ Trivia has competitors, such as The Q Trivia , that users could switch to with similar ease. \nWhether intentionally or by chance, the fact that Founders’ investment is being led by Banister, a woman, could dampen other investors’ concerns over its founders. The funding deal had not closed as of Thursday, according to Recode, so the fast-growing social backlash could actually have some influence on negotiations.
