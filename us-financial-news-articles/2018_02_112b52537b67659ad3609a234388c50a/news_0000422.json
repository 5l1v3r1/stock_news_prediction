President Donald Trump in October declared the problem a national public health emergency. \nInsys has found itself at the center of several lawsuits and investigations focused on Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients that contains fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. \nFederal prosecutors in Boston have accused seven former executives and managers at Insys including billionaire founder John Kapoor of participating in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys and to defraud insurers. \nProsecutors said that beginning in 2012, Kapoor, former Insys Chief Executive Michael Babich and others schemed to bribe medical practitioners by paying them to participate in sham speaker program events. \nKapoor, Babich and their co-defendants have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled to face trial in January 2019. \nInsys has said it is in settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department and has estimated the minimum amount it may have to pay is $150 million. \nThe company has said that it has taken steps to prevent past mistakes from happening again and has stressed that Subsys made up 0.02 percent of opioid prescriptions in 2016. \nInsys previously agreed to pay $9.45 million to resolve investigations by attorneys general in Oregon, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Illinois. It also faces lawsuits by attorneys general in North Carolina, Arizona, New Jersey and New Mexico.
