The central bank meets next Thursday.\n“There were a couple of things in there that suggested things were more optimistic,” said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel, in London. “He (talked about) focus shifting back to curbing inflation, which suggested that maybe they’re looking at a hike in 2018.”\nPatel said sterling had also been able to recover because of the absence of bad news this week.\n“Domestic political noise will act as a limiter for sterling, but it won’t actively weigh on it. Once that noise doesn’t escalate, or there’s no new catalyst, the natural tendency is for the pound to just revert some of those losses,” he said.\nA report that showed British manufacturing lost more momentum than expected last month, with activity falling to a seven-month low, took some shine off sterling but was not enough to knock it into negative territory.\nBy 1000 GMT the pound was trading up 0.4 percent up at $1.4244, having earlier reached $1.4275. Against the euro, it was up 0.1 percent at 87.36 pence.\nThe pound reached its highest levels on a trade-weighted basis since late June 2016 in the aftermath of the Brexit vote last week. It was just a half a percent off that high on Thursday.\nSince the EU referendum, sterling is still down around 9 percent on a trade-weighted basis, but it is up about 8 percent from a trough reached in October 2016.\n“With the currency having returned to more ‘normal’ levels recently, we foresee a slower pace of gains for the rest of 2018, mainly against the dollar, before the pound trade-weighted index trend appreciation re-accelerates in 2019,” Credit Agricole strategists wrote in a note to clients.
