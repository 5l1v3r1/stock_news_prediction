You never know if you’re going to play good again, never know if you’re going to lift a trophy again.\n“I thought about retirement ... I mentioned it about 10-12 times to my wife. We sat down and had many talks about it because physically I wasn’t ready to play.”\nThe 39-year-old said he had plenty of other business interests outside golf to keep him busy if he had retired.\nHalf of Watson’s career wins have come at Augusta National or Riviera, but his chances on Sunday looked tenuous after a mediocre front nine that included three bogeys.\nBut he steadied his leaky ship with a 10-foot birdie at the par-five 11th, and then took a two-shot lead when his 50-foot bunker shot at the 14th clattered against the pin and dropped in.\nWith nobody else making a charge on the difficult finishing stretch, Watson only had to avoid any mistakes coming in.\nDefending champion Dustin Johnson finished tied for 16th at four-under, a stroke better than four-times major winner Rory McIlroy.\nReporting by Andrew Both in Adelaide, South Australia; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T01:54:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
