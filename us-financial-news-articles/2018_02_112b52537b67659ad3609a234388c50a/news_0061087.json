Silva told reporters at the company’s headquarters in Sao José dos Campos that the talks with Boeing would not be affected by Brazil’s presidential campaign and October election, nor because an Army reserve general was named as the new defense minister this week. The military is leery of any Embraer deal with Boeing, given Embraer’s importance to the defense industry.
