Mr. Smallwood described these metrics as redundant and outdated. \nFacebook is taking steps to appease advertisers after acknowledging over the past year and a half several discrepancies or flaws in its data, which undermined marketers’ trust in the company’s data-reporting practices. In the wake of those errors, Facebook agreed to undergo audits by the media industry’s measurement watchdog, the Media Rating Council, a year ago. \nFacebook said the new metrics changes were spurred, in part, by the discovery that advertisers aren’t fully aware that some metrics are estimates or may be still be in the development phase. \nMr. Smallwood said the company’s decision to refine its labeling was also influenced by news reports last year that Facebook claimed to reach millions more users among specific age groups in the U.S. than actually reside in the country, according to official census data.\n“We always said it was estimated,” but “people didn’t know it,” he said. “We realize we need to do a better job and be super clear when things are estimated.” \nAd industry folks were also confused, Facebook found. \nFor example, a number of ad buyers and marketers thought the company’s reach data, which measures the number of unique individuals who saw an ad, was an actual count rather than an estimate, he said. It’s easy to count how many times an ad is viewed, but calculating the number of unique individuals exposed to the ad is complicated, he said. \nFacebook’s reach estimate is mainly to help marketers plan their ad campaigns and doesn’t affect how advertisers are billed by Facebook. \nFacebook recently quizzed advertisers and agencies that make up its measurement council on what metrics are estimated versus actual. When the reach metric came up, around half of the attendees were uncertain, said Ed Gaffney, director of implementation research at WPP ad buying network GroupM and a member of Facebook’s measurement council. \nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T01:51:03.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
