It is used to calculate a net score in stroke play and therefore allows players of different abilities to play against each other on more equal terms.\nOrganizers hope that the new system will encourage more people of varying backgrounds to take up the sport, particularly as there will be a limit of Net Double Bogey on the maximum hole score and a maximum handicap limit of 54.0, regardless of gender.\nPreviously, the USGA’s maximum limits, for example, were 36.4 for men and 40.4 for women.\n“For some time, we’ve heard golfers say, ‘I‘m not good enough to have a handicap,’ or ‘I don’t play enough to have a handicap.’ We want to make the right decisions now to encourage a more welcoming and social game,” Mike Davis, CEO of the USGA, said.\n“We’re excited to be taking another important step – along with modernizing golf’s Rules – to provide a pathway into the sport, making golf easier to understand and more approachable and enjoyable for everyone to play.”\nThe organizers’ statement added that all parties would now embark on a two-year transition period so that it would be ready to come into effect from 2020.\nReporting by Christian Radnedge; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T23:17:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
