Workers currently have rights to 24 hours a year.\nFrance currently spends over 30 billion euros ($37 billion) annually on professional training but the system’s vast complexity leaves many companies struggling to find skilled workers.\nThe government wants to reduce the number of intermediary bodies collecting and dispensing training funds that are currently jointly managed by unions and employers.\nRisking the anger of unions loath to cede any influence over how money is spent, Penicaud said the union and employers’ deal did not go far enough and she promised a “big bang” reform.\nMacron aims to bring unemployment down from 8.9 percent at the end of last year to 7.0 percent by the next election.\nPenicaud, a former head of human resources at Danone, said she would also outline plans in the coming days for unemployment insurance after unions and employers agreed suggestions on Thursday.\n“They gave in their conclusions yesterday, I’ll speak about it in several days. I’ll say what we’ll keep and also where we consider more needs to be done,” she told RTL radio.\nShe said the government wanted in particular measures to discourage the use of short-term labor contracts, a subject over which unions and employers have clashed for years.\nEmployers and unions agreed in particular that workers could get unemployment benefits when they voluntarily leave a job after seven years to pursue another career track.\nThe proposal had been one of Macron’s campaign pledges, although he had wanted the right to become available to workers every five to seven years.\nEmployers and unions currently jointly manage the unemployment benefits system and how much it pays out, and are reluctant to see the state play a bigger role even though it already guarantees the jobless insurance fund.\nReporting by Caroline Pailliez; writing by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:12:56.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
