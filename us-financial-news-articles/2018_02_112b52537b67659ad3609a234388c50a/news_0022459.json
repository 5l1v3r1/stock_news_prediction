Eurostar is majority-owned by French state rail operator SNCF. \nSince 1994 when Eurostar trains first connected London and Paris, travel between the two cities, including rail and air journeys, has doubled.

Eurostar said there were currently more than 4 million passengers travelling by air between the two cities annually. \n“As the Netherlands grows in popularity as a key business and tourism hub, the potential for the new service and the overall market is significant,” Eurostar said in a statement on Friday. \nAt two hours and 15 minutes, the London to Paris journey is much quicker than the London to Amsterdam route. Passengers travelling in one direction, from Amsterdam to London, will also have to disembark at Brussels for passport and security checks. \nBut by 2019 the return journey should become truly direct as Eurostar said that the British and Dutch governments would put in place an agreement to allow those checks to take place on departure in the Netherlands.
