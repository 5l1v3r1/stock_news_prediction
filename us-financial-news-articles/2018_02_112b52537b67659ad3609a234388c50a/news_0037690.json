Austria’s Mario Matt had been the previous oldest after winning slalom in Sochi four years ago at the age of 34.\nSvindal became the first Norwegian to win gold in the men’s downhill. The country had four silver medals in the event prior to Thursday’s race including Svindal’s silver from Vancouver in 2010.\nNorway have now won gold medals in each men’s Alpine event.\nSvindal becomes just the sixth man to have won multiple Olympic medals in the downhill race. All of them won two medals: Guy Perillat (France), Bernhard Russi (Switzerland) Franck Piccard (France), Lasse Kjus (Norway and Peter Muller (Switzerland).\nSvindal becomes the first man to win Olympic gold in both speed events -- downhill and super-G. Austrian woman Michaela Dorfmeister won both races in Turin in 2006.\nSvindal became the first man to win three major downhill titles -- he won the World Championships in 2007 and 2013 before these Games.
