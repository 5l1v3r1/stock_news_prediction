Fourth quarter income from operations was $440 million, or $1.98 per diluted share available to common stockholders, compared to $409 million, or $1.77 per diluted share available to common stockholders, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income for the full year of 2017 was $2.1 billion, or $9.22 per diluted share, compared to $1.2 billion, or $5.03 per diluted share available to common stockholders in 2016. For the full year 2017, income from operations was $1.8 billion, or $7.79 per diluted share, compared to $1.5 billion, or $6.50 per diluted share, available to common stockholders, for the full year of 2016.\nNet income for the current quarter and full year included non-recurring net favorable items of $417 million primarily related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n“Another strong quarter capped an exceptional year as we generated sales growth in every business, record operating EPS, a 13% increase in book value per share, and a 13% ROE,” said Dennis R. Glass, president and CEO of Lincoln Financial Group. “We are well positioned as we enter 2018 given our solid sales and earnings momentum and are very excited to execute on the significant opportunities and benefits of our recently announced acquisition of Liberty Mutual’s Group Benefits business.”\nAs of or For the\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31\nAs of or For the\nYear Ended\nDecember 31\n(in millions, except per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income (Loss) $ 816 $ 190 $ 2,079 $ 1,192 Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders 818 190 2,086 1,192 Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share Available to Common Stockholders 3.67 0.82 9.22 5.03 Revenues 3,669 3,254 14,257 13,330 Income (Loss) from Operations 440 409 1,754 1,540 Income (Loss) from Operations per Diluted Share Available to Common Stockholders 1.98 1.77 7.79 6.50 Average Diluted Shares 221.9 230.9 226.2 236.8 ROE, including AOCI (Net Income) 19.4% 4.9% 13.2% 7.8% ROE, excluding AOCI (Income from Operations) 12.8% 12.7% 13.1% 12.0% Book Value per Share, Including AOCI $ 79.43 $ 63.97 $ 79.43 $ 63.97 Book Value per Share, Excluding AOCI 64.62 57.05 64.62 57.05 Operating Highlights – Full Year 2017 versus Full Year 2016\nOperating EPS, up 20% Operating ROE, excluding AOCI, of 13.1%, up 110 basis points Variable annuity sales of $6.7 billion, up 8% Total Life Insurance sales of $798 million, up 8% Retirement Plan Services net flows of $1.3 billion, up 137% Group Protection sales of $504 million, up 7%\nThere were no notable items within income from operations for the current quarter while the full year included approximately $0.29 of net favorable items per share related primarily to tax adjustments, unrelated to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In the prior-year quarter, there were no notable items; however, full year 2016 included approximately $0.06 of net favorable items per share related primarily to tax adjustments, unrelated to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the company’s annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions.\nFourth Quarter 2017 – Segment Results\nAnnuities\nThe Annuities segment reported income from operations of $265 million, up 10% versus the prior-year quarter driven by growth in fee income from higher average account values.\nTotal annuity deposits of $2.8 billion were up 54% from the prior-year quarter, reflecting growth in all our major products. Variable annuity sales were up 53% versus the prior-year quarter driven by product and distribution expansion. Fixed annuity sales were up 57% versus the prior-year quarter, aided by our reinsurance agreement. Net outflows improved to $414 million compared to outflows of $932 million in the prior-year quarter. For the full year, variable annuity sales increased 8% while fixed annuity sales remained relatively flat.\nTotal average account values grew 9% to a record $135 billion as outflows were more than offset by favorable equity market performance.\nRetirement Plan Services\nRetirement Plan Services reported income from operations of $41 million, up 21% compared to the prior-year quarter. The increase in earnings is primarily due to growth in fee income driven by higher average account values and expense ratio improvement.\nTotal deposits for the quarter of $2.4 billion were up 1% while deposits for the full year increased 12% to a record $8.6 billion driven by a 29% increase in first-year sales and continued growth in recurring deposits.\nNet flows totaled $412 million in the quarter, up 7% compared to the prior-year quarter. Positive net flows in every quarter of 2017 resulted in $1.3 billion of annual net flows, more than double the prior year. When combined with favorable equity market performance, average account values for the quarter increased 15% to $66 billion.\nLife Insurance\nLife Insurance reported income from operations of $152 million versus $154 million in the prior-year quarter. Both periods included favorable mortality, while the prior-year quarter had more favorable variable investment income.\nTotal Life Insurance sales were $242 million, up 5% from the prior-year quarter driven by growth in Executive Benefits, VUL, and Term. For the full year, sales increased 8% versus the prior year as MoneyGuard®, VUL, and Term represented the largest percentage of sales.\nTotal Life Insurance in-force of $720 billion grew 4% over the prior-year quarter, and average account values of $48 billion increased 7% over the prior-year quarter.\nGroup Protection\nGroup Protection income from operations was $20 million in the quarter, up 25% versus the prior-year period. The increase in earnings was largely driven by improvement in the non-medical loss ratio. The total non-medical loss ratio improved to 67.1% in the current quarter from 70.9% in the prior-year period. For the full year, the total non-medical loss ratio improved 390 basis points to 66.9%, excluding the favorable impact of a reserve refinement in the prior year.\nGroup Protection sales of $265 million in the fourth quarter were consistent with the prior-year quarter. Full year sales of $504 million were up 7%, with growth across all product lines and in both employer and employee-paid sales. Employee-paid sales were 47% of the total in 2017.\nNon-medical earned premiums were $509 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from the prior-year quarter, driven by sales growth combined with improving persistency.\nOther Operations\nOther Operations reported a loss from operations of $38 million consistent with a loss of $37 million in the prior-year quarter.\nRealized Gains and Losses / Impacts to Net Income\nRealized gains/losses and impacts to net income (after-tax) in the quarter included:\nA $1.3 billion benefit from the impact on our net deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A $905 million impairment of intangibles related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and early adoption of GAAP accounting changes to goodwill. A $23 million net loss from general account investments compared to a $10 million net loss in the prior-year quarter. A $16 million variable annuity net derivative loss in the quarter compared to a $178 million net loss in the prior-year quarter where more than half was associated with non-performance risk.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses\nThe company reported a net unrealized gain of $7.8 billion, pre-tax, on its available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2017. This compares to a net unrealized gain of $4.7 billion at December 31, 2016, with the year-over-year increase primarily driven by tighter spreads.\nCapital\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 1.7 million shares of stock at a cost of $125 million. The quarter’s average diluted share count of 221.9 million was down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2016, the result of repurchasing 10.4 million shares of stock at a cost of $725 million since December 31, 2016.\nBook Value\nAs of December 31, 2017, book value per share, including accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), of $79.43 increased 24% from a year ago. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, of $64.62 increased 13% from the prior-year period.\nThe tables attached to this release define and reconcile the non-GAAP measures income from operations, operating return on equity (“ROE”) and book value per share, excluding AOCI to net income, ROE and book value per share, including AOCI calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThis press release may contain statements that are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially, especially given the current economic and capital market conditions.

Management also believes that using book value excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) enables investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations. Book value per share excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.\nFor the historical periods, reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure may be included in this Appendix to the press release and/or are included in the Statistical Reports for the corresponding periods contained in the Earnings section of the Investor Relations page on our website: www.lfg.com/investor .\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures Used in this Press Release\nIncome (loss) from operations, operating revenues and operating return on equity (including and excluding average goodwill within average equity), excluding AOCI, using annualized income (loss) from operations are financial measures we use to evaluate and assess our results. Income (loss) from operations, operating revenues and operating return on equity (“ROE”), as used in the earnings release, are non-GAAP financial measures and do not replace GAAP revenues, net income (loss) and ROE, the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nWe exclude the after-tax effects of the following items from GAAP net income (loss) to arrive at income (loss) from operations:\nRealized gains and losses associated with the following (\"excluded realized gain (loss)\"): Sale or disposal of securities; Impairments of securities; Change in the fair value of derivative investments, embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and our trading securities; Change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our guaranteed death benefit (\"GDB\") riders within our variable annuities, which is referred to as \"GDB derivatives results\"; Change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) riders within our variable annuities accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) (“embedded derivative reserves”), net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative reserves, the net of which is referred to as “GLB net derivative results”; Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (“indexed annuity forward-starting option”); Change in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services - Insurance - Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders (\"benefit ratio unlocking\"); Income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance; Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt; Losses from the impairment of intangible assets; Income (loss) from discontinued operations; Acquisition and integration costs related to mergers and acquisitions; and Income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards, regulations and policy changes including the net impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nOperating Revenues\nOperating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:\nExcluded realized gain (loss); Amortization of deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) arising from changes in GDB and GLB benefit ratio unlocking; Amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve charges on business sold through reinsurance; Revenue adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting standards.\nOperating Return on Equity\nReturn on equity measures how efficiently we generate profits from the resources provided by our net assets.\nIt is calculated by dividing annualized income (loss) from operations by average equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"). Management evaluates return on equity by both including and excluding average goodwill within average equity.\nDefinition of Notable Items\nIncome (loss) from operations, excluding notable items is a non-GAAP measure that excludes items which, in management’s view, do not reflect the company’s normal, ongoing operations.\nWe believe highlighting notable items included in income (loss) from operations enables investors to better understand the fundamental trends in its results of operations and financial condition.\nBook Value Per Share Excluding AOCI\nBook value per share excluding AOCI is calculated based upon a non-GAAP financial measure.\nIt is calculated by dividing (a) stockholders' equity excluding AOCI by (b) common shares outstanding. We provide book value per share excluding AOCI to enable investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations. Management believes book value per share excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nSpecial Note\nSales\nSales as reported consist of the following:\nMoneyGuard® – 15% of total expected premium deposits; Universal life (UL), indexed universal life (IUL), variable universal life (VUL) – first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received; Executive Benefits – single premium bank-owned UL and VUL, 15% of single premium deposits, and corporate-owned UL and VUL, first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premium received; Term – 100% of annualized first-year premiums; Annuities – deposits from new and existing customers; and Group Protection – annualized first-year premiums from new policies.\nLincoln National Corporation\nReconciliation of Net Income to Income from Operations\n(in millions, except per share data) For the Quarter Ended For the Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total Revenues $ 3,669 $ 3,254 $ 14,257 $ 13,330 Less: Excluded realized gain (loss) (106) (265) (336) (518) Amortization of DFEL on benefit ratio unlocking -\n(1) 3 1 Amortization of deferred gains arising from reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance\n-\n1\n1\n3\nTotal Operating Revenues $ 3,775 $ 3,519 $ 14,589 $ 13,844 Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders – Diluted\n$\n818\n$\n190\n$\n2,086\n$\n1,192\nLess: Adjustment for deferred units of LNC stock in our deferred compensation plans (1)\n2\n-\n7\n-\nNet Income (Loss) 816 190 2,079 1,192 Less (2) : Excluded realized gain (loss) (69) (172) (218) (337) Benefit ratio unlocking 28 (6) 129 28 Net impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 1,322 - 1,322 - Impairment of intangibles (905) - (905) - Income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance\n-\n-\n-\n2\nGain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt -\n(41) (3) (41) Income (Loss) from Operations $ 440 $ 409 $ 1,754 $ 1,540 Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share -- Diluted Net income (loss) $ 3.67 $ .82 $ 9.22 $ 5.03 Income (loss) from operations 1.98 1.77 7.79 6.50 Average Stockholders’ Equity Average equity, including average AOCI $ 16,818 $ 15,400 $ 15,796 $ 15,237 Average AOCI 3,044 2,471 2,454 2,427 Average equity, excluding AOCI 13,774 12,929 13,342 12,810 Average goodwill 1,820 2,273 2,160 2,273 Average equity, excluding AOCI and goodwill $ 11,954 $ 10,656 $ 11,182 $ 10,537 Return on Equity, Including AOCI Net income (loss) with average equity including goodwill\n19.4% 4.9% 13.2% 7.8% Return on Equity, Excluding AOCI Income (loss) from operations with average equity including goodwill\n12.8%\n12.7%\n13.1%\n12.0%\nIncome (loss) from operations with average equity excluding goodwill\n14.7%\n15.4%\n15.7%\n14.6%\n(1) The numerator used in the calculation of our diluted EPS is adjusted to remove the mark-to-market adjustment for deferred units of LNC stock in our deferred compensation plans if the effect of equity classification would result in a more dilutive EPS.
