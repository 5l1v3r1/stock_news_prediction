The couple, who plan to attend the march, declared their support for the group and its planned march, adding “our children’s lives depend on it.”\nSpielberg and Capshaw also said they would donate $500,000, reported Deadline. Film studio executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife Marilyn pledged a similar amount.\nMarch For Our Lives was born out of tragedy on Feb. 14, when Nikolas Cruz allegedly walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland and killed 17 people, including 14 students. The group has planned a march in Washington on March 24 and a national student walk-out .\nGeorge and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to ‘March For Our Lives.’ These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we’ve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard.\n— Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) February 20, 2018\nWinfrey tweeted support for the group along with her intention to donate a half a million dollars towards the cause. “George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more.
