The common currency has lost momentum since hitting a three-year high of $1.2556 on Feb. 16.\nThe euro could be subject to potential swings in price, analysts said, as Italians prepare to vote in a national election on Sunday, and the leading political parties in Germany decide on a coalition deal that could secure Angela Merkel a fourth term as chancellor.
