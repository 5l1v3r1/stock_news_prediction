The benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.3 percent, supported by shares of state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA on the heels of rising crude prices. Shares in electronics and appliance retailer Via Varejo SA rose 1.1 percent following solid fourth-quarter earnings figures. Fibria Celulose SA and Suzano Papel e Celulose SA also jumped after the wood pulp producers confirmed talks over \"alternative strategies.\" A newspaper had reported on Friday that the companies were discussing a potential merger. Insurance firm BB Seguridade SA, however, dropped 3 percent as the biggest decliner on the index after a large decline in fourth-quarter profit. In a conference call, management said raising profit will continue to be a challenge this year as interest rates reach their lowest level ever in the country. Other Latin American markets seesawed as many traders were away for the U.S. Presidents Day holiday. The Brazilian real was down 0.2 percent, while the Mexican peso was nearly unchanged.
