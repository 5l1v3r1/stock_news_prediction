Of course we very much hope it was some kind of mistake,” Russian curler Viktoria Moiseeva told reporters, adding that the team believed Krushelnitsky was innocent.\n“With us it’s not faster, higher, stronger; it’s about being more accurate. I can’t imagine what kind of drugs you could use in curling ... so it’s very hard to believe.”\nFLAG BAN\nCurling – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Mixed Doubles Bronze Medal Match - Olympic Athletes from Russia v Norway - Gangneung Curling Center - Gangneung, South Korea – February 13, 2018 - Alexander Krushelnitsky, an Olympic athlete from Russia, sweeps. Picture taken February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton Russia has been accused of running a state-backed, systematic doping program for years, an allegation Moscow denies. As a result, its athletes are competing at Pyeongchang as neutral “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (OAR).\nRussia’s curling federation told Reuters on Monday it had launched an internal investigation of the doping case.\n“The federation is now creating an emergency commission in which all information will be investigated and verified. We know that our athlete is not guilty,” federation president Dmitry Svishchev said.\nHe had earlier said that Russian curlers were tested on Jan. 22 before arriving in South Korea and the tests were negative.\nSlideshow (8 Images) Moiseeva said it would be dreadful if the case hurt Russia’s chances of regaining full Olympic status for future Games.\n“It’s a catastrophe, if it’s not just one Olympics but others too - it will throw sport in our country into turmoil. It’s awful just to think about, to be honest.”\nThe Russians had been hoping that a clean record at Pyeongchang would persuade the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow them to march at the closing ceremony on Feb. 25 with the Russian flag and in national uniform.\nThe IOC said on Monday that any doping violation would be decided by CAS and that a decision would come very quickly after analysis of a B sample.\nRelated Coverage Bemused curlers ask 'why would anyone dope in our sport?' If confirmed, the violation would be considered by the IOC’s OAR Implementation panel, the body in charge of monitoring the OAR team’s behavior at the Games.\n“REALLY SAD”\n“I hope it’s not true ... for the sport of curling,” said Norwegian skipper Thomas Ulsrud, whose team would stand to pick up the bronze if the doping result is confirmed.\n“If it’s true I feel really sad for the Norwegian team who worked really hard and ended up in fourth place and just left for Norway and they aren’t even here.”\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency banned meldonium with effect from January 2016, deeming it performance-enhancing because it enabled users to carry more oxygen to muscle tissue, something of benefit to endurance athletes in particular.\nFormer tennis world number one Maria Sharapova of Russia was barred from competition for 15 months after testing positive. In total, more than 170 athletes, including over 40 Russians, have tested positive for the drug since it was banned.\nAdditional reporting by Steve Keating in Gangneung, Karolos Grohmann in Pyeongchang and Andrew Osborn in Moscow; Editing by Mark Bendeich and Ed Osmond\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T03:21:15.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
