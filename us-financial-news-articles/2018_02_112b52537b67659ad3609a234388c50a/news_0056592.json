Unlike targeted therapies that attempt to regulate specific mutations within cancer, the Company’s therapeutic approach is designed to take advantage of a cancer cell’s innate metabolic weaknesses to compromise its defenses, leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. The Company’s lead clinical program, SM-88, is a novel combination therapy currently in Phase II development for prostate cancer, and the Company is preparing to initiate an additional Phase II clinical trial in pancreatic cancer.\nForward-Looking Statements/Disclosure Notice\nIn addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
