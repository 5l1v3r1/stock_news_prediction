Slideshow (4 Images) \nChan, who won silver in the team and men’s singles events at the 2014 Sochi Games, is a three-time world champion but Olympic gold has evaded him. \nOlympic Athlete from Russia Mikhail Kolyada, who won bronze at the European championships last month, fell on his opening jump, a quad Lutz, before tripling his quad toeloop, earning 173.57 points and finishing second in the long program. \nHis team is currently in second place. \nAdam Rippon of the United States was third, earning 172.98 points. The U.S. are currently third overall.
