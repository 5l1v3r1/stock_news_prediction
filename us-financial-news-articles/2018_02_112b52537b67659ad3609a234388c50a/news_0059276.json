So it's not like those are, what I would view as a common code, they really are separate organizations to some extent,\" Ives said. \"I think that is something, from a shareholder perspective, that could happen over the coming 12 to 18 months.\"\n\"The biggest worry for Amazon is regulatory pressure … that speaks to a separation of those two pieces.\"\nHe also believes Apple will be the first company to reach a $1 trillion market cap thanks to a more gradual replacement cycle: \"Right now you have 350 million iPhones that are up for an upgrade over the next 12 to 18 months. So this continues to be sort of a bullish theme that, even though iPhone 10 – we'd call it a 'B+' product cycle.\n\"Over the next three products that come out between now and September, we think Apple is going to get 240, 250 million iPhones that ultimately upgrade with an average selling price now that's trended toward $800.\"\nIves is chief strategy officer and head of technology research at GBH Insights, joining its executive team in October 2017.

It's trying to understand, within technology: whether it's big data, cyber, whether it's streaming,\" Ives added. \"Who are the second-, third-tier players? How does a Roku play? Is Snap or Twitter a turnaround story? Do you go with the crowd and bet against Cisco or do you go with them?\"\nHe also discusses:\n\"Content warfare\" between internet television and content providers.
