Diesel prices were 37 cents per gallon higher in September-December 2017 than a year ago. The average diesel fuel price per gallon for most of January was up 44 cents from last year. \nStructural labor shortages and higher fuel costs would drive truck rates up 5 to 6 percent in the next year, Howard said. \nFreight typically accounts for about 5 percent of costs of goods sold, or roughly 3 percent of sales on average for food manufacturing companies. \n“Looking across the entire food value chain, the margin headwind could be as high as 50-70 basis points for the entire industry,” Howard said. \nKisses chocolate maker Hershey reported a 1.8 percent fall in adjusted margins, partly hit by freight costs. Oreo-cookies maker Mondelez said margins in the quarter were flat compared with last year with cost of sales rising nearly 3 percent. \nThis comes despite prices of key ingredient Cocoa falling to a five-month low in December. \nJif Peanut butter maker J.M. Smucker and soup maker Campbell warned in November that freight and truck-related issues would hit margins. The companies are yet to report results for the last quarter of the year. \n“Demand for overall transportation is exceeding supply in marketplace and this makes a tough situation more difficult,” said Mark Pogharian, Hershey’s vice president for investor relations. \nHe added that shippers would have limited flexibility to move shipments based on truck availability and may cause overall market rates to increase further.
