As part of a major restructuring of the industrial giant, new Chief Executive John Flannery said in November that he would explore selling the stake before restrictions lift in 2019. \n“Given today’s valuation levels, we see a lot of upside there,” said Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller at a Barclays conference Wednesday. “At this point in time, we have no intent to change anything or execute prior to the expiration of any of the lockup periods.” \nShares of Baker Hughes jumped on the news, recently trading up 4.5% to $27.61. The company has a market value of about $30 billion. GE owns about two-thirds of the company. \nSince taking the reins as CEO in August, Flannery has cut the dividend and financial projections while pledging to shed at least $20 billion in assets. Flannery says he wants to simplify the company and is also considering bigger moves including separating the core divisions -- health care, aviation and power -- in what would amount to a breakup of the industrial giant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T19:56:57.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
