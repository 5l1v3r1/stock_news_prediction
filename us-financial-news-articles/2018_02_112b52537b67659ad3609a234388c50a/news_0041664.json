It was also the Sooners’ second consecutive loss at home after their previous 14 home games.\nThe win snapped a three-game losing streak for Texas (16-11, 6-8).\nMatt Coleman added 11 for the Longhorns and Mohamed Bamba had 18 rebounds as the Longhorns outrebounded the Sooners 43-31.\nChristian James was the only other Oklahoma player in double figures with 11 points.\nTexas led the entire way but its lead had dwindled to one after Young’s 3-pointer with just more than 13 minutes to play.\nYoung had missed his first four 3-point tries of the game and his last 20 dating back to the first half of the loss at Iowa State a week earlier.\nBut Texas seized the momentum after that, scoring 12 consecutive points over the next four-plus minutes to stretch its lead to 13.\nThe Sooners got within seven on a couple of occasions but couldn’t pull any closer.\nTexas shot 54.5 percent from the floor (30 of 55) and was even better in the second half, shooting 63 percent.\nOklahoma shot just 30.8 percent from the field and 26.7 percent from behind the 3-point line, making just 4 of 15 from behind the arc in the second half.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:10:44.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
