He did not explain why he made the payment or say whether Trump was aware of it.\nThe White House referred questions about the payment to Cohen.\nCohen’s statement was in response to a complaint filed at the Federal Election Commission by the Common Cause watchdog group.\nCommon Cause argued in its complaint that the payment amounts to a campaign contribution well in excess of the $2,700 limit to the amount any individual can give, and it has asked the FEC to enforce campaign finance laws.\n“The complaint alleges that I somehow violated campaign finance laws by facilitating an excess, in-kind contribution. The allegations in the complaint are factually unsupported and without legal merit, and my counsel has submitted a response to the FEC,” Cohen said.\n“Just because something isn’t true doesn’t mean that it can’t cause you harm or damage. I will always protect Mr. Trump,” Cohen said, adding that he would not comment further.\nCommon Cause said on Wednesday that the timing and circumstances of the payment “make it appear that the hush money was paid to Daniels in an effort to influence the election.” It called on the FEC to conduct a full investigation.\nThe FEC confirmed it received Common Cause’s complaint and declined to comment on the case.\nDaniels’ manager, Gina Rodriguez, told Reuters that by issuing the statement, Cohen was in violation of a non-disclosure agreement with Daniels about the matter and that Daniels believes she can now talk about it publicly.\n“Yes, Stormy is going to talk,” she said via direct message on Twitter. She did not immediately respond to a question about when and where Daniels would be speaking publicly.\nReporting by Steve Holland and Ginger Gibson in Washington, and Nichola Groom in Los Angeles; editing by Kieran Murray\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T01:24:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
