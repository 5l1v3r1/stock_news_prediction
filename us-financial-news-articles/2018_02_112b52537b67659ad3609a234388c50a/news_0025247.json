The wedding service itself will be conducted by Dean of Windsor, David Conner.\nSlideshow (5 Images) The wedding is likely to attract huge attention around the world, as did the marriage of Harry’s elder brother William to Kate Middleton in 2011, which was watched by an estimated two billion people.\nKensington palace said Harry and Markle would join guests at a reception inside Windsor Castle after the procession. Harry’s father, Prince Charles, would later host an evening reception for close friends and family.\nMarkle, who is a divorcee, met Harry in July 2016 after they were introduced through a mutual friend, with both knowing little about the other. After just two dates, the couple decided to go on holiday together to Botswana.\nReporting by William James; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T02:11:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
