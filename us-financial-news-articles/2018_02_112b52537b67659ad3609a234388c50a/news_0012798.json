The statutory and summary prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company, and it may be obtained by calling 1-888-898-2780. Read it carefully before investing.\nMutual fund investing involves risk; Principal loss is possible. Investments in debt securities typically decrease when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Derivatives involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. The Fund may make short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested. ETF and ETN investments involve additional risks such as the market price trading at a discount to its net asset value, an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact a fund's ability to sell its shares. The Fund may invest in Asset-Backed and Mortgage-Backed securities. Investments in Asset-Backed and Mortgage-Backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. The Fund is non-diversified meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings and is exposed to more individual stock volatility than a diversified fund.\nCrossingBridge Advisors is the Advisor to the CrossingBridge Long/Short Credit Fund which is distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.\nCONTACT: Alyson Gardner, 1-914-741-9600, agardner@cohanzick.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crossingbridge-advisors-acquires-the-collins-longshort-credit-fund-300594651.html\nSOURCE CrossingBridge Advisors, LLC", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crossingbridge-advisors-acquires-the-collins-longshort-credit-fund-300594651.html", "http://www.crossingbridgefunds.com/"], "published": "2018-02-07T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T18:53:57.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
