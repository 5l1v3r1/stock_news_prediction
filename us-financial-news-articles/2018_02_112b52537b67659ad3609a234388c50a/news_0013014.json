(NASDAQ: CVO) (the \"Company\"), a diversified manufacturer of print-related products including envelopes, custom labels, commercial print, and publisher solutions, today announced that it has reached an agreement with holders of a majority of its first lien debt to support a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, which will significantly increase its financial flexibility by reducing its debt and obtaining new financing, strengthening the Company and its best-in-class products and services. To facilitate the financial restructuring, Cenveo and its domestic subsidiaries have filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of New York, White Plains. The Chapter 11 filing does not include foreign entities, such as those located in India.\nIn conjunction with the filing, Cenveo has entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA) with noteholders representing more than 50% of its first lien debt. The RSA demonstrates the strong support of the Company's creditors for the financial restructuring and their confidence in management and the future of Cenveo, and provides a clear path to emergence on an expedited basis.\nThe Company has also negotiated agreements with certain of its existing lenders to provide Cenveo up to $290 million of debtor-in-possession financing (\"DIP\"), which includes $190 million of ABL financing and $100 million of Term Loan financing. In total, the debtor-in-possession financing will allow Cenveo to access up to $100 million in incremental liquidity during the Chapter 11 case. This incremental liquidity will ensure that suppliers and other business partners will be paid in a timely manner for goods and services provided during the Chapter 11 process, in accordance with customary terms.\n\"The plan we are pursuing today will significantly reduce our debt and improve our capital structure to support our long-term business strategy,\" said Robert G. Burton, Sr., Cenveo's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Since 2005, we have transformed Cenveo from its print-focused roots into the largest envelope manufacturer and one of the largest labels manufacturers in North America. This court-supervised restructuring process will protect our business operations, as we will continue to operate in the ordinary course. We are pleased that our plan has the backing of a number of our key financial stakeholders, and we are confident that Cenveo will emerge from this process with a stronger balance sheet to support its profitable growth in the years ahead.\"\nMr. Burton continued, \"Our foremost priority is providing seamless, high-quality service to our customers across multiple market segments, and that standard of excellence will remain unchanged throughout this process. This financial restructuring will significantly reduce the amount of debt on the balance sheet, increase cash flow available to invest in the business, and create a stronger and more competitive company in the future.\"\n\"In previous times of challenge, we have proven our ability to adapt and transform our Company with a business solution that is value maximizing. Our work on this debt recapitalization will be no different,\" Mr. Burton concluded.\nThe Company has made customary filings, including first day motions, which will facilitate the normal course of business operations during the financial restructuring process. These include, among other things, requesting authority to pay pre-filing wages, salaries, and benefits; honor customer commitments; and pay certain pre-petition vendors and suppliers. In addition, the plan provides the Company with sufficient liquidity to continue operating as usual with customers and vendors.\nAdditional information on the restructuring can be found at www.cenveo.com/restructuring or by calling the Company's toll-free Restructuring Information Line at (844) 219-2678 (or, if you are calling from outside the U.S. or Canada, at +1 (646) 813-2946).

It is possible the Company's outstanding securities may be cancelled and extinguished upon confirmation of a restructuring plan by the Bankruptcy Court. In such an event, the Company's stockholders and other security holders would not be entitled to receive or retain any cash, securities or other property on account of their cancelled securities. Trading prices for the Company's common stock and other securities may bear little or no relation to actual recovery, if any, by holders thereof in the Company's Chapter 11 cases. Accordingly, the Company urges extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in its securities.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements.
