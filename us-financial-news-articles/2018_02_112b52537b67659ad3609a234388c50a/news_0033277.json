It will present its final proposal for the next long-term budget for a seven year period from 2021 to 2027 in early May.\n“It (the budget) is ... vital at a time when Europe is in the midst of a fundamental debate on how the Union should evolve in the years to come,” the Commission said in a statement.\n“We now have an opportunity to choose the Europe we want and to decide on a budget that helps us build it,” it said.
