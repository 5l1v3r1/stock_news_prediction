UNDER FIRE \nOf 16 Syrian refugees HRW spoke to, 13 alleged that Turkish border guards had shot towards them or other fleeing asylum seekers as they tried to cross while still in Syria, killing 10 people, including one child, and injuring several more. \nTurkey has taken in more Syrian refugees than any other country, granting many temporary protection status and providing them with basic services, including medical care and education. \n“However, Turkey’s generous hosting of large numbers of Syrians does not absolve it of its responsibility to help those seeking protection at its borders,” the HRW statement added. \nIt said Erdogan’s government should issue standard instructions to border guards at all crossing points that lethal force must not be used against asylum seekers and that no asylum seeker is to be mistreated.
