It touched its lowest in more than six months on Monday. \n* “We’re seeing a positive reversal in the capesize dry bulk market today driven by a flurry of activity in the Pacific markets as a coal restock in China begins to take shape,” said analysts at shipbroker Clarksons Platou Securities. \n* “With the Chinese New Year around the corner, domestic coal production is expected to decline, increasing reliance on imports to alleviate thermal supply shortages.” \n* Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as iron ore and coal, were up $795 at $11,984. \n* Chinese iron ore futures edged higher alongside steel prices on Tuesday, with most steel producers done with replenishing stocks ahead of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. \n* The panamax index fell for the seventh session and was down 23 points, or 1.72 percent, at 1,316 points. \n* Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which usually carry coal or grain cargoes of about 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes, declined $183 to $10,555. \n* Among smaller vessels, the supramax index shed 8 points to 857 points, and the handysize index lost 5 points to 538 points.
