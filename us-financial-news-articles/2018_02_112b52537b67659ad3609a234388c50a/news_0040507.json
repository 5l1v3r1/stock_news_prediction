The clandestine purchase of advertising on the site through fake personas was particularly alarming, she said.\nTo know the identities of ad buyers, internet companies might need to duplicate the \"know your customer\" practices of banks and regularly share information with authorities, Ravel said.\nFacebook has said it will start requiring thorough documentation from election-related advertisers to verify their identity and location, beginning with U.S. elections this year.\nHow extensive that vetting will be is unclear. \"If you want to put up a theme page for a group, in the ordinary course you wouldn't expect that a vendor like Facebook would require that sort of vetting,\" said Dan Petalas, a former U.S. federal prosecutor.\n\"The indictment really details an elaborate scheme that would be difficult to identify,\" he said.\nFacebook said on Friday it was making \"significant investments\" to guard against future attacks and was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to deter election interference.\nThe Russians' alleged campaign began with three weeks of reconnaissance in 2014, when two of them traveled to nine U.S. states, including Colorado and Michigan, according to the indictment. They were equipped with cameras, SIM cards, drop phones and, if needed, \"evacuation scenarios,\" the indictment says.\nIt describes the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg as an organized bureaucracy. It was backed by an annual budget of millions of dollars, employed hundreds of people and boasted several departments dedicated to specific projects, like search-engine optimization and graphics.\nEven those who have demanded Facebook do more acknowledged on Friday it could do only so much.\n\"We each bear some responsibility for exercising good judgment and a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to the things we read and share on social media,\" Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.\nThe defendants are accused of stealing social security numbers of Americans to open up fraudulent accounts on digital payment system PayPal Holdings Inc. They purchased space on computer servers located within the United States to use virtual private networks to mask their identities and pose as Americans.\nFacebook could go further in monitoring its platform and adopt the process cryptocurrency firms use to verify bitcoin traders, said Jordan Lieberman, president of ad firm Audience Partners. But if Facebook raises the bar much higher, \"It's going to interrupt revenue flows and it's absolutely going to cost them money.\"\n(Reporting by David Ingram in San Francisco and Dustin Volz in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T07:04:24.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
