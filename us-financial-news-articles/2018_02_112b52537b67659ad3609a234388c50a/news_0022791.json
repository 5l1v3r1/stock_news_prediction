Because Waymo now owns a stake in Uber, the two companies are, ironically, brought closer after their yearlong legal battle. (Alphabet also owns a stake in Uber through its venture capital arm, GV .)\n\"We are committed to working with Uber to make sure that each company develops its own technology,\" a Waymo spokesperson said. \"This includes an agreement to ensure that any Waymo confidential information is not being incorporated in Uber Advanced Technologies Group hardware and software.\"\nThe case started in February 2017 when Waymo accused Uber of using at least eight Waymo trade secrets in its self-driving cars. Waymo said that when Uber acquired the start-up Otto, founded by star Google engineer Anthony Levandowski, in late 2016, Levandowski brought some 14,000 Google files with him, some of which contained Waymo trade secrets. Uber rebutted that its self-driving sensor designs were unique and that Levandowski's actions were unrelated to his work at Uber.\nIn the end, Uber's settlement with Waymo doesn't require it to pay out a particularly large sum of money or change its self-driving car plans, but the year-long litigation still brought to light many unflattering details about the company's business practices and its former CEO, Travis Kalanick. Waymo's legal team has tried to paint Uber and Kalanick as desperate to catch up to its self-driving car efforts \" at all costs .\"\nKalanick said in a statement that no trade secrets came to Uber, and that \"it is clear Uber would have prevailed,\" if the trial had continued.\n\"I remain proud of the critically important contributions Uber ATG has made to the company's future,\" Kalanick said.\nMeanwhile, the proceedings also highlighted correspondence from within Alphabet that showed that the company was fretful about losing its lead in the driverless car space as it bled talent and faced new competition. Uber's legal team tried to position Waymo's lawsuit against it as an act of vindictiveness.\nUltimately, the settlement gives both sides a bit of what they wanted, while neither Waymo or Uber is likely completely satisfied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:58:50.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
