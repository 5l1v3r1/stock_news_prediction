Retired colonel William Endley, 55, had been providing advice to former-vice-president-turned-rebel-leader Riek Machar, whose forces have been fighting a civil war since 2013. Sentencing him to hang, Judge Lado Eriminio Sekwat said Endley had 15 days to appeal. Endley was convicted of conspiracy, supplying weapons, espionage, waging an insurgency, sabotage, terrorism and illegal entry into South Sudan. Defence lawyer Gardit Abel Gar called the verdict a miscarriage of justice and said Endley, who plans to appeal, was a political prisoner who should have been freed under a December ceasefire agreement. During the trial, Endley attempted to call six witnesses in his defence but none showed up to testify.

Endley was on trial alongside a former spokesman for Machar who was handed the death sentence earlier this month for incitement and conspiracy against President Salva Kiir’s government. South Sudan won independence from Sudan in 2011 and descended into civil war in 2013, months after Kiir fired Machar as his deputy. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and a third of the population have fled their homes. Machar fled to Democratic Republic of Congo after fierce fighting broke out in Juba in July 2016 and is now in South Africa under virtual house arrest.
