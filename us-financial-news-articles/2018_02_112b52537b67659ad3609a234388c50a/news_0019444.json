If passengers are stranded again tomorrow, we already have a tool that works well,” de Smet said, adding that buying tickets with credit cards also offered protection. \nRepatriating more than 100,000 Monarch passengers is estimated to have cost the British government about 60 million pounds ($83 million). The German government loan that kept Air Berlin flying for two months was for 150 million euros ($184 million). \nThat loan was due to be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of Air Berlin’s operations. However, after Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) pulled out of a deal to buy its Niki unit, that money seems unlikely to be repaid in full, which has led to criticism of the government’s decision to award the loan from opposition politicians. \n($1 = 0.7235 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:23:48.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
