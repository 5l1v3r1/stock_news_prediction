Baldwin will undergo surgery and will be out of action for about five months, ruling him out for the rest of the season. The 29-year-old joined a lengthy list of Wales players sidelined by injury as they prepare to face Scotland in Cardiff on Saturday. Baldwin, who was not included in the match-day 23 to face Scotland, will be replaced in the Welsh squad by Ryan Elias. \nBaldwin was bitten on the hand by a lion on a visit to an animal sanctuary while on tour with the Ospreys in South Africa last year.
