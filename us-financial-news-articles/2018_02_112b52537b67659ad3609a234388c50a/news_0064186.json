A+ offering.”\nThe net proceeds of this offering will be used primarily to launch a blockchain-enabled open science collaboration platform that will unlock up to $4 trillion of orphaned and dormant intellectual property. Collaborating scientists will be rewarded Helix™, “The Currency of Science™” tokens resulting from the ICO for conducting research on the Knowbella Tech platform.\nUtilizing Reg. A+, Knowbella Tech plans to make its Helix tokens available to anyone interested in participating in the venture, not just accredited investors. Typically, in the USA, only accredited investors qualify to invest in early stage companies. Knowbella Tech intends to provide non-accredited investors the opportunity to participate.\n\"Reg. A+ allows us to advertise and reach out to everyone who may have an interest in our scientific platform and business,\" Pohlkamp said. \"It is similar to a pre-sale or perk crowdfunding campaign offered on platforms like Kickstarter® or Indiegogo®, but also allows us to offer participants equity in our Company in the form of Helix tokens, similar to cryptocurrencies.\"\nReg. A+ allows issuers to raise up to US$50 million in a 12-month period. Investors are not required to be accredited, but must receive an offering circular that has been qualified by the SEC.\nKnowbella has engaged Keating Muething & Klekamp PLL as its legal advisors for the offering.\nKnowbella plans to “test the waters” to gauge market demand for its proposed Reg. A+ offering prior to qualification of its offering statement by the SEC. No money or other consideration is being solicited, and if sent in response to any solicitation, it will not be accepted. No offer to buy the securities can be accepted and no part of the purchase price can be received until an offering statement on SEC Form 1-A is qualified, and any such offer may be withdrawn or revoked, without obligation or commitment of any kind, at any time before notice of its acceptance is given after the qualification date. Any person's indication of interest involves no obligation or commitment of any kind.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements. The use of any of the words \"anticipate\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", \"should\", \"believe\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. These statements speak only as of the date of this press release. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to various risk factors, which will be discussed in the Company's Offering Statement, which will be filed, with the SEC on www.sec.gov . While the Company may elect to, it does not undertake to update this information at any particular time.\nAbout Knowbella Tech LLC\nIts mission is crowdsourcing the global scientific community around orphan and dormant intellectual properties to advance science and generate a public good. The freely available Knowbella Platform that will result from a successful Initial Coin Offering (ICO) will enable scientists to collaborate around advancing technologies. Scientists will be rewarded for their conduct of science within the Platform with Helix™, “The Currency of Science™.”\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228005859/en/\nKnowbella Tech LLC\nMark Pohlkamp, CEO, +1-513-260-4400\nMark@Knowbella.Tech\nhttps://Knowbella.Tech\nTwitter: @Knowbella\nSource: Knowbella Tech LLC", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228005859/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51765981&newsitemid=20180228005859&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=1&md5=5db4ced7fe521c4fa705368b2144e9b4", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2FKnowbella.Tech&esheet=51765981&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2FKnowbella.Tech&index=2&md5=799a4ecd3a72ff70192d90e4c0c8481c"], "published": "2018-02-28T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T21:22:33.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
