Supply chains are often complex as a product is manufactured, packaged and distributed in a process linking multiple suppliers in many countries, making it difficult to spot forced labour.\nAbout 25 million people worldwide were estimated to be trapped in forced labour in 2016, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) and rights group Walk Free Foundation.\n“Primark joins the select but growing group of leading companies that disclose details of their supplier factories,” said Peter McAllister of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI).\n“It is one more step in meeting consumer expectations and we hope that other brands and retailers will follow this example,” said the executive director of the ETI, a global alliance of trade unions, firms and charities promoting worker rights.\nPrimark had previously withheld the factory breakdown, saying it gave the high-street chain a commercial edge.\nBut the company said it had decided to divulge the details as most of its suppliers were also contracted by rival companies, many of which had already made the details public.\nFollowing accusations it used “sweatshops” and “modern-day slaves” to produce clothes sold for just a few pounds, Primark says it has ramped up efforts to tackle the risk of forced labour, with worker hotlines and a rise in audits.\nThe retailer keeps down costs by spending very little on advertising and buying materials in bulk, Stewart said.\n\"We want to challenge the wrongly held perception that price and ethics are entwined,\" she said.
