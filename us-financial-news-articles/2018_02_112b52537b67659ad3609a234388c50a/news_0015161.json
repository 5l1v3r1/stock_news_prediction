NO SAFETY NET \nDombret also gave a blunt warning to banks about relying on a transition period to delay hard decisions on licences and staff moves to new EU hubs. \nEven if the EU and Britain agree on a transition deal by March to bridge Brexit and new trading terms, it may not give the legal certainty that cross-border banks crave, Dombret said. \nThe sector would still have to wait until October to see if there is agreement on future trading relations as well. \n“The transition phase is not a safety net,” Dombret said. \nIt might be better to focus on making licensing procedures as smooth as possible given that a “no deal” on future financial services trade is a realistic outcome, he said. \nEuropean regulators are looking at more than 100 financial firms operating from Britain that potentially need a new or modified EU licence, he said. \nThe European Central Bank’s banking supervisor said on Wednesday that eight banks have taken formal steps to apply for a licence, with four others planning to extend operations in the euro area. \n“Those who do not complete their plans and start implementing them by March this year risk being left high and dry by Brexit one year later,” Dombret said, adding the advice also applies to European banks with branches in Britain yet to make licence applications to the Bank of England. \nThe BoE proposed in December that EU banks in Britain continue operating as branches without a costly conversion into subsidiaries if there is similar cooperation with EU regulators after Brexit. \nDombret said such an approach, reciprocated already by the ECB’s pragmatic policy stances on licensing, can be an important contribution towards a smooth transition.
