Speaking with CNBC's \"Street Signs\" on Thursday, he explained how conducting criminal activity in cyberspace has gotten easier. \nCybercrime is the only criminal enterprise that has \"a help desk,\" he said, adding that would-be criminals \"don't need to be technologically advanced\" anymore to conduct a cyberattack. \nThe analysis comes as McAfee and American think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies releases a study entitled \"The Economic Impact of Cybercrime—No Slowing Down,\" which assesses the gravity of what Yip called a cybercrime \"pandemic.\" \n\"When you look at the cost of cybercrime in relation to the worldwide internet economy — $4.2 trillion in 2016 — cybercrime can be viewed as a 14 percent tax on growth,\" McAfee said about the study . \nCertain nation states have come to be regarded as safe havens for cybercriminals, Yip said, adding that countries such as North Korea , Iran and Russia \"tend to go after financial services,\" while \"espionage activities\" are more rampant in China . \nThe report comes at a time when cryptocurrency hacks have been in the spotlight. A headline-grabbing example is the recent hack of Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, where almost 58 billion yen of NEM coins were stolen. That wasn't the first of its kind, but it was certainly one of the biggest thefts to have occurred. In response, cryptocurrency users and investors have voiced concerns about the need for higher standards and broad regulatory systems to safeguard their interests. \nThe Asia Pacific region alone, Yip said, has lost $171 billion to cybercrime.
