To continue growing against strong competition and to capitalise on a large market opportunity, Zhaopin will continue its aggressive reinvestment focus,” CEO Andrew Bassat said in a statement.\nFor the full year, Seek said it expected growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 14 percent to 15 percent, up from about 13 percent previously, and said it is on track to achieve full-year revenue growth in the range of 20 percent and 25 percent.\n$1 = 1.2645 Australian dollars Reporting by Sumeet Gaikwad in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:53:15.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
