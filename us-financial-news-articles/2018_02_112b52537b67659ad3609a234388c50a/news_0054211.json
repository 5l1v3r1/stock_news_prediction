U.S. private-equity firms J.C. Flowers & Co. and Cerberus Capital Management LP plan to buy to buy German lender HSH Nordbank for $1.2 billion, the WSJ’s Costas Paris reports. The bank has been racing to find a buyer or face liquidation after suffering massive losses on shipping loans during the steep trade downturn . The two German states that own HSH had been looking at a sale for around $245 million, but improved results and a substantial reduction in bad shipping loans have made the struggling lender more attractive. Its remaining shipping holdings also are looking more attractive as trade figures pick up around the world and improved earnings push more carriers to bulk up their fleets. Analysts at Alphaliner say “a flurry of orders” to start the year will bolster a shipbuilding pipeline that had hit historic lows in recent months.\nOne of China’s most fashionable online apparel sellers is heading in a surprising direction : Toward physical stores. Retailer Inman has turned away from the online-only by opening some 450 brick-and-mortar outlets, feeding a growing trend in which China’s e-commerce companies are building up offline locations as accessories to their online presence. The WSJ’s Li Yuan reports Inman and other web-based companies are responding to growing online competition, including heavy e-commerce efforts by big Western brands, and that stores help them stand out. Smartphone seller Xiaomi Corp. has opened more than 300 stores since its online-only sales slumped in 2015, and has seen sales recover. Inman says its online experience provides insights on consumer trends that help the company manage its supply chain better than purely brick-and-mortar competitors. The new stores, in turn, help Inman streamline inventories by providing ongoing information on how customers are responding to products on sales floors.\nTesla Inc.’s sedan supply chain may be moving into a higher gear. The Silicon Valley auto maker is notifying some reservation holders new to the electric-car brand that they can begin ordering their Model 3 sedan, the WSJ’s Tim Higgins reports, suggesting production of the vehicle at Tesla’s assembly plant is speeding up after a turbulent start last year. Tesla has received about 500,000 reservations for the Model 3 since revealing the sedan in 2016, but the move into the mass-market business has been rocky. It delivered about 1,600 of the vehicles during the final three months of 2017—well below its goal of building 5,000 on a weekly basis, or 250,000 on an annual basis. New reports show the company is advancing its road tests of the Tesla Semi heavy-duty truck, the vehicle expected to start production for the commercial truck market in 2019.\nTRANSPORTATION Greece’s Thessaloniki Port. Photo: Bloomberg News Maersk Line is bracing for higher costs stemming from new environmental rules on bunker fuel. A. P. Moeller-Maersk A/S Chief Financial Officer Jakob Stausholm tells the WSJ’s Nina Trentmann the requirement to limit the sulfur content of bunker fuel by 2020 will have a big impact on a business that spent $3.3 billion last year on bunker fuel, and that Maersk is considering passing the higher costs on to customers. New International Maritime Organization rules require ships to use fuel with a sulfur content of less than 0.5% by 2020, down from the current level of 3.5%. Analysts at Jefferies LLC say the fuel is about 50% more expensive than the current cost of bunker. The low-sulfur demand along with changing prices in other energy sectors have carriers looking at alternatives including liquefied natural gas, which is cleaner than bunker. Maersk officials told Shipping Watch separately they are looking at LNG as a potential alternative to bunker.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ The question is not whether a fashion brand needs to be both online and offline.
