The long overdue correction is taking place amidst growth in earnings, reduction in crude oil (prices) and stable domestic yields,” said Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer at Sanctum Wealth Management.\nImprovement in earnings alongside price correction creates attractive buying opportunities, particularly in the consumer and industrial sectors, Sharma added.\nThe broader NSE index was down 1.6 percent at 10,410.50 as of 0549 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 1.5 percent lower at 33,893.08. In early trade, all the constituent stocks were in the red.\nThe partially convertible rupee dropped to 64.38/39 per dollar, compared with its previous close of 64.2550. The benchmark 10-year bond yield was down 1 basis point at 7.46 percent.\nFinancials such as ICICI Bank Ltd and Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd were the biggest drag on both the indexes, shedding over 2 percent each.\nGlenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd dropped as much as 9.6 percent to its lowest in over three years after the pharma company posted disappointing quarterly results on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, Tata Steel Ltd recovered from early falls to climb as much as 2 percent ahead of its December-quarter results.
