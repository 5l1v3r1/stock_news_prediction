The company has also previously denied reports that McGrath had an undisclosed personal gambling debt.\nA company spokeswoman declined to comment further on either allegation on Thursday.\n$1 = 1.2633 Australian dollars Reporting by Byron Kaye in Sydney Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; Editing by Eric Meijer and Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T01:46:25.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
