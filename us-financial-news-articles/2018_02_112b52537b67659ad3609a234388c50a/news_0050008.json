The ratio indicates the demand for a Treasury offering relative to the number of investor bids.\nThis week’s issuance of $258 billion is the second-largest amount ever over a three-day period, and is $1 billion short of the all-time high set in August 2010.\nThe federal debt load is expected to swell by as much as $1.5 trillion because of the U.S. tax overhaul signed into law in December, while the budget agreement would increase government spending by almost $300 billion over the next two years.\nIndirect bidders took 27 percent of the offer, their smallest takedown since January 2017, according to Simons. Direct bidders took a record high of 14 percent and 58.9 percent was taken by dealers, well above the average rate.\nThe Treasury will also auction $35 billion of five-year notes later on Wednesday at 1:00 p.m. (1800 GMT).\nExpectations the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates as many as four times in 2018 had helped propel the two-year Treasury yield to a nine-year high of 2.282 percent in overnight trading.
