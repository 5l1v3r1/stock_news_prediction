That happens, it’s slalom.”\nAlpine Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's Slalom - Yongpyong Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 22, 2018 - Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway reacts. REUTERS/Dominic Ebenbichler Kristoffersen, who won a giant slalom silver behind Hirscher in Pyeongchang and a slalom bronze as a teenager in Sochi four years ago, said he had been suffering from a cold for a few days but that his vomiting before the race was quite normal.\n“I was a little bit late coming out of that first hairpin and then the next one had a bigger groove than what I expected. Boots hit the wall in the snow there,” he added.\nAlpine Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's Slalom - Yongpyong Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 22, 2018 - Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway competes.

But that’s life, it happens.”\nThat Swede Andre Myhrer took gold at the age of 35 was encouragement to Kristoffersen, who reckoned he had “two or three” more Olympic Games in him to secure the precious gold medal.\nAs for how he would pick himself after defeat, the irrepressible Norwegian -- who has plenty of practice losing slalom races to Hirscher -- said that job was already done.\n“I‘m already up, I‘m not down in the snow anymore,” he grinned.\nEditing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T10:21:13.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
