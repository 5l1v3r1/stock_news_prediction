This is not a decision we made lightly, however, we believe he has exhibited a pattern of behavior in his videos that makes his channel not only unsuitable for advertisers, but also potentially damaging to the broader creator community.\"\nUp until this year Paul was one of YouTube's favorite stars, with more than 10 million subscribers. But YouTube has also spent the last year fending off a series of controversies about inappropriate content on the site, and is trying to convince marketers that the site is a safe place for them to run their ads.\nIf you want to watch Paul tasering a rat, you can see it near the five-minute mark of this clip, published February 5.\nIt's worth noting that another one of Paul's actions that bothered YouTube executives didn't happen on YouTube. Instead, they're upset that he joked about the Tide Pod challenge to his Twitter followers, via a now-deleted tweet. \nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content sharing arrangement. NBCUniversal is also a minority investor in Buzzfeed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:47:33.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
