Shares in Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA (SQM) , which has attracted investor interest due to increasing demand for lithium from electric car makers, fell almost 8 percent, leading losses on the index after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut their rating on the stock to \"underweight\" from \"equal-weight.\" Shares in Sociedad de Inversiones Oro Blanco SA, an investment vehicle with an indirect stake in SQM, followed as the second-biggest loser, its shares falling almost 5 percent. In the Morgan Stanley note, analysts wrote that they expect prices for lithium to peak in 2018, before falling 45 percent by 2021, as demand growth falls far short of what is needed to absorb growing supply. Stocks in Chile's forestry sector also fell. Shares in forestry firm Empresas CMPC SA and Empresas Copec SA , which operates in forestry through subsidiary Arauco, both slid between 2 and 3 percent, due to what traders described as profit taking in the sector. Overall, the IPSA had fallen 1.15 percent in afternoon trade. Elsewhere in Latin America, Mexico's IPC equities index also fell on Monday, as companies reported generally unimpressive earnings figures, while December retail sales fell 0.5 percent from the previous month. \"The Q4 corporate earnings reports weren't a positive catalyst for the stock market,\" Santander analysts wrote in a note. Traders were also cautious as the seventh round of North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations open in Mexico City, amid continued tough talk from U.S. President Donald Trump and little hope of a breakthrough among negotiators. The IPC had fallen 0.54 percent in morning trade.
