Through such agreements, insurers look to cut its exposure to the liabilities it has created by underwriting. \nPeel Hunt said the agreement provides AICL with further capital relief and downside protection. \n“This new program is a positive and shows that the underwriting quality within the insurance business remains high, albeit moving to 80 percent risk transfer gives the reinsurance panel more say in the underwriting strategy,” Peel Hunt, which rates Saga at “buy”, said. \nSaga, which restructured its travel business after its tour operations were hit by the collapse of Monarch Airlines, said trading continued to be in line with the guidance given in December, when it cut its profit forecast.
