Analysts on average had expected 4 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\"The results delivered in 2017 provide significant momentum as we enter 2018 and deliver growing value for shareholders,\" Chief Executive David Stover said in a statement.\nIf oil prices stay at or above $50 per barrel, Noble said it could generate $1.5 billion in extra cash flow in total through 2020.\nA rise in global crude prices, led by OPEC cuts, has prompted oil and gas companies to ramp up production. U.S. crude prices averaged $55.30 per barrel in the last quarter of 2017, up 12.2 percent from a year earlier.\nNoble's total operating expenses nearly halved to $740 million in the quarter, as exploration costs sank 90 percent.\nTotal sales volumes from U.S. onshore rose 40.5 percent to 104,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and prices realized per barrel rose by $7.14.\nNoble's total revenue surged 19 percent to $1.2 billion.\nShares jumped 7 percent to $28.15 in morning trading as oil prices fell.\nOn Monday, Noble, along with its operating partner Delek Drilling signed a 10-year agreement to sell $15 billion worth of Israeli natural gas to Egyptian company Dolphinus Holdings.\nLast month, Noble sold a 7.5 percent stake in the Tamar natural gas field offshore Israel to Tamar Petroleum Ltd for about $800 million in cash and shares, to comply with government plans to open the market to competition.
