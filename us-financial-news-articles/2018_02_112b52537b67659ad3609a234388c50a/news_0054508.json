NIBC reported profit of 213 million euros for 2017, with an underlying return on equity of 8.9 percent.\nPlans to sell NIBC to Iceland’s Kraupthing for 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) in 2008 were derailed by the country’s financial crisis, and NIBC booked heavy losses on its investments in U.S. subprime mortgage loans, with JC Flowers eventually injecting 400 million euros of equity into the bank.\nBut as the Dutch economy emerged from seven years of zero growth in 2014, NIBC’s restructuring began to bear fruit and the bank began exploring strategic options in August last year.\nNIBC CEO Paulus de Wilt said at Feb. 8 earnings the company continued to weigh strategic options, with an IPO possible but “dependent on market circumstances.”\nMichele Negen, a spokeswoman for NIBC, said she did not have anything to add to Wilt’s comment that IPO preparations “are progressing very well.”\nMorgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and JC Flowers declined to comment. Citi, ING and ABN Amro could not immediately be reached for comment.\nReporting by Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt, Dasha Afanasieva in London and Toby Sterling in Amsterdam.
