Countries across the Americas have condemned Mr. Maduro’s plans to hold the vote, with the U.S. signaling the prospect of expanded sanctions if it takes place.\n“We repudiate Henri Falcon’s unilateral inscription” as a candidate, Democratic Unity, the coalition, said in a statement. “We cannot recognize a fraudulent electoral process.”\nPresident Nicolás Maduro registering his candidacy on Tuesday for the April 22 vote, which the opposition and foreign countries have said won’t occur on a level playing field. Photo: Miguel Gutierrez/Zuma Press The playing field is vastly tilted in Mr. Maduro’s favor. The most popular opposition politicians are jailed, in exile or otherwise barred from running. The electoral board is under the president’s control, and Venezuela doesn’t permit international monitoring of elections.\nMr. Falcon, 56 years old, launched his campaign late Tuesday, casting himself as an outsider seeking to lift the country after 19 years of Socialist Party mismanagement and economic ruin. As governor of Lara, he broke with then-President Hugo Chávez over the fiery leader’s efforts in 2010 to expropriate facilities belonging to the Polar food conglomerate, with which Mr. Falcon had good relations.\n“He’s a traitor,” Mr. Chávez said at the time. “I knew it, maybe like Christ knew that Judas was the traitor.”\nMr. Falcon has since emerged as a critic of both sides of Venezuela’s fraught political divide. He rejects U.S. sanctions as well as the antigovernment street demonstrations many in the opposition have advocated to pressure Mr. Maduro. But he has also condemned the president, whom he calls “the candidate of hunger,” for rigging the electoral system in his favor.\n“I speak in the name of the millions of Venezuelans whom this government promised a paradise and instead gave a hell,” Mr. Falcon said.\nJosé Luis Pirela, an opposition congressman, said Mr. Maduro believes having Mr. Falcon as a rival will bestow the legitimacy his government has lost.\n“The government wants a sparring partner,” he said. “The government believes that finding a competitor, anyone, would help give it international recognition.”\nMr. Falcon has urged a postponement of the vote and posed other conditions, but hasn’t said what he might do if Mr. Maduro doesn’t deliver.\nThere are four other candidates, including a retired leftist general and an evangelical pastor. None of them has the national presence of Mr. Falcon, who advised the 2013 presidential campaign of opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who narrowly lost to Mr. Maduro.\nPolls show Mr. Maduro’s approval rating to be below 30%, with most Venezuelans blaming him for hyperinflation, rampant crime and food shortages. Those factors are expected to increase the number of Venezuelans who have left for neighboring Colombia from 700,000 now to 1 million by July, according to Colombian government estimates.\n—Juan Forero contributed to this article.\nWrite to Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T21:11:13.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
