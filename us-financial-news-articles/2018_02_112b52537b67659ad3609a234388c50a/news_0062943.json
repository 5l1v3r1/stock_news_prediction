Neither the Xinjiang government nor China’s Ministry of Public Security responded to requests for comment.\nA similar design of predictive security software is also being rolled out in other regions of China but surveillance is more intrusive in Xinjiang and there are fewer protections for suspects due to government concerns about unrest, she said.\nWaves of violence have rocked Xinjiang in recent years, largely fueled by tensions between the Han majority and the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home.\nWang said that, while it was unclear whether the system explicitly targeted Uighurs, forms to gather information for the program asked about religious practice and overseas travel.\nOfficial reports about the program say it has helped police catch criminals guilty of petty theft and illegal financial dealings, as well as to find Uighur officials who are disloyal to the ruling Communist Party.\nThe “Integrated Joint Operations Platform” pushes lists of people of interest to the police for investigation by crunching data from CCTV cameras, ID card checks and WiFi connections of phones and computers, as well as health, banking and legal records.\nThese lists are meant to be acted upon by measures including face-to-face visits within a day, according to state media reports. The exact algorithm for weighting the various factors was unclear.\nReporting by Christian Shepherd; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T06:50:29.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
