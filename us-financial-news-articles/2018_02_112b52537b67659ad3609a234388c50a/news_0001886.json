Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net IS THIS JUST A TASTER? (1438 GMT) Things are getting increasingly ugly out there and our screens are flashing in a most non-ambiguous red that the New Year rally is no more. So, is this a healthy pullback, a minor correction, a technical sell-off, or the beginning of the end? According to Unicredit analysts, this could just be a taster of what's to come later. \"This period has been a taster of what might occur when investors anticipate a substantial normalization rather than a minor sell-off,\" they say in a note, where they \"recognize that the vulnerability of equity markets has increased, with interest rates trending higher and the USD remaining weak.\" They take the view however that \"global synchronised growth\" and corporate earnings should keep the engine going. \"Nevertheless, it should be clear that the period of historically low volatility is drawing to a close and that equity investors will have to deal with more-volatile trends in the coming months,\" they warn. (Julien Ponthus) U.S. PAYROLLS: BIG NUMBER, AND EUROPEAN STOCKS COME OFF LOWS (1350 GMT) U.S. annual wage growth saw its biggest annual gain since 2009, a strong number which boosted expectations of higher inflation. Non-farm payrolls rose by 200,000 last month. U.S. futures extended losses and the dollar jumped on heightened expectations of three Fed rate hikes this year. The weaker euro helped ease some pressure on European equities. Look at the export-oriented German index DAX: it was down 1.1 percent, having earlier fallen as much as 1.65 percent. (Kit Rees) CALLING THE BITCOIN BUBBLE BURST (1233 GMT) With Bitcoin just crashing below 8,000 dollars, it's probably not a surprise that a number of analysts feel it's now safe to make a call. \"The continuing drop in cryptocurrency prices can probably now be classified as a bursting of that particular bubble,\" said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Wealth Management about five hours ago. Consensus goes that the crash won't have any macro or systemic impact but then again it could very well add to the gloominess building up on equity markets. As Donovan noted, an otherwise confident American consumer could feel somewhat less upbeat this morning ahead of the U.S. payroll data. \"There is no reason for the U.S. consumer to be concerned at the moment about the state of things, unless of course that consumer has been so foolish as to gamble on Bitcoin,\" Donovan said. (Julien Ponthus) \"NO-ONE WANTS TO PUT THEIR NECK OUT THERE ON A SELL SIGNAL\" (1219 GMT) It was a shy kind of a sell signal: BAML's note stopped short of being outright bearish, examining several potential scenarios including the S&P 500 rising above 3,000, and even suggesting extraordinary market circumstances may make sentiment signals irrelevant. As a trader puts it: \"I don't see how they can say 'sell signal' when they've been banging on about it not hitting 8 for months, and then not go through with it... Sums up how NO ONE wants to put their neck out there on a sell signal.\" BAML cross-asset strategists have taken some extra precautions in reaction to the signal. \"Cautious\" on the near term, they've rolled over their S&P 500 \"fragility hedge\". \"We felt that risk reward had deteriorated and that the market could not sustain the pace of gains. While the modest falls of the last week have started to see some of those overbought indicators diminish, equity markets remain stretched on most measures we look at,\" they note. Yet they're still \"constructive\" on the longer-term outlook for stocks. Global growth likely to come in at 4 percent or more should drive earnings to grow by double digits for the year (see chart). Responding to clients' pushback to their more cautious stance, they say: \"We do not disagree with the solid fundamentals... It is just when many seem to agree and are quoting our own arguments back at us, we get a bit nervous.\" The BAML cross-asset team's favourite trades in European equities: - Long European dividend yield stocks - Long European pharma (valuations at lowest since 2011) They're also long U.S. banks against the S&P 500, betting on deregulation boosting returns. (Helen Reid) EYES ON LEVERAGE AS BOND YIELDS RISE (1059 GMT) Even if rising yields do suggest that growth expectations are increasing, and therefore could lift equities, there are also implications for investors using leverage, says David Jane, manager of Miton's multi-asset fund range. \"Higher yields also means higher funding costs for leveraged investors and a higher opportunity cost for investors in risk assets versus the risk-free return,\" says Miton's Jane. \"While the economic outlook is highly positive and equity valuations remain reasonable against a strong period for profit growth, the risk remains that the overblown leveraged trades need to be unwound as interest rates rise worldwide,\" Jane adds. (Kit Rees) A TIMELY \"SELL\" SIGNAL (1045 GMT) In terms of timing, Bank of America Merrill-Lynch's \"Bull & Bear\" indicator comes at a time where it definitely won't be overlooked. The fact that it hit a \"Sell\" signal while European markets are deep into a fifth consecutive day in the red is food for thought. \"What is for sure is that this indicator comes at a moment where investors are asking themselves where the market is heading,\" said Pierre Martin, a senior sales trader at Saxo Bank. Martin argues that the fast-rising upward trend since the beginning of the year leaves some space for some technical correction but that at the same time, there is no reason to give up on the \"global synchronised growth\" investment case. (Julien Ponthus) DECLINE OF THE DAX (0939 GMT) One of the most impressive reversals in 2018 so far has been Germany's DAX, which started out the year as a leader among European stock markets, fuelled to a fresh record high by the cyclicals-led rally, only to reverse violently, dropping more than 5 percent in just eight sessions. It's now in the red year-to-date. The euro's relentless rise must be partly to blame for the outsize decline in the exporter-heavy index, but rising bond yields are also a pressure for the DAX's big defensive stocks in healthcare and utilities. (Helen Reid) SPANISH BANKS' RESULTS \"A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING\" (0847 GMT) It's a hefty day for European banking results, and the falls in the share prices confirm the view from Jefferies analysts that earnings from Spanish lenders Sabadell and Caixabank are somewhat underwhelming. \"4Q numbers decidedly mixed for both (-ve one-offs at CABK, weaker core trends at SAB), but the guidance towards a brighter outlook may offer partial support,\" Jefferies analysts say. Spanish banks did have a strong year in 2017 so some share price weakness was perhaps to be expected. (Kit Rees) OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES DIP AS BANKING RESULTS WEIGH (0811 GMT) It looks like day five of straight losses for European shares, with the STOXX 600 index sliding further in early dealing. Aside from oil & gas, all other sectors are in negative territory, with the disappointing results from Deutsche Bank sending its shares 5 percent lower, while Spain's Caixabank and Sabadell are also among the biggest fallers among banks following earnings. We could see some volatility ahead of U.S. payroll data. Here's your opening snapshot: (Kit Rees) WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0745 GMT) European shares are set to open flat to slightly lower at the end of a week where rising bond yields and strength in the euro have pushed the STOXX 600 benchmark down around 1.7 percent. That is already the biggest one-week loss since early November when a slowdown in earnings growth and similar bond market jitters weighed. Futures were trading between flat and a fall of 0.2 percent. Tech stocks will be in focus after U.S. internet giants released their earning updates yesterday with a record profit at Amazon possibly boosting shares in companies like Zalando, while shares in semiconductor companies like AMS, Dialog Semi, and IQE are expected to open lower after Apple issued a light guidance and reported it sold fewer iPhones over the holiday quarter than Wall Street had expected. There is a raft of results in Europe too that will keep investors busy. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for the STOXX 600 are expected to increase by 11.9 percent year on year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed. Deutsche Bank shares are indicated down 4 percent after the German lender reported a bigger than expected net loss for 2017, which could test a strong rally in banking stocks seen so far this year which was fuelled by expectations over tighter monetary policy and strong economic growth.

The STOXX 600 is down around 1.8 percent so far this week, set for its biggest weekly loss since November Here's your snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) DEUTSCHE BANK POSTS BIGGER THAN EXPECTED LOSS (0643 GMT) Banks, recently buoyed by rising bond yields and optimism about economic growth, could be in focus today after the DAX-listed heavyweight lender disappointed analyst expectations with a 2017 loss of 497 million euros in 2017.
