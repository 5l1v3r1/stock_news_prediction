By contrast, 130,000 EU citizens left Britain -- the biggest outflow since the year to December 2008, during the financial crisis.\nThe number of EU citizens moving to Britain for work dropped to the lowest in more than four years -- chiming with data on Wednesday that showed the number of EU workers in Britain rising in 2017 at the slowest annual rate since mid-2013.\nThe ONS said the rise in non-EU net migration mostly reflected more people coming to Britain to study. The increase was flattered by an unusual dip in the same period a year ago.\nMay has been urged to exclude students from migration statistics. Critics say the government has exaggerated the risk that students stay in Britain after their visas expire.\nReporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by Sarah Young and Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:09:58.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
