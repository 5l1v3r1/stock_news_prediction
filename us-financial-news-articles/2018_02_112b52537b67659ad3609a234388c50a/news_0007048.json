It was just very, very scary but once I did it, I went back up and did another one,” he said. \n”Absolutely it’s a medal-winning jump. \n“If I get into the top six, there’s no way I‘m not doing that skill. I haven’t come all this way to just back down at the last minute.” Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T12:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T12:36:07.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
