I don’t want to be rude -- you are all great -- but I didn’t really expect that I would be sitting here. I should have already had, like, three runs on snowboard now.”\nAsked why she was still wearing her ski goggles at a news conference, she explained: “Because I was not as prepared as the other girls that I would be at the (victory) ceremony, and I don’t have no make-up.”\nThough she won the 2017 world championship in parallel giant slalom snowboard, Ledecka was until now seen only as a second-tier skier. The very fact of becoming the first person to compete in both disciplines at an Olympic Games seemed remarkable enough.\nWith all the pre-race super-G favorites starting in positions 1-20, Austrian Anna Veith took a seat in the leader’s chair at the foot of the course after her run and was taking phone calls as she prepared to celebrate her second successive Olympic win in the event.\nThen Ledecka, drawn 26th, began her run -- unspectacular at first but gathering pace and drawing a roaring crescendo from the crowd as she ripped up the lower half of the course to usurp the shell-shocked Veith.\nThe Czech looked stunned at the finish, and told reporters later that it had not felt like an especially brilliant run, saying: “I thought I was doing a lot of mistakes.”\nLedecka now faces a quandary over whether to stick to her original plan and concentrate on the snowboarding, or think about going in the women’s downhill Alpine ski race on Wednesday.\n“Maybe my skiing coach will be a little bit pushy after today.”\nEditing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T15:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:11:10.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
