We need to be open and we need to ask for a lot of reforms,” said Belgium’s Didier Reynders.\nRegional disputes also hamper the accession process, with Serbia - and some EU member states - refusing to recognize the independence of Kosovo, and Macedonia still locked in a name dispute with its southern neighbor Greece.\nSpain, where a standoff between the central government in Madrid and Catalan separatists has intensified in recent months, is among five EU states that do not recognize Kosovo.\nMacedonian Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov said he hoped recent diplomatic efforts would soon lead to a compromise over his country’s name with Greece, which has been blocking Skopje’s EU bid. Greece says using the name ‘Macedonia’ implies a territorial claim on a northern Greek province of the same name.\n“We are doing everything we can so that there be a political decision in June,” Dimitrov said, hoping the EU would agree to start membership negotiations then.\nHis Albanian colleague, Ditmir Bushati, said the region needed EU development money, not only advice on strengthening democracy.\n“Rule of law comes first but there is no rule of law without economic development,” he said.\nWriting by Gabriela Baczynska Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T13:35:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
