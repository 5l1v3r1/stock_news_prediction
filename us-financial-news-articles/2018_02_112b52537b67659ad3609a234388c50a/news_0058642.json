(NYSE: SAR) (\"Saratoga Investment\" or \"the Company\"), a business development company, today announced that its Board of Directors has declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share for the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2018, payable on March 26, 2018, to all stockholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2018.\nThis increase is the fourteenth sequential increase to the Company's quarterly dividends. The Company has continued to pay quarterly dividends regularly throughout fiscal year 2018, including $0.47 per share for the quarter ended May 31, 2017, $0.48 per share for the quarter ended August 31, 2017, $0.49 per share for the quarter ended November 30, 2017 and now $0.50 per share for the quarter ended February 28, 2018. These steady increases follow total dividends of $1.98 per share for the previous fiscal period ending February 28, 2017, representing four quarters' dividends and one special dividend.\n\"Our relentless focus on growing our high quality asset base has enabled us to consistently increase quarterly dividends for over three years â€“ a time during which many of our competitors left their dividends unchanged or even significantly cut their dividend payments,\" said Christian L. Oberbeck, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Saratoga Investment. \"Our investment approach draws on the strengths of our high quality management team utilizing our ample liquidity and employing fundamental, disciplined credit analysis on opportunities generated from an investment pipeline that continues to be robust, despite increased market competition.\"\nStrong financial performance has enabled Saratoga Investment to increase regular quarterly dividends each quarter for the past fourteen quarters from $0.18 per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to $0.50 per share for this fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Actual dividends paid in fiscal year 2017 were $0.43 per share for the quarter ended May 31, 2016, $0.44 per share for the quarter ended August 31, 2016, $0.45 per share for the quarter ended November 30, 2016 and $0.46 per share for the quarter ended February 28, 2017. In addition, Saratoga Investment paid a special dividend of $0.20 per share on September 5, 2016.\nShareholders will have the option to receive payment of the dividend in cash, or receive shares of common stock pursuant to the Company's dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\"). Saratoga Investment shareholders who hold their shares with a broker must affirmatively instruct their brokers prior to the record date if they prefer to receive this dividend and future dividends in common stock. The number of shares of common stock to be delivered shall be determined by dividing the total dollar amount by 95% of the average of the market prices per share at the close of trading on the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding (and including) the payment date.\nAbout Saratoga Investment Corp.\nSaratoga Investment Corp. is a specialty finance company that provides customized financing solutions to U.S. middle-market businesses.
