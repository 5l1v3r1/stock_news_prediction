The funds, which also invest in fixed income products, disclose asset allocations on a quarterly basis.\nHit by global market volatility and a slew of domestic factors such as margin calls and a deepening crackdown on shadow banking, China’s blue-chip index CSI300 tumbled 12 percent in a 10-session rout that started Jan. 29.\nThe five state-backed mutual funds, which also include ChinaAMC New Economy Flexible Fund, China Southern Consumer Vitality Flexible Fund and CMF FengQing Flexible Allocation Fund, were launched during the 2015 stock market crash to help stabilize the Chinese market.\nThe funds, which manage roughly 250 billion yuan ($39.1 billion) in total on behalf of the government, had been slashing their equity holdings since mid-2017.\nTheir boost in equity holdings during the recent market slump shows the funds still play a important role in stabilizing the market, the Shanghai Securities News said.\nIn another sign of government support to the market during the recent turmoil, an affiliate of China’s securities regulator on Feb. 12 encouraged major shareholders of domestically-listed firms to increase their holdings.
