Slideshow (2 Images) \nIn late January, Reuters reported that three months before he granted Fujimori the pardon, Kuczynski met the former leader’s son, lawmaker Kenji Fujimori, to discuss his release. \nAt the meeting, Kenji Fujimori offered Kuczynski political support in Congress in return for the pardon. \nSimons added that any disagreement over the pardon should be resolved by Peru’s justice system and he alleged that the IACHR was being used as a “shortcut.” \nIf the court’s resolution, expected in the next few weeks, revokes the pardon, Peru’s government is obligated to accept it. \n“We hope Fujimori goes back to prison to serve his sentence,” said Carmen Amaro, sister of Armando Amaro, who was killed in a 1992 massacre during Fujimori’s rule that was cited in his conviction. \n“This isn’t hatred or revenge,” she said. “It’s justice.” Reporting by Enrique Andres Pretel; Writing by David Alire Garcia", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T05:53:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
