The condition of the wounded church-goers was not immediately clear.\nIndonesia is an officially secular country and has the world’s largest population of Muslims, as well as sizeable minorities of Christians, Hindus, and those who adhere to traditional faiths.\nCommunal and religious tensions have been on the rise in recent years as calls by hardline groups for sharia, or Islamic law, to be implemented nationally grow louder.\nIndonesia has also seen a resurgence in homegrown radicalism, inspired in part by the militant Islamic State group.\nReporting by Agustinus Beo Da Costa; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T08:21:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
