State-run outlets had earlier said that all were expected to be released on Wednesday.\nThe move is one of a series of reforms that the government has undertaken after violence broke out three years ago, sparked by an urban development plan for the capital, Addis Ababa, that critics said would trigger land grabs in the Oromiya region.\nUnrest subsequently spread throughout that province, with demonstrations taking place over political marginalization and human rights abuses.\nThousands of prisoners have been freed since January, having been accused of involvement in the mass protests. On Tuesday, authorities released Bekele Gerba, secretary general of the opposition group Oromo Federalist Congress, who was arrested in December 2015.\n“It is clear that there need to be plenty of changes. Atrocities were committed and those have to be addressed,” Bekele told Reuters. “People have to gain confidence in the government.”\nRights groups say hundreds died in the violence of 2015 and 2016, casting a shadow over a country with one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies.\nThe government in Addis Ababa is often accused of using security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent, as well as suppressing non-governmental organizations and the media, which the government denies.\n“The authorities must also take steps to reform the legal system under which arbitrary detentions and torture of dissidents have been allowed to flourish,” said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International’s deputy director for the region.\nReporting by Aaron Maasho, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:46:03.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
