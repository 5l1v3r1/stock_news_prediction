Further out, Europe needed to invest in infrastructure, notably charging stations, to support electric vehicles.\nFILE PHOTO - New cars are seen in a carpark near Barcelona, Spain, January 18, 2017.

Changes for this level of integration will most likely have an adverse impact on manufacturers.”\nProblems could include restricted access to EU or UK markets, which could mean parts stuck in containers at ports, and the possibility of diverging regulation.\nTavares said the auto industry believed the transition period after Britain leaves the EU should be three years, longer than the 21 months until the end of 2020 that the EU has proposed.\n“It is a struggle for our industry to make investment decisions when we don’t know what is just around the corner,” he said. “What we know today is everyone is holding on.”\nACEA forecasts that German and French car sales growth will be muted and that the British car market will decline by 4-5 percent, following a 5.7 percent fall in 2017.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Alissa de Carbonnel and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:59:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
