Others, such as ActionAid, Plan International and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) published their data only last week ahead of a government deadline.\nThe ICRC said 23 staff members had left since 2015 over sexual misconduct, while ActionAid said it had recorded 22 such cases in the last five years with six resulting in dismissals.\nChildren’s aid charity Plan recorded six cases of sex abuse and child exploitation by staff and associates between July 2016 and June 2017, with action taken in all cases. A further nine incidents of sexual misconduct led to seven dismissals.\nThe International Rescue Committee said it would provide figures on Tuesday. Islamic Relief said it would publish its figures in its annual report in September. Action Against Hunger said it was urgently gathering the data.\nCompassion International, Catholic Relief Services and Caritas Internationalis said they had received no reports of serious violations.\nFUNDAMENTAL FAILURE Mordaunt said charities had failed in their fundamental duty to prioritize the people they were supposed to help.\n“We have a real opportunity now to do something lasting and to ... send a message to predatory individuals that the aid sector is not a safe haven for them,” Mordaunt told the conference organized by Bond, an umbrella group of international development organizations.\nShe said charities were complicit in the abuse by protecting those responsible, not tackling the problem or turning a blind eye as predatory individuals moved to other organizations.\nShe suggested the situation might have been exacerbated by fundraising pressures, which meant charities feared that reporting wrongdoing would hurt their work.\nBritain has said it would deny cash to aid agencies that did not come clean on abuse, with Mordaunt saying other nations were keen to follow Britain’s example by linking funding to conduct.\nMordaunt said she was committed to a government commitment to spend the equivalent of 0.7 percent of economic output on foreign aid that makes Britain one of the world’s most generous donors, saying it was a moral duty but also benefited Britain.\nThe minister said the U.N. global development goals, which pledge to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, were at the heart of Britain’s international development vision and she would soon present a new plan focused on delivering the U.N. goals.\n“It will require me to stop funding organizations that do not deliver our objectives, contribute to the (U.N.) goals, or live up to our standards ... it will put our beneficiaries first,” she added.\nReporting by Emma Batha, Additional Reporting by Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Robert Carmichael and Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, which covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.
