Nasdaq's announcement to suspend trading of XIV does not change the dates related to the Event Acceleration of XIV other than with regard to the last day of trading of XIV on Nasdaq.\nEvent Acceleration of XIV\nOn February 6, 2018, Credit Suisse announced the Event Acceleration of XIV due to an Acceleration Event. The Acceleration Date for XIV is February 21, 2018, which is three business days after the Accelerated Valuation Date, February 15, 2018, each of which is subject to postponement due to certain events. On the Acceleration Date, investors will receive a fixed cash payment per ETN in an amount equal to the Closing Indicative Value of XIV on the Accelerated Valuation Date. As of February 6, 2018, Credit Suisse no longer issued new units of XIV.\nNasdaq Notification\nAfter the market close on February 13, 2018, Credit Suisse received a notification from Nasdaq that it intends to suspend trading of XIV following the market close on February 15, 2018 and institute delisting proceedings. Nasdaq informed Credit Suisse that the ability to trade XIV following the Accelerated Valuation Date provides no benefit to holders. Nasdaq specifically noted that XIV will cease to be a tool that can manage daily trading risks because the cash payment due upon Event Acceleration will remain fixed after the Accelerated Valuation Date. Therefore, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5710(k)(iv)(C)(2)(c), Nasdaq informed Credit Suisse that the Event Acceleration of XIV is an event or condition which in the opinion of Nasdaq makes further dealings on Nasdaq inadvisable. Credit Suisse will not appeal this determination.\nNone of the other ETNs offered by Credit Suisse are affected by this announcement. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Media Release have the meaning set forth in the Pricing Supplement for XIV that has been publicly filed with the U.S. Commission.\nTitle of ETN\nETN Ticker Symbol\nETN CUSIP\nVelocity Shares™ Daily Inverse VIX Short Term\nETNs due December 4, 2030\nXIV\n22542D795\nPress Contacts\nNicole Sharp, Credit Suisse AG, telephone +1 212 325 8708, nicole.sharp@credit-suisse.com\nAzar Boehm, Credit Suisse AG, telephone +1 212 538 3953, azar.boehm@credit-suisse.com\nCredit Suisse AG\nCredit Suisse AG is one of the world's leading financial services providers and is part of the Credit Suisse group of companies (referred to here as 'Credit Suisse').
