The U.S. Treasury Department last month released a list of wealthy Russian businessmen it said were close to the Kremlin that included Alekperov. “The banks are asking for additional materials. The procedure will be more complicated... Such lists are bad,” Alekperov told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. The list, drawn up as part of a sanctions package signed into law in August last year, does not mean that those included will be subject to sanctions, but casts a shadow of sanctions risk over a wide circle of wealthy Russians, including many outside President Vladimir Putin’s immediate circle.
