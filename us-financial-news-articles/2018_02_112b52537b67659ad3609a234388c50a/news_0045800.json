Marcelo was one of Real’s best performers in the 3-1 win at the Santiago Bernabeu last week and scored the final goal of the game to give them a two-goal cushion in the tie. He was forced off, however, during his side’s 5-3 win at Real Betis on Sunday with a hamstring injury. Real released a statement on Tuesday confirming the player had injured his right hamstring and said Modric, who played against PSG but was an unused substitute against Betis, had the same injury. As is customary at Real, the club did not reveal how long either player would be out of action although Spanish newspaper Marca said there was a possibility both players could return in time for the second leg at the Parc des Princes on March 6.

Real are fourth in the Liga standings on 45 points, 17 behind leaders Barcelona, but victory over Leganes would lift them above Valencia and into third place. Leganes, who are 13th, are in their second season in Spain’s top flight and knocked Real out of the King’s Cup in the quarter-finals last month, before eventually losing to Sevilla in the semis.
