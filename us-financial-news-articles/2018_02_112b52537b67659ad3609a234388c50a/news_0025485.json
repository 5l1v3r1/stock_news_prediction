The contract for the 16 combat utility helicopters was a repeat order, he said, after Canada delivered eight Bell 412 helicopters worth 4.8 billion pesos ($92.8 million) in 2014.\nLorenzana signed the Canadian helicopter deal last week at the Singapore Air Show last week, but Canada ordered a review after learning the aircraft would be used in anti-rebel operations.\n“I think there is malice in the way it is being raised,” Lorenzana told reporters.\n“It is not an attack helicopter but a medium-lift, meaning for transport of personnel and supplies. We are not asking these for free but we’re buying them. We do not have to justify how we will use these equipment.”\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte scrapped the deal on Friday night because of conditions imposed by Canada, telling his generals not to buy from the United States and Canada because of conditions imposed on arms sales.\nAir Force officials said Russia’s Kamov and China’s Z-series helicopters are comparable models to Bell’s 412 medium lift. South Korean’s Surions are also an option.\n($1 = 51.7300 Philippine pesos)\nReporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty & Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T11:26:36.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
