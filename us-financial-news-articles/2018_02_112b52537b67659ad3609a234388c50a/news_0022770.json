Meanwhile, the luxury business notched up near 10 percent growth on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and acquisitions.\nCEO expects “significant growth”\nThe beauty industry “should remain dynamic and contrasted” in 2018, L‘Oreal Chairman and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon said in a statement, adding he was confident of significant growth in like-for-like sales.\nOperating profitability should increase, Agon said. It hit a record 18 percent in 2017, after L‘Oreal sold off the Body Shop, where margins were low.\nL‘Oreal - which has previously not ruled out buying Nestle’s ( NESN.S ) 23 percent stake in the firm should its Swiss shareholder want to sell - would have the resources to do so, Agon said separately on Thursday in an interview with the Financial Times.\nView of the entrance of cosmetics company L'Oreal's new World hair research centre in Saint-Ouen, near Paris, France, December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Platiau “We have all the resources for that. We are cash rich,” Agon was Quote: d as saying. He also pointed to L‘Oreal’s 9 percent stake in drugmaker Sanofi ( SASY.PA ), which analysts have long said could be sold to fund such a purchase.\nAn agreement between Nestle and L‘Oreal’s biggest investors, the Bettencourt family, not to increase their stakes expires in mid-March, following the death last September of matriarch Liliane Bettencourt.\nThat stirred speculation Nestle could sell out or even look to launch a takeover of L‘Oreal, though Agon has previously said the status quo was unlikely to change in the medium-term.\nL‘Oreal is due to hold an earnings news conference on Feb. 9.\nONLINE ON THE RISE Overall, L‘Oreal’s sales rose by a better-than-expected 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter on a comparable basis, and revenues for the whole of 2017 reached 26 billion euros, up 4.8 percent like-for-like, compared to 4.7 percent growth in 2016.\nThe share of products sold online increased, reaching 7.7 percent of all sales at year-end, up from 5 percent two years earlier. Operating income grew 3 percent in 2017, to 4.7 billion euros.\nL‘Oreal shares closed down 2.16 percent at 171.8 euros on Thursday before it released earnings. They have fallen 7.1 percent so far this year, after rising 6.7 percent in 2017.\nMany of L‘Oreal’s peers have also posted better-than-expected revenues or profits for the last three months of 2017, including Clinique owner Estee Lauder and U.S. cosmetics producer Coty ( COTY.N ).\nEditing by Adrian Croft and Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:32:14.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
