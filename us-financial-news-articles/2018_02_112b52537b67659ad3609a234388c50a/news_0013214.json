(NASDAQ:CG) today reported its unaudited results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nCarlyle Co-CEOs Kewsong Lee and Glenn Youngkin said, “We concluded 2017 with great momentum in all of our businesses. We had record activity across several dimensions during 2017, deploying $22 billion into new investments and raising $43 billion of capital across the platform. Our investment performance was exceptional with 20% appreciation across our carry funds, and we realized $26 billion of proceeds for our carry fund investors.”\nU.S. GAAP results for Q4 2017 and 2017 included income before provision for income taxes of $395 million and $1,132 million, and net income attributable to The Carlyle Group L.P. common unitholders of $53 million and $238 million, or net income per common unit of $0.49 and $2.38, on a diluted basis. Total balance sheet assets were $12 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nIn addition to this release, Carlyle issued a full detailed presentation of its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, which can be viewed on the investor relations section of our website at ir.carlyle.com .\nTax Reform Impact on Financial Results\nFollowing the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we revalued our net deferred tax assets and tax receivable agreement liability. This resulted in a net charge in our Q4 2017 U.S. GAAP earnings of $42 million. The revaluation of our net deferred tax assets increased our provision for income taxes by $113 million in Q4 2017, while the revaluation of our tax receivable liability resulted in $71 million of other non-operating income in the quarter. This non-cash charge did not affect Economic Income or Distributable Earnings.\nDistributions\nThe Board of Directors has declared a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per common unit to holders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2018, payable on February 27, 2018. For full year 2017, the Board of Directors declared $1.41 in aggregate distributions to common unitholders.\nThe Board of Directors has declared a quarterly distribution of $0.367188 per preferred unit to preferred unitholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2018, payable on March 15, 2018.\nConference Call\nCarlyle will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. EST on Wednesday, February 7, 2018, to announce its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.
