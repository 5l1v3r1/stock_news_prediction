As things stand, her government could not recommend consent for the bill, she said.\nCabinet minister David Lidington said on Monday that most currently devolved powers would now automatically stay in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, the devolved nations’ capitals, after Britain leaves the European Union.\nBut the British government would make exceptions if it believed that would damage the UK as a whole, he said, comments that raised hackles in Scotland and appeared to overturn progress made between the sides last week.\nThe British government needs a deal before the summer in order to pass the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill in Britain’s national parliament. The bill will formally sever the UK’s ties to the EU and “copy and paste” EU legislation into British law.\nReporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; editing by Michael Holden and Guy Faulconbridge\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T11:21:49.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
