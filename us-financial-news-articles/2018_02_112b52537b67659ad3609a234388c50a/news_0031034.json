REUTERS/Toru Hanai “Cryptocurrencies aren’t legal tenders and don’t have assets to back up their value,” Kuroda told parliament, adding that the prospect of them threatening the role of globally-trusted legal tenders such as the yen was low.\n“Some people say they should be described as crypto-assets, not cryptocurrencies,” he said.\nKuroda’s comments came in the wake of recent calls from global policymakers for a coordinated approach to regulating cyptocurrencies like bitcoin, which has drawn attention due to its highly volatile moves and increasing trading volume.\nFinance leaders from the Group of 20 major economies are expected to discuss the impact of cryptocurrencies at their meeting in Buenos Aires in March.\nReporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Chris GallagherEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:39:36.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
