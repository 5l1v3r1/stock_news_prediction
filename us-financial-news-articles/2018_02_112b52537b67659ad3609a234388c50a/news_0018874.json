It said Medvedev became the website's owner and administrator when Bondarenko went missing in 2015.\nThai Police Maj. Nuthapong Rattanamongkolsak, the arresting officer, said U.S. officials had tracked the group for several years but only recently started to make arrests.\n\"Before the operation could be ready, they had to recheck their targets in various countries,\" Nutthapong said, adding that the case against the Infraud Organization began in 2014 when a U.S. Homeland Security officer sent an undercover agent to sign up as a member of the Dark Web forum.\nOn Thursday, thirteen of the wanted persons were taken into custody across the globe, including in California, New York and Alabama. Suspects arrested in France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Kosovo and Serbia are awaiting extradition.\nMedvedev will be extradited to face prosecution in the U.S., Nutthapong said.\nA Thai police statement said they seized 29 electronic items from Medvedev's Bangkok apartment, while the Infraud Organization's main servers were seized Tuesday in Paris.\nThe police statement said officers were able to arrest Medvedev by performing stake-outs, behavioral analyses, and by investigating his online activity.\nNutthapong said Thai police are tracking several other similar online syndicates.\nLast year Thai authorities arrested the alleged operator of Alphabay, a massive Dark Web marketplace where illicit items such as narcotics and guns could be sold or purchased by anyone, unlike Infraud, which vetted its members. The alleged Alphabay administrator, 26-year-old Canadian Alexandre Cazes, was found dead in his Thai prison cell shortly after his arrest, a suicide by hanging according to Thai police.\nThis story has been corrected to show that the servers were seized on Tuesday, not Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:29:37.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
