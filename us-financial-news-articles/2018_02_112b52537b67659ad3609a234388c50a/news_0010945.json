To attain that vision, it is vital that local companies get preference in planning, designing and executing Sci, Tech & Eng. projects,” Buhari said on his official Twitter feed late on Monday.\nThe president “ordered that all ‘procuring authorities shall give preference to Nigerian companies and firms in the award of contracts, in line with the Public Procurement Act 2007’,” the presidency said in a statement circulated on Monday.\nThe executive order also prohibits the ministry of interior from giving visas to foreign workers whose skills are readily available in Nigeria, the statement said.\nAround four out of every 10 people in Nigeria’s workforce were unemployed or underemployed by the end of September, according to data released by the statistics office in December.\nThe order states that consideration will only be given to a foreign professional “where it is certified by the appropriate authority that such expertise is not available in Nigeria”.\nNigeria, which has Africa’s largest population and biggest economy, fell into a recession in 2016 largely caused by low oil prices and militant attacks on energy facilities in the Niger Delta region.\nIt emerged from recession in the second quarter of 2017, largely on higher oil prices.\nReporting by Tife Owolabi; Additional reporting by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T01:56:34.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
