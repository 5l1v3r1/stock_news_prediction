White House officials had no immediate comment. \nThe apartment building where the incident occurred is in Manhattan’s expensive Sutton Place neighbourhood close to the East River. The apartment may be the home of Vanessa Trump’s mother, local news outlets reported. Slideshow (2 Images) \nDonald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, has been in the public eye for his role in 2016 meetings with a Russian attorney and others where the Trump campaign was offered potentially damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. \nCongress has held probes into those meetings and whether they were part of a Russian campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. \nRussia denies trying to influence the election. Trump dismisses any talk of collusion. \nIn 2016, white powder, which also proved harmless, was sent to the home of Eric Trump, Trump Jr.’s brother.
