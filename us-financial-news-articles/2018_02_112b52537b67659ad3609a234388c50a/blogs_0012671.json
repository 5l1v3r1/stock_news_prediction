In November it tested the Hwasong-15, believed to be capable of reaching the continental United States. It is not yet believed to have the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile.\nNorth Korea is under tightening U.N. Security Council sanctions for its banned nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. But recent weeks have seen a thaw with South Korea, after Pyongyang agreed to send athletes to compete in the Olympic Games opening on Feb. 9 in the south.\n'Charm offensive'\n\"What I would call 'the charm offensive' frankly is fooling no one,\" Wood told the talks.\nHe also said arsenals in China and Russia were expanding, drawing rebukes from their respective delegations.\n\"Russia, China, and North Korea are growing their stockpiles, increasing the prominence of nuclear weapons in their security strategies, and — in some cases — pursuing the development of new nuclear capabilities to threaten other peaceful nations,\" Wood said.\n\"We are not going to stick our head in the sand, we are going to respond to these growing challenges,\" he later told reporters.\nNorth Korea accused the United States of seeking to aggravate the situation on the divided peninsula by \"deploying large nuclear assets\" nearby, laying the ground for a possible pre-emptive strike against it.\n\"In view of the nature and scale of U.S. military reinforcements, they are designed to make a pre-emptive strike against the DPRK,\" North Korean diplomat Ju Yong Chol told the talks, referring to his country's official name the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\"U.S. officials including the defense secretary and the CIA director repeatedly talked about DPRK nuclear and missile threat to justify their argument for a military option and a new concept of a so-called 'bloody nose', a limited pre-emptive strike on the DPRK is under consideration within the U.S. administration,\" Ju said.\nHe said President Donald Trump's \"America First\" doctrine and U.S. nuclear superiority would endanger global peace and security and \"trigger off a new nuclear arms race and could bring the whole world close to a horrible catastrophe.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T13:40:47.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
