But it also collects fees based on the performance of its global funds, which have proven to be a less volatile source of income.\nA pedestrian walks past the logo of Australia's biggest investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd which adorns a wall on the outside of their Sydney office headquarters in central Sydney, Australia, July 18, 2017.
