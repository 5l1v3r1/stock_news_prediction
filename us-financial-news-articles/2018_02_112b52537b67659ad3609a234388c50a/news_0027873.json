Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports \n“It’s definitely a miracle and I‘m really thankful... to be able to motivate and inspire others - that’s bigger than any medal, right?” \nMcMorris’ remarkable comeback drew praise from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who tweeted: “What a journey back to the podium for @MarkMcMorris. Mark - your tenacity and courage inspire so many of us.” \nMcMorris tweeted two photographs on Monday, one of him in the hospital following his crash and the other on the medal podium. They were accompanied by a caption: “Thank You Life.” \nThe Canadian could add yet another chapter to his success story before the end of the Games, as McMorris is seen as a gold medal contender in the new Olympic discipline of Big Air.
