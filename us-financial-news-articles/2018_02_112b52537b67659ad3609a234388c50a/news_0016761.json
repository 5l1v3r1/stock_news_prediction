Excluding 60 million euros of currency effects, revenues would have been up by 5 percent in the three months through end-December. \nAdjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 4 percent to 172 million euros, beating an average forecast of 162 million euros in a Reuters poll. \nOsram stuck with forecasts for full-year comparable sales growth between 5.5 percent and 7.5 percent and broadly flat adjusted EBITDA of around 700 million euros. \nCurrency effects, ramp-up costs for its new light-emitting diode chip factory, the world’s biggest, in Malaysia and higher spending for research and development will add up to more than 100 million euros for the full year, it said.
