This buyback program includes repurchases made to offset performance share issuance. In 2016, we completed €200 million in share buybacks under this program. In 2017, we completed €300 million of repurchases, including an additional €100 million to mitigate the EPS dilution related to two divestments completed in 2017 ( Transport Services and certain UK assets ). Following completion of the divestments of Corsearch and certain Swedish assets in January 2018, we now intend to execute up to €400 million in buybacks in 2018, as we deploy the proceeds of these two most recent divestments with the aim of mitigating their dilutive effect on earnings per share.\nThe cumulative amounts repurchased under this three-year program is now as follows:\nShare Buyback Program 2016-2018\nPeriod Cumulative shares\nrepurchased in period Total consideration\n(€ million) Average share price\n(€) 2018 To Date 901,032 38.6 42.79 2017 7,768,288 300.0 38.62 2016 5,826,473 199.7 34.28 Total 14,495,793 538.3 37.13 Current repurchases are being executed under a third party mandate granted on September 26, 2017. Under this mandate, €50 million of share buybacks were completed in the period from November 2, 2017 up until December 31, 2017 and a further up to €50 million will be executed in the period from January 1, 2018 up to and including February 19, 2018.\nShare repurchases are made within the limits of relevant laws and regulations, in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer's Articles of Association. Repurchased shares are added to and held as Treasury shares and will be used for capital reduction purposes or to meet obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.\nFurther information is available on our website:\nDownload the share buyback transactions excel sheet for detailed individual transaction information.
