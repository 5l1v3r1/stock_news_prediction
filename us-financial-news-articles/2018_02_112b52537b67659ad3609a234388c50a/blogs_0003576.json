Tweet \nRomney has been a critic of President Donald Trump , a fellow Republican who had unsuccessfully urged incumbent Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, 83, to seek re-election this November. \nIn early January, when Hatch announced he would not seek re-election after more than 40 years in office , the White House pointedly would not commit to Trump supporting the eventual Republican nominee for Hatch's successor. Getty Images Former Massachusetts Governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is interviewed at the Silicon Slopes Tech Conference on January 19, 2018 in Salt Lake City, Utah. \nIn mid-January, Romney said that Trump's reported use of a scatological term to refer to Haiti and African counties was \"inconsistent\" with \"America's history and antithetical to American values.\" \nRomney, a former governor of Massachusetts , was the 2012 GOP nominee for president. He lost to former President Barack Obama. Romney also ran for the Senate in 1994 out of Massachusetts but was defeated in incumbent Sen. Ted Kennedy, a Democratic icon.
