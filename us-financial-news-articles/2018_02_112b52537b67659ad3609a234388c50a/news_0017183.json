They were last seen trading slightly below that level, but were still 3 percent higher from their closing price. \nAnalysts had expected the company to give conservative guidance. \nOn Thursday, Activision said it expects adjusted full year earnings of $2.45 a share on revenue of $7.35 billion. Prior to the earnings release, Wall Street had forecast fiscal 2018 earnings of $2.57 a share on $7.41 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. \nHere is what each of the company's businesses reported in revenue for the quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to Street Account consensus estimates: Activision: $1.34 billion vs. $1.40 billion expected Blizzard: $599 million vs. $526.1 million expected King: $516 million vs. $508.2 million expected \nKing, the maker of \"Candy Crush,\" saw year-over-year growth in revenue, beating analyst expectations.
