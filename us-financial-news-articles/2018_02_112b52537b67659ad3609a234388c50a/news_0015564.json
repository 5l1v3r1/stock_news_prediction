The result exceeded a mean estimate of 527.22 billion yen taken from 11 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nToyota raised its forecast for operating profit in the year through March to 2.2 trillion yen, a 10 percent rise from last year, based on an unchanged assumption of the yen averaging around 111 yen versus the U.S. dollar.
