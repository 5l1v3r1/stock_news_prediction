Interior officials said they are on track to exceed a planned 50% increase in drone flights this fiscal year, with 2,200 since Oct. 1.\nThe department has been testing drones since 2006 at its agencies, which include the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service and U.S. Geological Survey.\nThe Interior Department released its drone-flight data Wednesday, the first time it has disclosed details about its drone program. Other federal agencies have been rushing to adopt drones for a myriad uses: border surveillance by the Department of Homeland Security, weather monitoring by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and inspections of decommissioned radiation sites by the Energy Department.\nAlthough those agencies didn’t release numbers, Interior officials say theirs is the largest federal drone program after the military; the devices have been used by the Interior Department on missions including mapping archaeological sites, wildlife studies and inspection of remote infrastructure.\nThe advantage of the drones is that they can cover more ground than human-operated aircraft at a much lower price and less risk to pilots, said Mark Bathrick, director of the Interior Department’s Office of Aviation Services.\n“We are seeing as a rule of thumb they’re taking one seventh of the time and one tenth of the cost” compared with manned aircraft performing similar missions, Mr. Bathrick said.\nThe agency has used drones in Alaska to monitor threatened wildlife and assist in animal counts, he said.\nOne area of great promise is drones’ role in helping fight wildfires. Over the last year, drones were deployed on 707 missions on 71 wildfires, including in California, Oregon and Alaska.\nUsing infrared cameras, they mapped the progress of fires, which helped with decision-making about where to position fire crews.\nDrones deployed in one western Oregon blaze actually detected a spot fire. Firefighters were able to quickly extinguish the small blaze, which had ignited from flying embers and could have grown to threaten infrastructure and other property nearby, Mr. Bathrick said.\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke said drone technology “will help prevent and control catastrophic wildfires.”\nPrivacy advocates worry government drones could be used for other surveillance if there aren’t strict controls. For example, drones used to inspect an oil pipeline could be loaned to a law-enforcement agency to watch protesters nearby, said Adam Schwartz, senior staff attorney of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit privacy group based in San Francisco.\n“We are inherently concerned about mission creep, that the drone will be aimed at the public,” Mr. Schwartz said.\nPolicies to protect privacy need to be put in place to ensure the drones aren’t used for unwarranted surveillance, he added.\nMr. Bathrick said privacy is protected by training drone pilots, as well as agency procedures put in place to make sure an unmanned device only flies on a designated mission.\n“I am not aware of a single privacy complaint from the public,” he said.\nThe Pentagon has been using drones for about 20 years, including ones that have been used to bomb suspected terrorists overseas.\nOver the past decade, drone use by the American government has expanded to nonmilitary purposes, said Kostas Alexis, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno.\nThe civilian use carries challenges and safety risks including possible collisions with manned aircraft at fires, Mr. Alexis said. “Once you share the airspace, it becomes a risk,” he said.\nInterior officials said the aerial devices are controlled by more than 200 certified drone pilots.\nThis year, the Interior Department plans to expand the capabilities of the firefighting drones to replicate some of the work of the manned aircraft—dropping buckets of water and setting backfires. Unlike manned aircraft, they can fly at night and in heavy smoke, Mr. Bathrick said. Field trials of the firefighting capabilities are set to begin this spring.\nWrite to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T09:16:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
