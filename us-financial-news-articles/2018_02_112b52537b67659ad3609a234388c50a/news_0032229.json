Wilson, whose movies include “The Royal Tenenbaums,” is the brother of fellow actors Owen and Andrew Wilson.\nHaas, who reached a career-high 12th in the world golf rankings in 2012, is currently ranked 67th. He joined the PGA Tour in 2006 and has earned six victories, most recently at the Humana Challenge in La Quinta, California, in 2015.\nHe enjoyed his best finish at a major tournament when he earned a share of fifth place at the U.S. Open in 2017.\nHaas, whose father is a nine-time PGA Tour winner, represented the United States three times at the Presidents Cup, a biennial competition between the U.S. and an international team of players from the rest of the world excluding Europe.\nReporting by Peter Szekely in New York and Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T18:26:36.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
