Sky Zone’s brand and franchise structure will remain in place, and its management team will continue to manage Sky Zone operations as well as corporate-wide franchise activity in conjunction with the existing CircusTrix franchise team.\nSky Zone President Jeff Platt said, “We are extremely excited about what this new partnership with CircusTrix will enable for our guests and our franchise partners across the world. We believe, together, we will continue to be the leader in bringing more play to more people.” Jeff will continue to oversee Sky Zone as well as CircusTrix’s global franchise division as President of Franchise Operations and a member of CircusTrix’s executive team.\nCircusTrix’s acquisition of Sky Zone follows its acquisition of Rockin’ Jump in March 2017 and the investment in CircusTrix in December 2016 by an affiliate of Palladium Equity Partners, LLC (along with its affiliates, “Palladium”), a middle market private equity firm with approximately $3.0 billion in assets under management. Palladium and other CircusTrix equity holders made follow-on investments to support the acquisition and the future growth of the combined company.\n\"Sky Zone launched our industry when it created the first indoor trampoline park almost 10 years ago. They have since grown to become the largest brand in the trampoline park market,” said Case Lawrence, Founder and CEO of CircusTrix. “When it comes to franchise support and infrastructure, we believe that nobody does it better than Sky Zone. We are delighted to welcome Jeff Platt and the Sky Zone team into the CircusTrix family.”\nSky Zone, which was founded in 2004, opened its first park in Las Vegas and has since grown to 195 franchised and corporate-owned parks in the U.S. and abroad. It focuses on active play experiences for people of all ages.\nProvo, Utah-based CircusTrix was founded by Lawrence in 2011. Its parks specialize in active recreation attractions including trampoline fields and ninja courses. With this acquisition, CircusTrix has almost 300 parks worldwide under its umbrella.\nHarris Williams & Co. served as the exclusive financial advisor to Sky Zone.\nTo learn more about CircusTrix, visit www.circustrix.com .\nTo learn more about Sky Zone visit www.skyzone.com/ .\nAbout CircusTrix\nFounded by award-winning entrepreneur Case Lawrence in 2011, CircusTrix is one of the leading companies in the increasingly relevant “Experience Economy.” With a growing network of almost 300 facilities worldwide, CircusTrix is the largest developer, operator and franchisor of trampoline parks in the world.
