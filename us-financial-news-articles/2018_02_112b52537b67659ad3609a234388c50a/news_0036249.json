So far, at the request of Republican Governor Rick Scott, only Florida has been awarded an exemption.\nReporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Daniel Bases and Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:18:59.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
