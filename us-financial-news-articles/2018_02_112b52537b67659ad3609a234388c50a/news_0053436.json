Both filings had been withdrawn as of Thursday, the Nikkei said, without citing sources.\nFILE PHOTO: A 100-inch, Hisense 4K Laser Cast television is displayed during the 2017 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., January 5, 2017. REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo A Sharp spokesman declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. A Hisense spokesman in Tokyo said he could not comment on the matter.\nSharp cut back its overseas TV business and licensed Hisense to use its brand in the United States in 2015. It later sued the Chinese state-owned firm for putting the Sharp name on what it said were low-quality TVs.\nIn September, Sharp asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to probe certain Wi-Fi enabled devices and their parts after Sharp accused Hisense of infringing its patents.\nSharp was taken over by Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) ( 2317.TW ), the world’s largest contract electronics maker, having struggled in the face of low-cost Asian competition. Recent financial results have shown Sharp is recovering from massive losses, and the company has said it plans to re-enter the U.S. market with a high-end TV brand.\nReporting by Minami Funakoshi in TOKYO and Susan Mathew in BENGALURU; Editing by Joseph Radford and Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T01:09:55.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
