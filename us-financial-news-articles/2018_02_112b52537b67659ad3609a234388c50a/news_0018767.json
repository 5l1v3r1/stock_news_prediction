Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods from domestic clients jumped by 11 percent in real terms, outpacing an increase in foreign demand of 5 percent, VDMA said. In the less volatile October-December comparison, orders were similarly robust, rising by 10 percent on the year, VDMA said, with domestic demand rising 13 percent and foreign up 9 percent. VDMA chief economist Ralph Wiechers called the double-digit surge in domestic bookings \"especially pleasing\". He noted that over the full-year period, foreign demand had been stronger. \"The next government needs to implement a growth-friendly policy which guarantees that Germany is not blocking its way into the future by neglecting investments,\" Wiechers said. In 2017 as a whole, engineering orders rose 8 percent, with foreign demand jumping by 10 percent and domestic orders up 5 percent.
