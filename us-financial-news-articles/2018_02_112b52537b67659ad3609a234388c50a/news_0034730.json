Most other better-rated euro zone bond yields were also down 1-2 bps.\nItaly kicked off one of the most hefty weeks of supply this year so far by selling around 7.68 billion euros in bonds maturing in 2020, 2024 and 2048.\nOverall this week, analysts are expecting over 20 billion euros of supply from euro zone governments.\nItalian bond yields rose after the auction, with 10-year yields touching six-week highs at 2.08 percent.\nPortuguese bond yields climbed around 7 bps to their highest in around six weeks at 1.99 percent.\nElsewhere, British gilt yields rose after data showed inflation in the UK unexpectedly held close to its highest level in nearly six years in January, firming up investors’ bets that the Bank of England will raise interest rates again in May.\nThe BoE surprised financial markets last week by indicating that rates could move up faster than previously expected, as the Bank wanted to bring inflation back to its target of 2 percent within two years rather than three.
