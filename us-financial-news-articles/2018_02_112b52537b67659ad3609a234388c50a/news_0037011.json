Hughes, M.D., has been appointed Medical Director of Jefferson's newly initiated Burn Center and as Clinical Associate Professor of Surgery in the Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University . Under the direction of Dr. Hughes, Jefferson's Burn Center provides a comprehensive set of services from skin grafts and rehabilitation services to psychological counseling. The program provides patients with improved access to world-leading experts in treating the most serious life-threatening or disfiguring burns. Until now, residents of the Greater Philadelphia region had few options for treating severe burns.\nThe Jefferson Burn Center rounds out a complement of surgical and trauma services offered at Jefferson, as well as outpatient acute care. It is among few programs of its kind in the Delaware Valley to be located in a Level 1 Trauma Center where emergency cases can be transported around-the-clock from the scene or from other hospitals. It is also one of only a few burn facilities in the area to be affiliated with an academic medical center, giving patients the added measure of confidence that they are receiving the best care possible. Through Jefferson's broad network of hospitals, patients across the region have access to a program that has the ability to care for the injury from start to finish and is backed by a variety of resources to handle any type of burn injury.\n\"Dr. Hughes is a very experienced and talented burn surgeon that is not only be an incredible asset to our team, but a leader in our intent over the next few years to build a Burn Center that can be nationally verified,\" said Charles Yeo, M.D., FACS, Chair, Department of Surgery, and Samuel D. Gross Professor of Surgery at Sidney Kimmel Medical College. \"We're happy to be working with Dr. Hughes in bringing tertiary and quaternary care of complex burn patients to Jefferson with this new endeavor.\"\nDr. Hughes is Board Certified by the American Board of Surgery, and his expertise includes critical care, trauma, burn, and general surgery. He is an active participant in the community and devotes his time to lectures and seminars on fire prevention and burn care. He continues to work with local emergency services and outpatient providers, accepting patients with burns to Jefferson.\nDr. Hughes comes to Jefferson from Temple University Hospital where he served as Director for the Temple Burn Center for nearly 20 years. He graduated from the University of Scranton, and the Temple University School of Medicine. He completed his General Surgery residency at the Medical College of Pennsylvania/Hahnemann, where he served as Chief Resident. He began practicing at St. Agnes Burn Center and left in July of 1999 to establish the Temple University Burn Center.\nOutpatient burn care at Jefferson is delivered at 1100 Walnut Street on the 5th floor of the Medical Office Building with established office hours held in the afternoons three days per week.\nAbout Jefferson Health\nJefferson Health, home of Sidney Kimmel Medical College, is reimagining health care in the greater Philadelphia region and southern New Jersey.
