We gave away a few avoidable penalties.” \nThe hooker said he had no complaints about referee Nigel Owens, who was often booed by the Stade de France crowd. \n“He was coherent. It’s up to us to see what didn’t work well,” he said. \nCoach Jacques Brunel echoed his captain’s opinion. \n“We were a bit too penalised and gave away points but we were always in contention against the world number three, we showed a lot of courage,” Brunel said after his first game in charge. \nSexton scored a 44-metre drop goal with the last kick of the game to give Ireland the win. \n“It’s a big disappointment after all the effort we put into this game,” said Brunel.
