The foreign ministry said France was concerned about Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its activities in the region, mentioning its support for Houthi rebels in Yemen but making no mention of its role in Syria. Reuters reported on Sunday that the United States is hoping to convince its European allies -- Britain, France and Germany -- to improve the Iran nuclear deal over time in return for U.S. President Donald Trump keeping the pact alive by renewing U.S. sanctions relief in May. Asked about the Reuters report, the foreign ministry responded in an online media briefing: “The French position on the Iran nuclear deal is known. As the President of the Republic (Emmanuel Macron) has said, we reaffirm our full attachment to the global action plan and its strict implementation.” Without directly responding to the report, the foreign ministry added: “We will continue to talk about the Iran nuclear programme with our European and American partners.” Reporting by Ingrid Melander and Sudip Kar-Gupta; editing by Luke Baker", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T15:10:42.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
