(but) in our view it was not a pre-condition for having the guidelines in March,” the official said.\nSince an agreement in December on the basics of Britain’s withdrawal, EU officials have been urging London to clarify what it wants from a transition period and a future relationship.\nBut the British government, split into supporters of a tougher and softer line to take, has so far been unable to make any proposals, other than sticking to the initial position that Britain no longer wanted to be part of the EU’s single market or customs union or respect European Court of Justice rulings.\nThese “red lines”, however, appear to be irreconcilable with Britain’s pledge not to re-introduce a physical border between Northern Ireland and Ireland or to give its companies, including banks, as full access as possible to the EU’s market.\nThe EU official said that in the absence of any new input from London by March, the guidelines for Barnier would simply be based on what Britain has declared so far.\n“Some wishes have been expressed and on the basis of these wishes the guidelines will be prepared in March,” he said.\nThe negotiations between the EU and Britain on the future relationship are to end in October with a political declaration attached to the withdrawal treaty. The declaration will then be the basis of negotiating a proper free trade agreement once Britain ceases to be a member of the EU in March 2019.\nReporting By Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T20:08:32.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
