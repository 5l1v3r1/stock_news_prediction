Its population will shrink to 88 million from the current 127 million in the next four decades, the government estimates.\nThe grim demographics, coupled with a reluctance to loosen tight immigration rules, have led to the worst labour shortages since the early 1970s. The squeeze stifles the potency of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic policies, the International Monetary Fund has said.\nAbe has pushed for more elderly people to remain in work and stay active in later life, as part of his “work style” reforms aimed at revving up economic growth and productivity. The government said on Friday it would also support companies that raise their mandatory retirement age.\nMost Japanese companies require full-time employees to retire at 60. The system is a keystone of Japan’s traditional jobs-for-life employment structure where workers are virtually guaranteed employment from graduation to retirement.\nMore than half are planning to raise the retirement age, a Reuters poll last year showed.\nReporting by Thomas Wilson; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T07:56:45.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
