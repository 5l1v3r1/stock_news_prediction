Republican Senator Marco Rubio told Fox News he was unsure whether any Senate plan would move forward.\nEven if one of three bills passes, it must still win over the U.S. House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a larger majority and are pushing a more conservative proposal that is closer in line with Trump's framework.\nU.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he will support only legislation backed by Trump, who has carried his tough law-and-order stance toward immigrants from his 2016 campaign into his administration.\n\nâ€” CNBC contributed to this report .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T16:47:02.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
