(NYSE:HCC) (“Warrior” or the “Company”) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. Warrior is the leading dedicated U.S. based producer and exporter of high quality metallurgical (“met”) coal for the global steel industry.\nWarrior reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $97.2 million, or $1.83 per diluted share, compared to net income of $34.0 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $86.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $51.4 million in the prior year period. The market for high quality premium met coal continued to be strong in the fourth quarter, reflecting resilience in global steel production, as well as the effects of met coal supply disruptions in Australia and supply side reforms in China. The fourth quarter results for Warrior also reflect the successful completion of three planned longwall moves which lowered total production as expected when compared to previous quarters during 2017.\n“Warrior’s results in the fourth quarter were even better than expected enabling us to exceed our full year guidance in our key sales and production metrics,” commented Walt Scheller, CEO of Warrior. “The fourth quarter also saw the timely and successful back to back completion of all three longwall moves which will help to strengthen our operational base in 2018.”\nWarrior reported full year 2017 net income of $455.0 million and adjusted net income of $467.9 million, excluding non-recurring transaction costs associated with its initial public offering in April 2017, or net income of $8.62 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $8.86 per diluted share. The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $517.7 million for the full year of 2017.\nOperating Results\nThe Company produced 1.6 million short tons of met coal in the fourth quarter of 2017, 52% more than the amount produced in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year of 2017, the Company produced 6.7 million short tons, which exceeded its guidance and expectations as the Company ramped up its operations toward full capacity of the mines. “Moving one longwall operation is challenging by itself and when combined with the normal difficult geological conditions near the end of a panel, three moves back to back could have been overwhelming. However, our success was the result of good planning, preparation, communication and outstanding work by our employees and we thank them for the significant effort and success,” Mr. Scheller added.\nAdditional Financial Results\nTotal revenues were $239.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, including $228.8 million in mining revenues, which consisted of met coal sales of 1.4 million short tons at an average net selling price of $168.89 per short ton, net of demurrage and other charges. Sales volume increased 42% over the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting both strong continued production and strong demand from customers. Warrior capitalized on the strong pricing environment in the quarter by selling its met coal at 101% of the quarterly Australian premium low-volatility (“LV”) hard coking coal (“HCC”) index average price (the “Australian LV Index”), which replaced the Australian premium low-volatility HCC benchmark (“Australian HCC Benchmark”) starting in the second quarter of 2017. Total revenues for 2017 were $1.2 billion on sales volume of 6.5 million short tons.\nCost of sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $136.7 million, or 59.7% of mining revenues, and included mining costs, transportation and royalty costs. Cash cost of sales (free-on-board port) per short ton increased to $100.97 in the fourth quarter from the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the lower sales volume and higher transportation and royalty costs related to higher met coal prices.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $13.4 million, or 5.6% of total revenues, and were $36.5 million for the full year. Depreciation and depletion costs for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $17.8 million, or 7.4% of total revenues, and were $75.4 million for all of 2017. Warrior incurred interest expense of $5.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, which was higher than previous quarters due to the issuance of the $350 million Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “Senior Secured Notes”) in November 2017. Full year 2017 interest expense was $6.9 million.\nFor the full year 2017, the Company will pay approximately $2.3 million in alternative minimum income taxes (“AMT”) that will be refunded for that same period with the other AMT credits as noted below. The Company’s estimated savings in cash taxes for 2017 was approximately $122.8 million, or $2.33 per diluted share, due to the unlimited annual use of its net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards. “Our NOLs are tremendous assets of the Company which will significantly increase the cash available to fund the needs of the business and any strategic opportunities that may present themselves in the future,” said Dale Boyles, Warrior’s Chief Financial Officer.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted in December lowers most business and individual tax rates and generally represents the most sweeping reform of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years. While nearly all the provisions took effect on January 1, 2018, companies are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in their financial statements in December 2017. Accordingly, Warrior recognized an income tax benefit of $35.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $38.6 million benefit for the full year, primarily as a result of the refund of existing AMT credits of approximately $39.3 million which the Company expects to receive in 2019 through 2022.\nCash Flow and Liquidity\nThe Company continued to generate strong cash flows from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $91.4 million compared to $12.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 cash flows from operating activities were $434.5 million. Net working capital, excluding cash and income tax receivable, decreased by $6.9 million from the third quarter of 2017 and was an increase, or use of cash, of $61.0 million for the full year 2017. The increase in net working capital, or use of cash, in 2017 was primarily attributable to the restart of two longwall operations in the Company’s ramp up of production and sales volumes resulting in higher accounts and other receivables, slightly higher inventories and higher prepaid expenses partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in long-term income tax receivable is attributable to recognition of the expected refunds of AMT credits in future years as noted above. The Company invested significantly in its business during 2017 with total cash capital expenditures for the fourth quarter 2017 of $30.0 million and $92.6 million for the full year of 2017. These cash expenditures exclude non-cash accruals and capital leases of approximately $15.0 million for the full year of 2017.\nFree cash flow was $61.5 million in the fourth quarter, which was $52.5 million higher than in the prior year period in 2016. Free cash flow for the full year 2017 was $341.9 million. Cash flows used in financing activities for the fourth quarter were $260.6 million, reflecting the net proceeds from the $350 million Senior Secured Notes offering and the payment of a special dividend of $11.21 per share as more fully described below.\nThe Company’s available liquidity as of December 31, 2017 was $135.5 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $35.5 million and $100.0 million available under its Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement.\nCompany Outlook\nThe Company’s outlook is subject to many risks that may impact performance, such as market conditions in the steel and met coal industries, overall global economic and competitive conditions, all as more fully described under Forward-Looking Statements. In light of the Company's successful 2017 performance, NOL carryforwards and expected market conditions in 2018, Warrior is establishing its guidance for the full year 2018 as follows:\nCoal sales 6.6 - 7.2 million short tons Coal production 6.6 - 7.2 million short tons Cash cost of sales (free-on-board port) $89 - $95 per short ton Capital expenditures $100 - $120 million Selling, general and administrative expenses $30 - $33 million Interest expense $31 - $32 million Cash tax rate 0% The Company’s guidance for capital expenditures consists of sustaining capital spending of approximately $70 - $83 million, including regulatory and gas requirements, and discretionary capital spending of $30 - $37 million for various operational improvements.\nKey factors that may affect outlook include:\nHard coking coal index pricing 2 planned longwall operation moves in 2018 (1 - Q3 and 1 - Q4) Excludes other non-recurring costs\nThe Company does not provide reconciliations of its outlook for cash cost of sales (free-on-board port) to cost of sales in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided for under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop the meaningful comparable GAAP cost of sales. These items typically include non-cash asset retirement obligation accretion expenses, mine idling expenses and other non-recurring indirect mining expenses that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include a GAAP estimate.\nRegular Quarterly Dividend\nOn February 13, 2018, the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling approximately $2.7 million, which will be paid on March 2, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 23, 2018.\nStandard & Poor’s (“S&P”) Global Ratings Upgrade\nOn January 17, 2018, S&P raised the Company’s corporate credit rating to B, from B-, with a stable outlook. At the same time, S&P raised the issue-level rating on the Senior Secured Notes to B+ from B- and the recovery rating to 2 from 3. S&P cited the Company’s strong performance, strong credit metrics and stable outlook as reasons for its new ratings. The upgrade reflects S&P’s view about Warrior’s ability to increase production with its low-cost structure and capitalize on robust demand in a favorable met coal price environment, enabling it to generate strong margins and cash flows.\nSenior Secured Notes Offering and Special Dividend\nAs previously disclosed on November 2, 2017, the Company consummated a private offering (the “Offering”) of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company used the net proceeds of approximately $340.0 million from the Offering, together with cash on hand of approximately $260.0 million, to pay a special cash dividend of approximately $600.0 million, or $11.21 per share, to all its stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 13, 2017 on a pro rata basis.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release contains the use of certain U.S. non-GAAP (“Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”) financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insights into the performance of the Company, and they reflect how management analyzes Company performance and compares that performance against other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other entities. The definition of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures is provided in the financial tables section of this release.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results today, February 14, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET.

The HCC that Warrior produces from the Blue Creek coal seam contains very low sulfur and has strong coking properties and is of a similar quality to coal referred to as the premium HCC produced in Australia. The premium nature of Warrior’s HCC makes it ideally suited as a base feed coal for steel makers and results in price realizations near the Australian LV Index. Warrior sells all of its met coal production to steel producers in Europe, South America and Asia.

Our cash cost of sales per short ton is calculated as cash cost of sales divided by the short tons sold. Cash cost of sales per short ton is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe cash cost of sales per ton is a useful measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and future potential performance. Cash cost of sales per ton may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWARRIOR MET COAL, INC.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant to a reader in understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure of our profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a useful measure of our ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing operations. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate our operating performance. Investors should be aware that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nRECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME TO AMOUNTS REPORTED UNDER U.S. GAAP:\nSuccessor\n(Unaudited) Predecessor (in thousands, except per share amounts) For the three months ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the\nyear ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the nine\nmonths ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the three\nmonths ended\nMarch 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 2016 Net income (loss) $ 97,156 $ 34,032 $ 455,046 $ (49,673 ) $ (61,816 ) Transaction and other costs, net of tax — — 12,873 13,568 — Reorganization items, net, net of tax — — — — (7,918 ) Restructuring costs, net of tax — — — — 3,417 Mine No. 4 idle costs, net of tax — 3,340 — 8,726 10,170 VEBA contribution — — — 25,000 — Adjusted net income (loss) (6)\n$ 97,156 $ 37,372 $ 467,919 $ (2,379 ) $ (56,147 ) Weighted average number of basic shares outstanding 53,018 52,640 52,800 52,640 Weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding 53,027 52,640 52,806 52,640 Adjusted basic and diluted net income (loss) per share: $ 1.83 $ 0.71 $ 8.86 $ (0.05 ) (6) Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) net of the following items net of tax (based on each respective period's effective tax rate): transaction and other costs, reorganization items, net, restructuring costs, Mine No. 4 idle costs and VEBA contributions. Adjusted net income (loss) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from adjusted net income (loss) are significant to the reader in understanding and assessing our results of operations. Therefore, adjusted net income (loss) should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income under GAAP. We believe adjusted net income (loss) is a useful measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and future potential performance.
