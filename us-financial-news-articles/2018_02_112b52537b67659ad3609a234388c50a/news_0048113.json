Harel will have 40 percent ownership of the partnership and has committed to an equity investment of 90 million shekels. The property has 11 floors with a five-level parking garage. It is under a long-term lease to a single technology tenant who has made a significant investment in adapting the office space to its needs. Harel said it seeking to diversify its portfolio from a geographic and a sectorial perspective, with the goal of producing stable, relatively low-risk returns for its beneficiaries and policyholders.
