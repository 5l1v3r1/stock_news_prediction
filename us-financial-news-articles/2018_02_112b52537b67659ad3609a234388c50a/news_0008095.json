It is not easy at the beginning of the year. I had to focus hard for the win.”\nThe Czech left-hander gave few opportunities on her serve to Mladenovic, firing nine aces and saving all three break points faced in front of a buoyant Sibur Arena crowd.\n“Coming into this week, there was a lot of pressure and I don’t think many people expected me to show up in the finals,” the 24-year-old Mladenovic said in her runner-up speech.\n“I fought very hard every single match to make it back here but Petra had an amazing week.”\nThe victory meant Kvitova maintained her streak of winning at least one WTA title since 2011 and now moves back up to world number 21, while German semi-finalist Julia Goerges will make her top-10 debut in Monday’s rankings.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T18:47:43.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
