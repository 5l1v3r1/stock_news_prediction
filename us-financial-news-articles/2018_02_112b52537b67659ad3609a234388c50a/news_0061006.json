(Nasdaq: NTRI), a leading provider of weight-management products and services including Nutrisystem® and South Beach Diet® brands, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nDawn Zier, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “In 2017, we achieved accelerated growth for both revenue and earnings. Double-digit revenue growth from both new and reactivation customers was driven by a highly effective advertising campaign, media expansion, and increased engagement throughout the customer journey. We also proved out our multi-brand strategy, demonstrating that we have a scalable platform to which we can continue to add brands as the right opportunities present themselves.”\nMs. Zier added, “As we enter 2018, I am pleased with the extraordinary growth of the South Beach Diet, and we believe it’s just getting started. Our Nutrisystem brand had a slower than expected start to Diet Season as our campaign failed to generate more new customers versus last year. Our highly successful creative approach fatigued and we are in the process of revamping the advertising and rebalancing media as a result. We view this as a temporary and fixable setback and anticipate returning to meaningful growth in 2019. All other key metrics around the business are sound and continuing to grow.”\nThe following are key financial highlights for the period. Reconciliations of certain GAAP to non-GAAP measures are provided later in this press release.\nFull Year 2017 Compared to Full Year 2016\nConsolidated revenue increased 28% to $697.0 million, compared to $545.5 million. The South Beach Diet brand contributed $27.1 million in revenue, compared to $1.6 million. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 53.9%, compared to 52.9%. Net income increased 63% to $57.9 million, compared to $35.5 million. Diluted income per common share increased 60% to $1.90, compared to $1.19. Our full year 2017 EPS included a fourth quarter non-cash write-off of $0.06 due to tax law changes. Adjusted EBITDA increased 46% to $109.4 million, compared to $74.8 million. In 2017, the Company returned $21 million in cash to stockholders via dividends. The Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, payable March 19, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 8, 2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nRevenue increased 20% to $131.2 million, compared to $108.9 million. Gross margin increased 50 basis points to 53.1%, compared to 52.6%. Net income increased 23% to $10.9 million, compared to $8.9 million. Diluted income per common share increased 24% to $0.36, compared to $0.29. Our fourth quarter 2017 EPS included a fourth quarter non-cash write-off of $0.06 due to tax law changes. Adjusted EBITDA increased 27% to $23.7 million, compared to $18.7 million.\nMike Monahan, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “Our full year 2017 results reflect strong revenue, EBITDA, and earnings growth and a continued strengthening of our balance sheet. Based on these results and expected continued strong cash flow in 2018, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 43% to $0.25 per share.”\nFirst Quarter and Full Year 2018 Guidance\nThe Company’s first quarter and full year 2018 guidance are outlined below.
