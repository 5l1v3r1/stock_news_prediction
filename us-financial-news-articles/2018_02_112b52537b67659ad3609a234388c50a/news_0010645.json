She became a mother during that time and decided that the benefits she received from pursuing a career as a nurse better fit her needs. She also has a natural passion for providing care to others, especially those in her community. It is this passion that she credits her entire career to, if she was without it she believes she would not have been this successful.\nTo begin her day, Theresa Gutierrez, MSN serves as a clinician that provides care to bariatric patients who manage chronic health issues associated with obesity. She manages the pre-surgical screenings of all bariatric-surgical patients as well as performing her duties as the Bariatric Program Manager.\nIn her time as a nurse practitioner, Ms. Gutierrez has had the privilege of being an Adjunct at the Brookline College of Nursing and the Central New Mexico Community College.

She wishes to teach those in the nursing field, using her experience as an educational tool for others who are willing to learn. She truly values education above all else, which is why she is currently pursuing her Doctorate in Nursing as well as her Master's in Public Health. She strongly believes that people must do all that they can to give back to their community to ensure the health and wellness of future generations.\nWhen she has time to herself, Ms. Gutierrez likes to be outdoors, she is fond of hiking and fishing.
