It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!,” the president tweeted.\nThe idea of turning educators into armed guards garnered blowback from other lawmakers (“I don’t support that,” Florida Senator Marco Rubio said at a town hall on Wednesday ), law enforcement professionals (“Teachers should teach,” Broward County Sheriff Steve Israel said at the same townhall), and—notably—some teachers themselves.\nOn Wednesday, teachers started using the hashtag #armmewith on social media to counter the president’s proposal and express what they want in their classrooms instead of guns. Two educators with large Instagram followings — Brittany Wheaton of Utah and Olivia Bertels of Kansas — started the campaign, according to Buzzfeed , and it’s since reverberated around Instagram with nearly 7,000 posts as of Friday morning .\n#armmewith the resources and funding needed to help students experiencing mental health issues, NOT guns. Teachers, now (more than ever) is the time to take and stand and say we will not accept another one of our students being lost to another senseless school shooting. We have to strive for MORE. Our students deserve it. Call, write, march… do whatever you can to show enough is enough— we NEED stronger gun laws, we NEED funding for mental health issues, we NEED our students to L I V E so they can change the future of this country. #resist #standup #guncontrol #enoughisenough #notonemore #gunsafety #schoolsafety #mentalhealth #teachertribe #iteachtoo #teachersmatter\nA post shared by Brittany Wheaton (@thesuperheroteacher) on Feb 20, 2018 at 3:59pm PST\n“If you’re an educator, you know that [more guns] is not a solution to stopping the violence that’s happening in our schools. Knowing that, I decided to start the #armmewith movement, where ACTUAL teachers give their solutions to what’s happening,” Wheaton told Buzzfeed .\nR E A L • W O R L D • S O L U T I O N S • my friend @thesuperheroteacher and I think that we should find more practical solutions than giving teachers guns. I hope you’ll take the same stance and read the explanation on my stories as to why.

Schools too often are either underfunded or those funds are misallocated. If every school was able to identify and implement resources that their specific population needs this country would be a better place. #future . . . #teachersofinstagram #teachersfollowteachers\nA post shared by @ hunka_learnin_love on Feb 20, 2018 at 4:04pm PST\nThis is a movement that I can 100% get on board with. If you’ve heard me talk about my class size the last couple years, you will not be surprised that this is one of my hot button issues. In the mind of children, negative attention is still attention, and I believe that as we raise class sizes, overload teachers, and cut support, we will continue to see major behavioral, social, and emotional issues rise to unparalleled levels. I think that reaching out to educators about ways that we can be PROactive, not reactive, in the education world to reduce violence of any kind is absolutely one of the best places to start making a change! . . . . . #ArmMeWith #RealTalk #IssuesInEducation #iTeach2nd #iTeach3rd #TeacherLife #TeachersOfInstagram #TeacherCommunity #TargetTeachers\nA post shared by Kelly Bates (@buildingbrilliance) on Feb 20, 2018 at 5:58pm PST\nSome of the posts took on a political tone, with teachers asking for common sense gun laws or security officers in schools, but a consistent message was that some educators, already short on time and resources, don’t necessarily want the additional responsibility of carrying firearms in their classrooms.\nPoliticians want to arm teachers with firearms. Here’s my response. #ArmMeWith #education #guncontrol\nA post shared by Jason Knoll (@jlknoll) on Feb 22, 2018 at 5:26am PST\nBertels’s post hit on this point, calling out the personal investment teachers make in their own classrooms. “I should not be single-handedly keeping Target in business,” she wrote. Indeed, the Education Market Association found in 2016 that the average teacher spends nearly $500 of their own money on school supplies every year. One in 10 spends $1,000 or more.\nCost estimates for arming teachers vary from tens of millions of dollars to nearly $1 billion . And while public schools are funded in large part at the local level, Trump’s push for armed teachers comes as his administration looks to cut back on existing federal education spending and invest more in school choice initiatives.\nHis budget proposal , introduced before school massacre in Florida last week, seeks to slash the federal government’s presence in public schools by cutting the Education Department’s discretionary spending by 5.3%. Notable among the reductions is a $25 million decrease in funds for national school safety activities and the elimination of a $400 million grant program that school districts could spend on anti-bullying programs or mental health assistance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T14:52:08.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
