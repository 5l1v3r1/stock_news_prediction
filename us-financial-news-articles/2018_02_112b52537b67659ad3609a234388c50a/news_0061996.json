It has investigated lawmakers, ministers, and other top officials and exposed conflicts of interest, fraud and abuse of power. It has led to scores of top officials being sent to trial.\nPresident Klaus Iohannis, who has the final say in removing top prosecutors from office, gave Kovesi his support on Friday and criticised Toader for failing to provide sufficient reasons for Kovesi’s dismissal.
