The company, which is Europe’s biggest retailer, also cut its 2017 dividend by 34 percent after it unveiled a net loss of 531 million euros ($648 million), following non-recurring charges of 1.3 billion euros. It said the weak results demonstrated the necessity of implementing the five-year overhaul plan it presented last month. Its 2017 recurring operating profit fell 14.7 percent to 2.006 billion euros. This was broadly in line with a median forecast of 1.99 billion euros in an Inquiry Financial poll of analysts for Reuters, and the company’s guidance for about 2 billion euros. Carrefour announced last month plans to cut costs and jobs, boost E-commerce investment and seek a partnership in China with Tencent in a bid to boost profits and revenues and help it tackle competition from Amazon. $1 = 0.8190 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T19:10:23.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
