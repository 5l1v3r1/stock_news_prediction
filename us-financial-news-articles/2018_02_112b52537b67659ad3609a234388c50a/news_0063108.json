The asset is well-located at 2801 East 120 th Avenue in Thornton, Colorado – a growing submarket of Northglenn/Thornton within the greater Denver MSA.\n“The acquisition of Waterford Place represents a continuation of Greystar’s strategy of acquiring high-quality assets with value-add upside in submarkets like Thornton, poised for growth due to limited new supply.

Unit updates will include the addition of stainless steel appliances, extended plank flooring, quartz countertops, and new lighting and hardware packages. Renovations to the common areas will feature enhancements to the pool, clubhouse, fitness center, BBQ area, dog park, and sport/tennis court.\nWaterford Place is a 336-unit garden-style apartment community constructed in 1998. It’s location in the attractive Thornton submarket boasts low-density of only 18 units per acre and the development’s park-like setting sets it apart from other communities in the submarket. Thornton has emerged as an area with a unique balance of high-tech industries, well-planned retail, and attractive development driving strong population growth of 12.1% since 2010 and is expected to grow another 12% by 2021. The asset is located four minutes from the future light rail station that will provide direct high-speed rail access to downtown Denver’s Union Station.\nAs the nation’s largest apartment operator with over 420,000 units under management, Greystar currently owns more than 1,700 units in the Denver Metro Area and manages 23,142 more.
