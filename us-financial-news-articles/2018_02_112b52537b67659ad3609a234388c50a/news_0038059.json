The meeting was called off due to scheduling conflicts after German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel unexpectedly had to fly back to Berlin to participate in a news conference about the release of a German-Turkish journalist from a Turkish prison, a source close to Gabriel said. It was not immediately clear if the meeting could be rescheduled during the conference, which runs through Sunday.
