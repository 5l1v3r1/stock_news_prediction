African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded.\"\nNot anymore. Last month, the jobless rate among blacks jumped nearly a full point to 7.7 percent , according to the latest monthly data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nEven at its low point, the jobless rate for black Americans has been roughly twice the rate for whites since the job market recovery began in March 2010.\nThose higher jobless rates for blacks may understate the overall level of unemployment for that group, which has a lower labor force participation rate than other groups tracked by the BLS. (The labor force participation rate measures the share of the overall population that is actively in the workforce and excludes, among others, those who have given up looking for a job.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T21:48:32.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
