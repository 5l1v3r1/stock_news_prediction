(NYSE: CNP) today reported full-year 2017 net income of $1,792 million, or $4.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $432 million, or $1.00 per diluted share in 2016.\nOn a guidance basis, full-year 2017 earnings were $3.93 per diluted share, which includes a one-time tax benefit of $1,113 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) federal income tax rate reduction. Excluding the tax benefit, on a guidance basis, full-year 2017 earnings were $1.37 per diluted share, consisting of $0.99 from utility operations and $0.38 from midstream investments. Full-year 2016 earnings on a guidance basis were $1.16 per diluted share, consisting of $0.88 from utility operations and $0.28 from midstream investments.\nFourth quarter 2017 earnings were $2.99 per diluted share, compared to $0.23 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the tax benefit, on a guidance basis, fourth quarter 2017 earnings were $0.33 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2016 earnings of $0.26 per diluted share.\n\"I am very pleased with our performance in 2017. We had strong results and delivered more than 18 percent year-over-year EPS growth on a guidance basis, excluding the tax benefit,\" said Scott M. Prochazka, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. \"We continue to invest significant capital in our businesses to support safety, customer growth, reliability projects, and infrastructure programs.\"\nBusiness Segments\nElectric Transmission & Distribution\nThe electric transmission & distribution segment reported full-year 2017 operating income of $610 million, consisting of $535 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $75 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2016 was $628 million, consisting of $537 million from the TDU and $91 million related to securitization bonds.\nFull-year 2017 operating income for the TDU benefited from rate relief and customer growth with the addition of nearly 41,000 customers. These increases were more than offset by lower equity return, higher depreciation, higher operation and maintenance expenses, lower usage and lower miscellaneous revenues.\nNatural Gas Distribution\nThe natural gas distribution segment reported full-year 2017 operating income of $328 million compared with $303 million in 2016.\nFull-year 2017 operating income for natural gas distribution improved as a result of rate relief, higher transportation revenues, customer growth with the addition of more than 30,000 customers, and favorable labor and benefits expenses resulting primarily from the recording of a regulatory asset to recover prior postretirement expenses in future rates established in the Texas Gulf rate order. These improvements were partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses and increased depreciation and amortization.\nEnergy Services\nThe energy services segment reported full-year 2017 operating income of $125 million, which included a mark-to-market gain of $79 million, compared with $20 million in 2016, which included a mark-to-market loss of $21 million. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments, operating income was $46 million in 2017 and $41 million in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased margin associated with increased throughput in 2017.\nMidstream Investments\nThe midstream investments segment reported full-year 2017 equity income of $265 million, compared to equity income of $208 million in 2016.\nEarnings Outlook\nCenterPoint Energy expects earnings on a guidance basis for 2018 in the range of $1.50 - $1.60 per diluted share, inclusive of Enable's net income guidance of $355 - $435 million announced on Enable Midstream's fourth-quarter earnings call on Feb. 20, 2018. The guidance range assumes ownership of 54.1 percent of the common units representing limited partner interests in Enable Midstream and includes the amortization of CenterPoint Energy's basis differential in Enable Midstream and effective tax rates. CenterPoint does not include other potential Enable Midstream impacts on guidance, such as any changes in accounting standards or unusual items.\nThe guidance range considers utility operations performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates, financing activities, and regulatory and judicial proceedings to include regulatory action as a result of recent tax reform legislation.\nIn providing this guidance, CenterPoint Energy uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not consider other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and the related stocks, or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business.\nCenterPoint Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Net Income\nand Diluted EPS to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS used in providing annual earnings guidance\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nNet Income\n(in millions)\nDiluted EPS\nNet Income\n(in millions)\nDiluted EPS\nConsolidated net income and diluted EPS as reported\n$ 1,792\n$ 4.13\n$ 432\n$ 1.00\nMidstream Investments\n(675)\n(1.56)\n(121)\n(0.28)\nUtility Operations (1)\n1,117\n2.57\n311\n0.72\nTiming effects impacting CES (2) :\nMark-to-market (gains) losses (net of taxes of $29 and $8) (3)\n(50)\n(0.12)\n13\n0.03\nZENS-related mark-to-market (gains) losses:\nMarketable securities (net of taxes of $3 and $114) (3)(4)\n(4)\n(0.01)\n(212)\n(0.49)\nIndexed debt securities (net of taxes of $17 and $145) (3)(5)\n(32)\n(0.07)\n268\n0.62\nUtility operations earnings on an adjusted guidance basis\n$ 1,031\n$ 2.37\n$ 380\n$ 0.88\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS used in providing earnings guidance:\nUtility Operations on a guidance basis\n$ 1,031\n$ 2.37\n$ 380\n$ 0.88\nMidstream Investments\n675\n1.56\n121\n0.28\nConsolidated on a guidance basis\n$ 1,706\n$ 3.93\n$ 501\n$ 1.16\nBenefit from tax reform (6)\nUtility\n(599)\n(1.38)\n-\n-\nMidstream\n(514)\n(1.18)\n-\n-\nTotal benefit from tax reform\n(1,113)\n(2.56)\n-\n-\nUtility Operations on a guidance basis, excluding benefit from tax reform\n$ 432\n$ 0.99\n$ 380\n$ 0.88\nMidstream Investments excluding benefit from tax reform\n161\n0.38\n121\n0.28\nConsolidated on a guidance basis, excluding benefit from tax reform\n$ 593\n$ 1.37\n$ 501\n$ 1.16\n(1) CenterPoint earnings excluding Midstream Investments\n(2) Energy Services segment\n(3) Taxes are computed based on the impact removing such item would have on tax expense\n(4) As of May 18, 2016, comprised of Time Warner Inc., Charter Communications, Inc. and Time Inc.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. CenterPoint Energy's adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation excludes from net income and diluted earnings per share, respectively, the impact of ZENS and related securities and mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company's Energy Services business. CenterPoint Energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of ZENS and related securities and mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company's Energy Services business are not estimable.\nManagement evaluates the company's financial performance in part based on adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of CenterPoint Energy's overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods. The adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that Management believes does not most accurately reflect the company's fundamental business performance. These excluded items are reflected in the reconciliation tables of this news release, where applicable. CenterPoint Energy's adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income and diluted earnings per share, which respectively are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
