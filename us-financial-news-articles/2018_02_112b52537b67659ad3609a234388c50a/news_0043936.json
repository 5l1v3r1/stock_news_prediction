NBC brings a small army of employees to Olympic host cities each time it hosts the event. So what’s the company doing to entertain the troops on their downtime? At Sochi, in 2014, NBC opened a covert, employee-only Starbucks for the 2,500-odd people it sent to the Games. In Pyeongchang this year, as WSJ sports columnist Jason Gay reports, NBC is hosting Peloton classes . And of course, our trusty steed gave the high-end, internet-connected subscription exercise bike class a try.\nBacklash Blues If you unplugged over the Presidents Day weekend, you may have missed the commander in chief himself quoting Facebook’s vice president of ads. In a weekend tweetstorm about the U.S. indictment against Russian companies and individuals over election interference, Rob Goldman suggested few news outlets reported that the majority of Russian ad spend happened after the election because it “doesn’t align with the main media narrative of T[r]ump and the election.” Another suggested the Russians’ main goal wasn’t to sway the election. POTUS jumped on the opportunity to endorse those tweets. One standout response among the fact-checkers and general backlash to Mr. Goldman’s assertions came from Omnicom Media Group Executive Chairman Mainardo de Nardis : “You really are not in a position to preach and your astonishing tweets have created confusion and anger. Enough damage done over the past 2+ years. In the absence of real actions silence would be appreciated.” Ooof. On Monday, Wired reports, Mr. Goldman posted an internal Facebook message apologizing for tweeting his own views about Russian interference “without having it reviewed by anyone internally.”\n—Get Up to Speed—\nThe federal indictment, which was made public Friday, detailed how the Internet Research Agency organization spread discord in the U.S. by allegedly using platforms including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube like a well-oiled digital ad agency —complete with a graphics team, SEO experts and an analytics group, as CNN reported. Another fascinating read on the matter is this Washington Post interview with a man who says he worked at a Russian troll factory from 2014 to 2015, where he “felt like a character in the book ‘1984’ by George Orwell—a place where you have to write that white is black and black is white.” Related: Facebook has an old-skool solution to a new problem. Katie Harbath, Facebook’s global director of policy programs, said Saturday that the social network will send out postcards via U.S. mail to verify the identities and locations of people looking to place U.S. election-related ads. The postcards will contain a code those advertisers would need to input on Facebook to verify they are from the U.S.\nHit Like and Subscribe Publishers with paywalls have long griped at Google search and its algorithms, which tended to favor free content. But the search giant has softened its approach to paid-for content, recently ending its “first-click-free” policy, for example, which had allowed search visitors to read at least three articles for free. Google continued subscription charm offensive into a “Digital News Initiative” summit it held in Amsterdam last week, where the search giant showcased ways it’s working to identify users who are likely to subscribe to a publication and tailor people’s search results based on the outlets they subscribe to. One attendee said that previous events had focused on advertising—which ultimately benefits Google’s bottom line, too—but this summit had far more of an emphasis on subscriptions. As Digiday points out, Facebook too is experimenting with allowing readers to subscribe to publisher sites through its platform. But Google increasingly is becoming the friendlier frenemy of the pair to publishers, especially given Facebook’s recent move to downrank news content, which is already leading to referral traffic declines , as Digiday reported in a separate article.\nAll I Have To Do Is Stream Are you a Fox News “superfan?” Well, have I got news for you: The cable news channel is launching “Fox Nation,” a standalone subscription streaming service , by the end of the year, the New York Times reports. Fox Nation is the latest in a wave of direct-to-consumer plays from TV networks and will include hours of original daily content and appearances from well-known Fox News anchors and commentators. It won’t, however, offer streams from the Fox News TV channel itself due to the company’s agreements with cable distributors. Fox News program development and production head John Finley says Fox Nation will appeal to “the folks who watch Fox News every night for hours at a time” and are still left wanting more. Those tend to be older folks, according to Nielsen, so it remains to be seen whether they’ll top up with a digital service, too. Fox News says its highly trafficked website and its big social presence suggest its digital plans make sense. Fox Nation isn’t expected to initially include advertising, and the all-important monthly subscription cost has yet to be decided, according to the report. Reminder: Fox News owner 21st Century Fox and WSJ parent News Corp share common ownership.\nBest of the rest Ad Age has published its annual “A-List” of the year’s top agencies. Wieden & Kennedy takes the top spot.

[ G-Squared Interactive ]\nA Belgian court has ordered Facebook to stop tracking users who haven’t given consent for their data to be collected on third-party sites or else face daily fines of €250,000 ($311,000). Facebook said it plans to appeal the ruling. [ BBC ]\nToy companies are mimicking the moves of fast-fashion retailers to capitalize on trends driven by social media that can spawn new types of games and toys that get into stores in a matter of months instead of following the annual Christmas cycle. [ WSJ ]\nJay Friedman, COO of the Goodway Group, argues the ad industry needs an “amnesty day,” where everyone in the supply chain agrees to full transparency going forward and doesn’t use those disclosures to punish actions of the past.
