REUTERS/Michaela Rehle/Files Last month, Alphabet Inc’s self-driving unit Waymo said it had begun testing self-driving vehicles in Atlanta, bringing to 25 the total number of U.S. cities in which it is testing.\nTechnology companies and carmakers are striving to adjust to a shifting landscape in the auto industry as consumers increasingly use smartphones to locate, hail and rent vehicles, rather than going out and buying cars.\n“Apart from highly autonomous level 3 vehicles we will also bring fully autonomous vehicles - level 4/5 - to the streets in the foreseeable future,” Wilko Stark, vice president Daimler and Mercedes-Benz Cars strategy, told Automobilwoche.\nA level 3 car still needs a steering wheel and a driver who can take over if the car encounters a problem, while level 4 promises driverless features in dedicated lanes. Full autonomy - known as an “eyes off, brains off” or “level 5” system - does away with even the need for a steering wheel.\n“The big difference to other competitors is that we are conceptualising our vehicle as a robo-taxi right from the beginning and not as a technology-kit mounted on a serial vehicle. We will not have a makeshift solution,” Stark added.\nReporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Andrew Bolton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T19:38:09.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
