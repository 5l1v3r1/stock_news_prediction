The website lists several benefits that NRA members can receive from companies like FedEx and credit card processing firm Clearent. \nSymantec didn’t elaborate on why it chose to end its discount program, but earlier this week, the progressive advocacy organization ThinkProgress highlighted the security firm as one of several companies that offer discounts to NRA members. Symantec has stopped its discount program with the National Rifle Association. \n— Symantec (@symantec) February 23, 2018 \nOther companies to have ended similar discount programs since the Florida shooting include First National Bank of Omaha, which said it would stop offering an NRA Visa Card because of “customer feedback.” Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA. As a result, First National Bank of Omaha will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card. \n— First National Bank (@FNBOmaha) February 22, 2018 \nEnterprise, which operates car rental services like Alamo and National Car Rentals, also said Thursday that it would end its discount program with the NRA. Thank you for contacting us! All three of our brands have ended the discount for NRA members. This change will be effective March 26. Thank you again for reaching out. Kind regards, Michael \n— EnterpriseRentACar (@enterprisecares) February 23, 2018 \nInsurance group MetLife also told USA Today on Thursday that it would end auto and home insurance discounts to NRA members. \nThe recent school shooting in which Nikolas Cruz used an AR-15 assault rifle to kill 17 people at a Florida high school has caused a number of advocacy groups and politicians like Senators Jeff Flake (R-Az.) and Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) to call for tougher gun control laws, including raising the minimum age for buying rifles to 21 from 18. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nThe NRA has countered by saying that certain politicians, advocacy groups, and the media are “exploiting” the shooting, according to the BBC . \"We are significantly increasing gun prosecutions… in 2017 we brought cases against more violent crimes than in the last quarter century\"- @POTUS \nFortune contacted the NRA for comment and will update this story if it responds.
