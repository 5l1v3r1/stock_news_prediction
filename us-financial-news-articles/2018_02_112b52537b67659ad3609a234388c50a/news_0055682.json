They say such a law would make it harder for them to find buyers for church-owned land - sales that help to cover operating costs of their religious institutions.\n“This abhorrent bill ... if approved, would make the expropriation of the lands of churches possible,” said the statement by Theophilos III, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Francesco Patton, the Custos of the Holy Land, and Nourhan Manougian, the Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem.\nRachel Azaria, the lawmaker who sponsored the legislation, said in a statement she agreed to delay the committee’s discussion by a week so that “we could work with the churches” to try to resolve the dispute.\nThe churches’ protest was also aimed at the recent cancellation by Israel’s Jerusalem municipality of a tax exemption it has granted to church-owned commercial properties in the city.\n“This reminds us all of laws of a similar nature which were enacted against the Jews during dark periods in Europe,” the church leaders said.\nJerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said on Twitter it was illogical to expect that church-owned commercial property, including hotels and retail businesses, would continue to enjoy tax-exempt status.\n“Let me make it clear: we are not talking about houses of worship, who will still be exempt from property tax, according to law,” he wrote.\nOutside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, pilgrims voiced their disappointment at finding its doors shut.\n“I am very upset. It’s my first time here and I made a big effort to get here and now I find it closed,” said Marine Domenech from Lille, France.\nReporting by Jeffrey Heller and Ori Lewis; Writing by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T14:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T14:32:23.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
