(\"Superior Gold\" or \"The Company\") (TSX.V:SGI) is pleased to announce detailed production results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 from the Company's 100%-owned Plutonic Gold Mine, located 800 kilometres north east of Perth, in Western Australia. The Company released initial basic production results on January 15, 2018.\n2017 PRODUCTION DETAILS\nProduction details are summarized in the table below.\nQ4\n2017\nTwelve\nMonths ended\nDec 31, 2017\nStope material mined (Tonnes)\n132,475\n598,752\nStope grade mined (g Au/t)\n3.72\n3.88\nDevelopment material mined (Tonnes)\n58,586\n209,392\nDevelopment grade mined (g Au/t)\n2.26\n2.40\nSurface material milled (Tonnes)\n110,098\n457,754\nSurface material grade (g Au/t)\n0.89\n0.64\nTotal material milled (Tonnes)\n307,166\n1,272,944\nGrade milled (g Au/t)\n2.4\n2.5\nGold recovery (%)\n84%\n80%\nGold Produced (ounces)\n20,197\n80,143\nGold Sold (ounces)\n20,029\n82,019\n2018 GUIDANCE\nDetails of production and expenditure guidance for 2018 are summarized in the table below.\nLow\nHigh\nProduction (oz of Gold) 1\n100,000\n110,000\nCash Costs ($/oz)\n$840\n$890\nAll In Sustaining Costs ($/oz) 2\n$990\n$1040\nExploration Expenditure (millions of $) 3\n$4.6m\nSustaining Capital Expenditures (millions of $)\n$5.7m\nNon Sustaining Capital Expenditures (millions of $) 4\n$1.7m\n1 Production includes a contribution from Hermes prior to commercial production being declared.\n2 This is a Non-IFRS measure. Refer to Non-IFRS measures section of the Company's prior MD&A's for a description of these\nmeasures.\n3 Exploration expenditures are primarily for the first six months of 2018 â€“ budget could increase with positive exploration\nresults.\n4 Non sustaining capital expenditures are for installation of a gravity circuit aimed at increasing gold recoveries. Note\nthat pre-production capitalized costs at Hermes are excluded as they are forecast to be largely offset by pre-production\nrevenue.\nChris Bradbrook, President and CEO of Superior Gold stated: \"The detailed production results highlight the strong operating performance achieved during the Company's first full year of operations at the Plutonic Gold Mine, during which we exceeded our annual 2017 production guidance of 75-80,000 ounces of gold. Of particular significance was the marked increase in recoveries to 84% in the fourth quarter in comparison to the average recovery of 78% in the first nine months of 2017. It is important to note that this increase in recoveries was achieved without the anticipated benefit from the gravity circuit which will be constructed during the first six months of 2018.\n\"Also during the quarter, a significant milestone was reached at Hermes where initial processing of mineralization commenced on schedule. Commercial production is expected in the first quarter of 2018. In preparation for the additional production, we have focused on various mill maintenance projects, which will be included in our All in Sustaining Costs for the fourth quarter. The contribution of the ore from Hermes is expected to allow us to reach our objective of increasing annual production to more than 100,000 ounces of gold. As a result we look forward to another strong year for 2018.\"\nThe Company will be releasing complete financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year for 2017 before market open on March 14, 2018.\nAbout Superior Gold\nSuperior Gold is a Canadian based gold producer that owns 100% of the Plutonic Gold Operations located in Western Australia.
