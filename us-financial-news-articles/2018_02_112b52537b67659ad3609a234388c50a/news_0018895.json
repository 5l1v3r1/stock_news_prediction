(NYSE: UTI), the leading provider of transportation technician training, reported financial results for the fiscal 2018 first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nKim McWaters, UTI's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Our fiscal first quarter 2018 results provide early indications of the success we are having adapting our business to perform optimally in the present full employment environment. We improved both the quality and quantity of prospective student inquiries, a key leading indicator for our business, which grew 14.5% year-over-year. In addition, for the first time in more than two years, we had application growth in our adult channel with new student applications increasing by almost 4% over the same period last year. Overall, student starts came in ahead of plan during the quarter with show rates improving almost 500 basis points over the prior year and solid progress demonstrated in our efforts to increase new student enrollment.\n\"Since our founding in 1965, we have established a strong market leadership position, with more auto/diesel graduates than our three closest competitors combined. Today, we are continuing to leverage our leadership reputation for long-term growth. Key to our growth strategy is introducing new commuter campuses closer to where our students live and providing innovative programs to offer more choices and pathways to successful careers. Our recently announced Bloomfield, NJ campus and the launch of our Welding program at our Avondale, AZ campus represent our latest progress toward these goals.\"\nFinancial Results for the Three-Month Period Ended December 31: 2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenues for the quarter were $81.2 million, compared to $84.2 million for the prior year period. The year-over-year revenue variance was attributable to a 5.8% decrease in UTI's average student population. Operating expenses for the quarter were $84.8 million, compared to $82.8 million for the prior year period. Operating loss for the quarter was $3.6 million compared to operating income of $1.4 million for the prior year period. The decline reflects the $3.0 million decrease in revenues as well as increases in advertising, contract services and professional services expenses, partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense. Income tax benefit was $2.8 million for the quarter, compared to an income tax expense of $2.6 million for the prior year period. The current period benefit was primarily a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, as well as the loss before taxes during the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $1.1 million, compared to $1.7 million for the prior year period. Net loss available for distribution to common shareholders was $2.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to $3.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share for the prior year period. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $0.8 million, compared to $6.3 million for the prior year period. (See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" below.) Our early adoption of the new accounting standard on revenue recognition resulted in a non-cash increase to equity of approximately $37.2 million as of October 1, 2018.\nStudent Metrics\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n(Rounded to hundreds)\nTotal starts\n1,300\n1,400\nAverage undergraduate full-time student enrollment\n11,300\n12,000\nEnd of period undergraduate full-time student enrollment\n10,400\n10,800\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nUTI expects new student starts to grow in the low single digits in fiscal 2018 with the growth more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year. UTI's goal is for its student population at year-end 2018 to be larger than it was at year-end 2017. Fiscal 2018 average student population is anticipated to be down in the mid single digits due to a 6% lower beginning population and the timing of the low single digit start growth expected for the full year. UTI expects full year 2018 revenue to range between $310 million and $320 million, compared to $324 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the expected lower average student population. Operating expenses are expected to range between $340 million and $345 million. UTI expects an operating loss of between $20 million and $25 million and negative EBITDA due to the lower total revenue expected in 2018 as compared to 2017, along with the financial impact of opening its New Jersey campus, its planned investments in marketing and admissions to support start growth and the planned expansion of its welding program. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $24 million and $25 million, including $11 million for the Bloomfield, New Jersey campus that is expected to open in fall 2018; approximately $4 million to expand the Company's welding program to two additional campuses; $7 million for new and replacement equipment for existing campuses; and approximately $2.5 million for real estate consolidation. The Company expects its efforts to rationalize its real estate footprint will provide net cost savings of $3 million to $4 million on an annualized basis starting in fiscal 2019.\nConference Call\nManagement will hold a conference call to discuss the 2018 first quarter results on Thursday, February 8th at 2:30 p.m. PST (4:30 p.m. EST).

Management chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because they provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the results from operations and helps to identify underlying trends. Additionally, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods. Management also utilizes EBITDA as a performance measure internally. To obtain a complete understanding of the Company's performance these measures should be examined in connection with net income (loss), determined in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the financial statements and notes thereto included in the annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since the items excluded from these measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance under GAAP, these measures should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of the Company's operating performance or profitability. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than UTI does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included below.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nAll statements contained herein, other than statements of historical fact, are \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
