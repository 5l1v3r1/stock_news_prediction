They asked whether patients were registered with a dentist and if they received preventive dental care. \nForty-one patients, or 80 percent, were registered or seen regularly by a dentist, and 35 said they had been to the dentist in the past year. About half of the patients attended regular hygienist sessions. \nAt the same time, however, preventive care appeared to be lacking. Most patients didn’t receive diet advice or oral hygiene instructions. Most also weren’t offered fluoride treatments, particularly fluoride varnishes, which can help prevent cavities and tooth decay. \n“With dementia patients, we tend to be treatment-oriented and there’s not as much talk of prevention,” Emanuel said. “Early in the disease, we should build positive habits so patients don’t forget what their dentists advise.” \n“It has been said, ‘Oral health is the gateway to quality of care and everyday life at old age,’” said Stefan Renvert of Kristianstad University in Sweden, who researches oral health in dementia patients living in residential facilities. \nRenvert, who wasn’t involved in the current study, is working to develop devices that might help people with cognitive decline maintain their oral health. \nThis year, he and his colleagues will test electronic toothbrushes that can remind patients how to brush their teeth thoroughly and record information that dentists can use, Renvert said in an email. \nCaregivers for people with dementia can find dental care advice online from The Family Caregiver Alliance ( bit.ly/2GJzy8i ) and the Alzheimer’s Association ( bit.ly/2GMYBYq ). \nSOURCE: go.nature.com/2GJzPYS British Dental Journal, online January 12, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T18:18:33.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
