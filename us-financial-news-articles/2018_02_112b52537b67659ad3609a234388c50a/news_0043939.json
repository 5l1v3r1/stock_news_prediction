This is critical for maintaining confidence across the global regulatory community in US banks,” said Adam Gilbert, a partner at PwC.\nIt is a blow, however, for conservative Republicans in Congress who have pushed to repeal the Dodd-Frank powers which they say are a taxpayer bailout in disguise.\n“Although I have been pleased or even excited about Treasury’s previous reports, this one disappoints,” Representative Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.\nThe OLA rules require all funds spent by the government to be recouped by fees on the banking industry, but conservatives say this temporary government lifeline is an improper intrusion into private markets.\nThe Treasury acknowledged the risks of rescinding the OLA, while noting it had “serious defects” that needed refining.\nThe report recommends reforming the OLA to limit its use, reduce the discretionary powers it affords bank regulators, and minimize the use of taxpayer funds to facilitate it.\nMany of these proposals can be enacted by bank regulators, but enhancing the bankruptcy code can only be done by Congress. The Treasury’s endorsement of an expanded bankruptcy code could inject new life into legislation currently pending before lawmakers.\nReporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Andrea Ricci, Michelle Price and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T16:43:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
