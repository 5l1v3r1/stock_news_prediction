At one point, SDF forces were capturing 40 to 50 Islamic State fighters, including Syrians, a day. \nU.S. officials say there are hundreds of foreign fighters and thousands of Syrian Islamic State militants in SDF hands. \n“The capacity problem is very real ... I think they are willing to hold them as long as we need,” Wheelbarger said. \n“(But) if they continue to capture them at the rates that they are, their facilities are eventually going to be full.” Reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Robin Pomeroy", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T23:33:32.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
