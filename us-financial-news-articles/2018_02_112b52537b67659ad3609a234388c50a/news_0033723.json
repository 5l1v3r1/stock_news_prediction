Later on Friday he is scheduled to speak at a Republican Party dinner in Provo, Utah.\nEarlier this week, a source familiar with Romney’s plans said he would pledge to “bring Utah values to Washington, D.C.” and planned to run a very Utah-centric campaign.\nRomney, a successful businessman, lost the 2012 presidential election to Democratic incumbent Barack Obama. He had served as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, after stepping in to lead the organising committee for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics following a bribery scandal.\nWhen Trump’s candidacy gained strength in the 2016 campaign, Romney urged Republicans not to support him, an effort that fizzled as the New York real estate magnate went on to win the nomination and the November election.\nTrump had urged incumbent Republican Senator Orrin Hatch to run for re-election in Utah, but Hatch opted not to do so, opening the door to Romney’s candidacy.\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Mohammad Zargham in Washington; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T00:12:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
