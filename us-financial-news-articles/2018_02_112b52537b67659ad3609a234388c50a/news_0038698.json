British women, however, have been an ever constant on the podium since the sport was re-introduced to the Winter Olympics programme in 2002.\nParsons had been standing next to Russian athlete Tregubov after Martin’s bad run put him into a podium position.\n“He doesn’t speak very good English, so I was kind of turning to him like ‘did that really just happen?,” Parsons said.\nSkeleton – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Competition – Olympic Sliding Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 15, 2018 - Yun Sung-bin of South Korea in action during the heat.
