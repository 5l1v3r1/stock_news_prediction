The government said it spent $5.8 billion on imports since late 2017.\nPrivate firms largely stopped importing gasoline after the government scrapped subsidy payments to help them sell at the capped price, leaving NNPC to import 90 percent or more of Nigeria’s needs.\nThe first group comprised the world’s largest oil trader, Vitol, with Italy’s Saipem, U.S. firm General Electric and Nigerian traders Sahara Group and MRS Oil Nigeria Plc and would refurbish Warri refinery in southern Delta state and the refinery in northern Kaduna state, the sources said.\nA second consortium included global commodities trader Trafigura, Italian oil major Eni, Spanish refiner Cepsa and Nigeria’s Oando, the sources said.\nThis group would carry out repairs at Port Harcourt, which consists of two refining plants, the sources said.\nVitol, Trafigura, Cepsa, Oando, Saipem, Sahara and Eni declined to comment. General Electric was unable to immediately respond to a request for comment. MRS did not respond to requests for comment.\nNNPC did not immediately provide a comment.\nFurther details on the deals being discussed, including the cost of repairs, were not immediately clear.\nOil minister Emmanuele Ibe Kachikwu previously said the government would raise $1.2 billion to upgrade its refineries and would end reliance on imports by 2019.\nKachikwu said this month Nigeria planned to announce the names of private investors in its refineries in coming month.\nNigeria’s gasoline consumption is now roughly 40 million liters per day in the nation of almost 200 million people.\nShortages have plagued the country for years. During the Christmas holiday, queues for gasoline emerged across the country, prompting intervention from NNPC and calls for calm from NNPC and the president.\nAdditional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, Jose Rodriguez in Madrid, Stephen Jewkes in Milan, Alexis Akwagyiram in Lagos and Ernest Scheyder in Houston; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://reut.rs/2BRndio", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:59:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
