Its products are also used in areas such as infrastructure planning, construction, mining, agriculture and energy. \nHexagon is targeting sales of 4.6-5.1 billion euros and an operating margin of 27-28 percent by the end of 2021. That compares with sales of 3.5 billion euros and operating margin of 24.1 percent in 2017. \nAdjusted quarterly operating earnings at Stockholm-listed Hexagon rose to 247 million euros ($306 million) from 209 million in the year-ago quarter, beating a 231 million forecast in a poll of analysts. \nThe firm partly competes with companies such as Trimble Navigation, Autodesk and Dassault Systemes . Its stock has been strong over the past year, rising 26 percent compared with a 14 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Technology Index ($1 = 0.8069 euros) (Reporting by Johannes Hellstrom; Editing by Simon Johnson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T09:58:06.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
