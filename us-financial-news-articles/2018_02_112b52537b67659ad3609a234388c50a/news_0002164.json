The site also notified people who opt out of Twitter emails and might have missed an initial notice. \nTwitter previously notified 677,775 people of their interactions with Russian propaganda. \nBoth Twitter and Facebook have faced heavy scrutiny for the role that fake news and propaganda on their sites played during the 2016 presidential campaign, and both have promised to take steps to combat manipulation and misinformation.
