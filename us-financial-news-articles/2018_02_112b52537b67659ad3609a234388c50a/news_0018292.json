The company spent much of 2017 reorganising as it battled a long-term downturn in industries like mining and oil and gas, where low prices have stalled customers’ investments.\nABB responded by cutting costs, simplifying its structures and ditching fringe businesses like the high-risk and low-margin engineering, procurement and construction business it spun off in December.\nBut Spiesshofer was more positive about the future, saying the simplified company was now ready to benefit from an upswing in many markets.\nSmall orders -- worth under $15 million and a signal of underlying demand -- grew for the fourth quarter in a row, registering a 9 percent rise during the October to December period.\n“The momentum we have built in 2017 positions us for profitable growth as the global markets are improving,” he said in a statement.\nABB’s view contrasted with industrial rivals General Electric and Siemens, which have announced major overhauls after being hit by weak demand from the power and gas sector.
