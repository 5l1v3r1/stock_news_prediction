He was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-VW chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of Volkswagen’s controlling clan who was ousted in 2016.\nSources close to Audi said there had been no discussion on the supervisory board about replacing Stadler. The controlling panels at Audi and parent VW are due to hold separate regular meetings next week.\nPorsche SE, the group through which the billionaire Porsche and Piech families control their majority stake in VW, declined comment.\nA senior source close to VW told Reuters last week that Stadler still had the backing of the Porsche-Piech clan.\nAudi, VW’s main profit contributor, did not admit to using illicit emissions control devices in the United States until November 2015, two months after the scandal at parent VW was revealed.\nBut Audi developed the bigger 3.0 litre V6 diesel engines used in about 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche models that in 2015 were found to be equipped with illicit software and to exceed U.S. emissions limits.
