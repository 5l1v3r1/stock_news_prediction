Regulators have been increasingly scrutinizing ICOs, which raised $3.7 billion in funds last year, according to CoinSchedule. \nThe 130-year-old company said last week that verifying the “accredited” status of potential investors for the digital KodakCoin token could take several weeks, sending its shares down 13 percent. Over 40,000 investors expressed interest in the offering, the Rochester, New York-based company said last week. \nKodak’s plan has been greeted with a mixed reception, with some critics of the proposal saying the imaging company is jumping on the distributed-ledger technology bandwagon to boost its shares. Kodak is working with a company that promotes paparazzi photos to offer a blockchain-based service that would let photographers get paid whenever their images are used.
