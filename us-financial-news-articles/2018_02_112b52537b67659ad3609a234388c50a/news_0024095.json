Arizona goaltender Antti Raanta recorded 40 saves on 43 shots.\nThe Coyotes entered the game with an emotional boost after overcoming a 3-0 deficit to stun the Minnesota Wild 4-3 in overtime Thursday.\nThe Flyers overcame an early 1-0 deficit to lead 2-1 after the first period and 3-2 after the second.\nDemers opened the scoring for the Coyotes, with just his fourth goal of the season, at 3:53 of the first period. But the Flyers responded with goals from Giroux and Raffl only 1:22 apart midway through the opening stanza, and the 2-1 lead held up after 20 minutes.\nGoligoski evened the score just 24 seconds into the middle frame, but Simmonds put the Flyers ahead 3-2 less than two minutes later.\nRinaldo drew the Coyotes even again at 1:59 of the third period as Max Domi, who has become the subject of trade speculation in only his third NHL season, earned an assist. The Flyers held the Coyotes without a shot in the final 12:40 of regulation time, but could not beat Raanta.\nThe Coyotes goaltender ensured his team’s participation in overtime for the second straight game as he stopped a Simmonds shot with only six seconds left in the third. Raanta forced the shootout by blocking a Sean Couturier backhand with only one second left in overtime.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:12:28.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
