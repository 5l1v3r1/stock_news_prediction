That helped push net imports to the lowest level on record.\nThe Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), the largest privately owned crude terminal in the United States, completed the first very large crude carrier (VLCC) crude oil loading operation at its deepwater port, the company said on Sunday. The supertankers can ship about 2 million barrels of oil.\nOil prices were also supported as the dollar declined from an eight-day peak. A weaker dollar makes oil and other dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.\nThe correlation between moves in the oil price and the dollar has strengthened in recent weeks, as investors increasingly sell other assets to buy the U.S. currency on expectations of a faster pace of rate rises.\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore and Amanda Cooper in London Editing by Marguerita Choy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T22:57:27.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
