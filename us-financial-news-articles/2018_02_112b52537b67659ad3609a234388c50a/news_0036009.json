They were laid during conflicts in the 1980s and 1990s when Afghan mujahideen battled the Soviet Union - and then fought among themselves once the Soviets pulled out in 1989.\nAfghanistan has since signed the 1997 global treaty which bans the use, stockpiling, production or transfer of landmines.\nReporting by Jared Ferrie; Editing by Robert Carmichael and Kieran Guilbert; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, resilliance and climate change.
