I completely get why there has been so much interest and speculation.”\nThe Ruta del Sol starting on Feb. 14 will be Froome’s first competitive appearance since his third-place finish in the time trial at the world championships in Norway last September.\nTeam Principal Dave Brailsford admitted it was a tough situation.\n“We all recognize that these are difficult circumstances but it’s important for all sides that this process is conducted fairly before a final conclusion is reached,” he said.\n“It is a complex situation but we’re working as hard as we can with Chris to resolve things as soon as possible.”\nFroome will line up in the five-day stage race in Andalusia, which he won three years ago, after completing a training stint in South Africa.\n“I have put in a hard training block in January,” Froome said. “It’s been good to be out on my bike and to get the miles under my belt.”\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T13:43:01.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
