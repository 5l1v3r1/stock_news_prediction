Security Council on Saturday, including veto-wielding Russia.\nBut that ceasefire has yet to take effect, and does not apply to some militant groups which Moscow and Damascus say are among the enemies they are fighting in Ghouta.\nRussia has instead promoted temporary truces, beginning with a five-hour ceasefire announced for Tuesday, aimed at opening what Moscow says is a relief route. Tuesday’s ceasefire did not hold, with bombing and shelling resuming after a brief lull.\nMoscow and Damascus blamed the rebels for the failure, accusing them of shelling the humanitarian corridor, which the rebels denied.\nLe Drian said he and Lavrov had held a detailed discussion of how the latest U.N. resolution on Syria could be fully implemented and made it clear he wanted Russia to do more.\n”Russia is one of the only actors that can get the regime to implement the (U.N.) resolution,” Le Drian said.\nHe called the Russian-backed daily five-hour daily truces “a step forward,” but said more was needed and that he wanted to see a special mechanism set up to monitor how and if all sides were respecting the new 30-day ceasefire in the area.\nThree rebels groups in eastern Ghouta had signalled their intention to abide by the ceasefire, Le Drian said. Lavrov said it remained to be seen how sincere the rebel assertions were.\nA French diplomatic source said the short-term ceasefire announced by the Russians was not encouraging.\n“It is not good,“ the source said. ”We aren’t going to do half a ceasefire. It’s the full U.N. resolution that needs to be implemented.”\nAdditional reporting by Maria Tsvetkova; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T18:07:27.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
