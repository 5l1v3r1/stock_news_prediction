Previous winners include Jennifer Lopez, Elizabeth Taylor and Whoopi Goldberg.\nSpears is a longtime supporter of the gay and transgender community, GLAAD said in a statement. She has spoken out against bullying of LGBTQ youth, publicly opposed bills in Texas that would have restricted transgender rights and participated in a musical tribute that honored the victims of the 2016 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando.\nShe has also supported gay marriage, and last year wrote an open “love letter” to the LGBTQ community that read: “Your stories are what inspire me, bring me joy, and make me and my sons strive to be better people.”\nSpears will receive the Vanguard Award at the 29th annual GLAAD Media Awards on April 12 in Beverly Hills, California.\nReporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T18:39:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
