This represents an increase of $776,000, or 17%, year over year. Basic earnings per share were $1.40 as of December 31, 2017, compared to $1.21 for the prior year. Pretax earnings were $9,240,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $6,637,000 in the prior year, an increase of $2,603,000 or 39%.\nNet income for the fourth quarter was $804,000, after a one-time tax expense adjustment of $943,000, compared to $1,159,000 for the same quarter in the prior year, a decrease of $355,000, or -31%. Basic earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.21, compared to $0.31 basic earnings per share reported for the same quarter in the prior year.\nAccording to Bruce Jay, President and Chief Executive Officer, \"The December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act required a one-time, non-cash adjustment to earnings in the fourth quarter. This tax reform reduces the highest federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%, beginning in 2018. When tax changes like this occur, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs) be revalued to reflect the future value of tax benefits. Accordingly, the Company was required to record a one-time expense adjustment of $943,000 to reduce its DTAs. Beginning in 2018, the Company will benefit from substantially lower federal corporate tax rates.\"\nJay continued, \"The material tax-related adjustment makes comparison reporting of operating results more difficult, both quarter over quarter and year over year.\" The following table shows the Company's 2017 year to date performance before and after this one-time DTA adjustment, as compared to 2016 performance:\nBefore DTA Adjustment\nAs Reported\n(Unaudited.

Book value per share was $14.94 at December 31, 2017, compared to $13.60 at the prior year-end, after adjusting for the retroactive effect of the stock dividend declared in December 2017.\nEugene Voiland, Chairman of the Board, stated, \"The Board of Directors is pleased with the solid growth and earnings performance of the Bank during 2017. The Company produced a return on average equity of 11.48% for the year, before the DTA adjustment, and a 9.73% return on equity after the DTA adjustment.\" Mr. Voiland continued, \"In recognition of the excellent performance of the Company, in the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company declared a 5% stock dividend, payable to shareholders of record as of December 15, 2017.\"\nAbout Valley Republic Bancorp and Valley Republic Bank\nValley Republic Bancorp is a bank holding company formed in 2016.
