(NYSE American:ISR), a medical technology company and innovator in seed brachytherapy and medical radioisotope applications for the treatment of prostate, brain, lung, head and neck and gynecological cancers, today announced financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.54 million, a 50% increase compared to revenue of $1.03 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and a 27% increase compared to revenue of $1.21 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The revenue increase was driven by the increasing traction of the Company’s new sales and marketing initiatives launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and the maturation of the new sales team. Prostate brachytherapy represented 86% of total revenue for both second quarter periods. Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $0.53 million compared to a loss of $0.01 million in the three month period ended December 31, 2016 and $0.27 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily due to ongoing cost saving initiatives and reduced staffing costs, including moving certain production personnel to research and development projects. Gross profit margin was 35% in the current period, negative in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and 22% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nTotal operating expenses were $2.0 million compared to $1.48 million in the second quarter of our last fiscal year. Continued investment in research & development and sales & marketing accounted for most of the increase. The increase in general and administrative expense is partially a function of the sales increase, which results in higher share-based compensation and bonus expense. R&D activities include cost increases associated with the collaborative development agreement with GammaTile, LLC, participation in new protocols and new device development. Operating loss was $1.47 million compared to a $1.48 million loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The net loss was $1.46 million, or ($0.03) per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $1.45 million, or ($0.03) per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Basic and diluted per share results are based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 55.0 million for both periods. IsoRay had cash, cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of $5.7 million as of December 31, 2017, and no debt.\n“We believe that IsoRay’s 50% increase in second quarter revenue, the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases, firmly establishes its upward trend and supports our confidence in reiterating guidance for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 for revenue growth of at least 20%, or approximately $5.8 million,” said Thomas LaVoy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IsoRay, Inc. “In the remaining half of the fiscal year, we expect sales to continue to progressively accelerate as current and new accounts increase their use of our brachytherapy products in prostate and other applications. Our ongoing manufacturing and process improvements are also expected to continue to contribute to sustainable gross profit expansion as operating leverage kicks in with the expanding sales base.”\nMr. LaVoy continued, “We’re excited about the study that was published on January 16 th in Cureus* that demonstrates advantages of Cesium-131 over Iodine-125 for brain brachytherapy from a perspective of radiation dose delivery. This is a key addition to the growing number of peer-reviewed published studies supporting the use of Cesium-131 to treat brain tumors and other cancers. These studies also provide additional support for the efforts of our new sales team, which has become increasingly effective in delivering IsoRay’s message of the value of Cesium-131 and providing service and support to our customers and target markets. During the quarter, we signed a 10-year exclusive manufacturing agreement with GT Medical Technologies, Inc., for the manufacture of GammaTile™ products for recurrent brain cancer treatment. We look forward to moving through the 510(k) and NTAP clearance process for this important product and we expect to obtain clearance and a NTAP reimbursement code in mid- 2018.”\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2018 ended December 31, 2017, revenue was $2.75 million, a 30% increase compared to revenue of $2.11 million for the same period of fiscal 2017. Prostate brachytherapy represented 87% of total revenue for the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to 88% for the first half of fiscal 2017. Operating expenses were $3.82 million, a 23% increase compared to $3.10 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Operating loss was $3.02 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a $3.05 million operating loss for the comparable period of fiscal 2017. The net loss for the six-month period was $3.01 million, or $(0.05) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.95 million, or $(0.05), per basic and diluted share, for the six- month period of fiscal 2017. Basic and diluted per share results are based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 55.0 million shares in both periods.\n* Han D Y, Ma L, Braunstein S, et al.
