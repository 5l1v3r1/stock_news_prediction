U.S. benchmark 10-year note yields were last yielding 2.929 percent, after rising to a four-year high of 2.957 percent on Wednesday.\n“U.S. bond yields have fallen and so sentiment is higher,” said Anita Gandhi, whole time director, Arihant Capital Markets.\n“Price correction has happened to a large extent in pharma, so market is looking at some value buying.”\nThe broader NSE index was up 0.71 percent at 10,456.65 as of 0614 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.64 percent higher at 34,035.57.\nBoth indexes were poised to end the week marginally lower.\nThe Nifty Pharma index rose as much as 2.8 percent in its biggest intraday percentage gain since Feb. 8. It had declined about 8 percent since the start of the year, as of Thursday’s close.\nFinancials also gained, with HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank among the biggest contributors to the rise.\nFederal Bank climbed as much as 5.2 percent after the bank on Thursday approved buying a stake in financial services company Equirus Capital.
