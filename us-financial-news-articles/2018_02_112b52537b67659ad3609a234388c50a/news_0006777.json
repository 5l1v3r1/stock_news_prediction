Since Friday, when the selloff in equities began in earnest, the index has gained about 1.1 percent.\nEmerging Asian currencies retreated, with the Indonesian rupiah touching a three-month low of 13,605 per dollar at one point.\nAnalysts at Maybank Kim Eng said Asian markets will probably show more resilience against the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, compared to the “taper tantrum” episode in 2013.\n“The global growth backdrop has changed, as 2013 was still a ‘divergent’ world when Asia export growth was weak,” they said in a research note, adding that countries like Thailand have seen a sharp improvement in the current account balance since then.\nThe U.S. currency was on the back foot as recently as of late January, when the dollar index fell to a three-year trough of 88.438, hurt by a range of factors including concerns about U.S. trade protectionism and perceptions of narrowing yield advantage.\nIt caught a break, however, lifted by Friday’s robust U.S. employment report and the punishing sell-off in the recently bullish global equity markets.\n“We are seeing a big rewinding of positions that had been built up since the start of the year, such as euro longs,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\n“The stock market plunge caused by the jump in yields has been the trigger. Investors hurting from the drop in equities are seen trying to limit their losses by selling recently bullish currencies like the euro, which in turn supports the dollar.”\nThe euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2384, regaining a bit of footing after shedding 0.7 percent on Monday.\nEquities remained under pressure on Tuesday, with markets in Asia taking a battering, while U.S. S&P futures tumbled by as much as 3 percent to four-month lows. S&P futures later pared their losses and were last down 0.9 percent.\nThat came after the Dow, which rose to a record high late in January, fell 2.5 percent on Friday and plunged 4.6 percent on Monday.\nThe sharp pullback comes amid concerns about higher inflation, sending U.S. 10-year bond yields surging to a four-year top on Monday.\nFriday’s U.S. jobs report was the latest jolt to financial markets, as strong wages growth reinforced the inflation and monetary tightening speculation, with traders betting the Federal Reserve might raise rates at a faster pace than expected this year.\nThe Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.7857, pulling further away from a 2-1/2-year high at $0.8136 set on Jan. 26.\nAustralia’s central bank kept interest rates steady on Tuesday as expected and sounded upbeat about the country’s economy even as global markets went into a tailspin.
