Andrea joins DispatchHealth from Healthgrades where she served in executive roles for more than nine years, most recently as its chief marketing officer. Prior to Healthgrades, Andrea spent 10 years in general management, marketing and product leadership roles. Her experience spans product development, customer acquisition, affinity partnerships, branding, marketing communications and public relations in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer environments.\nIn the newly created role of Senior Vice President of Provider Solutions for DispatchHealth, David will be focused on working with the company's healthcare provider partners such as hospital systems, large specialty practices and emergency medical services to coordinate care processes and ensure appropriate patient care. Previously, David served as vice president of sales at iTriage (now part of Aetna Digital) and held leadership positions at Airstrip, Healthgrades and bConnected (now part of Optum). His career has been focused on improving quality and processes for patient care and strengthening patient and provider engagement.\n\"Andrea and David come to DispatchHealth with impressive track records both in start-up healthcare companies and in partnering with large health systems to create new patient access points that increase convenience and quality, and eliminate unnecessary cost,\" said CEO and co-founder Mark Prather, MD. \"We are thrilled to add their leadership and deep understanding of consumer-driven healthcare as we expand to new markets and pursue new partnerships with payers, health systems and senior communities across the country.\"\nToday's announcement builds on the momentum of DispatchHealth's expansion to five markets, with plans to double its reach in the coming months. Additionally, in December 2017, DispatchHealth won the AARP Foundation/Rock Health 2017 Aging in Place Challenge , a competition for entrepreneurial solutions that help vulnerable, older adults remain in their homes and communities. DispatchHealth achieved this award based on its innovations that reduce unnecessary healthcare services, costs and hospital readmission rates while allowing older adults the opportunity to live independently in their homes.\nPrather added, \"In 2017, DispatchHealth treated more than 10,000 patients in the comfort of their homes, saving an estimated $25 million in unnecessary 911 transports, ER visits and hospitalizations. We are on track to quadruple that impact this year.\"\nAbout DispatchHealth\nDispatchHealth offers consumers on-demand medical care in their homes or place of work, in order to increase quality and convenience and dramatically reduce unnecessary cost.
