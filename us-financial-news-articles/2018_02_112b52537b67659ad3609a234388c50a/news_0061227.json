In October 2016, Chinese logistics company ZTO Express raised $1.41 billion from an IPO in New York.\nNIO, which plans to go public in the second half of the year, declined to comment on its IPO plans. BAML, Citigroup, Goldman and UBS declined comment while the other banks did not respond to Reuters emailed request for comment.\nAlthough China's auto market slowed sharply in 2017, new energy vehicles have been a bright spot. An industry body said last month new EV sales would likely grow 40 percent this year, topping 1 million vehicles. China's finance ministry will also extend a tax rebate on purchases of NEVs until the end of 2020, a boost for hybrid and electric car makers. Carmakers and investors in China have embarked on a flurry of dealmaking, pumping in billions of dollars into the so-called new energy vehicle sector in the world's biggest auto market.\nChinese carmaker Geely, for instance, has built up an almost 10 percent stake in Daimler (DAIGn.DE) in a $9 billion bet, in a push to access the Mercedes-Benz owners know-how in electric and autonomous cars.\nShanghai-based NIO, formerly known as NextEV, is among the first of a raft of Chinese electric vehicle firms to launch a production vehicle, with many so far only showing concept cars.\nIt launched sales of its first mass production car - the ES8 pure-electric, seven-seat sport-utility vehicle in December, at about half the price of American peer Tesla's Model X. It has also vowed to bring an autonomous electric car to the U.S. market by 2020.\nNIO counts Asian tech behemoth Tencent Holdings Ltd as its main backer alongside investment firms Hillhouse Capital Group and Sequoia Capital.\nLast November, the firm raised more than $1 billion in its latest fundraising round, led by existing investor Tencent, valuing the firm at about $5 billion.
