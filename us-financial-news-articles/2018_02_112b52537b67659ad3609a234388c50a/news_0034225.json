We were really touched. I had no words,” Guido Huwiler, 55, told Reuters Television.\nHuwiler, who sported a long bushy beard, and Rita Ruttimann, 57, said cycling every day was difficult.\nTheir toughest challenge was traveling the Pamir Highway which can reach more that 4,000 metres in height as it crosses several countries in Central Asia.\nGuido Huwiler and his wife Rita Ruettimann stand with their bikes before an interview with Reuters in Pyeongchang, South Korea, February 15, 2018.

We were finished and had to recover for two to three weeks,” he said.\nWhen they reached the Chinese border, Huwiler said he was refused a visa because of his beard. He refused to cut it but they are hoping to travel through China later in the journey.\nSlideshow (3 Images) In South Korea, the couple camped outdoors in sub-zero temperatures en route to Pyeongchang’s Phoenix Park, the venue for Gasser’s freestyle skiing event.\nHuwiler said his 26-year-old son had dreamed of competing in the Olympics since he was four or five years old.\n“I think it’s most important that he lives his dream and I just wish to be close to him when he gets this moment,” Huwiler said.\nAfter cheering on Gasser, the cyclists will continue through South Korea before flying to Japan. From there they plan to return to Switzerland to get visas for China, Russia and Mongolia before resuming their adventure.\n“We are crazy!,” Huwiler said with a laugh.\nAdditional reporting by Hyun Oh, editing by Darren Schuettler and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T13:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T13:57:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
