REUTERS/Danny Moloshok/File Photo “In short, combining two truisms about playas and haters, both well-worn notions as of 2001, is simply not enough,” the judge said in his ruling.\nThe judge left the door open for Hall and Butler to file a revised lawsuit.\nBut Gerard Fox, the attorney for the two songwriters, said he had no intention to file an amended complaint and would instead appeal Fitzgerald’s ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nFitzgerald made a mistake by assessing the originality of the lyrics for himself, instead of relying on experts, Fox said.\n“He cannot make himself an expert in the music industry, I‘m sorry it’s actually embarrassing,” Fox said.\nA representative for Swift did not immediately return a call or email seeking comment.\nHall is a songwriter and producer for artists such as Justin Bieber and Maroon 5, and Butler has worked with artists such as Backstreet Boys and Luther Vandross.\nSwedish producer and songwriter Max Martin and Karl Johan Schuster, another Swede who is known professionally as Shellback, are credited as co-writers, along with Swift, on “Shake It Off.”\nReporting by Alex DobuzinskisEditing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T06:02:11.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
