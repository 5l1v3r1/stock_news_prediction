That’s what I think bitcoin pretty much is,” he said.\n$1 = 1.2667 Canadian dollars Reporting By Allison Lampert and Matt Scuffham; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:02:47.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
