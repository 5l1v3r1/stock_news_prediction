Petr Mrazek stopped Tomas Hertl’s backhand try to end the shootout.\nTrevor Daley scored in regulation for Detroit, which had lost six of its last eight. Mrazek, who recorded shutouts in the Wings’ previous two victories, stopped 30 shots. Frans Nielsen assisted on Daley’s fourth goal of the season.\nKevin Labanc scored the lone goal for the Sharks, who have lost four straight. Brenden Dillon and Hertl recorded assists, while Martin Jones made 43 saves. Joe Pavelski, Logan Couture and Chris Tierney beat Mrazek in the shootout.\nDetroit had a season-high 44 shots on goal, compared to 31 for San Jose.\nThe Red Wings were awarded a power play with 2:43 left in overtime when Brett Burns was called for hooking Dylan Larkin. However, Detroit couldn’t put the puck past Jones despite a 7-0 advantage in shots on goal during the overtime session.\nBoth goals were scored in the third period.\nNielsen fed the puck to Daley along the right side while the Sharks were making a line change. Daley skated in and his shot trickled past Jones’ pads and into the net at 6:48 of the period. Daley had missed the previous three games with a lower-body injury.\nLabanc tied it with 4:59 remaining with a shot from the point that snuck over Mrazek’s shoulder and inside the crossbar.\nDetroit had a 12-11 edge in shots on goal during the first period.\nThe Red Wings put even more pressure on Jones in the second period to no avail, outshooting the Sharks 13-9. Mrazek was sharp, too, as he made a nifty glove save on Burns with just over a minute to go in the period. Burns had eight shots on goal in the first two periods, nine for the game.\nThis was the first meeting between the teams this season. The Sharks will host the Red Wings on March 12.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T12:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:08:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
