(1) As part of the acquisition, New Residential purchased and settled on approximately $8 billion UPB of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac MSRs from Shellpoint in January 2018. The corporate acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2018, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and certain third party consents and satisfaction of certain other closing conditions. Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSRs”) - During and subsequent to fourth quarter 2017, New Residential acquired or agreed to acquire MSRs totaling approximately $32 billion UPB for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $307 million. In addition, to further enhance liquidity, NRZ priced two fixed rate MSR notes in January and February 2018, totaling $930 million, at a weighted average cost of funds of ~3.6%. In January 2018, as part of the Company’s previously announced MSR transfer agreement with Ocwen Financial Corporation (“Ocwen”) (2) , New Residential paid Ocwen an approximately $280 million restructuring fee to obtain the remaining rights to MSRs on the legacy Non-Agency MSR portfolio totaling $87 billion UPB. (3) Under the New RMSR Agreement, Ocwen will transfer the remaining $87 billion UPB Non-Agency MSRs (3) to New Residential. Non-Agency Securities & Call Rights - During the fourth quarter, New Residential continued to accelerate the execution around its deal collapse strategy by executing clean-up calls on 36 seasoned, Non-Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) deals with an aggregate UPB of approximately $1 billion. In addition, subsequent to the fourth quarter, New Residential completed a $727 million Non-Agency loan securitization. In the fourth quarter, New Residential continued to strategically invest in Non-Agency securities that are expected to be accretive to the Company’s call rights strategy. New Residential purchased $882 million face value of Non-Agency RMBS, bringing net equity to approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2017. Servicer Advances - New Residential continued to focus on lowering advance balances during the quarter. Advances declined to $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down approximately 31% year-over-year.\n(1)\nShellpoint total purchase price is subject to certain adjustments, plus potential additional consideration pursuant to a three-year earnout based on the performance of Shellpoint after closing.\n(2)\nIn July 2017, New Residential and Ocwen signed definitive agreements for the transfer of Ocwen’s interest in MSRs and subservicing relating to approximately $110 billion UPB (balance as of June 30, 2017) of Non-Agency MSRs. In January 2018, New Residential and Ocwen entered into new agreements (“New RMSR Agreement”), which accelerated certain parts of the July 2017 agreements, including, but not limited to, lump sum payments made by New Residential to Ocwen while the companies continue to obtain the third party consents necessary to transfer the MSRs from Ocwen to New Residential.\n(3)\nIn the third quarter of 2017, New Residential paid Ocwen $55 million in restructuring fees for approximately $16 billion UPB of MSRs. Total portfolio UPB decreased from $110 billion to $87 billion prior to entering into the New RMSR Agreement as a result of amortization and the transfer of such MSRs.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nFor additional information that management believes to be useful for investors, please refer to the latest presentation posted on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website, www.newresi.com .

3,468,177 $ 22,213,562 $ 18,399,529 NON-GAAP MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP NET INCOME\nNew Residential has four primary variables that impact its operating performance: (i) the current yield earned on the Company’s investments, (ii) the interest expense under the debt incurred to finance the Company’s investments, (iii) the Company’s operating expenses and taxes and (iv) the Company’s realized and unrealized gains or losses, including any impairment, on the Company’s investments. “Core earnings” is a non-GAAP measure of the Company’s operating performance, excluding the fourth variable above and adjusts the earnings from the consumer loan investment to a level yield basis. Core earnings is used by management to evaluate the Company’s performance without taking into account: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses, which although they represent a part of the Company’s recurring operations, are subject to significant variability and are generally limited to a potential indicator of future economic performance; (ii) incentive compensation paid to the Company’s manager; (iii) non-capitalized transaction-related expenses; and (iv) deferred taxes, which are not representative of current operations.\nThe Company’s definition of core earnings includes accretion on held-for-sale loans as if they continued to be held-for-investment. Although the Company intends to sell such loans, there is no guarantee that such loans will be sold or that they will be sold within any expected timeframe. During the period prior to sale, the Company continues to receive cash flows from such loans and believes that it is appropriate to record a yield thereon. In addition, the Company’s definition of core earnings excludes all deferred taxes, rather than just deferred taxes related to unrealized gains or losses, because the Company believes deferred taxes are not representative of current operations. The Company’s definition of core earnings also limits accreted interest income on RMBS where the Company receives par upon the exercise of associated call rights based on the estimated value of the underlying collateral, net of related costs including advances. The Company created this limit in order to be able to accrete to the lower of par or the net value of the underlying collateral, in instances where the net value of the underlying collateral is lower than par. The Company believes this amount represents the amount of accretion the Company would have expected to earn on such bonds had the call rights not been exercised.\nThe Company’s investments in consumer loans are accounted for under ASC No. 310-20 and ASC No. 310-30, including certain non-performing consumer loans with revolving privileges that are explicitly excluded from being accounted for under ASC No. 310-30. Under ASC No. 310-20, the recognition of expected losses on these non-performing consumer loans is delayed in comparison to the level yield methodology under ASC No. 310-30, which recognizes income based on an expected cash flow model reflecting an investment’s lifetime expected losses. The purpose of the core earnings adjustment to adjust consumer loans to a level yield is to present income recognition across the consumer loan portfolio in the manner in which it is economically earned, avoid potential delays in loss recognition, and align it with the Company’s overall portfolio of mortgage-related assets which generally record income on a level yield basis. With respect to consumer loans classified as held-for-sale, the level yield is computed through the expected sale date. With respect to the gains recorded under GAAP in 2014 and 2016 as a result of a refinancing of the debt related to the Company’s investments in consumer loans, and the consolidation of entities that own the Company’s investments in consumer loans, respectively, the Company continues to record a level yield on those assets based on their original purchase price.\nWhile incentive compensation paid to the Company’s manager may be a material operating expense, the Company excludes it from core earnings because (i) from time to time, a component of the computation of this expense will relate to items (such as gains or losses) that are excluded from core earnings, and (ii) it is impractical to determine the portion of the expense related to core earnings and non-core earnings, and the type of earnings (loss) that created an excess (deficit) above or below, as applicable, the incentive compensation threshold. To illustrate why it is impractical to determine the portion of incentive compensation expense that should be allocated to core earnings, the Company notes that, as an example, in a given period, it may have core earnings in excess of the incentive compensation threshold but incur losses (which are excluded from core earnings) that reduce total earnings below the incentive compensation threshold. In such case, the Company would either need to (a) allocate zero incentive compensation expense to core earnings, even though core earnings exceeded the incentive compensation threshold, or (b) assign a “pro forma” amount of incentive compensation expense to core earnings, even though no incentive compensation was actually incurred. The Company believes that neither of these allocation methodologies achieves a logical result. Accordingly, the exclusion of incentive compensation facilitates comparability between periods and avoids the distortion to the Company’s non-GAAP operating measure that would result from the inclusion of incentive compensation that relates to non-core earnings.\nWith regard to non-capitalized transaction-related expenses, management does not view these costs as part of the Company’s core operations, as they are considered by management to be similar to realized losses incurred at acquisition. Non-capitalized transaction-related expenses are generally legal and valuation service costs, as well as other professional service fees, incurred when the Company acquires certain investments, as well as costs associated with the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses.\nManagement believes that the adjustments to compute “core earnings” specified above allow investors and analysts to readily identify and track the operating performance of the assets that form the core of the Company’s activity, assist in comparing the core operating results between periods, and enable investors to evaluate the Company’s current core performance using the same measure that management uses to operate the business. Management also utilizes core earnings as a measure in its decision-making process relating to improvements to the underlying fundamental operations of the Company’s investments, as well as the allocation of resources between those investments, and management also relies on core earnings as an indicator of the results of such decisions. Core earnings excludes certain recurring items, such as gains and losses (including impairment as well as derivative activities) and non-capitalized transaction-related expenses, because they are not considered by management to be part of the Company’s core operations for the reasons described herein. As such, core earnings is not intended to reflect all of the Company’s activity and should be considered as only one of the factors used by management in assessing the Company’s performance, along with GAAP net income which is inclusive of all of the Company’s activities.\nThe primary differences between core earnings and the measure the Company uses to calculate incentive compensation relate to (i) realized gains and losses (including impairments), (ii) non-capitalized transaction-related expenses and (iii) deferred taxes (other than those related to unrealized gains and losses). Each are excluded from core earnings and included in the Company’s incentive compensation measure (either immediately or through amortization). In addition, the Company’s incentive compensation measure does not include accretion on held-for-sale loans and the timing of recognition of income from consumer loans is different. Unlike core earnings, the Company’s incentive compensation measure is intended to reflect all realized results of operations. The Gain on Remeasurement of Consumer Loans Investment was treated as an unrealized gain for the purposes of calculating incentive compensation and was therefore excluded from such calculation.\nCore earnings does not represent and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, net income or as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flows from operating activities, each as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the Company’s calculation of this measure may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.
