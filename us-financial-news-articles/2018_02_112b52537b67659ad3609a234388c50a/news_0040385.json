The weapon discharged and hit the floor — no injuries were reported.\nIs that a school shooting? By Everytown's definition, that's exactly what it is.\n\"Every time gunfire breaks out on school grounds, it can shatter a child's sense that they are safe in their school and in their community. Tracking each of these incidents is an important way to measure some of the many ways that shootings affect children in this country,\" Sarah Tofte, director of research and implementation at Everytown, told CNBC in an email.\nThe Washington Post challenged this definition in an article published Thursday , saying Everytown had inflated its numbers \"by including incidents of gun fire that were not really school shootings.\"\nThe Post pointed to one incident in particular. On Jan. 3, a 31-year-old man committed suicide outside of an elementary school in Michigan. Everytown counted the suicide as a school shooting. The elementary school, however, had been closed since June – seven months. No children or teachers were present at the closed school.\nAfter the Post published its piece, Everytown removed the Jan. 3 suicide from its tally of school shootings.\nHere is a list of all 18 shootings included in Everytown's original tally, ranked from most to least severe:\nFeb. 14, 2018 - Parkland, Florida\nA 19-year-old former student entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and opened fire, killing 17 and injuring multiple others.
