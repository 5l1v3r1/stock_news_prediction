Through the series they know that that bowler is always going to come straight on when they come out to bat and it’s a bit of extra pressure, you just know you’ve got the wood on them.”\nThe 34-year-old Amla, seventh in the world test batting rankings, will be playing in his 114th test.\nHe scored three 50s in January’s three-test series against India but was dismissed cheaply in his other three innings.\nHazlewood, 27, took 21 wickets to help Australia regain the Ashes with a 4-0 home series win over England.\nReporting by Mark Gleeson, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T16:24:21.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
