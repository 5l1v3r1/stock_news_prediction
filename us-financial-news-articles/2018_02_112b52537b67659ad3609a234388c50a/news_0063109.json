Following his remarks, markets started pricing in a one-in-three chance of a fourth U.S. rate hike this year, potentially ramping up pressure on global borrowing rates.\nMSCI’s emerging market benchmark fell more than 1 percent and is on track for a more than 4 percent fall on the month, its steepest such tumble since November 2016. Chinese stocks suffered some of the steepest falls, with the mainland blue-chip index down 1 percent while Hong Kong’s bourse fell 1.4 percent.\n“Global reflation is emerging as the core theme for 2018, particularly as we see a continued synchronised global recovery,” said Andrew Swan, Head of Asian and Emerging Markets Equities at BlackRock in a note to clients.\n“The pace of the U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes and scope for renewed dollar strength has caused some volatility across markets recently.”\nEmerging currencies were mixed as the dollar strengthened for a second straight session.\nSouth Africa’s rand looked on track for a fourth straight month of gains, set to end February 1.5 percent up against the dollar after Cyril Ramaphosa took over as president of Africa’s most industrialised nation.\nHowever, S&P Global Ratings slashing the credit rating of state-run power utility Eskom deeper into junk, citing liquidity concerns and insufficient government support that could trigger a default, showing the country was still facing big challenges. Dollar-denominated Eskom bonds fell across the curve.\nRussia’s rouble struggled to make gains on the day thanks to lower oil prices but was on track for its second month of gains.\nMeanwhile China’s yuan weakened against the greenback and was on track for a loss in February - snapping a four month winning streak.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) (Reporting by Karin Strohecker Editing by Peter Graff)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T12:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:47:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
