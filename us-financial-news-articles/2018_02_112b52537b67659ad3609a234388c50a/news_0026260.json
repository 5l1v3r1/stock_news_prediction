The project is designed to accommodate growing traffic in a major hub.\nUnder President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey has built high-speed railways, suspension bridges and undersea tunnels to boost the construction industry and domestic demand.\nThe airport is among Turkey’s mega-projects which include a third bridge across the Bosphorus that opened in 2016 and plans to build a huge canal in Istanbul that would render a large chunk of the city an island.\nIncoming flights will be directed to the new airport from the existing Ataturk Airport as soon as the new one opens, the agency Quote: d Arslan saying. The transition to the new site will be completed in 48 hours.\nThe airport will be large enough for 114 planes to dock at the same time, the minister told Anadolu, adding that it would employ 225,000 people when fully operational.\nArslan said around $10.2 billion was invested in the project and that it would generate around $22.2 billion in 25 years before value added tax.\nIstanbul’s Ataturk Airport is among Europe’s five busiest airports, recovering in 2017 from a downturn in passenger traffic the previous year. It will be closed after the new airport opens.\nIstanbul is a major hub for transit flights, attracting lucrative transfer traffic this year from major airports in the Gulf as Turkey recovers from security worries, according to travel data analysis company Forward Keys.
