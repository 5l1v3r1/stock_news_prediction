New England Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady holds the Vince Lombardi trophy after defeating the Atlanta Falcons, winning his fifth Super Bowl title, at Super Bowl LI in Houston, 2017.

The economy is doing good and that’s going to help.” \nAside from more traditional bets, gamblers can take a chance on proposition bets, like deciding which team will score first, whether a player will leave the game with a concussion and what colour liquid will be poured on the winning coach. \nAmong some of the more unique proposition bets are how many times U.S. President Donald Trump will tweet during the game, how long Pink will take to sing the national anthem and how many times Brady’s supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen will be shown during the live broadcast.
