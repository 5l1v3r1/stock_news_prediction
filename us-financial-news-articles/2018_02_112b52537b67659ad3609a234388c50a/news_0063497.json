There is absolutely no justification for South Korea to criticise China on the basis of a so-called ADIZ,” Lu told a daily news briefing.\nA Chinese military aircraft entered the KADIZ on Jan. 29, while two similar instances were observed in 2017.\nReporting by Christine Kim, Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING, Editing by Michael Perry and Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T04:46:05.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
