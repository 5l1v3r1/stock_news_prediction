Federal officials contend they have always had the authority to deport them.\nFederal courts do not have direct authority over immigration matters. But over the Justice Department’s objections, Saris in October ruled that she had jurisdiction.\nTheir cause has drawn the support of New Hampshire’s all-Democratic congressional delegation, including U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, and Republican Governor Chris Sununu.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Scott Malone and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T00:16:57.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
