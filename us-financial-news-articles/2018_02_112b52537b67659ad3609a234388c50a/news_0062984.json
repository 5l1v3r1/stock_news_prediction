Jabari Parker finished with 19 off the bench while Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe added 17 apiece.\nFrom the opening tip, Milwaukee look destined to lose its second straight game -- in humiliating fashion.\nThe Bucks missed their first six shots while Washington raced out to a 14-0 lead and after hitting six of 10 3-pointers in the opening half, led 64-50 at the break.\nThe lone bright spot for the Bucks were Parker -- who scored 14 points in 11 minutes of work in the half -- and Antetokounmpo who also had 14 in the half and added six assists, five rebounds, two steals and a pair of blocks.\nMilwaukee stormed back into the game with a strong third quarter. The Bucks outscored Washington 31-20 and thanks to Jason Terry’s 3-pointer and a block by Antetokounmpo, Washington led by just three.\nAn Antetokounmpo lay-in made it a one-point game with 9:47 to play.\nWashington recovered and stretched its lead back to three on a step-back jumper from Beal with 7:07 remaining. The Bucks got back within a point on a tip-in from Antetokounmpo but missed a chance to take their first lead of the night when Bledsoe missed a 3-point try from the corner and Middleton’s jumper from the top of the key fell short with 5:44 left.\nKelly Oubre Jr. converted a three-point play to put the Wizards up six with 4:53 left only for the Bucks to answer again, this time with a 3-pointer from Tony Snell and a two-footer from John Henson, making it a 99-98 game with 3:37 left.\nThe Bucks would get no closer than that, though. Beal beat the shot clock with a 3-pointer to put the Wizards up five, and after Middleton’s three-point play with 50 seconds left, Antetokounmpo missed a 13-footer that could have tied the game.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:54:58.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
