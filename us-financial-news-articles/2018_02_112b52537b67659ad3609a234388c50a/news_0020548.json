Slideshow (19 Images) \nThe hosts were in cruise control after 26 minutes, however, when Moussa Sissoko’s drilled cross deflected cruelly off Butler’s heel and wrong-footed keeper Joe Day on its way into the Newport net. \nThe lead was doubled eight minutes later when Lamela scored his first Tottenham goal since September, 2016, the Argentine showing quick feet before slipping his finish through the legs of Day having been played in by Son Heung-min. \nTottenham, who missed several chances in the second half with Fernando Llorente, substitute Dele Alli and Lamela all guilty of wasting opportunities, will travel to third-tier Rochdale in the last 16.
