It cut the interest rate on the 28-day Lebac, the shortest-term security on offer, to 26.75 percent, down from 27.24 percent last month.\nThe central bank is targeting inflation of 15 percent this year, up from a prior target range of 8-12 percent but below economists’ expectations for 19.4 percent inflation.\nThe central bank no longer considers the short-term Lebac yield as its benchmark interest rate, turning instead to the seven-day interbank lending rate in 2017. It held that rate at 27.25 percent last week, after reducing it in each of its prior two decisions.
