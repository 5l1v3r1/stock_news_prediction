Amazon Business, the company’s business-to-business marketplace already sells professional medical products and hospital consumables such as gloves.\nAmazon plans to expand the business, the WSJ reported on Tuesday, and recently dispatched employees to a large Midwestern hospital system, where hospital officials are testing whether they can use Amazon Business to order health-care supplies.\nThe news pushed down shares of dental supply companies Henry Schein Inc and Patterson Cos Inc. Shares of drug distributors Mckesson Corp and Cardinal Health were lower as well.\nReporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh, Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T17:36:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
