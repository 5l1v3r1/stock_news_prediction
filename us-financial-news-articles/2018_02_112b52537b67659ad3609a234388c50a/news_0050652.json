By that measure, analysts expected a loss of 30 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nProduction rose 8 percent to 128,050 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nFor 2018, Whiting plans to spend $750 million and pump 128,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, in what would be a 9 percent increase over the average daily production in 2017. Most of that growth should come in North Dakota, the company said.\nWhiting has 70 percent of its 2018 production hedged.\n“Looking forward, we will work together to achieve our goal of becoming a top-tier exploration and production company as measured by capital efficient growth and free cash flow generation,” Brad Holly, Whiting’s chief executive, said in a statement.\nShares of Whiting rose 1.2 percent to $22.57 in after-hours trading.\nWhiting executives plan to discuss the quarterly results on a conference call with investors on Thursday morning.\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder; editing by Grant McCool and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T18:03:05.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
