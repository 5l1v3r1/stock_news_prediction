The adjustment reduced earnings per share from continuing operations by 3 cents per share in the fourth quarter and 2 cents per share for the full year.\nThe sweeping tax code changes enacted in late December cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, meaning that U.S.-based corporations with the highest rates like banks would benefit in the longer term.\nMorgan Stanley expects its overall tax rate from continuing operations this year to be 22 to 25 percent, depending on where its earnings come from globally.\nThe bank’s board also decided to change the amount of long-term stock awards executives were awarded in prior years because of the way tax code changes affected the performance targets they had to hit.\nAlthough the new law is expected to boost future corporate earnings, big Wall Street banks took large one-time earnings hits last year related to deferred tax assets and earnings stored overseas.\nReporting by Catherine Ngai; editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:34:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
