European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s appearance in the European Parliament on Monday and euro zone inflation data due later this week also add to a nervous outlook for euro trading.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, eased 0.2 percent to 89.685. It gained nearly 0.9 percent last week and pulled away from a three-year low near 88.25 set on Feb. 16.\nA view that the dollar’s sell-off had been overdone, plus minutes from the Fed’s January rate-setting meeting that offered a relatively upbeat tone, helped give the dollar a lift last week.\nPOWELL‘S TESTIMONY\nThe focus this week is Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s first congressional testimony on monetary policy and the economy.\nSatoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore, said the dollar was weighed down by a drop in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield eased a tad in Monday’s Asian trade to 2.866 percent, continuing a slip from the four-year high of 2.957 percent reached on Wednesday.\n“He (Powell) probably doesn’t need to project any dovish image. But at a time when share prices have been unstable, he also doesn’t need to say anything that sounds especially hawkish on interest rates,” Okagawa said.\nThe dollar fell 0.1 percent versus the yen to 106.65 and erasing some of its earlier losses in Asian trading.\nWhile stock markets started the week on a solid footing and pointed to strong risk appetite, futures data suggested foreign exchange investors were cutting their risk exposures, albeit from high levels.\nPositions in risk-related foreign exchanges, particularly sterling and the Canadian dollar, fell, according to the data.\nAdditional reporting by Masayuki Kitano in SINGAPORE; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T08:54:23.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
