Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said.\nBlankenship, who took the reins on Jan. 15 with support from activist investor Elliott Management, said he was not prepared to comment on the 2019 cash flow goal of $700 million and that investors would have to “wait” till the year-end.\nArconic said its 2018 free cash flow, a measure of how much cash a business generates after accounting for capital expenditures, is expected to be about $500 million, below analysts’ estimate of $534 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nArconic said its capital expenditure would increase about 17 percent to $700 million.\nBlankenship, a former General Electric ( GE.N ) veteran, said the company “will look at everything” during the portfolio review without elaborating. The company expects the review to be completed by the year-end.\nArconic said it expects 2018 earnings of $1.45 to $1.55 per share and a tax rate of 27 percent to 29 percent. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.60 per share and a tax rate of 28.4 percent.\nSales rose 10 percent to $3.27 billion in the fourth quarter, ahead of expectation of $3.09 billion.\nExcluding one-time items, Arconic earned 31 cents per share, topping analysts’ estimate of 24 cents.\nArconic said it will move out of its New York City headquarters to a more cost-effective location and also announced a share buyback of up to $500 million.\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T15:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T15:32:15.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
