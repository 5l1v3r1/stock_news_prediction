The deal will be done via a preferential share allotment.\nSingtel has assembled a portfolio of stakes in regional mobile firms outside its small home market, and overseas businesses now account for about 75 percent of its core earnings.\nReporting by Aradhana AravindanEditing by Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T06:12:14.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
