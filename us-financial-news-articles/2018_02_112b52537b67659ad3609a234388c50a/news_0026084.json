Anthony Cowan added 16 points and seven rebounds, and Darryl Morsell had 14 points and a team-high nine rebounds.\nThe Wildcats (15-11, 6-7) had upset 20th-ranked Michigan in their last outing and had won four of their last five contests coming in but couldn’t match the Terrapins’ torrid shooting pace. Scottie Lindsey had 20 points but Northwestern managed just 33 percent shooting (19 of 57) as a team.\nMaryland led 36-29 at the half after connecting on 13 of 25 shots overall, and 7 of 14 beyond the arc. The Terrapins shot out to a 17-8 lead, hitting their first six shots, including three 3-pointers from Huerter, who had 16 points in the first 20 minutes.\nMaryland eventually led by 16 (32-16) at 5:47 on a Cowan jumper, but Northwestern closed strong, going on a 13-2 run, led by Lindsey. His 3-pointer at 42 seconds brought the Wildcats within 34-29. He had 15 of Northwestern’s 29 points at the half and the Wildcats hit five of their last eight shots after a 6-for-23 start from the field.\nThe Terrapins scored the first seven points of the second half and never let the Wildcats get closer than seven points the rest of the way, Maryland leading by as many as 21 points at 3:49.\nMaryland finished 9-of-21 shooting from 3-point range and hit 10 of 11 free throws. Dion Wiley was a fourth Terp in double figures with 10 points.\nCenter Dererk Pardon finished with 12 points and eight rebounds for Northwestern.\nBoth teams return to action Tuesday, Maryland traveling to Nebraska and Northwestern at Rutgers.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:09:25.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
