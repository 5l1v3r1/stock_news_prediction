We needed this after that tough loss last night to Orlando,” James continued. Slideshow (12 Images) \n“They (Minnesota) shot 58 percent from the field and we were still able to get a win. We played Cavaliers basketball tonight and that’s all you could ask.” \nThe win lifted the Cavaliers to 31-22, seven games behind the East-leading Boston Celtics. \nThe Cavaliers have struggled this season after making the NBA finals for the past three years, beating the Golden State Warriors once and losing to the same team the other two times.
