Each time, the increases went beyond expectations, shaking investors’ confidence in company forecasts and management.\nThe Auckland project is a convention centre and hotel being built for casino operator Sky City Entertainment Group.\nThat project has been delayed by six months until mid-2019, but SkyCity CEO Graeme Stephens has said there is no indication Fletcher’s troubles will further delay completion.\nThe firm is due to report results for six months ended December on Feb. 21, the first under new CEO Ross Taylor, who took over in November after Mark Adamson stepped down in July.\nIt had reported a larger-than-expected drop in its profits for fiscal 2017.
