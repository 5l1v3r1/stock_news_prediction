It was also the lowest since November 2016.\nThe preliminary numbers also showed that EU-harmonised prices rose by 0.5 percent compared to January. This undershot a 0.6 percent rise expected by analysts.\nInflation figures from Europe’s largest economy are closely watched because of their influence on the European Central Bank’s monetary policy.
