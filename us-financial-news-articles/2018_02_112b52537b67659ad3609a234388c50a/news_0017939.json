(referred to as Great Lakes throughout this press release) from Great Lakes Higher Education Corporation. Nelnet paid $150.0 million in cash for 100 percent of the stock of Great Lakes, following the satisfaction of all required closing conditions.\nHeadquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, Great Lakes has approximately 1,800 employees and previously served as Great Lakes Higher Education Corporation & Affiliates' technology provider and student loan servicing company. As of December 31, 2017, Great Lakes was servicing $224.4 billion in government-owned student loans for 7.5 million borrowers, $10.7 billion in Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans for almost 479,000 borrowers, and $8.5 billion in private or consumer loans for over 415,000 borrowers.\n\"We are excited to welcome the Great Lakes team into the Nelnet family,\" said Jeff Noordhoek, chief executive officer of Nelnet. \"We now have the incredible opportunity to transform student loan servicing for millions of borrowers and make a lasting impact on their financial lives. With 90 years of collective experience and values focused on providing superior customer service for borrowers, it's a mission for which Nelnet and Great Lakes are prepared. It is now up to us to execute together our plans for further enhanced borrower experiences.\"\nIn 2009, Great Lakes and Nelnet were awarded contracts to service government-owned student loans on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education (Department). These contracts are scheduled to expire in June 2019.\nGoing forward, Great Lakes and Nelnet will continue to service their respective government-owned portfolios on behalf of the Department, while maintaining their distinct brands, independent servicing operations, and teams. Likewise, each entity will continue to compete for new student loan volume under its respective existing contract with the Department. Nelnet will integrate technology, as well as shared services and other activities, to become more efficient and effective in meeting borrower needs.\nNelnet and Great Lakes have also been working together for almost two years to develop a new, state-of-the-art servicing system for government-owned student loans through a joint venture. The servicing platform under development will utilize modern technology to effectively scale for additional volume, protect customer information, and support enhanced borrower experience initiatives. The efficiencies gained by leveraging a single platform for government-owned loans supporting millions more borrowers will give Great Lakes and Nelnet opportunities to invest in strategies to further enhance borrower experiences.\nUpon completion of the transaction, the combined company will service $455 billion of student loans for 16.2 million borrowers, including $397 billion in government-owned student loans for 13.4 million borrowers, $38 billion in FFEL Program loans for 1.9 million borrowers, and $20 billion in private or consumer loans for almost 918,000 borrowers. During 2017, Great Lakes recognized approximately $230 million in servicing revenue. Nelnet expects the transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nInformation contained in this press release, other than historical information, may be considered forward-looking in nature and is subject to various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.
