(NYSE: DRI) today announced the final results as of 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on February 21, 2018 (the \"Expiration Date\") for its previously announced cash tender offers (each, an \"Offer\" and collectively, the \"Offers\") to purchase any and all of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2035 (the \"2035 Notes\") and 6.800% Senior Notes due 2037 (the \"2037 Notes\" and, together with the 2035 Notes, the \"Notes\").\nIn conjunction with the Offers, Darden also announced the final results for its previously announced solicitations (each, a \"Consent Solicitation\" and collectively, the \"Consent Solicitations\") of consents (the \"Consents\") to amend certain provisions of the indenture under which the Notes were issued (the \"Proposed Amendments\"). The Offers and the Consent Solicitations were made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in its Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated January 24, 2018 (the \"Offer to Purchase\"), and the related Consent and Letter of Transmittal.\nThe principal amount of each series of Notes that was validly tendered (with Consents validly delivered) at or prior to the Expiration Date and not validly withdrawn (or Consents revoked) is set forth in the column entitled \"Aggregate Principal Amount Tendered\" in the table below. The consideration being offered for such Notes accepted for purchase in the Offers is also set forth below:\nTitle of Securities and\nCUSIP Numbers\nPrincipal Amount Outstanding\nAggregate\nPrincipal Amount\nTendered\nPercent of Amount\nOutstanding\nTendered\nTotal\nConsideration (1)(2)\n6.000% Senior Notes due 2035\n(CUSIP No. 237194AE5)\n$150,000,000\n$53,707,000\n35.80%\n$1,207.13\n6.800% Senior Notes due 2037\n(CUSIP No. 237194AH8)\n$300,000,000\n$257,234,000\n85.74%\n$1,336.99\n(1)\nPer $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered and accepted for purchase. Holders will also receive accrued interest on Notes accepted for purchase up to, but excluding, the Final Settlement Date (defined below).\n(2)\nThe Total Consideration for both series of Notes, as determined by the Dealer Manager (which was determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase) as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on February 6, 2018, includes the Early Tender Payment (defined below).\nHolders who validly tendered and did not validly withdraw their Notes accepted for purchase, and who validly delivered and did not validly revoke their Consents at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 9, 2018 (the \"Extended Early Tender Date\") will receive the applicable Total Consideration (which was determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase), which includes an early tender payment of $50.00 per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes accepted for purchase (the \"Early Tender Payment\"). Holders who validly tendered and did not validly withdraw their Notes accepted for purchase, and who validly delivered and did not validly revoke their Consents after the Extended Early Tender Date and at or before the Expiration Date will receive only the applicable Tender Offer Consideration per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equal to the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment. Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on their purchased Notes from the last interest payment date for such Notes to, but not including, the Final Settlement Date (defined below).\nIt is currently expected that Darden will purchase all Notes that have been validly tendered (with Consents that have been validly delivered) and not validly withdrawn (or Consents revoked) at or prior to the Expiration Date, subject to all conditions to the Offers and the Consent Solicitations having been satisfied or waived by Darden, later today (the \"Final Settlement Date\").\nIn addition, the requisite consents to effect the Proposed Amendments for the 2037 Notes, as described in the Offer to Purchase, have been received. Accordingly, Darden executed and delivered a supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the 2037 Notes, amending certain provisions that, among other things, (i) eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and events of default, (ii) modify notice requirements for redemption and (iii) modify certain other provisions with respect to the 2037 Notes.\nThe obligation to accept for purchase, and to pay for, Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn (with Consents validly delivered and not revoked) pursuant to the Offers and the Consent Solicitations is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Offers, including a financing condition and certain other general conditions described in the Offer to Purchase.\nNo Offer is conditioned on any minimum amount of Notes being tendered, the consummation of the other Offer in respect of the other Series of Notes or obtaining any requisite consent as it relates to the related Consent Solicitation.\nThe complete terms and conditions of the Offers are set forth in the related Offer to Purchase and the Consent and Letter of Transmittal. Holders of the Notes are urged to read the tender offer documents carefully. Notes not tendered and purchased pursuant to the Offers will remain outstanding and be paid in accordance with their terms.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to purchase securities, a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities or a solicitation of consents to amend the related indenture.
