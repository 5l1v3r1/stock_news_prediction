Looks can be deceiving, though.\nWith a week to go before its annual meeting, Qualcomm’s share price closed trading Tuesday at $66.34. That is 16% below Broadcom’s current offer of $79 a share. Broadcom trimmed its unsolicited bid price from $82 last week after Qualcomm raised its own takeover price for NXP Semiconductor, which Broadcom criticized as a “transfer of value” out of the company. Adjusted for splits, Qualcomm’s shares haven’t traded above $82 since 1999.\nThat would appear to set up a simple choice for Qualcomm’s shareholders, who effectively will get a chance to vote on the merger at next week’s meeting. Broadcom has proposed an alternative slate of directors to replace Qualcomm’s current board, which so far has rejected the company’s overtures. The meeting is currently set for March 6.\nBut the choice is hardly that simple. The combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm would create one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies—one with a dominant position in the key technologies that connect devices to wireless networks. As such, the merger would face intense scrutiny from regulators who lately are taking a more critical eye to big mergers.\nThat means eventual passage of the deal is iffy. Its failure could have a deleterious impact to Qualcomm’s licensing business, which generates most of the company’s profits. Broadcom has made no secret of its desire to restructure that business, but it has given little further information as to how it plans to do it. That level of uncertainty probably would impede Qualcomm’s ability to run the operation effectively while the proposed merger works its way through regulatory examination, which is likely to take more than a year.\nMost of Qualcomm’s big shareholders also own sizable stakes in Broadcom, which means they also need to consider how Broadcom will integrate the two very different chip makers if the deal eventually passes regulatory muster. Broadcom’s share price has fallen by 9% since the company announced its unsolicited bid even as the PHLX Semiconductor Index has risen by 4%.\nMuch can still change in a week. Chinese authorities have yet to rule on Qualcomm’s NXP acquisition, the failure of which would significantly alter Qualcomm’s perceived value. And Broadcom could raise its offer again, to a price that could make the substantial gamble worth the risk. But, in a deal with this many obstacles, the right price is elusive.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:53:50.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
