Business Insider reports that the tweet was no longer up by about 7 p.m. E.T. — after an official at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress Action noticed. Earlier this morning, @NRA re-tweeted a tweet from a gun maker encouraging people to buy their loved ones guns for #ValentinesDay \nSince the #schoolshooting in Florida they've deleted that tweet and have gone silent. \nThankfully, I took a screenshot. pic.twitter.com/cC4A835n0a \nThe NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Newsweek reports that Kimber Firearms deleted the tweet. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T22:51:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
