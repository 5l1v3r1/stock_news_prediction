The output gap shows demand exceeds supply by the most in more than nine years. Stock prices are at their highest in 26 years, and corporate profits are near an all-time high.\nReporting by Stanley White; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T03:39:02.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
