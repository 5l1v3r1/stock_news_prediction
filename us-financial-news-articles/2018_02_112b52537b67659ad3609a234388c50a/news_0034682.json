Many of them gave her a standing ovation.\nChoi, who finished sixth with 65.73 points -- a personal best -- said she was surprised and pleased with her score.\n“This was my first Olympics so I was very nervous, but so many people came and cheered for me that I was able to compete and it was a very good experience,” she told reporters.\nFigure Skating – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Team Event Women Single Skating short program – Gangneung Ice Arena - Gangneung, South Korea – February 11, 2018 - Choi Da-bin of South Korea competes. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson “My coach told me to just trust myself and do my best as I practised, so that gave me energy.”\nThe South Korean team did not make the cut to the qualifying round of the team event but Choi has another shot at Olympic glory with the women’s individual skate later in the Games.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Choi won her Olympic berth after a difficult off season in 2017 during which she struggled with foot pain adjusting to new skates, which required considerable tinkering.\nHer mother, who had been ill with cancer for some time, died last June, a month before the first competition that selects South Korean skaters for the Olympics. Choi said at the time that she had contemplated dropping out.\nOn Sunday she said that she had finally adjusted to the shoes.\n“And I am very thankful to my mother, who is watching me from Heaven,” she added.\nReporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:42:41.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
