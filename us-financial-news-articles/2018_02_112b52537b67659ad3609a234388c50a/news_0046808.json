In addition, the Groenland farmers association also released water from their private reservoirs into the Steenbras storage dam.\n“We anticipate that Day Zero could move back into June again once the Groenland transfer has been completed, unless we are able to meet the 450 MLD (million liters per day) collective water usage target,” Neilson said in a statement.\nReporting by Wendell Roelf; Editing by James Macharia\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:19:31.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
