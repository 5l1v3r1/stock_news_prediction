(NYSE:QTWO), a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital banking solutions for community-focused financial institutions, today announced results for its fourth quarter and full year ending Dec. 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of $51.7 million, up 23 percent year-over-year and full-year revenue of $194 million, up 29 percent year-over-year. GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 48.6 percent, down from 49.8 percent one year ago. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 52.7 percent, down from 53.2 percent one year ago. GAAP gross margin for the full year of 48.7 percent, up from 48.5 percent in 2016. Full-year non-GAAP gross margin of 52.5 percent, up from 51.9 percent in 2016. GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of $5.5 million, which compares to a GAAP net loss of $7.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss for the full year of 2017 of $26.2 million, which compares to $36.4 million for the full year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of positive $4.1 million, an improvement from positive $1.3 million one year ago and positive $3.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. Full-year adjusted EBITDA of positive $10.2 million compared to negative $4.5 million in 2016.\n“We had a great finish to 2017 with record bookings in the quarter,” said Matt Flake, CEO of Q2. “We saw a significant increase in activity in the bank market, where an improved economic environment is accelerating banks’ decision-making. With the addition of four Tier 1 banks in the fourth quarter and a solid pipeline entering the year, I believe 2018 should be another strong year for Q2.”\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Highlights\nPosted the largest bookings quarter in company history in the fourth quarter of 2017. Signed a Top 100 credit union and four Tier 1 banks in the fourth quarter, including a $30 billion bank in the Northeast and a $15 billion bank in the Midwest. Signed Acorns, a savings and micro-investment platform with three million customers, for use of the Q2 Open product suite. Exited the fourth quarter with approximately 10.4 million registered users on the Q2 platform, representing 4 percent sequential and 21 percent year-over-year growth.\nFinancial Outlook\nQ2 Holdings is providing guidance for its first quarter 2018 as follows:\nTotal revenue of $52.6 million to $53.2 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 18 percent to 20 percent. Adjusted EBITDA of positive $1.4 million to positive $2 million. GAAP net loss is the most comparable GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA differs from GAAP net loss in that it excludes things such as depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, acquisition-related costs, interest, income taxes and unoccupied lease charges. Q2 Holdings is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Q2 Holdings has not provided guidance for GAAP net loss or a reconciliation of the foregoing forward-looking adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss.\nQ2 Holdings is providing guidance for the full-year 2018 as follows:\nTotal revenue of $234 million to $236 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 21 percent to 22 percent. Adjusted EBITDA of positive $19 million to positive $21 million. Adjusted EBITDA differs from GAAP net loss in that it excludes things such as depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, acquisition-related costs, interest, income taxes and unoccupied lease charges. Q2 Holdings is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Q2 Holdings has not provided guidance for GAAP net loss or a reconciliation of the foregoing forward-looking adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss.\nConference Call Details\nDate:\nFeb. 15, 2018 Time:\n8:30 a.m. EST Hosts:\nMatt Flake, CEO / Jennifer Harris, CFO Dial in:\nUS toll free: 1-833-241-4254 International: 1-647-689-4205 Conference ID:\n8194919 Please join the conference call at least 10 minutes before start time to ensure the line is connected.

We are driven by a mission to build stronger communities by strengthening their financial institutions. Q2 provides the industry’s most comprehensive digital banking platform, enriched through actionable data insights, open development tools and an evolving fintech ecosystem. We help clients elevate the experience, drive efficiency and grow faster. To learn more about Q2, visit www.q2ebanking.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nQ2 uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP gross profit; non-GAAP sales and marketing expense; non-GAAP research and development expense; non-GAAP general and administrative expense; non-GAAP operating loss; and, non-GAAP net loss. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of operating performance because they exclude items that Q2 does not consider indicative of its core performance.\nIn the case of adjusted EBITDA, Q2 adjusts net loss for such things as interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, amortization of technology and intangibles, and unoccupied lease charges. In the case of non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit, Q2 adjusts gross profit and gross margin for stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired technology. In the case of non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, and non-GAAP general and administrative expense, Q2 adjusts the corresponding GAAP expense to exclude stock-based compensation. In the case of non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss, Q2 adjusts operating loss and net loss, respectively, for stock-based compensation, acquisition related-costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangibles, and unoccupied lease charges.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, the closest GAAP measures, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to the closest GAAP measures of these non-GAAP measures is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nQ2’s management uses these non-GAAP measures as measures of operating performance; to prepare Q2’s annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of Q2’s business; to evaluate the effectiveness of Q2’s business strategies; to provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance; to facilitate a comparison of Q2’s results with those of other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and in communication with our board of directors concerning Q2’s financial performance.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements about positive sales and bookings momentum, increased activity in the bank market and the effects of the improved economic environment on banks’ decision-making, optimism about our pipeline and Q2’s performance in 2018, and Q2’s quarterly and annual financial guidance. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based upon Q2’s historical performance and its current plans, estimates and expectations and are not a representation that such plans, estimates or expectations will be achieved. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein include risks related to: (a) the risk of increased competition in its existing markets and as it enters new sections of the market with Tier 1 customers and new products and services; (b) the risk that the market for Q2’s solutions does not grow as anticipated, in particular with respect to Tier 1 customers; (c) the risk that Q2’s increased focus on selling to larger Tier 1 customers may result in greater uncertainty and variability in Q2’s business and sales results; (d) the risk that changes in Q2’s market, business or sales organization negatively impacts its ability to sell its products and services; (e) the challenges and costs associated with selling, implementing and supporting Q2’s solutions, particularly for larger customers with more complex requirements and longer implementation processes; (f) the risk that errors, interruptions or delays in Q2’s products or services or Web hosting negatively impacts Q2’s business and sales; (g) risks associated with data breaches and breaches of security measures within Q2’s products, systems and infrastructure and the resultant harm to Q2’s business and its ability to sell its products and services; (h) the impact that a slowdown in the economy, financial markets, and credit markets has on Q2’s customers and Q2’s business sales cycles, prospects and customers’ spending decisions and timing of implementation decisions, particularly in regions where a significant number of Q2’s customers are concentrated; (i) the difficulties and risks associated with developing and selling complex new solutions and enhancements with the technical and regulatory specifications and functionality required by customers and governmental authorities; (j) the risks inherent in technology and implementation partnerships that could cause harm to Q2’s business; (k) the difficulties and costs Q2 may encounter with complex implementations of its solutions and the resulting impact on reputation and the timing of its revenue from any delayed implementations; (l) the risk that Q2 will not be able to maintain historical contract terms such as pricing and duration; (m) the risks associated with managing growth and the challenges associated with improving operations and hiring, retaining and motivating employees to support such growth; (n) the risk that modifications or negotiations of contractual arrangements will be necessary during Q2’s implementations of its solutions or the general risks associated with the complexity of Q2’s customer arrangements; (o) the risks associated with integrating acquired companies and successfully selling and maintaining their solutions; (p) litigation related to intellectual property and other matters and any related claims, negotiations and settlements; and (q) the risks associated with further consolidation in the financial services industry.\nAdditional information relating to the uncertainty affecting the Q2 business are contained in Q2’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Services section of Q2’s website at http://investors.q2ebanking.com/ .
