This comes about a month after Chief Executive Domhnal Slattery said the company was adequately protected, seeking to dispel concerns about the risk of being stripped for cash by China’s HNA Group.\nAvolon has come under scrutiny over its links to HNA and credit ratings analysts said last month it would benefit from tougher safeguards against being forced to bail out the cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate.\nAvolon is owned by Bohai Capital Holding Co Ltd ( 000415.SZ ), a unit of HNA Group.\n“We are a stronger and more strategically relevant business than at any time in our history,” Slattery said in a statement on Thursday.\nReporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T15:38:33.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
