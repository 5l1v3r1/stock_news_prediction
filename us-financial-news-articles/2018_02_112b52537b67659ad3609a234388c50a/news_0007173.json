I am submitting this letter to reaffirm my commitment to the Proposed Transaction and to advise the Board that I am reviewing the purchase price proposed in the Original Proposal.\nMy decision to review the purchase price proposed in the Original Proposal has been a difficult one but is necessitated by the tougher than expected environment faced by the Company and the Proposed Transaction, including in particular, since the Original Proposal: (i) the weaker than expected financial and operational performance of the Company as identified, among other things, in the Company's earnings releases since the Original Proposal, (ii) the increased competitiveness in the Chinese online gaming market, and (iii) strengthened regulatory oversight on Chinese outbound mergers and acquisitions transactions.\nI continue to be fully committed to the Proposed Transaction and look forward to continue working with the Special Committee and its advisors. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.\nCharles Zhang\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/changyoucom-receives-letter-regarding-previous-preliminary-non-binding-proposal-to-acquire-the-company-300591757.html\nSOURCE Changyou.com Limited", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/changyoucom-receives-letter-regarding-previous-preliminary-non-binding-proposal-to-acquire-the-company-300591757.html", "http://ir.changyou.com/"], "published": "2018-02-01T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T13:57:02.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
