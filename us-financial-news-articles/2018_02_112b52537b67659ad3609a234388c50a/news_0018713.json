They said the CFPB has shelved plans for on-the-ground tests of how Equifax protects data, an idea backed by Cordray.\nThe CFPB also recently rebuffed bank regulators at the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency when they offered to help with on-site exams of credit bureaus, the sources said.\nRepublican President Donald Trump's administration has sought to curb the power of the CFPB, which was created under his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama to protect consumers from financial industry abuses. The agency has been criticized fiercely by the industry.\nMulvaney has sought no new operating funds for the agency, opting instead to finance a slimmed-down budget by shrinking a reserve fund established by Cordray.\n(Reporting by Patrick Rucker and Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Franklin Paul and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T11:04:23.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
