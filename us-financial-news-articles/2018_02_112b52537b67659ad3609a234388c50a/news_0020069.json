Dermapharm, which makes generic drugs, cosmetics, dietary products and medical devices, has said it would float around a 25 percent stake.\nIts offering will comprise a total of 13.46 million shares, of which 3.84 million will be new shares from a capital increase and 9.62 million from the holdings of the selling shareholders.\nIn addition, up to 1.76 million shares from the family have been earmarked for over-allotments.\nDermapharm plans to use proceeds from its IPO to set up a new manufacturing site in Austria and partially refinance a bridge loan among other uses.\nBerenberg is acting as Sole Global Coordinator and Sole Bookrunner and ODDO BHF as Co-Lead Manager for the offering.\nOther flotations expected in the coming months include Siemens Healthineers unit, which sources have said is expected to list in March, with brake systems maker Knorr-Bremse and Deutsche Bank’s asset management arm DWS hot on its heels.\nWorld stock markets reached all-time highs last month, with the combination of solid global growth and low inflation powering the appetite for risk. But they have nose-dived over the past week amid concerns about a bond market sell-off and rising inflation.
