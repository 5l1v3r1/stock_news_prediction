(\"the Partnership,\" NYSE: APU), today reported financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nEARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS\nGAAP net income of $104.4 million and adjusted net income of $103.7 million Adjusted EBITDA of $194.1 million, compared with $185.1 million in the prior year\nJerry E. Sheridan, president and chief executive officer of AmeriGas, said, \"We had a solid operating quarter, with National Accounts and Cylinder Exchange programs both posting volume increases over the prior year and our bulk business experiencing a slight increase in unit margins despite increases in product costs. Weather was close to normal, an improvement over the prior two warm years, although the colder weather disproportionately occurred in the final week of December, and much of the sales volume associated with that colder weather occurred in January. The cold weather led to operating conditions that underscore the benefits of the scale and reach of our supply infrastructure, which is unmatched in the industry. We quickly redeployed our extensive network of supply assets to the hardest hit areas of the Northeast and South to ensure continuity of supply to our customers during the peak heating season.\"\nGiven the significance of the second fiscal quarter to full year results, AmeriGas intends to provide an update regarding its adjusted EBITDA guidance upon completion of the second fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nKEY DRIVERS OF RESULTS\nTemperatures were 1.4% warmer than normal and 9.9% colder than the prior year, however they were significantly impacted by the last week in December which was 60% colder than the prior year period. Excluding that week, weather was 6.6% warmer than normal and 3.8% colder than the prior year. Cylinder Exchange volume increased 9% over prior year. National Accounts volume increased 7% over prior year. Unit margins increased $0.01 despite Mont. Belvieu prices that were 64% higher than the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the prior-year period included a previously-reported charge of $8.8 million to correct gains on sales of certain assets related to the Heritage Propane Acquisition.\nEARNINGS CALL and WEBCAST\nAmeriGas Partners, L.P. will hold a live Internet Audio Webcast of its conference call to discuss fiscal first quarter earnings and other current activities at 9:00 AM ET on Thursday, February 1, 2018.

UGI Corporation, through subsidiaries, is the sole General Partner and owns 26% of the Partnership and the public owns the remaining 74%. Comprehensive information about AmeriGas is available on the Internet at http://www.amerigas.com .\nUSE OF FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements that management believes to be reasonable as of today’s date only. Actual results may differ significantly because of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond management’s control. You should read the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more extensive list of factors that could affect results. Among them are adverse weather conditions, cost volatility and availability of propane, increased customer conservation measures, the capacity to transport propane to our market areas, the impact of pending and future legal proceedings, political, economic and regulatory conditions in the U.S. and abroad, the availability, timing and success of our acquisitions, commercial initiatives and investments to grow our business, our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and achieve anticipated synergies, and the interruption, disruption, failure, malfunction or breach of our information technology systems, including due to cyber-attack. The Partnership undertakes no obligation to release revisions to its forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nThe Partnership’s management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted total margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to AmeriGas Partners, L.P., when evaluating the Partnership’s overall performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measures.\nManagement believes earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), as adjusted for the effects of gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions and other gains and losses that competitors do not necessarily have (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), is a meaningful non-GAAP financial measure used by investors to (1) compare the Partnership’s operating performance with that of other companies within the propane industry and (2) assess the Partnership’s ability to meet loan covenants. The Partnership’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from those used by other companies. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to compare year-over-year profitability of the business without regard to capital structure as well as to compare the relative performance of the Partnership to that of other master limited partnerships without regard to their financing methods, capital structure, income taxes, the effects of gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions or historical cost basis. In view of the omission of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions and other gains and losses that competitors do not necessarily have from Adjusted EBITDA, management also assesses the profitability of the business by comparing net income attributable to AmeriGas Partners, L.P. for the relevant periods. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to assess the Partnership’s profitability because its parent, UGI Corporation, uses the Partnership’s Adjusted EBITDA to assess the profitability of the Partnership, which is one of UGI Corporation’s industry segments. UGI Corporation discloses the Partnership’s Adjusted EBITDA as the profitability measure for its domestic propane segment.\nManagement believes the presentation of other non-GAAP financial measures, comprised of adjusted total margin and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to AmeriGas Partners, L.P., provide useful information to investors to more effectively evaluate the period-over-period results of operations of the Partnership. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures because they eliminate the impact of (1) gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments that are not associated with current-period transactions and (2) other gains and losses that competitors do not necessarily have to provide insight into the comparison of period-over-period profitability to that of other master limited partnerships.\nReconciliations of adjusted total margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income attributable to AmeriGas Partners, L.P. to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are presented at the end of this press release.\nREPORT OF EARNINGS\nAMERIGAS PARTNERS, L.P.
