Driven by the continuing momentum of our new products, AOS revenue and gross margin came in at the high end of the guidance ranges, resulting in an EPS of $0.27 on a GAAP basis and $0.32 on a non-GAAP basis for the December quarter. AOS is well positioned for its next level of growth,” stated Dr. Mike Chang, the chairman and CEO of the company. “Through our hard work and effort in the past few years, we have established a strong core business that is profitably growing and generating cash. Now, we are stepping up investments in two growth initiatives, namely the Chongqing joint venture and our digital power business. Healthy returns from our core business are enabling these strategic investments that open the door for greater expansion in revenue and profit.”\nBusiness Outlook for Fiscal Q3 Ending March 31, 2018\nThe following statements are based on management's current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. AOS undertakes no obligation to update these statements. The following statements contains non-GAAP financial measures and please see the section below “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information.\nWe expect the construction of cleanrooms of our Chongqing joint venture to be completed during the March quarter. We expect to increase headcount, install equipment, conduct qualification processes, and perform trial productions starting from the March quarter. A large portion of the pre-production costs cannot be capitalized under GAAP accounting. Because these expenses do not reflect our normal business and operations, we plan to exclude such pre-production expenses in our non-GAAP operating expenses. With that, here are our expectations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018:\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $99 million to $103 million. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 26.0% plus or minus 1%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 26.3% plus or minus 1%. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes $0.3 million of estimated share-based compensation charge. Operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $26.5 million plus or minus $1 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $22.0 million plus or minus $1 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses include $1.5 million to $1.7 million of estimated expenses relating to the development of our digital power team. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude an estimated share-based compensation charge of approximately $2.2 million and estimated pre-production expenses of the Chongqing joint venture of $2.5 million. Tax expenses are expected to be in the range of $0.8 million to $1.0 million. Loss attributable to non-controlling interest is expected to be around $1.9 million. On a non-GAAP basis, this item is expected to be around $0.7 million. The $1.2 million difference is due to the exclusion of estimated pre-production expenses in non-GAAP operating expenses.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAOS plans to hold an investor teleconference and live webcast to discuss the financial results for the fiscal second quarter of 2018 ended December 31, 2017 today, February 7, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET.

These include, without limitation, statements relating to projected amount of revenue, gross margin, operating income (loss), income tax expenses, net income (loss), noncontrolling interest, and share-based compensation expenses, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating expenses, tax expenses, and adjusted loss attributable to non-controlling interest, our ability and strategy to develop new products, including digital power controller products, the ability to expand our sales, maintain optimal capacity and achieve sustained growth and profitability, the ability of our repurchase program to enhance shareholder value, the pre-production phase of our Chongqing joint venture, and our strategy to develop the new digital power business, and other information under the section entitled “Business Outlook for Fiscal Q3 Ending March 31, 2018”. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the These factors include, but are not limited to, the decline of the PC industry and our ability to respond to such decline; difficulties and challenges in executing our diversification strategy into different market segments; ordering pattern from distributors and seasonality; our ability to introduce or develop new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance, the actual product performance in volume production, the quality and reliability of our product, our ability to achieve design wins, the general business and economic conditions, the state of semiconductor industry and seasonality of our markets, our ability to maintain factory utilization at a desirable level, our ability to successfully operate our joint venture in China, and other risks as described in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 filed on September 5, 2017. Other unknown or unpredictable factors or underlying assumptions subsequently proving to be incorrect could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance, or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these All information provided in this press release is as of today's date, unless otherwise stated, and AOS undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures for our historical performance, including non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\"). These supplemental measures excludes share-based compensation expenses for all periods presented and income tax benefit from tax reform for current period in this press release. We also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in our guidance for the next quarter, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses and loss attributable to non-controlling interest. These forecast supplemental measures exclude estimated pre-production expenses relating to our Chongqing joint venture. We believe that these historical and forecast non-GAAP financial measures can provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items and expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results or do not reflect our normal business operations, such as the joint venture pre-production expenses. In addition, our management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and to benchmark our performance externally against competitors. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations in that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as non-GAAP net income (loss) or adjusted operating expenses, do not have a standardized meaning. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures both in the text in this press release and in the tables attached hereto. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Alpha and Omega Semiconductor\nAlpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited, or AOS, is a designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of power semiconductors, including a wide portfolio of Power MOSFET, IGBT, IPM and Power IC products.
