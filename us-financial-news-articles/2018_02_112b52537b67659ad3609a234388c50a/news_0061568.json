Net interest income was up 8.5 percent to $129.5 billion.\nFDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said the industryâ€™s performance remains positive, as the number of problem banks dropped to just 95, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. However, he said low interest rates and a competitive lending environment has led some banks to reach for yield, heightening risks.
