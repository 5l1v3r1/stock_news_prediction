That's about one-fifth of its U.S. store fleet.\n\"We estimate less than half the stores in their announced closures directly affect our initial plans, but we also expect Toys R Us to streamline inventory at remaining stores,\" CEO Brian Goldner said during an earnings conference call Wednesday. \"Much of this impact will be felt in the first two quarters of the year. We anticipate during 2018 that we will right-size our business with Toys R Us.\"\nHasbro has relied heavily on Toys R Us for sales. In 2016, the retailer was tied with Target as the second-largest seller of Hasbro goods, accounting for 14 percent of Hasbro's sales in the U.S. and Canada.\nAs Toys R Us begins to streamline the amount of inventory it can take, Goldner said Hasbro has \"continued to grow our revenue outside of Toys R Us.\"\nThe brand is expanding in international markets like Russia and China and is exploring new channels like drug and grocery stores.\n\"Toys R Us risk is contained and contingency plans are prepared if there is a full liquidation event,\" Stephanie Wissink, an analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a research note Wednesday.\nJefferies currently holds a buy rating on the stock and a price target of $123. \nWhile Hasbro did not offer guidance for 2018, the company said it feels \"very good\" about 2018's prospects, particularly around its growth of franchise toys, items like Monopoly, My Little Pony and Nerf, and its games segment.\nGoldner said the company would provide more insight on its forecast at the New York Toy Fair next week.\nTUNE IN: Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner will appear on CNBC's \"Mad Money\" tonight at 6 p.m. ET.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:11:36.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
