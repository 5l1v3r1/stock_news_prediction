In addition, an archived webcast will be available on the Investors section of the company’s website at www.imperva.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nImperva reports all financial information required in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To supplement the Imperva unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Imperva uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the results of Imperva operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by Imperva include historical and forward-looking non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP basic and diluted loss per share, free cash flow and forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition- and disposition-related expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring costs, costs associated with the review of strategic alternatives and non-routine stockholder matters, gain on sale of business and provision for income taxes on sale of business from the Imperva unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations and net purchases of property and equipment from the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.\nFor a description of these items, including the reasons why management adjusts for them, and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” as well as the related tables that precede it. Imperva may consider whether other significant non-routine items that arise in the future should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures it uses.\nImperva believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the performance of Imperva by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company’s core business, operating results or future outlook. Imperva management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing operating results of Imperva, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of the performance of Imperva to prior periods.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains and the conference call will include forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding the company’s expectations regarding its strength in subscription revenues, future interest in its cloud-based solutions, anticipated demand for its FlexProtect licensing program, expectations regarding profitability and growth, and our business outlook and expectations for the first quarter and full year 2018.

When evaluating the performance of its consolidated results, Imperva does not consider stock-based compensation expense. Likewise, the Imperva management team excludes stock-based compensation expense from its operating plans. In contrast, the Imperva management team is held accountable for cash-based compensation and such amounts are included in its operating plans. Further, when considering the impact of equity award grants, Imperva places a greater emphasis on overall stockholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants.\nImperva excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because it does not consider such expense as part of its ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of its business, and the exclusion of the expense facilitates the comparison of current period results with results from prior periods.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles. When analyzing the operating performance of an acquired entity, Imperva’s management focuses on the total return provided by the investment (i.e., operating profit generated from the acquired entity as compared to the purchase price paid) without taking into consideration any allocations made for accounting purposes. Because the purchase price for an acquisition necessarily reflects the accounting value assigned to intangible assets (including acquired technology and goodwill), when analyzing the operating performance of an acquisition in subsequent periods, Imperva’s management excludes the GAAP impact of acquired intangible assets to its financial results. Imperva believes that such an approach is useful in understanding the long-term return provided by an acquisition and that investors benefit from a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the accounting expense associated with acquired intangible assets.\nIn addition, in accordance with GAAP, Imperva generally recognizes expense for internally-developed intangible assets as they are incurred until technological feasibility is reached, notwithstanding the potential future benefit such assets may provide. Unlike internally-developed intangible assets, however, and also in accordance with GAAP, Imperva generally capitalizes the cost of acquired intangible assets and recognizes that cost as an expense over the useful lives of the assets acquired (other than goodwill, which is not amortized, as required under GAAP). As a result of their GAAP treatment, there is an inherent lack of comparability between the financial performance of internally-developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets. Accordingly, Imperva believes it is useful to provide, as a supplement to its GAAP operating results, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles.\nStrategic Review and Non-routine Stockholder Matters. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Imperva incurred professional service fees and costs related to its review of strategic alternatives and other non-routine stockholder matters. Imperva has excluded the expenses associated with these activities from its non-GAAP financial results because they are not representative of and Imperva does not consider them part of ongoing operating costs. The exclusion of these expenses facilitates the comparison of current period results with results from prior periods.\nAcquisition and Disposition-related Expense, Gain on Sale of Business, and Provision for Income Taxes on Sale of Business. Imperva completed an acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2016 and completed the sale of the Skyfence business during the first quarter of 2017. Imperva incurred legal, accounting, advisory and other transaction-related expense in connection with these transactions. Imperva has excluded these acquisition- and disposition-related expenses from its non-GAAP financial measures because they are not representative of ongoing operating costs. Imperva also has excluded the gain on the sale of the Skyfence business and the related tax effects given that such gain and the associated taxes are not representative of Imperva’s ongoing operations. Imperva does not acquire or dispose of businesses on a predictable cycle and the expenses, gains (if any) and the associated taxes from these transactions vary significantly and are unique to each transaction. Imperva records acquisition- and disposition-related expense as operating expense when incurred and the gain on sale of business and provision for income taxes associated with the sale were recorded at the time the Skyfence transaction closed. As a result, when they occur, these expenses, gains and taxes affect comparability from period to period and Imperva believes that investors benefit from a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these expenses, gains and taxes to facilitate the comparison of current period results with the results from prior periods.\nRestructuring Charges. Imperva undertook a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2016 and recorded additional restructuring charges in connection with the plan during the first quarter of 2017, substantially all of which were related to stock-based compensation expense associated with accelerated vesting of equity awards for certain terminated employees. In contrast to cost-reduction initiatives that are part of ongoing operations, the restructuring plan resulted in one-time severance costs that are not representative of ongoing operating costs. Because the restructuring plan was incremental to the operating activities of Imperva’s core business, Imperva has excluded the expense associated with the restructuring from its non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate the comparison of current period results with the results from prior periods.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208006087/en/\nICR for Imperva\nSeth Potter, 646-277-1230\nIR@imperva.com\nSeth.Potter@icrinc.com\nSource: Imperva, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imperva.com&esheet=51755425&newsitemid=20180208006087&lan=en-US&anchor=www.imperva.com&index=3&md5=03bb7ba205d797fc1d80947bb241bc5f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imperva.com&esheet=51755425&newsitemid=20180208006087&lan=en-US&anchor=www.imperva.com&index=2&md5=8d26862587bd3faa5a436a7f9ddf55d7", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imperva.com%2F&esheet=51755425&newsitemid=20180208006087&lan=en-US&anchor=Imperva&index=1&md5=b716eedca3146d3d66bb5b0ae3bf89b7", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imperva.com&esheet=51755425&newsitemid=20180208006087&lan=en-US&anchor=www.imperva.com&index=5&md5=ad02d9291d17f35a6571f504fd4a2c4f", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208006087/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51755425&newsitemid=20180208006087&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=4&md5=c5ef85334284c97811cf040b580dd5bd"], "published": "2018-02-09T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T02:03:59.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
