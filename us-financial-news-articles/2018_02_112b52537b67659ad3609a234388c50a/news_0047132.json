Ryom, 19, shed a tear.\n“I was very nervous but once I entered the rink, I saw our North Korean cheering squad and South Korean people putting their hearts together and cheering together,” the 25-year-old Kim said in televised comments.\n“They really cheered for me and it encouraged me a lot.”\nA North Korean cheerleading squad chanted the skaters’ names as they warmed up on the ice, waving flags of their country, while the crowd of mostly South Koreans applauded and cheered every time they executed an element of their programme.\nThe pair set three personal-best scores in Pyeongchang.\n“This may be the last time I see North Koreans compete at an Olympics in South Korea,” said Lee Sae-rom, a South Korean spectator at the Gangneung Ice Arena.\n“My daughter is so young that she does not even know that the two Koreas are divided, but I hope she feels that they should be reunited through sport.”\nEASING TENSIONS North and South Korea have remained in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. The poor one-party state to the North and wealthy, democratic South are divided by a heavy militarised border.\nDuring the figure skating pair’s short programme on Wednesday, South Korean students advocating for warmer ties with the North brandished a banner that read: “Pyeongchang fairy Ryom Tae Ok, jump toward unification!”\nRyom and Kim work with Canadian coach Bruno Marcotte, who has said they need to improve their power to be a threat on the international stage.\nTheir objective in the free programme was to earn more than 125 points. They fell a few tenths of a point short, but they are on track for their longer-term goal.\n“Our goal has always been to break a record again and again, and advance step by step and not to turn back no matter what happens,” Kim said.\nNorth Korea agreed to compete in Pyeongchang after the South and the International Olympic Committee encouraged the heavily sanctioned state to participate as a peace gesture.\nNorth Korea’s participation is viewed as a sign of easing tensions over its nuclear and missile programmes, which it pursues in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\nThe country did not have any athletes at the 2014 Sochi winter Games, but it has sent 22 athletes to Pyeongchang, including 12 ice hockey players in a combined North and South Korean women’s team.
