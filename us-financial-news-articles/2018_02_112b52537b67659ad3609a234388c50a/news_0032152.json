We produced sales growth of 8% in 2017 on top of sales growth of 9% in 2016 and converted this into solid earnings growth, primarily due to executing our strategies in pursuit of our mission every day,” commented Manuel Perez de la Mesa, President and CEO.\nNet sales increased 8% to a record high of $2.79 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.57 billion in 2016. Pool remodeling, equipment replacement and the expansion of building materials and commercial products were the major contributors to base business sales growth of 7% for the year.\nGross profit reached a record $805.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 9% increase over gross profit of $741.1 million in 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (gross margin) grew 10 basis points to 28.9% for 2017 compared to 28.8% in 2016.\nSelling and administrative expenses (operating expenses) increased 7% to $520.9 million for 2017, up from $485.2 million in 2016, with base business operating expenses up 5% over last year. The increase in base business operating expenses was primarily due to higher growth-driven labor and freight expenses, as well as greater employee benefit costs, equity-based compensation, and technology spending. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses declined 20 basis points and 30 basis points on base business results.\nOperating income for the year increased 11% to $284.4 million, up from $255.9 million in 2016. Operating income as a percentage of net sales (operating margin) increased to a record 10.2% in 2017 compared to 10.0% in 2016, with a 40 basis point increase on base business results.\nOur provision for income taxes for 2017 was impacted by both U.S. tax reform and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. As a result of the recently enacted tax legislation, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $12.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which reflects remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability. Going forward we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 25.5%, which is an improvement over our historical rate of approximately 38.5%, both of which exclude the impact of ASU 2016-09. We have not finalized our accounting for the tax effects of tax reform; however our net benefit is based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. In addition to the impact from tax reform, we recorded a $12.6 million benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to ASU 2016-09, which positively impacted our net income and earnings per share, but was partially offset by an increase of approximately 550,000 diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The combination of both tax reform and ASU 2016-09 resulted in a total net benefit of $0.52 to our diluted earnings per share in 2017.\nNet income attributable to Pool Corporation increased 29% to a record $191.6 million in 2017 compared to $149.0 million in 2016. Earnings per share increased 30% to a record $4.51 per diluted share compared to $3.47 per diluted share in 2016. Excluding the $0.28 per diluted share impact of tax reform and the $0.24 per diluted share impact of ASU 2016-09, diluted earnings per share increased 15% over last year. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the addendum to this release) increased 12% to $322.2 million in 2017 compared to $286.4 million in 2016, or 11.6% of net sales in 2017 compared to 11.2% of net sales in 2016.\nOn the balance sheet at December 31, 2017, total net receivables, including pledged receivables, increased 18% over the prior year, reflective of fourth quarter sales growth and two acquisitions completed in December. Inventory levels grew 10% to $536.5 million compared to $486.1 million last year. Total debt outstanding was $519.7 million, an increase of $81.6 million or 19% over last year’s balance, primarily to fund share repurchases and working capital growth.\nCash provided by operations was $175.3 million in 2017. Compared to 2016, cash provided by operations was $9.9 million higher primarily due to the increase in net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. Excluding the net income benefit from tax changes, cash provided by operations approximates net income for 2017.\nNet sales increased 15% to $510.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 up from $445.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin declined 20 basis points to 28.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $17.3 million compared to $9.7 million in the same period last year. Operating margin increased 120 basis points in the quarter, including a 140 basis point increase in base business operating margin. This improvement is on top of the 80 basis point operating margin growth for base business in the fourth quarter of 2016. Base business operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined 160 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to Pool Corporation for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $25.7 million compared to $2.6 million in the comparable 2016 period. Earnings per diluted share was $0.62 for the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.21 excluding the $0.29 per diluted share impact from tax reform and the $0.12 per diluted share impact from the new accounting pronouncement, compared to $0.06 for the same period last year.\n“We are optimistic about the opportunities available to us given the attractive long term attributes of our industry to enhance the quality of outdoor home life. Based on our continued investments in our people, tools and resources, and considering our very strong finish to 2017, we expect earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $5.36 to $5.61 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.13 favorable impact from ASU 2016-09. This range also reflects our expected 2018 tax rate including tax reform legislation,” said Perez de la Mesa.\nBased on our December 31, 2017 stock price, we estimate that we have approximately $5.4 million in unrealized excess tax benefits related to stock options that will expire in the first quarter of 2018 and restricted awards that will vest in 2018, which we have included in our earnings guidance range. Additional tax benefits could be recognized related to stock option exercises in 2018 from grants that expire in years after 2018, for which we have not included any expected benefits.\nPOOLCORP is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products.

We also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers.\nWe generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of cash flow or liquidity as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We have included Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used by our investors, industry analysts and others as a useful supplemental liquidity measure in conjunction with cash flows provided by or used in operating activities to help investors understand our ability to provide cash flows to fund growth, service debt and pay dividends as well as compare our cash flow generating capacity from year to year.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating income or loss, net income or loss, cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement line items reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\n(Unaudited) Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 Net income $ 191,339 $ 148,603 Add: Interest and other non-operating expenses (1) 15,360 13,802 Provision for income taxes 77,982 92,931 Share-based compensation 12,482 9,902 Goodwill impairment — — Equity earnings in unconsolidated investments, net (139 ) (156 ) Depreciation 24,157 20,338 Amortization (2) 976 1,012 Adjusted EBITDA $ 322,157 $ 286,432 (1) Shown net of interest income and net of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and includes amortization of deferred financing costs as discussed below.\n(2) Excludes amortization of deferred financing costs of $592 for 2017 and $627 for 2016.
