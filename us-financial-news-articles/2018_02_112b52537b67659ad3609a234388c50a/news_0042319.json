REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha Greenpeace activists presented an hourglass filled with dust from Bangkok and other provinces most affected by severe air pollution to a government representative.\n“Bangkok cannot continue choking on hazardous air,” said Tara Buakamsri, director of Greenpeace in Thailand.\n“It endangers the lives of people, affects economic productivity and negatively impacts the prestige of one of the most popular cities on earth.”\nThe prime minister, who is also the chairman of the National Environment board, should order an improvement in air quality, he said.\nThe PM2.5 level in central Bangkok was at 22.5 micrograms per m3 on Thursday, according to the AirVisual smartphone application.\nEarlier this month, the pollution department measured PM2.5 dust in Bangkok at 72-95 micrograms per m3.\nThat compares with a World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of an annual average of no more than 10 micrograms.\nReporting by Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T09:13:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
