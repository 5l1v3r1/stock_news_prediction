And now that the UK government as well as the Dutch have a little bit more time away from some of the shorter term issues, we’re obviously progressing those as we talk,” Polman said. \n“We’re not time-bound by a week or a month,” he added. “We are approaching this very maturely and tactically.” Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Adrian Croft", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T13:36:12.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
