However, throughout the fourth quarter, our focus was on assisting our employees, customers and the community after the most devastating wildfires in California history. We are grateful that because of our positive financial position we are able to help our community move forward through the rebuild process,” said Gary Hartwick, President and CEO.\nExchange Bank reported income before taxes of $10.86 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $8.80 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of 23%. Income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $43.57 million, compared to $34.67 million a year ago, an increase of 26%. As a result of the enactment of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (Tax Act) as signed into law on December 22, 2017, the Bank reported an additional adjustment to income tax expense totaling $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which had a material impact on net income for both the year and quarter ending December 31, 2017. As a result of this additional tax expense, the Bank reported a net loss of $293 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 and net income for the year ending December 31, 2017 of $19.5 million, as compared to net income of $5.45 million and $21.50 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. Without this additional income tax expense, net income would have been $6.6 million and $26.4 million for the quarter and year ending December 31, 2017.\nThe increase in income tax expense was the result of a remeasurement related to the carrying value of the Bank’s net deferred tax assets due to the reduction in federal income tax rates from 35% to 21%. Net deferred tax assets represent the tax effected timing difference between revenues and expenses recorded for book purposes as compared to the timing of revenues and expense recorded for tax purposes. “While the Bank was required to remeasure its net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2017, the reduction in federal tax rates beginning January 1, 2018 is expected to have a significant and positive impact on net income in future periods. Based on the projected level of Bank earnings, the 2017 impact on tax expense resulting from the net deferred tax asset remeasurement is expected to be earned back through a reduction in income tax expense in less than eighteen months,” stated Greg Jahn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThe Bank did benefit from two unusual and nonrecurring items of income during 2017 that contributed to this elevated level of earnings, including a gain of $1.6 million on the sale of other real estate held for sale and a $1.4 million litigation settlement. These benefits were partially offset by the reversal of loan loss provisions of $900 thousand during 2016, which were not repeated in 2017.\nThe earnings of the Bank were driven primarily by continued growth in loans and investments, which were funded by a significant increase in deposits. The growth in loans and investments led to an increase in net interest income of approximately $8.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2017, an 11% increase over the year ending December 31, 2016. The Bank experienced loan growth of approximately $71 million and an increase in investments and interest earning deposits primarily held with the Federal Reserve Bank totaling $322 million, which represent increases of 5% and 51% respectively. This increase in interest earning assets was funded primarily by growth in deposits of approximately $400 million, an increase of 21% over 2016. The extraordinary growth in deposits occurred during the fourth quarter and to a large extent related to the inflow of insurance settlements received by the Bank’s clients who suffered losses as a result of the unprecedented wildfires in the communities we serve. “Through this heartbreaking time, we used our financial resources and personnel in a number of innovative ways to support disaster relief efforts, and we continue to be a resource for liquidity and credit to our clients. We have recently announced a number of innovative and low-cost financial solutions to assist our community through the rebuild efforts. During this period of extraordinary devastation in Northern California, we have never been more proud to be a part of this generous and caring community,” said Gary Hartwick, President and CEO.\nThe Bank’s credit quality remains strong, with non-accrual loans declining to just 0.18% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Despite continued loan growth, as a result of the continued improvement in asset quality and net loan recoveries, the Bank did not make any provision for loan losses in 2017 and was able to maintain a ratio of loan loss reserves to total loans of 2.70%. In addition, the Bank’s capital ratios remain in excess of the regulatory definitions of “well capitalized.” As of December 31, 2017, the Bank reported total risk-based capital of 12.92%.\nExchange Bank paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per share on common stock outstanding to shareholders on December 8, 2017. Total dividends paid to Exchange Bank common shareholders during 2017 were $5.8 million and represented an increase of approximately 21% above total dividends of $4.8 million paid to common shareholders during 2016. The Doyle Trust, which funds the Doyle Scholarships at the Santa Rosa Junior College, receives 50.44% of all cash dividends paid by the Bank.\nAbout Exchange Bank\nHeadquartered in Sonoma County and founded in 1890, Exchange Bank is a premier community bank with assets of $2.6 billion.
