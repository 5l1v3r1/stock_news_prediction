This offers some relief to investors jittery about signs that some major central banks may dial back their crisis-mode policies earlier than expected.\nKuroda’s nomination needs approval by both houses of parliament, a near certainty as premier Shinzo Abe’s ruling coalition holds comfortable majorities in the lower and upper houses of the Diet.\nReporting by Takaya Yamaguchi; Editing by William Mallard\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T04:00:40.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
