Haskell was suspended for four weeks following a high tackle in a match for Wasps against Harlequins, while Marler was given a six-week ban for striking with the shoulder in an illegal clear out playing for Harlequins against Sale Sharks. England under-20 wing Gabriel Ibitoye has been named as an ‘apprentice’ in the squad which means he gets the experience of being involved in training and preparation for the match.
