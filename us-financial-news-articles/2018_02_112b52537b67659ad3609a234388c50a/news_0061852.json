The probe threatens to create a power vacuum at Israel’s largest telecoms group.\nFormer Bezeq chairman Shaul Elovitch said he will step down from the board as will his wife and son, parent company B Communications (Bcom) said on Monday.\nElovitch, a family friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who controls Bezeq through Bcom parent Eurocom, was arrested last week along with his wife and son. They are in police custody but will be brought to court on Monday morning for a hearing on their request to be released.\nThey all deny any wrongdoing.\nBcom is proposing former Bezeq chairman Shlomo Rodav and Doron Turgeman -- CEO of Eurocom subsidiary Internet Gold -- to the board.\nIn addition, a group of investors led by U.S.-Israeli businessman Naty Saidoff has proposed biotechnology executive Tamir Cohen to the board. An offer for the indebted Eurocom from Saidoff’s group has been accepted by Eurocom’s creditors and submitted to court for approval.\nElovitch last June temporarily stepped down as chairman of Bezeq and was replaced by acting chairman David Granot.\nIsraeli media had reported on Sunday that Chief Executive Stella Handler, who is also in police custody, would be replaced at least temporarily, but there has been no such decision.\nShe and another company official were arrested last week in connection with the Israel Securities Authority’s (ISA) investigation of Bezeq over allegations including fraud, bribery and securities offences.\nThey are in police custody and will also be brought to court on Monday.\nThey also deny any wrongdoing.\nAmid a 29 percent drop in Bezeq’s shares in 2017, activist investor Elliott, which has a 4.8 percent stake, has called for the resignation of all Bezeq directors implicated in the investigation and those affiliated with Eurocom.
