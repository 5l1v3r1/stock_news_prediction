Matt Niskanen of the Capitals fumbled the puck away in the neutral zone, and Justin Abdelkader picked it up and scored on a breakaway with 6:23 left, tying the score at one.\nNiskanen also had the puck stolen from him on the third Detroit goal later on.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:49:07.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
