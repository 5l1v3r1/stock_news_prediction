But blockchain experts have broadly panned Venezuela’s cryptocurrency efforts, noting that digital tokens are only as valuable as the faith inspired by their issuer.\nThe country’s history of uncompensated expropriations and the 99 percent depreciation of its fiat currency the bolivar have created doubts about the ruling Socialist Party’s capacity to manage digital tokens.\nBlockchain technology is built on making information about transactions open to the public. But the Socialist Party jealously guards even the most basic of information - including about inflation.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has already warned that Venezuelan cryptocurrencies could violate sanctions and thus create legal risk for U.S. investors.\nSean Walsh, founder of crypto-asset investment firm Redwood City Ventures, said it was difficult to reach conclusions about the petro gold without seeing specific details. But he said he had little interest in tokens backed by physical assets.\n“Rather than buying a cryptocurrency backed by gold, I’d just go buy the gold,” said Walsh in a telephone interview. “Gold is a physical thing that you want to be able to hold in your hands, because that’s the point.”\nEditing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T07:03:01.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
