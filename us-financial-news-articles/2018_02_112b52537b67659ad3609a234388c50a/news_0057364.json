(NYSE:BSM) (“Black Stone Minerals,” “Black Stone,” or “the Partnership”) today announces its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, provides detailed guidance for 2018, and presents an updated five-year production forecast.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nReported a new quarterly production record in the fourth quarter of 38.1 Mboe/d, representing a 3% increase from the third quarter and a 28% increase from the fourth quarter of last year. Increased mineral and royalty volumes by 15% over the third quarter. Recognized net income and Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $19.4 million and $79.5 million, respectively. Reported distributable cash flow of $69.4 million, resulting in distribution coverage for all units of 1.3x. Announced and closed the acquisition of a diverse set of mineral and royalty assets from subsidiaries of Noble Energy, Inc. for $335 million, funded primarily by the private placement of $300 million in convertible preferred units. Entered into farmout agreement covering substantially all of Black Stone's remaining working interests in the Shelby Trough area of East Texas targeting the Haynesville and Bossier shales for the next several years. Reconfirmed the credit facility borrowing base at $550 million and extended the credit agreement maturity date to November 1, 2022.\nOther Financial and Operational Highlights\nAchieved full year 2017 production, net income, and Adjusted EBITDA of 37.0 MBoe/d, $157.2 million, and $309.8 million, respectively. Reported estimated proved reserves at year-end 2017 of 67.9 MMBoe (74% natural gas and 82% proved developed producing), an increase of 7% over year-end 2016. Anticipate average daily production for 2018 growing approximately 14% to 41 - 43 MBoe/d, driven by expected mineral and royalty production growth of 24% year over year. Updated long-term forecast provides compound annual growth of approximately 16% and 7% for mineral and royalty production volumes and total production volumes, respectively, over the next five years. Based on the improved commodity outlook and the strength of the current forecast, management anticipates converting all the subordinated units to common units on a one-to-one basis in mid-2019 while still allowing for distribution growth and healthy distribution coverage following conversion.\nManagement Commentary\n“2017 was a standout year for Black Stone Minerals,” stated Thomas L. Carter, Jr., Black Stone Minerals’ President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman. “Operationally, we posted very strong results for the year with total average daily production growing 17% year over year. Perhaps more importantly, we enhanced our growth prospects through organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions. We added an agreement with a major operator that will drive development of large portions of our Shelby Trough acreage in East Texas. We also lived up to our reputation as an active acquirer by purchasing approximately $500 million in assets during the year, bolstering both our Haynesville and Permian footprints.”\nMr. Carter continued, “Last year at this time, I outlined our goal to de-emphasize our working interest participation program and replace those volumes with mineral and royalty production in a way that would allow us to grow production and cash flow over the long-term. Today, our updated five-year production forecast delivers on that commitment and provides line of sight for the conversion of subordinated units into common units on a one-to-one basis, while growing distributions and maintaining healthy coverage ratios following conversion. This is a testament to the strength of our team and the value of actively managing our assets. I am extremely proud of what our team accomplished in 2017 and how we are positioned to continue building value for our unitholders.”\nQuarterly Financial and Operating Results\nProduction and Realized Prices\nBlack Stone Minerals reported average production of 38.1 MBoe/d for the fourth quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 28% from the corresponding period in 2016. Mineral and royalty volumes made up 65% of the Partnership’s total reported volumes in the fourth quarter of 2017 and natural gas volumes represented 73%.\nThe Partnership’s average realized price per Boe, excluding the effect of derivative settlements, was $28.21 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 3% from $27.29 per Boe for the corresponding quarter last year.\nFinancial Results\nBlack Stone Minerals reported oil and gas revenues of $99.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 32% from $74.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase reflects higher reported production volumes as well as slightly higher commodity prices compared to the corresponding period in 2016.\nThe Partnership reported a loss on commodity derivative instruments of $8.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, composed of a $2.9 million gain from realized settlements and a non-cash $11.4 million unrealized loss due to the change in value of Black Stone’s derivative positions during the quarter.\nLease bonus and other income was $5.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $6.0 million for the same period last year.\nMost expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were in line with or below the Partnership’s previously provided guidance, with the exception of general and administrative expense. Based on Black Stone's updated long-term forecast, the Partnership reinstated accruals for certain performance-based units granted in 2015 as part of the Partnership’s IPO which had previously been written off. These expense accruals made in the fourth quarter capture the entire amount of non-cash expense that would have been recognized from grant date through the end of 2017 for those performance-based IPO awards.\nThe Partnership reported net income of $19.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $7.3 million in the corresponding period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $79.5 million, as compared to $58.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAcquisitions\nAs previously reported, Black Stone acquired a diverse mineral and royalty package for $335 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from subsidiaries of Noble Energy, Inc. For the full year, the Partnership acquired approximately $500 million worth of properties, which included $72 million of asset acquisitions financed through the direct placement of common units with the sellers.\n2017 Proved Reserves\nEstimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at year-end 2017 were 67.9 MMBoe, an increase of 7% from 63.4 MMBoe at year-end 2016, and were approximately 74% natural gas and 82% proved developed producing. The discounted net cash flow of proved reserves discounted at 10% (“PV-10”) was $864.4 million at the end of 2017 as compared to $605.1 million at year-end 2016.\nNetherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc., an independent petroleum engineering firm, evaluated Black Stone Minerals’ estimate of its proved reserves and PV-10 at December 31, 2017. These estimates were prepared using reference prices of $51.34 per barrel of oil and $2.98 per MMBTU of natural gas in accordance with the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These prices were adjusted for quality and market differentials, transportation fees, and in the case of natural gas, the value of natural gas liquids. A rollforward of proved reserves is presented in the summary financial tables following this press release.\nFinancial Position and Activities\nAs of December 31, 2017, Black Stone Minerals had $388.0 million outstanding under its credit facility. Black Stone Minerals is in compliance with all financial covenants associated with its credit facility. The Partnership’s borrowing base at December 31, 2017 was $550 million. Black Stone’s regularly scheduled borrowing base redetermination is set for April 2018. As of February 23, 2018, $371 million was outstanding under the credit facility.\nAs previously disclosed, Black Stone issued $300 million of Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred units during the fourth quarter of 2017 to an affiliate of The Carlyle Group at a price of $20.3926 per preferred unit.\nThe Partnership established an at-the-market (“ATM”) offering program in 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, no units were sold under the ATM program. Through the ATM program, Black Stone can sell common units into the open market from time to time. As of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had approximately $70 million of availability in the ATM program.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Distributions\nAs previously announced, the Board of Directors of the general partner approved a cash distribution of $0.3125 per common unit and $0.20875 per subordinated unit attributable to the fourth quarter of 2017. These distributions will be paid on February 27, 2018 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February 20, 2018.\nIn determining the amount of distributions to common and subordinated unitholders, the Board takes into account numerous factors, including the level of distribution coverage. In addition to the industry-accepted method of calculating distribution coverage, the Partnership also evaluates distribution coverage after deducting net working interest capital expenditures with a goal over the long-term of funding recurring working interest capital expenditures with retained cash flow. The quarterly distribution coverage attributable to the fourth quarter of 2017 for all units was approximately 1.3x before net working interest capital expenditures and approximately 1.2x after net working interest capital expenditures. The Partnership expects the farmout agreements entered into during 2017 will eliminate the substantial majority of its working interest capital expenditures by mid-2018, and accordingly the Partnership does not expect to continue using distributable cash flow after net working interest capital expenditures as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure in 2018.\nSummary 2018 Guidance\nKey assumptions in Black Stone Minerals’ 2018 program are as follows:\nFY 2018\nAverage daily production (MBoe/d) 41 - 43 Percentage natural gas ~75% Percentage royalty interest ~65% Lease bonus and other income ($MM) $30 - $40 Lease operating expense ($MM) $15 - $19 Production costs and ad valorem taxes (as % of total pre-derivative O&G revenue) 12% - 14% Exploration expense ($MM) $1.5 - $2.5 G&A - cash ($MM) $45 - $47 G&A - non-cash ($MM) $28 - $30 G&A - TOTAL ($MM) $73 - $77 DD&A ($/Boe) $8.00 - $9.00 No acquisitions are assumed in the guidance above; however, consistent with its stated strategy, the Partnership expects to remain active in the acquisition market.\n2018 Capital Expenditures\nBlack Stone Minerals expects to invest between $15 million and $25 million in working interest participation capital in 2018 related primarily to Haynesville and Bossier Shale wells in East Texas that pre-date the Partnership’s working interest farmouts in the Shelby Trough. Substantially all of this capital is expected to be spent in the first quarter of 2018 as these wells are completed and brought online. As a result of the aforementioned farmout arrangements, Black Stone expects working interest participation capital to be negligible following the first quarter of 2018.\nIn addition, Black Stone expects to invest approximately $10 million to $12 million in the evaluation of its PepperJack prospect in Hardin and Liberty counties, Texas. The previously disclosed PepperJack A#1 well targeting the Lower Wilcox formation has been drilled and was logged in mid-February of 2018. Based on the encouraging results from that well, Black Stone plans to drill a step-out well to further delineate the prospect. The Partnership believes these wells substantially improve its ability to structure a deal with an operating partner to aggressively develop the field to the benefit of Black Stone’s retained mineral and royalty position.\nFive Year Outlook\nThe following projections are based on existing assets and do not contemplate additional acquisitions.\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Total production (MBOE/d) 41 - 43\n44 - 46 45 - 47 47 - 49 50 - 52 Percentage natural gas ~75% ~76% ~75% ~76% ~77% Percentage royalty ~65% ~77% ~87% ~90% ~90% Implied royalty production (MBOE/d) 26 - 28\n34 - 36 41 - 43 42 - 44 45 - 47 Percentage growth ~24% ~27% ~15% ~8% ~6% 5 year CAGR (2017 to 2022) ~16% Black Stone Minerals has a long history of being an active acquirer of mineral and royalty assets and contemplates making acquisitions over the outlook period in the amount of $150 million per year. Including production from modeled acquisitions, the five-year production forecast would increase as follows:\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Total production, incl. acquisitions (MBOE/d) 42 - 44 46 - 48 49 - 51 52 - 54 57 - 59 Black Stone’s subordinated units first become eligible for conversion into common units following the payment of the distribution with respect to the quarter ending March 31, 2019. Based on the updated pre-acquisition production forecast above and the improved commodity price environment, Black Stone's management and Board of Directors now expect that the Partnership will be in a position to convert the subordinated units on a one-to-one basis while achieving the overarching goal of continued growth in the common distributions with healthy levels of distribution coverage. As a result, management intends to recommend increasing the subordinated unit distribution attributable to the second quarter of 2018 to parity with the common unit distribution. Black Stone will continue to monitor both market conditions and business performance over the conversion period when determining the level of subordinated distributions.\nHedge Position\nThe Partnership has commodity derivative contracts in place covering portions of anticipated production for 2018 and 2019. For 2018, approximately 74% of expected oil volumes are hedged at prices averaging $54.32 per barrel and approximately 80% of expected gas volumes are hedged at prices averaging $3.02 per Mcf. For 2019, approximately 17% of expected oil volumes are hedged at prices averaging $53.58 per barrel and approximately 19% of expected gas volumes are hedged at prices averaging $2.91 per Mcf. More detailed information regarding the Partnership’s existing hedge position can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2017, which is expected to be filed on or around February 27, 2018.\nConference Call\nBlack Stone Minerals will host a conference call and webcast for investors and analysts to discuss its results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time.

As a result, the Partnership is unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on its acreage. Accordingly, no NGL volumes are included in our reported production; however, revenue attributable to NGLs is included in natural gas revenue and the calculation of realized prices for natural gas. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, and distributable cash flow after net working interest capital expenditures are supplemental non-GAAP (\"GAAP\" is defined as generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures used by management and external users of the financial statements such as investors, research analysts, and others, to assess the financial performance of the Partnership's assets and its ability to sustain distributions over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis.\nBlack Stone defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization adjusted for impairment of oil and natural gas properties, accretion of asset retirement obligations, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments, and non-cash equity-based compensation. The Partnership defines distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA plus or minus amounts for certain non-cash operating activities, estimated replacement capital expenditures, cash interest expense, and distributions to noncontrolling interests and preferred unitholders. Distributable cash flow after net working interest capital expenditures is defined as distributable cash flow less net working interest capital expenditures. Net working interest capital expenditures consists of all capital expenditures related to working interest wells less the recoupment of working interest expenditures under farmout agreements. Black Stone expects the farmout agreements entered into during 2017 will eliminate the substantial majority of its working interest capital expenditures by mid-2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, and distributable cash flow after net working interest capital expenditures should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP in the United States as measures of Black Stone's financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, and distributable cash flow after net working interest capital expenditures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Partnership's computation of Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, and distributable cash flow after net working interest capital expenditures may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, and distributable cash flow after net working interest capital expenditures to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 (Unaudited) (In thousands)\n(Unaudited) (In thousands)\nNet income (loss) $ 19,360 $ (7,286 ) $ 157,153 $ 20,188 Adjustments to reconcile to Adjusted EBITDA: Depreciation, depletion and amortization 30,051 22,833 114,534 102,487 Interest expense 4,034 2,774 15,694 7,547 Impairment of oil and natural gas properties — — — 6,775 Accretion of asset retirement obligations 266 212 1,026 892 Equity-based compensation 1 14,431 10,018 33,045 43,138 Unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivative instruments 11,357 29,738 (11,691 ) 81,253 Adjusted EBITDA 79,499 58,289 309,761 262,280 Adjustments to distributable cash flow: Deferred revenue (416 ) (695 ) (2,086 ) (870 ) Cash interest expense (3,818 ) (2,497 ) (14,817 ) (6,676 ) (Gain) loss on sales of assets, net — (21 ) (931 ) (4,793 ) Estimated replacement capital expenditures 2 (3,250 ) (3,750 ) (13,500 ) (11,250 ) Cash paid to noncontrolling interests (30 ) (28 ) (120 ) (111 ) Preferred unit distributions (2,590 ) (1,324 ) (5,042 ) (5,763 ) Distributable cash flow 69,395 49,974 273,265 232,817 Net working interest capital expenditures (5,389 ) (17,140 ) (39,477 ) (80,179 ) Distributable cash flow after net working interest capital expenditures $ 64,006 $ 32,834 $ 233,788 $ 152,638 1 On April 25, 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved a resolution to change the settlement feature of certain employee long-term incentive compensation plans from cash to equity. As a result of the modification, $10.1 million of cash-settled liabilities were reclassified to equity-settled liabilities during the second quarter of 2016. 2 On August 3, 2016, the board of directors of our general partner established a replacement capital expenditures estimate of $15.0 million for the period of April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017; there was no established estimate of replacement capital expenditures prior to this period. On June 8, 2017, the board of directors of our general partner established a replacement capital expenditure estimate of $13.0 million for the period of April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.
