REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann \nShe was also mindful of how it could all come crashing down in the final run, as happened to her long-time team mate Loch, whose title defence was ruined with a single mistake when the gold was there for the taking. \n“Yesterday we saw what could happen if you make a little mistake and you have a big, big, big time losing,” the 30-year-old told reporters. \n”It was hard for us yesterday because I trained with Felix for almost 20 years. We had so many successes. We’ve been in Sochi, in the team relay, Olympic champions. It was hard. \n”That’s sport, that’s life, such mistakes can happen. \n“My goal for me tomorrow is hopefully that it will not happen.” \nA boisterous crowd lined much of the track and exploded into cheers when German-born Aileen Christina Frisch, a naturalised South Korean citizen, completed a strong second run to place fifth. \nErin Hamlin, the bronze winner in Sochi and first American woman to claim an Olympic luge medal, was sixth.
