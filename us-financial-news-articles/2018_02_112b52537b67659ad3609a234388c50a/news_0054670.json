Security Council resolution calling for an immediate, month-long ceasefire in Syria.\nThe two European Union leaders appealed to Putin -- whose military intervention in Syria gave President Bashar al-Assad the upper hand in the seven-year-old conflict -- to stop bombardments of the rebel-held pocket of eastern Ghouta.\nWarplanes from Assad’s government forces and their allies pounded the densely populated enclave east of the capital Damascus for a sixth straight day on Friday.\n“France and Germany call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the implementation of a ceasefire to provide civilian support, humanitarian access and medical evacuation, as called for by the UN,” the two governments said.\n“France and Germany call on Russia to shoulder its responsibilities in this regard,” they said in a joint statement.\nDiplomatic sources told Reuters Merkel and Macron were also due to call Putin together after the vote in New York.\nMoscow, which has the power to veto U.N. Security Council resolutions, has often in the past blocked texts that would be damaging to Assad.\nRussia said on Friday it was ready to support the draft resolution, but with caveats.\n“There are no guarantees that (the rebels) will not continue shooting at Damascus residential areas,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a briefing.\n“That’s why for the resolution to be efficient -- and we are ready to agree on the text which would make it so -- we propose a formula which would make the ceasefire real, based on the guarantees of all who are inside eastern Ghouta and outside eastern Ghouta,” Lavrov said.\nThe EU as a whole has only played a marginal role in the international diplomacy around the conflict in Syria, where the multi-sided war has killed hundreds of thousands and driven millions from their homes.\nThe bloc is trying to leverage its role as the world’s top aid donor to woo Assad back into the stalled U.N. peace talks, which have achieved little over the years.\nThe talks are now deadlocked as Damascus, Moscow and their other ally Tehran attempt a final push to re-establish Assad’s rule.\nAdditional reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel, Andreas Rinke and Jean-Baptiste Vey; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:35:46.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
