But it is heavy. The cars are getting heavier. It’s a big car but streamlined as much as it can be.”\nHe hoped also that Mercedes had “ironed out some of the creases” from last year with a narrower and more tightly packaged car, whose official F1 W09 EQ Power+ name is already quite a mouthful.\nLast year’s car won 12 of the 20 races, with Ferrari triumphant five times and Red Bull three, but was swiftly declared to be a ‘diva’ because of its nature.\n“We hope that we keep the good character traits of the diva, we all like divas,” said Wolff.\n”But sometimes she was a bit difficult to understand and this is the area where we worked the most, trying to understand and preserve what we have in terms of speed in the car and equally find more driveability.\n“We have tried like in the past years to stay true to our design philosophy, continue to develop what was already a solid base.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:46:41.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
