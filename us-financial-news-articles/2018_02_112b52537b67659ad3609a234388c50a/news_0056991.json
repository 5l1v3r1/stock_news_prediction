The firm, which specializes in selling urban-core high-rise condominiums and creating unique marketing campaigns led by market specific experts, has relocated to larger offices in downtown Los Angeles to accommodate new senior executives hired to support the company's burgeoning growth.\nRegarded for its sales success at TEN50 , the first new construction condo tower to open in downtown in nearly a decade, Polaris Pacific will spearhead sales and marketing for two new high-profile condominium projects downtown â€“ a 140-residence condominium building located at 1150 Wilshire Boulevard and a 208-residence condominium tower located at 1133 South Hope Street. The team has also been engaged to lead sales and marketing for West Grove, a 23-residence condominium community under construction in Pasadena, as well as ongoing preconstruction work for many of Southern California's top developers.\nAccording to Polaris Pacific's January 2018 research report, the ever-growing demand for new construction condominium product in downtown Los Angeles continues to exceed available supply. While more than 8,000 rental units are slated to hit the Los Angeles market this year, only 3,355 condominiums are currently approved or under construction in downtown.\n\"The sales success we've experienced to date at TEN50 is a clear indication that the market is primed for continuous growth as more homebuyers realize the tremendous value of urban walkable neighborhoods positioned close to jobs and entertainment,\" said Managing Partner Garrett Frakes. \"With the continued growth in Southern California, it was natural for the company to expand our leadership team and presence in order to maintain an extraordinarily high level of customer service.\"\nVice President, Regional Manager Mike Akerly will oversee the company's portfolio and continued strategic growth in Los Angeles, while new team members, Project Director Christina Milovancev and Marketing Director Kara Schultz, will be tasked with supporting sales and marketing efforts for the region. Rachel Weaver, New Business Development Manager, has also relocated from the company's San Francisco office to help grow the Southern California portfolio. The new executives will augment Polaris Pacific's existing robust Los Angeles team responsible for the upcoming completion of sales at TEN50.\nChristina Milovancev previously worked in London as Director of Residential Marketing for CBRE and Head of Marketing for Mount Anvil, one of the leading residential development firms in Central London, where she led marketing efforts for some of the city's most influential residential communities.\nKara Schultz's background includes ten years with Pandiscio in New York City, a strategic branding and marketing agency, and RFR Holding, a privately held real estate investment, development and management firm. She has also held a variety of sales and management positions with The Four Seasons Residence Club in Costa Rica.\n\"Downtown Los Angeles has become a focal point for technology, media, and finance as well as a new residential destination for working professionals, couples and families,\" added Mr. Akerly. \"As we take on new high-profile condominium projects in DTLA and around the region, our enhanced footprint in this market will be a tremendous benefit to our developer clients who rely on us for our unparalleled market expertise and proven sales and marketing capabilities.\"\nPolaris Pacific's Los Angeles office is located Downtown in the 777 Tower at 777 South Figueroa.\nAbout Polaris Pacific\nPolaris Pacific is the leading real estate sales and marketing group for today's high-density residential communities.
