It won’t work. It’ll fail again.” \nRelations between the United States and Cuba have soured since Trump took office vowing to roll back the normalization of relations instigated by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini \nMany analysts say that by taking a tougher line on Cuba, Trump is pushing Havana to batten down the hatches rather than continue its economic and social opening, thereby achieving the opposite of his stated aim. \nAs U.S.-Cuba rapprochement unfolded in 2015-2016, Cuba significantly expanded internet access, introducing Wi-Fi hotspots in public spaces around the country and hooking more homes up to the web. \nA handful of independent, web-based news outlets emerged too, chipping away at Cuba’s half-century state media monopoly. \nThose media however have come under fire over the past week by pro-government commentators in Cuba, who say they are part of the U.S. strategy of subversion via Internet. \n“All the web pages of ‘independent’ media launched or recruited to integrate them into the strategy of the Obama government can be read without any obstacle in Cuba,” Javier Gómez Sánchez wrote on one blog, listing some of the most prominent alternative news outlets.
