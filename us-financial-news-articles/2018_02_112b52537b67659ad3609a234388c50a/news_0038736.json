In terms of consolidated cash operating cost per ounce 1 and AISC per ounce 1 , both results ($763 and $944 respectively) were below the bottom end of the guidance ranges. These results also represent a 13% decrease in cash operating cost per ounce 1 and a 14% decrease in AISC per ounce 1 compared to FY 2016. Additionally, Golden Star's consolidated cost of sales per ounce 1 was $998. As Prestea Underground was in pre-commercial production during 2017, its gold production and operating exenditures 1 were capitalized. Golden Star's total capital expenditures for the year were $69.6 million, in line with its guidance of $69.3 million.\nThe Company intends to focus on high margin ore in 2018 and to become a primarily underground-focused gold producer. As a result, gold production is expected to decrease by 5-14% in FY 2018 compared to FY 2017. However by focusing on higher grade, underground ore, Golden Star expects to deliver a lower cash operating cost per ounce 1 (expected decrease of 4-15%) and AISC per ounce 1 (decrease of up to 10%) than in FY 2017. This is anticipated to strengthen the Company's financial position and give it a robust platform to deliver shareholder value.\nAccordingly, 2018 guidance is as follows:\nGold production of 230,000-255,000 ounces Cash operating cost per ounce 1 of $650-$730 AISC per ounce 1 of $850-$950 Capital expenditures of $36.5 million\nFrom a development perspective, Golden Star continued to advance both of its underground mines, ramping up production during the course of 2017. Commercial production was declared at the Wassa Underground Gold Mine (\"Wassa Underground\") on January 1, 2017 and the Company began to access the higher grade B Shoot zone in late March 2017. Golden Star outperformed its planned mining rate of 1,400 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") at Wassa Underground by 33% in FY 2017, achieving 1,866 tpd on average. At Prestea Underground, the first stope was blasted by Golden Star's mining operations in late September 2017 and commercial production was achieved on February 1, 2018, post-period end.\nFourth quarter of 2017\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017 consolidated production was 71,769 ounces of gold, representing a 34% increase compared to the same period in 2016. Golden Star's consolidated cash operating cost per ounce 1 decreased by 8% to $812 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and its AISC per ounce 1 decreased by 16% to $1,002. The consolidated cost of sales per ounce 1 was $1,111.\nNotes\n1.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nWassa Complex (\"Wassa\")\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\nWASSA FINANCIAL RESULTS\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenue\n$'000\n$\n51,628\n$\n24,785\n$\n167,376\n$\n112,341\nMine operating expenses\n$'000\n31,012\n23,139\n115,625\n92,938\nSeverance charges\n$'000\n5,217\n—\n6,316\n113\nRoyalties\n$'000\n2,682\n1,770\n8,652\n6,483\nOperating costs from/(to) metals inventory\n$'000\n1,253\n(161)\n5,080\n(5,149)\nInventory net realizable value adjustment\n$'000\n—\n1,190\n2,410\n1,190\nCost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization\n$'000\n40,164\n25,938\n138,083\n95,575\nDepreciation and amortization\n$'000\n5,440\n4,202\n20,052\n15,094\nMine operating margin/(loss)\n$'000\n$\n6,024\n$\n(5,355)\n$\n9,241\n$\n1,672\nCapital expenditures\n$'000\n8,470\n10,155\n21,583\n41,805\nWASSA OPERATING RESULTS\nOre mined – Main Pit\nt\n520,482\n513,144\n1,601,004\n2,311,503\nOre mined – Underground\nt\n171,907\n118,896\n681,141\n185,314\nOre mined – Total\nt\n692,389\n632,040\n2,282,145\n3,496,817\nWaste mined – Main Pit\nt\n1,043,854\n2,151,267\n6,037,366\n9,741,312\nWaste mined - Underground\nt\n60,054\n45,305\n199,550\n233,225\nWaste mined - Total\nt\n1,103,908\n2,196,572\n6,236,916\n9,974,537\nOre processed - Main Pit\nt\n476,828\n593,286\n1,925,587\n2,444,339\nOre processed - Underground\nt\n179,186\n115,602\n691,255\n178,255\nOre processed - Total\nt\n656,014\n708,888\n2,616,842\n2,622,594\nGrade processed - Main Pit\ng/t\n1.38\n1.22\n1.27\n1.27\nGrade processed - Underground\ng/t\n4.04\n2.27\n3.03\n2.06\nRecovery\n%\n94.4\n92.9\n94.6\n93.6\nGold produced - Main Pit\noz\n21,149\n21,411\n75,736\n93,319\nGold produced - Underground\noz\n20,852\n7,865\n61,498\n11,062\nGold produced - Total\noz\n42,001\n29,276\n137,234\n104,381\nGold sold - Main Pit\noz\n20,775\n21,076\n75,644\n93,284\nGold sold - Underground\noz\n20,852\n7,867\n61,498\n11,062\nGold sold - Total\noz\n41,627\n28,943\n137,142\n104,346\nCost of sales per ounce 1\n$/oz\n1,096\n1,430\n1,153\n1,186\nCash operating cost per ounce 1\n$/oz\n775\n1,090\n880\n941\nNotes\n1.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nWassa Operational Overview\nGold production from the Wassa complex increased by 31% in FY 2017 to 137,234 ounces compared to FY 2016 due to the larger contribution of ounces from the higher grade Wassa Underground as it continued to ramp up. Wassa Underground produced 61,498 ounces in FY 2017, which represents 45% of Wassa's total production for the year. This compares to production of 11,062 ounces in FY 2016, when Wassa Underground's production represented just 11% of the Wassa complex's total gold production. Gold production from the Wassa complex in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 42,001 ounces, an increase of 43% compared to the same period in 2016. This included 20,852 ounces from Wassa Underground (50% of total production).\nGold production from Wassa Main Pit was 75,736 ounces in FY 2017 and 21,149 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2017. As previously announced, Golden Star took the decision during the third quarter of 2017 to defer the next pushback of Wassa Main Pit, Cut 3, to focus on the higher grade, higher margin underground ounces. This followed an internal study to assess capital expenditure requirements and margins in light of the current gold price. As a result, a severance charge of $5.2 million was recorded at the Wassa complex in the fourth quarter of 2017 as the mine's workforce was reduced. Wassa became an underground-only operation in late January 2018, although 341,000 tonnes of lower grade, stockpiled ore will continue to be fed to the processing plant during the first nine months of 2018.\nMining rates at Wassa Underground continued to be strong in the fourth quarter of 2017 at approximately 1,900 tpd, which represents a 36% outperformance compared to the planned mining rate for 2017 of 1,400 tpd. The average mining rate for FY 2017 was 1,866 tpd. The head grade of Wassa Underground's ore being delivered to the processing plant increased by 47%, compared to FY 2016, to 3.03 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") of gold (\"Au\") in FY 2017 as a result of mining operations accessing the higher grade B Shoot zone from late March 2017 onwards. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the head grade from Wassa Underground increased by 55% to 4.04 g/t Au compared to the third quarter of 2017 and by 78% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe average targeted mining rate for Wassa Underground in 2018 is 2,700-3,000 tpd, with the potential to expand further in time. The mining team is well-positioned to increase the tonnage profile in 2018, with the mining sequence working well and an increasing number of stopes prepared and developed, in addition to new equipment having arrived on site.\nWassa's cash operating cost per ounce 1 decreased by 6% in FY 2017 to $880 compared to FY 2016 as a result of the increase in gold sold. Wassa's cash operating cost per ounce 1 in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $775, representing a decrease of 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of sales per ounce 1 for Wassa was $1,153 in FY 2017 and $1,096 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCommercial production was declared at Wassa Underground on January 1, 2017 and as a result, capital expenditures for FY 2016 decreased by 48% to $21.6 million compared to FY 2016. The majority of this amount was development capital ($14.1 million), which comprised $8.5 million relating to the development of Wassa Underground, $3.7 million of exploration drilling and $1.9 million for the improvement of the tailings storage facility. The remaining $7.5 million relates to sustaining capital. During the fourth quarter of 2017, capital expenditures totaled $10.2 million, which included $4.2 million of development capital, primarily for the development of Wassa Underground and exploration drilling.\nNotes\n1.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nPrestea Complex (\"Prestea\")\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nPRESTEA FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenue\n$'000\n$\n30,217\n$\n28,470\n$\n148,121\n$\n108,949\nMine operating expenses\n$'000\n21,952\n17,021\n81,753\n73,046\nSeverance charges\n$'000\n2,833\n—\n2,916\n(184)\nRoyalties\n$'000\n1,938\n1,468\n8,643\n5,599\nOperating costs to metals inventory\n$'000\n(486)\n(433)\n(4,913)\n(1,420)\nCost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization\n$'000\n26,237\n18,056\n88,399\n77,041\nDepreciation and amortization\n$'000\n1,655\n1,915\n11,740\n6,066\nMine operating margin\n$'000\n$\n2,325\n$\n8,499\n$\n47,982\n$\n25,842\nCapital expenditures\n$'000\n8,281\n13,530\n48,055\n42,413\nPRESTEA OPERATING RESULTS\nOre mined – Open Pits\nt\n300,247\n341,246\n1,462,607\n1,499,656\nOre mined - Underground\nt\n19,458\n—\n31,740\n—\nWaste mined – Open Pits\nt\n912,509\n614,805\n3,496,148\n4,039,768\nWaste mined - Underground\nt\n6,254\n—\n26,303\n—\nOre processed\nt\n465,179\n377,580\n1,632,979\n1,504,139\nGrade processed – Open Pits\ng/t\n2.39\n2.51\n2.85\n2.21\nGrade processed - Underground\ng/t\n8.41\n—\n6.96\n—\nRecovery\n%\n82.6\n83.0\n86.4\n83.9\nGold produced - Open Pits\noz\n24,723\n24,128\n121,757\n89,673\nGold produced - Underground\noz\n5,045\n—\n8,574\n—\nGold produced - Total\noz\n29,768\n24,128\n130,331\n89,673\nGold sold - Open Pits\noz\n24,536\n23,893\n121,619\n89,517\nGold sold - Underground\noz\n5,045\n—\n8,574\n—\nGold sold - Total\noz\n29,581\n23,893\n130,193\n89,517\nCost of sales per ounce 1\n$/oz\n1,137\n836\n823\n928\nCash operating cost per ounce 1\n$/oz\n875\n694\n632\n800\nNotes\n1.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nPrestea Operational Overview\nGold production from the Prestea complex increased by 45% in FY 2017 to 130,331 ounces compared to FY 2016. This was primarily as a result of the contribution from the high grade Mampon deposit and Prestea Underground. The Prestea complex also exceeded the top end of its upwardly revised FY 2017 production guidance of 120,000-130,000 ounces. Gold production in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 23% to 29,768 ounces compared to the same period in 2016.\nGold production from the Prestea Open Pits increased by 36% to 121,757 ounces in FY 2017, compared to FY 2016. This represents a 74% outperformance compared to the top end of the Company's original 2017 guidance for these assets. In the fourth quarter of 2017 the pits delivered 24,723 ounces, which is a 2% increase compared to the same period in 2016. The Prestea Open Pits were expected to complete gold production at the end of 2017 but it is now anticipated that mining will continue until late in the first quarter of 2018 and processing of stockpiled ore will continue until the end of the first half of 2018. A severance charge of $2.8 million was recorded at the Prestea complex during the fourth quarter of 2017 as the Prestea Open Pits' workforce begins to be reduced in advance of the end of their minelife.\nGold production from Prestea Underground was 8,574 ounces in FY 2017 and 5,045 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2017, which represents a 57% increase compared to the third quarter of 2017. However production in the fourth quarter of 2017 was lower than anticipated due to weaker than expected blasting performance in the first stope. After conducting an internal review, various adjustments have been made to drill design patterns, blasting practices and raise layouts in order to improve blasting efficiencies. As a result, in-stope productivity has increased and progress with subsequent stopes has accelerated. With the production sequence progressing well, commercial production was declared at Prestea Underground on February 1, 2018, post-period end.\nThe Prestea complex's cash operating cost per ounce 1 decreased by 21% in FY 2017 to $632 compared to FY 2016. This result is 7% below the lower end of the downwardly revised $680-725 guidance range. This robust outperformance was primarily as a result of the 36% increase in gold sold from the Prestea Open Pits resulting from the 29% increase in head grade being fed to the Prestea processing plant. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Prestea complex delivered a cash operating cost per ounce 1 of $875. The cost of sales per ounce 1 at Prestea in FY 2017 was $823 and in the fourth quarter of 2017 it was $1,137.\nTotal capital expenditures for FY 2017 at Prestea were $48.1 million, a 13% increase compared to the same period in 2016. This is as a result of an increase in development capital expenditures, totaling $42.4 million, which were incurred primarily on advancing Prestea Underground towards production ($36.8 million). Other development capital related to the Prestea Open Pits ($1.2 million) and exploration drilling ($1.5 million). Total capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $8.3 million, with $6.8 million relating to the development of Prestea Underground.\nNotes\n1.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nExploration\nFourth Quarter of 2017 Exploration Update\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017 Golden Star's exploration team was focused on in-fill and expansion drilling of Wassa Underground's Inferred Mineral Resources and exploratory drilling of the South Gap at Prestea Underground, which is situated between two historical shafts (Bondaye and Tuapim).\nThree rigs were employed at Wassa Underground, drilling seven deep holes for 5,055 metres. These holes were drilled from the surface to test the potential extensions of the B Shoot and F Shoot gold mineralization at depth to the south and to assess the geometry and continuity of these mineralized corridors. This work received positive results and the drilling to the south confirmed that the ore body remains open down plunge. Further drilling is expected to be conducted in 2018, investigating the significant intercepts received in 2017.\nAt Prestea Underground, one rig was used to drill the South Gap and it completed nine holes for a total of 3,000 metres 1 . This initial 100 metre spaced drilling program will be followed up in 2018 by drill testing of the areas where economic underground gold grades and structure widths were intersected.\nThe Company expects to release further drilling results from the South Gap later in the first quarter of 2018, in addition to its exploration strategy for 2018. An overview of Golden Star's exploration program in FY 2017 can be found in the Company's Management Discussion & Analysis.\nNotes\n1.\nThis includes two holes that were drilled at the end of the third quarter of 2017.\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCapital Expenditures\nGolden Star incurred capital expenditures in FY 2017 totaling $69.6 million, a decrease of 17% compared to FY 2016 as a result of Wassa Underground achieving commercial production on January 1, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, capital expenditures were $16.8 million, a decrease of 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFY 2017 Capital Expenditures Breakdown (in millions) 1\nItem\nSustaining\nDevelopment\nTotal\nWassa Exploration Drilling\n-\n$3.7\n$3.7\nWassa Main Pit and Processing Plant\n$0.1\n-\n$0.1\nWassa Tailings Expansion\n-\n$1.9\n$1.9\nWassa Underground\n$1.2\n$8.5\n$9.7\nWassa Equipment Purchases\n$6.2\n-\n$6.2\nWassa Subtotal\n$7.5\n$14.1\n$21.6\nPrestea Exploration Drilling\n-\n$1.8\n$1.8\nPrestea Open Pits\n$2.1\n$1.2\n$3.3\nMampon Development\n$3.5\n-\n$3.5\nPrestea Underground\n-\n$39.4\n$39.4\nPrestea Subtotal\n$5.6\n$42.4\n$48.0\nConsolidated\n$13.1\n$56.5\n$69.6\nFourth Quarter 2017 Capital Expenditures Breakdown (in millions) 1\nItem\nSustaining\nDevelopment\nTotal\nWassa Exploration Drilling\n-\n$1.0\n$1.0\nWassa Tailings Expansion\n-\n$0.3\n$0.3\nWassa Underground\n$0.4\n$3.0\n$3.4\nWassa Equipment Purchases\n$3.8\n-\n$3.8\nWassa Subtotal\n$4.2\n$4.3\n$8.5\nPrestea Exploration Drilling\n-\n$0.5\n$0.5\nPrestea Open Pits\n$0.3\n$0.5\n$0.8\nMampon Development\n$0.2\n-\n$0.2\nPrestea Underground\n-\n$6.8\n$6.8\nPrestea Subtotal\n$0.5\n$7.8\n$8.3\nConsolidated\n$4.7\n$12.1\n$16.8\nNotes\n1.\nPlease note variance to consolidated total relates to corporate capital expenditures.\nOther Financial Highlights\nGold revenues for FY 2017 totaled $315.5 million from gold sales of 267,335 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,219 per ounce. This represents a 43% increase in revenue compared to FY 2016, due primarily to the revenue attributable to Wassa Underground after achieving commercial production on January 1, 2017. Gold revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $81.8 million from gold sales of 71,208 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,237 per ounce, compared to gold revenues of $53.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 from gold sales of 52,836 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,184. The 54% increase in gold revenues was due primarily to higher gold production at Wassa Underground. Gold revenues from the Wassa complex increased by 108% during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of an increase in gold ounces sold at the underground operation, which achieved commercial production on January 1, 2017. Gold revenues from the Prestea complex increased by 6% during the fourth quarter of 2017 as gold sales attributable to the Prestea Open Pits increased by 3% compared to the same period in 2016.\nCost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization for the full year totaled $226.5 million, an increase of 31% from $172.6 million in the same period in FY 2016, due mainly to a $9.2 million severance charge in FY 2017, an increase in inventory charge as a result of drawdown of stockpiles at Wassa, an increase in mining costs at Prestea due to higher haulage costs for the material mined at the Mampon deposit and an increase in mining costs at Wassa Underground, which were capitalized in FY 2016. Cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $66.4 million, compared to $44.0 million in the same period in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization for FY 2017 was $31.8 million, a 50% increase compared to 2016. Depreciation and amortization totaled $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $6.1 million in the same period in 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to the commencement of depreciation on Wassa Underground assets in FY 2017 as a result of achieving commercial production, higher production at both operations and lower Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates for the Prestea Open Pits compared to FY 2016.\nAs a result, Golden Star reported a mine operating margin of $57.2 million in FY 2017, an increase of 108% compared to FY 2016. This reflects the significant increase in gold revenues and the reduction in the Company's cost structure due to the ramping up of the two high grade, underground mines.\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses for FY 2017 totaled $25.1 million. G&A expenses excluding share-based compensation costs were $12.9 million in FY 2017, slightly higher than the same period in FY 2016. G&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $7.9 million. The increase in G&A costs in this period was due primarily to an increase in share-based compensation compared to the same period in FY 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in Golden Star's share price.\nGolden Star recorded a $2.1 million fair value gain on financial instruments in FY 2017 compared to a $25.7 million fair value loss for the same period in 2016 as the prior year loss included a fair value loss on the Company's 5% Convertible Debentures. In the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company recorded a $1.9 million loss on fair value of financial instruments compared to a $0.8 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2016. The loss relates to a non-cash revaluation loss on the embedded derivative of the Company's 7% Convertible Debentures. Further details of this loss and gain on financial instruments is included in Golden Star's Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nThe net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders in FY 2017 totaled $38.8 million or $0.10 income per share, compared to a net loss of $39.6 million or $0.13 loss per share for the same period in 2016. The 177% increase was due primarily to a higher mine operating margin at both operations, an income tax recovery and a gain on financial instruments in FY 2017 compared to a loss on financial instruments recognized in FY 2016. The net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $12.6 million or $0.03 income per share, compared to a net income of $3.4 million or $0.01 income per share in the same period in 2016. The net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2017 was due primarily to the deferred tax recovery recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to nil in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAfter certain adjustments, the adjusted net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders 1 in FY 2017 was $46.1 million, which represents an increase of 312% compared to the same period in 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, after certain adjustments, the adjusted net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders 1 was $15.2 million, compared to adjusted net income of $0.1 million for the same period in 2016. The higher adjusted net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders 1 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was principally due to a higher mine operating margin compared to the same periods in 2016.\nCash provided by operations in FY 2017 was $55.2 million or $0.15 per share, which compares to $53.2 million or $0.18 per share in FY 2016. Cash provided by operations before changes in working capital 1 for FY 2017 was $62.6 million or $0.17 per share, compared to $75.5 million or $0.26 per share in FY 2016. This decrease was due mainly to $60.0 million received in advance payments from RGLD Gold AG (\"RGLD\") in FY 2016 compared to $10.0 million received in FY 2017, offset by a higher mine operating margin in FY 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, cash provided by operations was $10.9 million or $0.03 per share, compared to $25.2 million or $0.08 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Cash provided by operations before changes in working capital 1 was $6.8 million or $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $23.9 million or $0.06 per share in same period in 2016.\nThe Company's consolidated cash balance was $27.8 million at the end of 2017. Working capital provided $4.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.3 million in the same period in 2016. The working capital changes in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to an increase of $5.4 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease of $0.8 million in accounts receivable, offset by an increase of $1.5 million in inventories and $0.5 million in prepaid and other.\nFor further information about Golden Star's operational and financial performance, please visit the Financial and Operational database at http://apps.indigotools.com/IR/IAC/?Ticker=GSC&Exchange=TSX The data relating to the FY and fourth quarter of 2017 will be available 24 hours after release at the latest.\nNotes\n1.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nOther Corporate Developments During FY 2017\nBought deal transaction\nIn February 2017 Golden Star completed a bought deal public offering. This resulted in the issuance of 31,363,950 common shares, including 4,090,950 common shares issued upon full exercise of the over-allotment option. The shares were issued at a price C$1.10 per share for net proceeds of $24.5 million.\n$25 million Medium Term Facility from Ecobank\nIn March 2017 the Company, through its subsidiary, Golden Star (Wassa) Limited, signed a commitment letter with Ecobank Ghana Limited regarding a $25.0 million secured Medium Term Loan facility. The facility has a term of 60 months from the date of initial drawdown and the interest rate on the loan is three month LIBOR plus 8% per annum. At December 31, 2017, the Company had drawn down $10.0 million and post-period end in late January 2018, the Company drew down the remaining $15.0 million to assist with the funding of the severance payments in the first half of 2018 at both Wassa and Prestea.\nAdvance payment under Streaming Agreement\nIn January 2017 Golden Star received the final advance payment of $10.0 million pursuant to the gold purchase and sales agreement with RGLD. Since the inception of the Streaming Agreement in July 2015, the Company has received total advance payments of $145.0 million. All advance payments under the Streaming Agreement have now been received.\nAwards Recognition\nIn November 2017 Golden Star was named as the winner of the PDAC 2018 Environmental and Social Responsibility Award. Selected by PDAC's Board of Directors, this award recognizes an organization that demonstrates outstanding initiative, leadership, and accomplishment in establishing and maintaining good relations with local communities and in protecting and preserving the natural environment during an exploration program or operation of a mine. Golden Star will be honored at an awards ceremony to be held during PDAC's annual convention in Toronto on March 6, 2018.\nAlso in November 2017, Golden Star's local subsidiary, Golden Star Bogoso/Prestea Limited (\"GSBPL\"), was named Mining Company of the Year at the Ghana Mining Industry Awards. Judged by a panel of industry professionals, the Mining Company of the Year Award recognizes an organization that has achieved the highest aggregate performance results in the categories of environmental management, occupational health and safety, corporate social investment, innovation and local content.\nThe Company also won:\nMining Personality of the Year for Golden Star's Chief Operating Officer, Daniel Owiredu, which was the inaugural award in this category Best Performer in Corporate Social Investment for Golden Star's breast cancer awareness program that involved screening over 10,400 women in Ghana during the past three years Best Graduate Research for Ahmed-Salim Adam, Process Manager at Golden Star's Prestea operations Runner Up in Occupational Health and Safety for GSBPL\nOutlook\nFor the second consecutive year, the consolidated guidance range for cash operating cost per ounce 1 and AISC per ounce 1 is materially lower than the previous year's guidance, reflecting Golden Star's significantly reducing cost structure.\nThe following tables set out Golden Star's full year 2018 guidance in terms of gold production, cash operating cost per ounce 1 , AISC per ounce 1 , and capital expenditures.\nGold Production and Operating Cost Guidance\nAsset\nGold Production\n(ounces)\nCash\nOperating Cost 1\n($/ounce)\nAISC 1\n($/ounce)\nWassa\n137,000-142,000\n600-650\n-\nPrestea\n93,000-113,000\n740-880\n-\nConsolidated\n230,000-255,000\n650-730\n850-950\nCapital Expenditures Guidance\nAsset\nSustaining\nCapital\n($ millions)\nDevelopment\nCapital\n($ millions)\nTotal Capital\nExpenditures\n($ millions)\nWassa\n14.7\n5.9\n20.6\nPrestea\n3.0\n6.3\n9.3\nExploration\n-\n6.6\n6.6\nConsolidated\n17.7\n18.8\n36.5\nNotes to tables:\n1.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nAll monetary amounts refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nCompany Profile\nGolden Star is an established gold mining company that owns and operates the Wassa and Prestea mines in Ghana, West Africa.

These should be considered as non-GAAP financial measures as defined in applicable Canadian and United States securities laws and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\"Cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization\" as found in the statements of operations includes all mine-site operating costs, including the costs of mining, ore processing, maintenance, work-in-process inventory changes, mine-site overhead as well as production taxes, royalties, severance charges and by-product credits, but excludes exploration costs, property holding costs, corporate office general and administrative expenses, foreign currency gains and losses, gains and losses on asset sales, interest expense, gains and losses on derivatives, gains and losses on investments and income tax expense/benefit.\n\"Cash operating cost\" for a period is equal to \"cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization\" for the period less royalties, the cash component of metals inventory net realizable value adjustments and severance charges, and \"cash operating cost per ounce\" is that amount divided by the number of ounces of gold sold (excluding pre-commercial production ounces sold) during the period. We use cash operating cost per ounce as a key operating metric. We monitor this measure monthly, comparing each month's values to prior periods' values to detect trends that may indicate increases or decreases in operating efficiencies. We provide this measure to investors to allow them to also monitor operational efficiencies of the Company's mines. We calculate this measure for both individual operating units and on a consolidated basis. Since cash operating costs do not incorporate revenues, changes in working capital and non-operating cash costs, they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Changes in numerous factors including, but not limited to, mining rates, milling rates, ore grade, gold recovery, costs of labor, consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease. We believe that these measures are similar to the measures of other gold mining companies, but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance.\n\"All-in sustaining costs\" commences with cash operating costs and then adds the cash component of metals net realizable value adjustment, royalties, sustaining capital expenditures, corporate general and administrative costs (excluding share-based compensation expenses), and accretion of rehabilitation provision. \"All-in sustaining costs per ounce\" is that amount divided by the number of ounces of gold sold (excluding pre-commercial production ounces sold) during the period. This measure seeks to represent the total costs of producing gold from current operations, and therefore it does not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions, exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects, income tax payments, interest costs or dividend payments. Consequently, this measure is not representative of all of the Company's cash expenditures. In addition, the calculation of all-in sustaining costs does not include depreciation expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods. Therefore, it is not indicative of the Company's overall profitability. Share-based compensation expenses are now also excluded from the calculation of all-in sustaining costs as the Company believes that such expenses may not be representative of the actual payout on equity and liability based awards. Share-based compensation expenses were previously included in the calculation of all-in sustaining costs. The Company has presented comparative figures to conform with the computation of all-in sustaining costs as currently calculated by the Company.\nThe Company believes that \"all-in sustaining costs\" will better meet the needs of analysts, investors and other stakeholders of the Company in understanding the costs associated with producing gold, understanding the economics of gold mining, assessing the operating performance and also the Company's ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and to generate free cash flow on an overall Company basis. Due to the capital intensive nature of the industry and the long useful lives over which these items are depreciated, there can be a disconnect between net earnings calculated in accordance with IFRS and the amount of free cash flow that is being generated by a mine.\n\"Cash provided by operations before working capital changes\" is calculated by subtracting the \"changes in working capital\" from \"net cash provided by operating activities\" as found in the statements of cash flows. \"Cash provided by operations before working capital changes per share - basic\" is \"Cash provided by operations before working capital changes\" divided by the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.\n\"Adjusted net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders\" is calculated by adjusting Net income/(loss) attributable to Golden Star shareholders for (gain)/loss on fair value of financial instruments, share-based compensation expenses, loss on conversion of 7% Convertible Debentures, severance charges and income tax recovery on previously unrecognized deferred tax assets. \"Adjusted income per share attributable to Golden Star shareholders\" for the period is \"Adjusted net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders\" divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding using the basic method of earnings per share.\nChanges in numerous factors including, but not limited to, our share price, risk free interest rates, gold prices, mining rates, milling rates, ore grade, gold recovery, costs of labor, consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease. The Company believes that these measures are similar to the measures of other gold mining companies, but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance.\nIn the current market environment for gold mining equities, many investors and analysts are more focused on the ability of gold mining companies to generate free cash flow from current operations, and consequently the Company believes these measures are useful non-IFRS operating metrics (\"non-GAAP measures\") and supplement the IFRS disclosures made by the Company. These measures are not representative of all of Golden Star's cash expenditures as they do not include income tax payments or interest costs.

The terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\" and \"probable mineral reserve\" are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101. These definitions differ from the definitions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") set forth in Industry Guide 7 under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.\nIn addition, the terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101, however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. \"Inferred mineral resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations, however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC Industry Guide 7 standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.\nFor the above reasons, information contained in this news release or in the documents referenced herein containing descriptions of our mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nSOURCE Golden Star Resources Ltd.", "external_links": ["http://apps.indigotools.com/IR/IAC/?Ticker=GSC&Exchange=TSX", "http://www.gsr.com/", "http://www.sedar.com/"], "published": "2018-02-21T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T05:18:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
