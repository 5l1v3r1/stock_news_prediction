(Parkway) (OTC QX: PKKW) – the holding company for Skyline National Bank – announced fourth quarter 2017 earnings.\nResults of Operations for the Three Months and 2016\nParkway recorded a net loss of $214 thousand, or $0.04 per share for the quarter compared to net income of $397 thousand, or $0.08 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The loss was due to a nonrecurring charge to income tax expense to reflect the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The new legislation reduced tax rates effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a re-measurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities. The change in value of the Company's deferred tax assets was recorded as an addition to current income tax expense of $1.44 million for the three-month period . Income tax expense related to ordinary operations totaled $522 thousand for 2017 compared to $159 thousand for 2016. Net income before income taxes totaled $1.74 million or $0.35 per share for the quarter compared to $556 thousand or $0.11 per share for the same period in 2016. The increase in pretax earnings of $1.19 million from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to an increase in net interest income combined with a decrease in noninterest expenses. Net income, without the impact of the one-time charge to income tax expense, totaled $1.22 million or $0.24 per share for the quarter .\nTotal interest income increased by $245 thousand for the quarter compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest income was attributable primarily to an increase in the average balance of loans outstanding during the period as the bank's loan portfolio grew by $12.9 million, or 3.13% in 2017. Accretion of purchased loan discounts decreased by $131 thousand in 2017 compared to 2016; however, this decrease was offset by recoveries of previously charged off interest totaling $132 thousand during the quarter.\nInterest expense on deposits increased by $61 thousand due primarily to a reduction in the accretion of purchase discounts applied to time deposits acquired in the Cardinal merger. Accretion of time deposit discounts totaled $36 thousand for 2017 compared to $107 thousand for the same quarter in 2016. Interest expense on borrowings decreased by $96 thousand due to a reduction in borrowings of $10.0 million in 2016. The result was an increase in net interest income of $280 thousand for the quarter , compared to the same quarter last year. The increase in net interest income was reflected in the Bank's net interest margin which increased to 4.36% for 2017, compared to 4.26% in the third quarter of 2017 and 3.97% for 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses was a negative $16 thousand for the quarter , compared to a negative $19 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The reserve for loan losses at December 31, 2017 was approximately 0.81% of total loans, compared to 0.83% at December 31, 2016. Management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the acquired Cardinal loan portfolio was reflected as a purchase discount which will continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the acquired loans. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining unaccreted discount on the acquired loan portfolio totaled $3.97 million.\nTotal noninterest income was $1.30 million in 2017 compared to $1.67 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a nonrecurring bargain purchase gain of $709 thousand related to the Cardinal merger which was recognized in 2016. Noninterest income in 2017 also included nonrecurring securities gains of $116 thousand and a gain on the disposal of fixed assets totaling $188 thousand. Excluding these nonrecurring items, noninterest income increased by $38 thousand for the quarter compared to the same period last year.\nTotal noninterest expenses decreased by $1.28 million for the quarter compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016 due mainly to a reduction in merger related expenses resulting from the Cardinal merger. Salaries and employee benefit expenses decreased by $315 thousand as reductions in the total number of employees offset normal increases in salaries and other benefit costs. Merger related expenses totaled $763 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to $50 thousand for the quarter .\nPresident and CEO Allan Funk stated, \"We continue to be pleased with our quarterly earnings. Without the one-time charge related to the value of our deferred tax assets, our net earnings for the quarter totaled $1.22 million which continues our trend of increased quarterly earnings since the completion of our merger in the third quarter of 2016.\"\nResults of Operations for the Years and 2016\nAs previously announced, Grayson Bankshares, Inc. (Grayson) and Cardinal Bankshares Corporation (Cardinal) merged with and into Parkway on July 1, 2016, with Parkway as the surviving corporation. Immediately following that merger, Cardinal's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Bank of Floyd, merged with and into Grayson's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Grayson National Bank. Effective March 13, 2017, Grayson National Bank's name was changed to Skyline National Bank. (For accounting purposes, Grayson is considered the acquiror and Cardinal is considered the acquiree in the transaction. As such, all information contained herein as of and for periods prior to July 1, 2016 reflects the operations of Grayson prior to the merger.)\nFor the year , total interest income increased by $4.71 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As noted above, the Cardinal merger was completed on July 1, 2016; therefore, the operating results for 2016 include only six months of combined earnings along with six months of Grayson earnings prior to the merger. Accordingly, the increases in interest income on loans and investment securities for the year were due primarily to the increased volume resulting from the merger. The increases in interest income on federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in banks were due more to increases in overnight borrowing rates established by the Federal Reserve. Interest expense on deposits increased by $187 thousand in 2017 compared to 2016 as interest expense on acquired deposit balances was partially offset by decreases in deposit rates due to higher-yielding time deposits repricing to lower rates or migrating to lower-yielding non-maturity deposits. Interest on borrowings decreased by $441 thousand due to the repayment of $20.0 million in borrowings in 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses for the year was $217 thousand, compared to a negative $5 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. Asset quality has remained relatively consistent over the past year therefore the noted increase in loan loss provisions was due primarily to overall growth in the loan portfolio.\nNoninterest income decreased by $342 thousand in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was due to the nonrecurring bargain purchase gain of $891 thousand which was recognized in 2016. Without this gain, noninterest income increased by $549 thousand in 2017, due primarily to increases in service charges and fees resulting from additional accounts acquired through the merger with Cardinal.\nTotal noninterest expenses increased by $2.46 million, or 14.65% for the year , compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As noted above, the overall increase in expenses for the comparative periods was due primarily to the effective date of the Cardinal merger as the 2016 expenses reflect only six months of combined operations and six months of Grayson's operating expenses prior to the merger date. Accordingly, salaries and employee benefits increased by $1.65 million due to the increase in the number of employees, and occupancy and equipment costs increased by $603 thousand due to the addition of seven banking facilities.\nIn total, income before taxes increased by $1.94 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Income tax expense increased by $1.93 million due mainly to the aforementioned $1.44 million charge to the value of our deferred tax assets. Net income for 2017 totaled $2.43 million or $0.48 per share, compared to $2.42 million, or $0.60 per share for 2016. Net income for 2017 would have totaled $3.86 million, or $0.77 per share, without the one-time charge to tax expense to revalue our deferred tax assets.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets decreased by $10.90 million, or 1.95%, from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, due to continued reductions in interest-bearing deposits. Cash and cash equivalent balances decreased by $13.03 million and investment securities decreased by $11.87 million. The reduction in cash and investments was used to fund net loan growth of $12.87 million as well as the aforementioned reduction in deposits. Loan growth, combined with the decrease in deposits, resulted in an increase in the company's loan to deposit ratio to 86.28% at December 31, 2017 compared to 81.81% at December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest bearing deposits increased by $3.62 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, while interest bearing deposits decreased by $14.57 million over the same time period. The decrease in interest bearing deposits came primarily in the form of higher yielding certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. This reflected the continuation of a management strategy to allow the run-off of legacy higher-yielding deposits which were on the books of Grayson and Cardinal prior to the merger.\nStockholders' equity totaled $57.18 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $55.5 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in equity resulted from earnings of $2.43 million, less a net change in accumulated other comprehensive losses totaling $156 thousand, and the payment of dividends of $803 thousand. Tangible book value increased from $10.58 per share at December 31, 2016 to $10.98 per share at December 31, 2017. The Bank remains well capitalized with Common equity tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, Total risk based capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 12.33%, 12.33%, 13.14%, and 9.81%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\nForward-looking statements\nThis release contains certain within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934 as amended.
