He cited the stronger-than-expected January jobs report and traders overplaying the impact of tax cuts. \nStocks futures were sharply lower Tuesday, with Dow futures down more than 500 points at one point. \nMonday was the worst day for the Dow and S&P 500 since August 2011 as well as the biggest single-day point drop for the Dow in history. The Dow broke below 25,000 and erased its 2018 gains. \nThere's no \"puzzle\" for the market's decline, Siegel said Tuesday. People were worried about rising interest rates and inflation and they \"jumped off the train,\" he said. \n\"The market worked extremely well, and we're getting down to reasonable levels now,\" Siegel said. \"People who buy this morning a year from now are going to say, 'OK, I think I've got a good price.'\" \nRichard Turnill, chief Investment strategist at BlackRock Global, also doesn't see the skid as an end to the bull market. Like Siegel, he says it's an opportunity for investors to buy into attractive areas after January's record highs. \n\"These periods of volatility are common in bull markets, Turnill said Tuesday on \"Squawk Box.\" \"Focus on the longer term. Focus on the strong fundamentals. Valuations remain reasonable and are getting cheaper particular outside the U.S.\" Morning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup \nSign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
