I told him that hopefully we’ll be back in this game with him leading the way,” Pederson said.\nWentz, Philadelphia’s regular quarterback, put the Eagles in position for a postseason run with his high caliber play before suffering a season-ending knee injury in December.\nFoles took over, finishing a 13-3 regular season and leading the Eagles to playoff victories over the Atlanta Falcons, Minnesota Vikings and New England.\nThe 29-year-old played like a veteran starter in the Super Bowl, passing for 373 yards and three touchdowns and catching a fourth-down pass from tight end Trey Burton to put Philadelphia up 22-12 before the half in perhaps the most remarkable play of the game.\nNFL Football - Philadelphia Eagles v New England Patriots - Super Bowl LII - U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S. - February 4, 2018.

We’re just going to enjoy this moment.\n“I‘m happy for Nick, I‘m happy for the team. It’s not about one guy, it’s about the team. Like I said, we’re going to enjoy these next few days.”\nFoles, who is under contract for one more year, would not be drawn on the possibility of a different role next season.\n“I am not really worried about the future right now,” he said. “I‘m just living in the moment.”\nHe added that he looked forward to working again with his friend Wentz.\n“I am excited with Carson coming back,” Foles said. “The dude is a stud.”\nReporting by Gene Cherry; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T21:48:19.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
