(NASDAQ:CUTR) (“Cutera” or the “Company”), a leading provider of laser and other energy-based aesthetic systems for practitioners worldwide, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nJames Reinstein, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We are pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 performance. Our 26% global revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by the continued strength of systems revenue in North America, which increased 35%, as well as, considerable improvement in our International systems revenue, which increased 19%. We believe the enhancements made to our International structure in 2017 will continue to drive execution improvements. We expect to build upon our 2017 success with continued North American and International expansion of legacy and newly launched products, as well as, consumables revenue related to truSculpt 3D ® , Juliet and Secret RF . In the second half 2017, approximately 30% of our systems sold will realize a recurring revenue stream going forward. We believe our newly created Commercial Team dedicated to supporting our consumable products will help expand this revenue opportunity.”\nKey financial highlights for the fourth quarter 2017, when compared to the fourth quarter 2016, include:\nRevenue increased 26% to a record $47.6 million, due primarily to an overall growth of 30% in systems revenue, with 35% growth in North America and 19% Internationally; Record quarter of $11.5 million International systems revenue; 25% sequential quarter increase compared to the third quarter of 2017; Fourteenth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth; Gross Margin of 57% impacted by increased warranty costs, as well as, an increased investment in our Service operations to fuel future growth; Net Income was $22.9 million, or $1.57 per fully diluted share, including a benefit for the release of a significant portion of our valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets; Non-GAAP net income * was $6.1 million, or $0.42 per fully diluted share. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $18.2 million resulting primarily from the release of a significant portion of its valuation allowance against certain U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by the revised measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; Cash Generated by Operations increased 41% to $6.7 million, compared to $4.7 million in the prior period; Cash, cash equivalents and investments of $35.9 million, with no debt; and Repurchased $21.4 million of common stock.\nKey financial highlights for the full year 2017, when compared to the full year 2016, were as follows:\nRevenue increased 28% for the full year to a record $151.5 million, due primarily to a 51% growth in North American systems revenue; Three consecutive years of 20%+ year-over-year growth; Gross Margin of 57% was slightly lower than previous year, impacted by warranty costs and an increased investment in our Service operations in the second half of 2017; Net Income was $30.0 million, or $2.04 per fully diluted share; Non-GAAP net income * was $13.7 million, or $0.93 per fully diluted share; Cash Generated by Operations was $14.3 million, including the one-time $4 million benefit from our facility lease cancellation in the third quarter of 2017; and Repurchased $35.2 million of common stock.\nProduct Updates\nEach platform in our portfolio contributed to the success of the year. The Company’s newly launched truSculpt 3D system continues to gain market acceptance in North America and in International markets. In 2018, the Company expects continued North American growth for the truSculpt platform, as well as, expansion into new International markets. Additionally, the Enlighten family continues to be a top selling platform and closely follows truSculpt 3D in total revenue. In January 2018, the Company launched Juliet (a women’s health product) and Secret RF (an RF microneedle product) to further enhance our product offerings, as well as expand our participation in recurring procedural revenue. As previously announced, Cutera also created a commercial organization dedicated to supporting consumable products for procedures performed in physicians’ practices. We expect this new team, combined with the new consumable offerings, to expand disposable revenue opportunities in 2018 and beyond.\n2018 Outlook\nWe expect revenue to be in the range of $178 to $181 million, an 18% - 20% increase over 2017; Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 57% to 58%, as we continue to invest in our Service operations, and experience increased facility costs in our headquarters in Brisbane, California; Operating expenses are expected to be in the range of 52% to 54% of revenue, consistent with 2017 (excluding the non-recurring lease termination benefit), as we continue to invest in product development and the scalability of our operations; Non-GAAP earnings per share* is expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.11 as compared to $0.93 for the full-year of 2017; and Adjusted EBITDA* is expected to be in the range of $15.0 to $17.0 million.\nConference Call\nThe conference call to discuss these results is scheduled to begin today at 1:30 p.m. PST (4:30 p.m. EST). Participating in the call will be James Reinstein, President and Chief Executive Officer and Sandra Gardiner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Management uses these measures as aids in monitoring the Company’s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter, and year to year, on a regular basis and for benchmarking against other medical technology companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the operating performance measure as prescribed by GAAP.\nWe have provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have not provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis due to the potential significant variability, limited visibility, unpredictability, or unique non-recurring nature of the excluded items. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures include adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense. For computing non-GAAP earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA, we have assumed $8 to $9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, an effective tax rate of 10% to 12%, and approximately 15 million weighted-average shares outstanding.\nIn this press release management has disclosed certain non-GAAP financial measures for the statement of operations and net income per diluted share, which exclude the following:\nNon-cash expenses for stock-based compensation. We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. We record non-cash compensation expense related to grants of options, performance and restricted stock. Depending upon the size, timing and the terms of the grants, the non-cash compensation expense may vary significantly but will recur in future periods. We believe that excluding this item allows users of our financial statements to better review and assess both current, and historical results of operations. We also believe that excluding non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation better allows for comparisons to our peer companies.\nDepreciation. We have excluded depreciation expense in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Depreciation is a non-cash charge to current operations. We continue to evaluate our business performance excluding non-cash charges and believe that excluding this item allows users of our financial statements to better review and assess both current, and historical results of operations.\nNon-recurring lease termination income. We incurred a one-time benefit with respect to a certain lease termination transaction. We exclude this benefit as it is related to a unique, one-time event and has no direct impact or correlation to the operation of our on-going business. Additionally, we believe that its inclusion is potentially misleading to users of our financial statements given the lease termination income’s unique, non-recurring nature.\nNon-recurring income tax adjustments relating primarily to the release of a significant portion of the Company’s valuation allowance against certain U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We exclude this adjustment as it is related to a unique, non-recurring event and has no direct impact or correlation to the operation of our on-going business. Additionally, we believe that its inclusion is potentially misleading to users of our financial statements given its unique, non-recurring nature.\nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nCertain statements in this press release, other than purely historical information, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
