It expects the vetting process to take several weeks.\nKodak kodk has billed its foray into the cryptocurrency world as a potential solution to pervasive digital copyright challenges, with blockchain technology leveraged to help photographers register, license and manage their images.\nShare prices soared after Kodak announced the project, rising from $3.10 the morning before the announcement, to almost $11 one day after. But critics accused the company of capitalizing on cryptocurrency craze without concrete plans in place.\nThe day before KODAKCoin’s ICO was delayed, the New York Times called the venture a “dubious” gamble.\nFor more on Kodak’s cryptocurrency, see Fortune’s video: \n\n“A number of struggling companies have reversed their fortunes , at least temporarily, simply by adding ‘blockchain’ to their names or announcing a new cryptocurrency venture unrelated to their previous line of work,” the Times said, before calling KodakCoin's white paper a “mishmash of marketing buzzwords and vague diagrams”.\nKodak's chief executive countered that the company's blockchain project is a genuine attempt to help photographers solve ownership issues.\nAfter the delay of KODAKCoin was announced, Kodak Co’s share prices fell by more than 13%, reaching $7.95 as of Wednesday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T08:30:22.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
