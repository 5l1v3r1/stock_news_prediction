In November of 2017, RMF completed the acquisition of San Francisco Salt Company (“SFS”), a premier provider of specialty bath and gourmet salts founded in 2002 and located in San Francisco, California.\nSFS was RMF’s first corporate acquisition and was led by majority owner, San Francisco Equity Partners (“SFEP”).
