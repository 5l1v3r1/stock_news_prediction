It will convert a commission of inquiry into an amnesty commission,” he said. \nAfriForum lists the office of the president and the corruption-fighting Public Protector as the respondents. \nTyrone Seale, Ramaphosa’s acting spokesman, and Cleopatra Mosana, a spokeswoman for the Public Protector, said they would consult legal aides before commenting. \nA date for the hearing of the matter has not been set yet. \nZuma announced in January that he would set up the commission into influence-peddling, which has become known as “state capture” in South Africa, after he was ordered to do so within 30 days of a High Court ruling in December. \nThe 75-year-old former president had challenged the right of the Public Protector, a constitutionally-mandated anti-graft watchdog, to call for a judicial inquiry into the influence-peddling allegations in government. \nReporting by James Macharia; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T20:37:01.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
