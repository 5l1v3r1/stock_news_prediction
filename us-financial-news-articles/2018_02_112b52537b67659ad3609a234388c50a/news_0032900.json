The consideration of Mester for the job was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\nEarlier Tuesday Jerome Powell was officially sworn into the top spot at the Fed, the first U.S. central bank chief since the 1970s who is not a trained economist.\nHe faces an early test of his leadership as the Fed weighs the significance of a recent market downturn and jump in long-term bond yields, as well as the risk the Trump administrationâ€™s tax and spending policies may light the fuse of unexpectedly fast inflation.\nMester, who has a PhD in economics and was research chief at the Philadelphia Fed for more than a decade before taking over at Cleveland in 2014, said earlier Tuesday that recent market turbulence had not changed her forecast for continued economic growth and her support for three rate hikes this year.\nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams, whose research on monetary policy and interest rates has been influential both inside and outside the U.S. central bank, is also under consideration for the post, the Wall Street Journal has reported. He has declined to comment on the search.\nThe Fed vice chair is part of the trio of policymakers at the center of U.S. rate-setting that traditionally is led by the Fed chair and also includes the chief of the New York Fed.\nThe No. 2 spot at the Fed has been open since the October retirement of Stanley Fischer. The New York Fed is seeking a successor to its chief, William Dudley, who is set to retire later this year.\nReporting by Steve Holland with reporting by Ann Saphir and writing by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T00:30:03.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
