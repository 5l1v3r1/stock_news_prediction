About 64 percent say they aren't comfortable sharing their income and 53 percent say the same of their spending habits . \nWhat's more, 18 percent say discussing finances led to a break up in the past. That may be because money is such a personal and revealing topic, Fisher hypothesizes: \"It says so much about you.\" \nShe says your financial history could give clues about \" what kind of parent you're going be , what kind of friend you're going be [and] what kind of partner you're going be.\" \nStill, one in five Americans never have these conversations with their partner, according to a 2017 LearnVest survey . And that reticence can have a negative impact on their financial health. \n\"The major benefit of speaking about money is getting the subject out in the open,\" Greg Heller, founder and chief executive officer of HCR Wealth Advisors , tells NBC News . \n\"Knowledge is power and people tend to feel a huge sense of relief from discussing their situation and possibly fears with regard to money. This, in turn, allows them to make better decisions, avoid critical mistakes, set attainable goals and demystify the subject of money.\" show chapters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T17:24:59.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
