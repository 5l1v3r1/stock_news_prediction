They had slumped nearly $1 trillion to $2.998 trillion by January 2017 as authorities sought to shore up the yuan and reduce potentially destabilising capital outflows.\nLast year was a turning point as China’s cross-border capital flows went from net outflows to basically stable, SAFE spokeswoman Wang Chunying told reporters in January.\nIn 2017, the yuan rose around 6.8 percent against the greenback, reversing three straight years of depreciation.\nIt appreciated a further 3.5 percent in January, its best monthly performance since 1994, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nDespite stable capital flows, policy sources said they don’t expect any significant relaxation of capital controls, even as the yuan rebounds.\nAuthorities have continued to introduce new measures, including requiring local firms to report larger investments through offshore units and limiting the amount of cash that Chinese can withdraw using bank cards when they are overseas.\nThe value of China’s gold reserves rose to $79.675 billion at the end of January, from $76.47 billion at end-December.
