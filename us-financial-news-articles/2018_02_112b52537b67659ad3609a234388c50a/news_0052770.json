The cost of doing nothing would be even higher, according to the group's analysis. By 2025, the impact of lost business, higher transportation costs and other economic headwinds would wipe out about $4 trillion in GDP, and approximately 2.5 million jobs. \nFaced with rising pension costs and tax-weary voters, state governments have also been cutting infrastructure spending as a share of the economy. Over the past half decade, state and local government spending on capital projects dropped from its high of 3 percent of GDP to less than 2 percent in 2015, according a report last year from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \nSome states have decided they can no longer wait for Washington to come up with a solution. In the last two years, a handful of states have moved to raise gasoline taxes to fund transportation repairs and upgrades. \nThe Trump administration also has suggested that some of the funding could come from private investment, which has financed several dozen public projects in the past two decades. But the idea has had only mixed success. show chapters 17 Hours Ago | 02:51 \nIn the last 25 years, for example, there have been three dozen privately financed road projects either completed or under construction, according to a 2014 report from the Congressional Budget Office. Of the 14 that had been completed, three of them had declared bankruptcy and one required a public buyout of private partners, the report said. \nBut even when those public-private projects are financially viable, they represent just a tiny fraction of the funding needed to maintain and upgrade existing roadways and bridges. Those 36 projects generated total investment of just $32 billion, or less than 1 percent of the roughly $4 trillion in highway spending during that period, the CBO found. \nOne reason is that much of the spending represents repair of existing facilities, an investment that doesn't generate a return for potential investors. Across the 50 states, the rising costs of operating and maintaining infrastructure – as opposed to constructing new bridges, roads and airports – are consuming a larger and larger share of overall spending.That's just for highways. Much of the required infrastructure repair will involve public schools, water systems, power grids and other systems that underpin the U.S. economy.
