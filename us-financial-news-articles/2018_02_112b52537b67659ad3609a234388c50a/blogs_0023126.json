WSJ \nNew Barclays Charge \nThe U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office has hit Barclays Bank with an “unlawful assistance” charge over a $3 billion loan it granted to the State of Qatar a decade ago. In 2008, the bank avoided the part-nationalization that hit rivals Lloyds and RBS by securing an enormous rescue package from Qatar and other investors. The SFO is interested in secret payments that allegedly smoothed the way for this package. Telegraph \nUnilever Ad Threat \nConsumer goods giant Unilever says it will pull ads from Facebook and Google if they fail to protect children and increase transparency. “As one of the largest advertisers in the world, we cannot have an environment where our consumers don’t trust what they see online,” chief marketing officer Keith Weed will reportedly say Monday. “And we cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain—one that delivers over a quarter of our advertising to our consumers—which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency.” Guardian \nWeinstein Deal Collapses \nThe $500 million sale of the Weinstein Co. collapsed at the last minute on Sunday night after New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman sued the disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, his brother Robert, and the company. The civil suit accuses the Weinsteins and the firm of the “vicious and exploitative mistreatment of company employees.” Schneiderman had reportedly been worried about the company being sold without proper compensation for Harvey Weinstein’s victims. New York Daily News Around the Water Cooler \nFlying Cars \nFlying cars will be a reality within the next five years, according to the CEO of a company backed by Alphabet boss Larry Page. Kitty Hawk chief Sebastian Thrun said his firm would have an announcement ready next month. “You are now at a point where we can make air-based transportation, like daily transpiration, safer, faster and also [cheaper and more] environmentally friendly, than on the ground,” he said. CNBC \nSome Banks Like Cryptocurrencies \nSome smaller European banks are, unlike their larger counterparts, embracing the cryptocurrency sector. Vontobel, Falcon Bank, Fidor Bank, and Bank Frick are willing to handle clients’ cryptocurrency-based investments. “We know what to do from a security perspective so this is a big opportunity for banks like us,” Bank Frick CEO Edi Wögerer told the Financial Times . FT \nLondon City Airport \nIf you were planning to fly in or out of London City Airport on Monday, that won’t be happening. The airport has been temporarily shut down after an unexploded World War II bomb was found by construction workers near the end of the runway. This is inconvenient, but not that rare an occurrence in cities where a lot of bombs—some of them duds—fell in the war. Fortune \nBlack History Month Tweet \nThe Boston Police have caught some flak for a tweet celebrating Black History Month—by honoring a white man. The tribute went to former Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach, who was the first NBA coach to “draft a black player in 1950, field an All African-American starting five in 1964 and hire the league’s 1st African-American head coach (Bill Russell) in 1966.” Yes, people noted, but how about honoring Russell instead? The cops deleted the tweet and apologized. Washington Post \nThis edition of CEO Daily was edited by David Meyer . Find previous editions here , and sign up for other Fortune newsletters here .
