The Republican memo claimed FBI and Justice Department bias against Trump in the federal investigating of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election. \n“The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency,” Trump tweeted. “Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!” \nTrump’s decision to block the release of the memo infuriated Democrats, who said it showed a double standard on transparency on the part of the Republican president. \nTrump on Feb. 2 allowed the release of the memo written by Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee with no redactions. Democrats said the Republican memo mischaracterised highly sensitive classified information and was intended to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of potential collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.
