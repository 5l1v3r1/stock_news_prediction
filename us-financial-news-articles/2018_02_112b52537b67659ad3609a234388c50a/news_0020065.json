Citic Bank said in a statement at the time that it was working with HNA Group to resolve the issue.\nFriday’s announcement also said Citic Bank expressed confidence in HNA Group and believed “both parties can establish a more stable and lasting strategic partnership”.\nHNA Group is facing a liquidity squeeze that has prompted the conglomerate to initiate a widespread restructuring, selling real estate and shares, after a $50 billion spending binge left it with massive debts.\nHNA told major bank creditors last month that the group is facing a potential cash shortfall of at least 15 billion yuan in the first quarter of the year.\nScrutiny of the group’s ability to repay its borrowing is widespread, and even a missed pre-payment on a 1.7 billion yuan trust loan earlier this week drew widespread attention.\nOn Friday, HNA Group (International), an offshore investment arm, announced in a separate statement that it had made interest payments of $9 million on its $300 million bond due 11 days early in order “to avoid potential disruption due to the Lunar New Year holidays”.\nIn a separate announcement on Friday, HNA’s flagship Hainan Airlines Holding Co ( 600221.SS ) told the Shanghai Stock Exchange that a major company reorganisation would involve the purchase of major aviation assets, including maintenance and flight training facilities, as well as hotels.\nA deal has not been finalised, and the company said it is continuing to work with financial consultants and other intermediaries.\nHainan Airlines is one of seven mainland stocks that have been suspended from trading due to the group’s restructuring activities.\n($1 = 6.2961 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting By Matthew Miller, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:06:24.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
