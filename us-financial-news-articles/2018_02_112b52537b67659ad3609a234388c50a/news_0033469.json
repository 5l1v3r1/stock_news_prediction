I feel really great. It was quite a hard race because the wind on the track was not so easy and on the last round my goal was to push really hard the last round, the last meters and the last uphill,” Frentzel told reporters.\n“At the end, the only way was to go in front and make my own race. At the end I‘m really, really happy about this victory today,” he added.\nThe delay at the start of the ski jumping had no effect on Frenzel’s performance.\n“I think after the jump I was in a really great position. I knew it was a good jump. I was a little bit lucky with the wind - that was one of the big reasons why you today needed quite a little bit of luck so at the end I‘m really happy,” he said.\nIt was the fourth Olympic medal for the 29-year-old German, who also won silver in Sochi and bronze at the Vancouver Games in 2010.\nNorway’s Jan Schmid, who is second in the World Cup standings, dropped out of contention after a poor ski jump.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:42:01.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
