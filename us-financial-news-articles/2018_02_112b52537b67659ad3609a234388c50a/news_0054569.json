Secessionist parties won a regional election in December but they have since then failed to agree on how the region should be ruled. \n\nFILE PHOTO - Flags of Spain, Catalonia and Esteladas (Catalan separatist flag) hang from balconies and windows of a building in Barcelona, Spain, November 1, 2017. REUTERS/Albert Gea Some in the independence camp want former regional head Carles Puigdemont to govern from Brussels where he is in self-imposed exile since October, a solution that faces many potential legal hurdles, while others would prefer to pick a candidate with a lower profile in order to ease tensions. \nThe closely watched quarterly survey from the Centro d‘Estudis d‘Opinio showed 40.8 percent of Catalans backed a split from Spain from 48.7 percent in October. \nIn the meantime, support for Catalonia remaining within Spain jumped to 53.9 percent from 43.6 percent, its highest level in four years. \nThe new regional parliament is due to hold its first regular session next week to discuss how to break the deadlock. \nReporting by Julien Toyer; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T22:36:51.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
