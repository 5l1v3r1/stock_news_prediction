The company was keen to reach a deal before it reports earnings on Feb. 15. \nAirbus last year cited “huge losses” on the project and warned of “significant risks” ahead. The program was initially valued at 20 billion euros but its cost has ballooned to well over 30 billion, sources told Reuters last year. \nNATO buyers agreed in principle to revamp the delivery schedule and requirements for the plane during a meeting in London on Monday. \nAirbus must still work out the exact terms and conditions with each of the individual buyers, one of the sources said. \nBritain’s defense ministry was expected to announce the agreement later on Wednesday, a source said. The Ministry of Defence declined comment. \nThe countries acknowledged during the meeting that the program’s problems were caused in part by fresh demands imposed by the buyer nations. \nOCCAR, the pan-European procurement agency, also declined comment on the outcome of Monday’s meeting. \nOne industry executive said the agreement would provide some relief for Airbus and its suppliers after years of mounting tension between buyer nations and the companies.
