Many of China’s provinces only have enough money to pay less than one year’s worth of benefits.\nHoles in local pension funds are often filled through transfers of central government funds, and China said in November that it would begin a pilot program to transfer shares in state-owned firms to social security funds.\nThe aging population comes as births in the country fell by 3.5 percent last year despite a 2016 move to relax China’s “one-child policy” amid concerns about the rapidly aging population.\nWednesday’s data showed total urban employment increased by 10.34 million people last year as more rural residents moved to cities, though the figure was less than the often-cited statistic of 13.51 million new urban jobs being created last year.\nThe total number of employed people in China - which includes rural and urban residents - grew by just 370,000 people last year, a much smaller increase than in previous years, the data showed.\nWith a shrinking potential labor force and companies still hiring, per capita disposable income last year rose 7.3 percent, faster than the 6.3 percent increase in 2016.\nReporting by Elias Glenn and Stella Qiu; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:37:22.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
