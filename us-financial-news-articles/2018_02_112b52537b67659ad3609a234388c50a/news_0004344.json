We have still long way to go,” Kim told reporters in Seoul after an hours-long second round of talks on the pact.\n“The U.S. is keen on automobiles in light of reducing its trade deficit with South Korea.”\nThe United States is South Korea’s second-biggest trading partner after China.\nNegotiators from both countries divided into groups to discuss specific subjects such as anti-dumping and safeguard issues, the auto sector’s market access and tariffs and investor-state dispute settlement, Kim added.\nIn response to the U.S. tariffs, South Korea’s trade ministry has vowed to “actively respond to U.S. trade protectionism,” including making a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Writing by Jane Chung; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:09:42.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
