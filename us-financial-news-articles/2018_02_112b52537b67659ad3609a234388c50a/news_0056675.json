Picture taken March 26, 2014. REUTERS/David M. Parrott/File Photo The RFS requires oil refiners to cover the cost of blending increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuels each year. The policy was adopted during President George W. Bush’s administration to help farmers, cut petroleum imports and lower pollutant emissions.\nUnder the program, refiners must earn or purchase biofuel blending credits called RINs to prove that they are complying. As biofuels volume quotas have increased over the years, so have prices for the credits – meaning refiners that must buy them are facing rising costs.\nOil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than a thousand people in Philadelphia, declared bankruptcy last month and blamed the regulation for its demise. Reuters reported other factors may also have played a role in the company’s bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the refinery by its investor owners.\nTrump is due to discuss potential changes to the RFS on Tuesday with Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of corn state Iowa, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and potentially Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nWhile a handful of proposals will be considered, the sources said, past efforts to change the RFS have been stymied by strong opposition by corn lobbyists.\nWriting by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T22:08:26.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
