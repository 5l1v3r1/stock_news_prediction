( bit.ly/2GSJzA4 ) \nDel Monte Philippines will sell 559.46 million shares, or 20 percent of outstanding shares, at a maximum price of 29.88 pesos each, the company said in a disclosure to the Philippine and Singapore stock exchanges, where its parent is listed. \nThe majority of the IPO proceeds will be used to pay existing loans while remaining capital will be allotted for expansion. \n“The prepayment of such loans will allow the Del Monte Pacific Group to de-leverage and strengthen its balance sheet,” the company said. \nDel Monte Philippines hired BDO Capital & Investment Corp as the issue manager, sole global coordinator and sole bookrunner. \nIt would be the Philippines’ largest IPO since Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp’s $380.79 million share sale in October 2016. \nFor the food and beverage sector, it would be the Philippines’ biggest on record and the largest in the region since Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd’s $3.27 billion IPO in June 2012, Thomson Reuters data showed. \nDel Monte Philippines produces and exports fruit juices, packaged pineapples and mixed fruits, and various tomato and spaghetti sauces under the Del Monte brand. Its parent firm, Del Monte Pacific, is listed on both the Philippines and Singapore bourses. \n“Business-wise, they are still one of the leaders in their segment,” said Steven Kent Ko, fund manager at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp in Manila. \nHowever, higher taxes could challenge Del Monte Philippines in the coming years, Ko said. Allotting most of the proceeds for debt payment makes the IPO less attractive, he added. \nThe Philippines’ broader share price index is up 0.67 percent year-to-date, trailing its Southeast Asian peers. $1 = 51.5800 Philippine pesos Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Additional reporting by Elaine Tan; Editing by Martin Petty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T10:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T11:18:34.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
