Photo: Getty Following the shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school last week that killed 17 people , Mr. Trump has been rolling out ideas for preventing such tragedies, including stepping up gun background checks and banning “bump stock” devices that turn certain firearms into automatic weapons.\nHe also wants to stop designating schools “gun free zones” so that properly trained teachers and coaches can carry concealed weapons and fire back at a school shooter.\nIn one tweet, Mr. Trump wrote that by the time police arrive on the scene, the shootings have typically ended. That being the case, a low-cost and promising alternative would be to give school faculty the means to stop the shooter on their own, he said.\n“If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there…problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!” the president wrote .\nIn other tweets, he said that a “‘gun free’ school is a magnet for bad people” and that arming teachers would prove a “GREAT DETERRENT” to would-be shooters.\nMr. Trump tweeted that he favors other measures to curb gun violence, including “comprehensive background checks” that take into account a gun buyer’s mental health and raising the age to 21 for the purchase of certain firearms.\nThe president also praised the National Rifle Association, the foremost opponent of gun-control measures and a powerful fundraising and political organizing group. The NRA spent more than $30 million helping Mr. Trump win the 2016 election.\n“What many people don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,” he wrote on Twitter, referring to Wayne LaPierre and Chris Cox, the group’s CEO and chief political strategist, respectively. “They love our Country and will do the right thing.”\nAt the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., Mr. LaPierre called for “effective, trained armed security” to “harden schools and protect our kids” and rejected what he called attempts to take away Second Amendment rights by tightening gun regulations.\nA spokeswoman for the NRA attacked the news media. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” said Dana Loesch at the gathering of political activists. “You guys love it. I’m not saying you love the tragedy, but I am saying you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media in the back.”\nLater on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet state and local officials to discuss school safety, the White House said.\nIn that meeting will be five Republican politicians including the Florida and Indiana attorneys general, the Democratic mayor of Parkland, Fla., and state and local education and public-safety officials.\nMr. Trump’s call for arming teachers faces skepticism.\nThe National Education Association, with about three million members, said that educators shouldn’t be armed and need to stay focused on teaching students.\n“We need solutions that will keep guns out of the hands of those who want to use them to massacre innocent children and educators. Arming teachers does nothing to prevent that,” said NEA President Lily Eskelsen García.\nAt a CNN town hall-style event on Wednesday night in Florida, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said he didn’t support giving certain teachers concealed weapons. Mr. Rubio spoke in response to a question from a teacher at the Parkland school who said she objected to the notion of strapping a gun to her leg and donning a bulletproof vest.\nNewsletter Sign-up Mr. Rubio said the idea has “practical problems.” If a SWAT team entered the school, officers could mistake the armed teacher for the shooter, causing “an additional tragedy,” Mr. Rubio said.\nAlso Wednesday, high-school students who survived the Parkland school shooting descended on the state capital to plead for stricter gun-control measures, raising pressure on lawmakers in the normally firearm-friendly state to pass legislation.\n“Ninety percent of my fellow Americans support background checks, yet you lawmakers have failed to act,” said Florence Yared, a 17-year-old student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n—Arian Campo-Flores contributed to this article.\nWrite to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/966657362789568512", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/966662241977360384", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/966660169194229761"], "published": "2018-02-22T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T18:32:26.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
