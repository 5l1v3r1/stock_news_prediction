Blockchain, the technology that underpins virtual currencies, maintains a continually growing record of transactions across a decentralized network. \nVoicing his concerns about speculators in the market, Mohanty said: \"That's a key part because we are going to continue to experiment on this fabulous technology and find the use case, hopefully, in the long run.

This followed fears of a more far-reaching clampdown due to comments from government officials that suggested the country would move to ban cryptocurrency trading via exchanges.
