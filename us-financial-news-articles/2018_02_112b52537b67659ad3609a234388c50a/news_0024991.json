It will also pursue a vision of “free, innovative, competitive, and transparent consumer finance markets where the rights of all parties are protected.”\nThe CFPB will seek the counsel of others for its decisions and act with “humility and moderation,” Sutton wrote.\nReporting by Reuters Newsroom; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T18:28:23.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
