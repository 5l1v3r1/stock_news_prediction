Dredging and natural shifts in the North Sea explained some of the erosion, of 70 meters in places.\n“Climate change and rising seas are accelerating the retreat,” he told Reuters. U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts that greenhouse gas emissions are the prime driver of climate change, owns two courses in Scotland.\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board said it was suffering from less predictable weather. Twenty seven percent of England’s home One Day Internationals were played with reduced overs since 2000 due to rain disruptions, the study said.\nAnd for soccer, extreme weather events caused the cancellation of 25 Football League fixtures during the 2015-16 season, the study said. It did not give comparisons to other years.\nReporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T02:26:15.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
