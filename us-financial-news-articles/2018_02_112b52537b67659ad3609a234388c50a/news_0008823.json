They face resistance from smaller nations like Ireland who are a hub for those firms’ investments and fear changes could hurt their economies.\nLe Maire said countries should not go easy on the tech giants to lure investment.\n“Kissing the feet of GAFAs won’t ensure our prosperity,” Le Maire said.\nHe said that the companies should be paying billions of euros annually in EU tax.\n“European citizens would struggle to understand why the taxation of digital giants at a European level only raised tens of millions of euros. They would see that as a provocation and they would be right.”\nThe French government is open to working with other members of the OECD group of industrialised nations, which are currently seeking international solutions to the problem of corporate profit shifting.\n“But we won’t be slowed down or blocked by technicalities,” he added.\nEU states could have lost 5.4 billion euros in tax revenues from Google and Facebook between 2013 and 2015, according to an EU lawmaker’s report.\nWhile the European Commission has pledged to follow the lead of the OECD, it has also kept open the option of acting unilaterally.\nAdditional reporting by Andrea Shalal, Foo Yun Chee, Tom Bergin and Douglas Busvine; Editing by Richard Lough and Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:22:15.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
