Appropriate authorities have a duty to educate and protect investors and consumers, and need to be prepared to act.”\n“Private digital tokens masquerading as currencies must not subvert this trust (in central banks)”, he warned, but stopped short of suggesting what concrete measures should be taken.\nCarstens is the latest of a slew of global policymakers to speak out against digital currencies after their meteoric rise last year. Bitcoin, the best-known crypto asset, rose more than 1,000 percent in 2017.\nThis year, however, the threat of regulatory clampdowns and bans from credit card firms to social media sites, has already caused it to tumble some 50 percent.\nCarstens described bitcoin as “a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster”. The last refers to the energy-intensive process of “mining” the digital currency.\nTo prevent cryptocurrencies from becoming “parasites” on existing financial infrastructure, Carstens said that only those exchanges and products which met accepted standards should be given access to banking and payment services.\n“This means same risk, same regulation. And no exceptions allowed,” he added.\nAuthorities’ concern has grown after retail investors have ignored regulators’ warnings and poured money into digital coins, enticed by huge price run-ups.\nIndia has joined China and South Korea in promising to ban parts of the market, and international regulators will debate how to address risks at the March G20 meeting.\nOthers, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, have warned of cryptocurrency use by criminals.\nCarstens agreed, adding that “individuals who massively evade taxes or launder money are the ones who are willing to live with cryptocurrencies’ extreme price volatility”.\nReporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T13:10:02.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
