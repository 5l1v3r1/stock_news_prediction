And we are not giving blanket denials.” Detained Reuters journalist Kyaw Soe Oo escorted by police, arrives for a court hearing in Yangon, Myanmar February 6, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer \nIf there was “strong and reliable primary evidence” of abuses, the government would investigate, he said. \nThe United Nations on Friday described the details of the Reuters report as “alarming” and joined the United States in calling for an investigation into the violence in the state. \nThe Reuters investigation of the Inn Din massacre was what prompted the arrest of two of the news agency’s reporters. Burmese citizens Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were detained on Dec. 12 for allegedly obtaining confidential documents. \nProsecutors are seeking to charge Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo under Myanmar’s Official Secrets Act, which dates back to the time of colonial British rule and carries a maximum 14-year prison sentence. \nReferring to the Reuters report, Johnson said: “It’s an extremely brilliant piece of reporting, providing a very, very important testimonial which I will be bringing up tomorrow, you can be sure, with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and others. I’ll also be raising the case of the two detained Reuters journalists.” \n“It’s clear this is ethnic cleansing,” Johnson said, adding that observers and monitors should be allowed into northern Rakhine so a base of evidence can be built. \nSuu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has faced heavy international criticism for not taking a higher profile in responding to the strife in Rakhine state.
