The pilot reported that he had ejected by parachute, and he was later killed on the ground. \n“The pilot died in a fight with terrorists,” it said. \nTass news agency quoted the Russian Defence Ministry as saying Moscow retaliated with a strike from an undisclosed high-precision weapon that killed more than 30 militants in an area of Idlib province where the plane was downed. \nThe Syrian opposition had shown on social media what they said was the wreckage of the plane and the body of the pilot surrounded by rebels. \nThey said the downed warplane was one of the planes used to target civilian convoys fleeing along a major Syrian highway from villages that the army and foreign militias had overrun. \nSyria’s civil war, which is now entering its eighth year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. \nA Russian plane was blamed for the death of seven civilians and scores of injuries after cars were targeted on the highway, according to a witness and two rebels sources. \nSyrian soldiers and Iranian-backed militiamen were now around twelve kilometres from Saraqeb, advancing towards the Damascus-Aleppo highway under cover of heavy Russian air strikes, two opposition sources said. \nAt least five civilians were killed in Saraqeb city on Saturday, which residents blamed on Russian planes. Related Coverage Russia says kills more than 30 militants in Syria - TASS \nSyrians in rebel-held areas say they can distinguish between Russian warplanes and those of the Syrian air force, because the Russian planes fly at higher altitude. \nResidents say thousands of people have been forced by air strikes to flee the area, moving further north to the safety of makeshift camps on the Syrian side of the Turkish border. \nRussia’s Defence Ministry regularly says it targets only hardline Islamist militants in Syria.
