(NYSE Amex: UUU) today announced that it has filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported an increase in sales of 11.9% to $3,555,431 compared to sales of $3,177,632 for the same period last year. The Company reported a net loss of $1,014,796, or $0.44 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $549,806 or $0.24 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year.\nFor the nine months ended December 31, 2017, sales were $10,456,484 versus $10,569,944 for the same period last year, a 1.1% decrease. The Company reported a net loss of $1,726,384, or $0.75 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1,003,551 or $0.43, per basic and diluted share for the corresponding 2016 period.\n\"The Company's third fiscal quarter results were primarily impacted by (i) lower gross margins, due to higher sales to the electrical distribution trade, which typically has lower margins than sales to the retail trade, (ii) higher selling, general and administrative expense, due to higher insurance premiums, and (iii), an increase of $307,000 in our portion of the Hong Kong Joint Venture loss compared to same quarter last year. The nine month results were primarily impacted by (i) higher insurance premiums of $245,000, (ii) an increase in interest expense of $92,000, and (iii) an increase in our portion of the Hong Kong Joint Venture loss, which increased by $339,000 compared to the same period last year. In January 2018, the Company introduced a new line of Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters and we expect sales of these devices to increase significantly during 2018 helping the Company return to profitability,\" said Harvey Grossblatt CEO of Universal Security Instruments Inc.\nUNIVERSAL SECURITY INSTRUMENTS, INC. is a U.S.-based manufacturer (through its Hong Kong Joint Venture) and distributor of safety and security devices.
