The junta has promised and postponed elections several times since it came to power following a coup in 2014 that removed a civilian government. The latest date was set for November but last month the military-appointed legislature changed the election law, signalling a further delay. There have been growing, anti-junta protests in Bangkok calling for Prayuth to stick to his November time frame.
