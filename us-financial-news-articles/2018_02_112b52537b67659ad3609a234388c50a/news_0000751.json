(NYSE: MPC) and MPLX LP (NYSE: MPLX) today are closing on the final transactions to complete the previously announced strategic actions.\nMPC is contributing refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX that are projected to generate approximately $1 billion in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for total consideration of $8.1 billion consisting of $4.1 billion in cash and approximately 114 million newly issued MPLX units valued at $4 billion as of the announcement date. MPLX is financing the cash portion of the transaction with its $4.1 billion 364-day term loan facility, which was entered into on Jan. 2, 2018.\nImmediately following the dropdown, MPC is exchanging its general partner (GP) economic interests in MPLX, including incentive distribution rights (IDRs), for 275 million newly issued MPLX common (LP) units valued at $10.1 billion as of the announcement date. MPC will continue to control MPLX through its ownership of the non-economic GP interest in MPLX and will own approximately 64 percent of the outstanding MPLX common units.\n\"We are very pleased to complete these transformative transactions for both MPC and MPLX,\" said Gary R. Heminger, chairman and chief executive officer of both MPC and MPLX. \"The conversion of MPC's GP economic interests in MPLX into LP units provides a clear valuation for MPC's interests. This, combined with the elimination of the IDR burden on the partnership, creates mutual benefits and positions MPLX extraordinarily well to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all of its unitholders, including MPC.\"\nAbout Marathon Petroleum Corporation\nMPC is the nation's second-largest refiner, with a crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.9 million barrels per calendar day in its six-refinery system.
