The medical association denounced the operation, saying “No to war, peace immediately”.\nErdogan has accused the body of treason and prosecutors last month detained 11 of its senior members. They were later released on probation.\n“This institution has nothing to do with Turkishness and nothing about them is worthy of the notion of Turkishness,” Erdogan said in a speech on Thursday.\nA new law will ensure the group “will not be able to use the notion of Turkishness, nor the name Turkey,” Erdogan said.\nThe Turkish Medical Association, known locally by its initials TTB, represents 80 percent of the nation’s doctors. The group said the right to call itself “Turkish” was enshrined in the constitution and reflected its service to the public good.\n“The comments made to discredit the TTB are met with sadness and amazement by conscientious, civilized people,” it said in a statement. “We maintain our stance of being in favor of life and peace today, as we did in the past.”\nWhile the details of the new legislation have not been made public, the state-run Anadolu news agency said TTB membership would no longer be a requirement to practice medicine in a private practice. Likewise, bar membership will no longer be required to practice law, Anadolu said.\nSuch moves could potentially weaken two influential groups that have frequently opposed Erdogan.\nThe main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) said the moves were designed to further polarize the country and urged the government to drop its plans.\nErdogan launched a far-reaching crackdown following a failed coup attempt against him in 2016. So far, about 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000 suspended or sacked from their jobs.\nRights groups say Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to crush his opponents. The government says its measures are necessary given the security threats it faces.\nWriting by Ece Toksabay; Editing by David Dolan and Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T18:39:15.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
