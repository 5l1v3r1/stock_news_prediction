New York uses on average about 3.6 bcfd of gas, and one bcfd is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes.\nConstitution is owned by subsidiaries of Williams, Cabot Oil & Gas, Duke Energy and WGL Holdings.\nOfficials at Williams could not immediately say what the latest cost estimate was for the project. The company said it would take about 10 to 12 months to build the pipeline after receiving necessary approvals.\nWhen Williams proposed building Constitution in 2013, it estimated it would cost about $683 million and enter service in 2016. The delays, however, have boosted that estimate to as high as $875 million, according to upstate New York newspapers.\nWilliams filed with FERC to build the project in 2013. FERC first approved construction of the project in 2014 and then again in 2016, conditioned on other approvals.\nThe New York Department of Environmental Conservation denied Constitution’s application in 2016, saying the company failed to provide sufficient information to determine whether the project would comply with the state’s water quality standards.\nConstitution appealed the New York denial to a federal appeals court, but the court last year upheld the state decision. The company in January petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the appeal court’s ruling.\nReporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Ian Simpson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T00:22:44.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
