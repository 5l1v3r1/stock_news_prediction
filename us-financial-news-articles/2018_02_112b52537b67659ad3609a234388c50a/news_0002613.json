Analysts on average had expected $7.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nAmazon Web Services is the leader of the $14.4 billion cloud computing market with more than 31.8 percent market share, but Azure has been growing fast and holds the No. 2 position with 13.9 percent of the market, according to 2017 third quarter estimates by research firm Canalys. \nMicrosoft's tax charge lead to a net loss of $6.30 billion, or 82 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a profit of $6.27 billion, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. [ bit.ly/2npGtLa ] \nExcluding one-time items it earned 96 cents per share, beating analysts’ average expectation of 86 cents. \n“If they are the only company taking a one-time tax write off that would be disconcerting but the fact that nearly everyone is doing it implies it is not a big deal,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park investments, an investment advisory service. \nMany U.S. companies have taken large one-time charges this quarter to account for changes to the U.S. tax law made in December, which cut the overall corporate rate and offered a lowered rate for companies repatriating overseas profits to the United States. \nBesides Azure, Microsoft’s other businesses also grew. Revenue from its productivity and business unit, which includes the Office 365 service, was up 24.7 percent to $8.95 billion. Revenue at Microsoft’s “more personal computing” unit, which includes Windows, Xbox and Surface, rose 2.36 percent to $12.17 billion. \nOverall revenue climbed 12 percent to $28.92 billion, beating analysts’ expectations of $28.40 billion. \n(This story has been refiled to correct day in first paragraph to Wednesday from Tuesday) Reporting by Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru; editing by Bernard Orr and Bill Rigby", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T00:22:39.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
