The price of the world's best-known cryptocurrency surged above $10,000 on Thursday, on Coinbase, the largest U.S. marketplace for buying major cryptocurrencies. A number of other major cryptocurrencies, including ethereum , ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin were also higher Thursday. On Wednesday, litecoin got a major boost from news that a payments processor for the digital asset, called LitePay, is set to launch later this month. 'FOMO is back in the markets' South Korea appeared to soften its attitude toward cryptocurrencies this week, with one report suggesting that the government is looking at the possibility of a cryptocurrency exchange licensing system. The licensing system could be similar to that of New York's \"BitLicense\" system, which provides firms handling virtual currencies a license to operate, according to the report.

Yesterday it was litecoin which had a clean break out from its resistance levels and investors jumped on and are still riding it today.\" Greenspan added: \"There's been a lot of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) over the past few weeks. The FUD is fading now.\" © CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary. Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY. CLOSE Here’s how much you could have lost.
