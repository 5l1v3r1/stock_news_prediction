We will continue to implement our strategic objectives and are targeting a further like-for-like increase in operating income,” said St Gobain chairman and chief executive Pierre-Andre de Chalendar in a statement.\n$1 = 0.8115 euros Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Leigh Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:15:34.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
