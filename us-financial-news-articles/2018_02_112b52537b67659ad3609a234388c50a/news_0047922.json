Streaming deals offer miners upfront cash in exchange for future production at a discounted, fixed price.\nReporting by Nicole Mordant; Editing by Savio D'Souza\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T13:17:14.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
