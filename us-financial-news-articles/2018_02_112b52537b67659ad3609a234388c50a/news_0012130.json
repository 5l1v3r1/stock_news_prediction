Mitsubishi also increased its annual dividend outlook from 95 yen per share to 100 yen per share.\nMitsubishi’s Chief Financial Officer Kazuyuki Masu told reporters the price rally in coking coal was partially due to stronger-than-expected demand from China for high-quality coal.\nAustralian premium coking coal futures in Singapore have surged over 50 percent from a November low of $174 to $265 a tonne by early January. They have since come off to around $225 a tonne.\n“But the rally has been overdone. We expect the coking coal prices to head slightly lower through the end of March,” Masu added.\nMitsubishi also expects its metals unit, which includes copper and iron ore assets, to generate 240 billion yen for the year, nearly half of the total profit.\n“As we enter into an era of electric vehicles, we are considering to invest in copper,” Masu added, citing a possible purchase of an additional stake in copper mines in which it already holds a stake such as the Quellaveco project in Peru.\nMitsubishi owns 18 percent stake in Quellaveco copper project which is 82 percent held by Anglo American. Anglo American has said that it could expand copper capacity in Peru this year.\n$1 = 109.9600 yen Reporting by Yuka Obayashi Editing by Joseph Radford and Miral Fahmy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:51:29.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
