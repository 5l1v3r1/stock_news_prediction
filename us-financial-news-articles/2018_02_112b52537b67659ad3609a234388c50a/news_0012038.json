The government would also run online sales.\nThe Pacific Coast province aimed to open its first government-run and private recreational pot stores by late summer, Farnworth later told reporters.\nAlthough the province did not put a cap on the number of retail licenses available, they would not be issued without the backing of local municipalities, which could say what their communities needed.\nWhile the federal legislation proposed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government will regulate cannabis production, the details of who can sell it and who can buy it has been largely left up to the country’s provinces.\nIn Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, cannabis sales will be run by provincial government-owned entities. The western provinces of Manitoba and Alberta have said they will license private retailers.\nReporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver; editing by Alistair Bell and G Crosse\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:55:42.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
