But all that needs to be checked, in particular, of course, their citizenship, are they indeed citizens of Russia, or of other countries,” she said.\n“These are not Russian service personnel,” Zakharova said, referring to the casualties in Feb. 7 clashes near the Syrian city of Deir al-Zor.\nAssociates of Russian private military contractors fighting alongside government forces in Syria have said there were large-scale casualties among the contractors when U.S.-led coalition forces clashed with pro-government forces in Deir al-Zor province on Feb. 7.\nZakharova said media reports about dozens or hundreds of Russian dead in the Syria clashes were “disinformation”. She added that U.S. actions in Syria were probably designed to undermine the country’s territorial integrity.
