It was crazy, happened one morning,” added Mazdzer. “It shows we care about each other and there is this human connection which crosses countries and cultures and sport is an amazing way to accomplish it.”\nMazdzer finished runner-up to Austrian David Gleirscher at the Olympic Sliding Centre on Sunday to become the first American man to claim a luge medal at the Winter Games.\nFeb 11, 2018; Pyeongchang, South Korea; Chris Mazdzer (USA) celebrates after the fourth run of the men's single luge in the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Olympic Sliding Centre.

Organisations spend millions of dollars in developing the most bad-ass sled fliers you can imagine,” he added.\n“I developed such strong relationships with people, we travel together for months on end, known them since we were 13, so you build a strong relationship.”\nAnd how did he fare with the Russian equipment?\n“It didn’t work out, I’m too big for the sled,” he said. “I took it down and was out of control.”\nReporting by Peter Rutherford,; Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T11:05:58.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
