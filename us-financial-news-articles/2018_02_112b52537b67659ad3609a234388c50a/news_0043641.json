The advantages of RCT products over other therapies include immuno-privileged presentation of proteins within or on the red cell, high target avidity and affinity, and long circulation half-life. Rubius RCTs exhibit fundamentally unique and potent biology; they have been engineered to replace missing enzymes for patients living with a variety of rare diseases, to kill tumors, and to upregulate or downregulate the immune system to treat both cancer and autoimmune disorders.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220006007/en/\nPure Communications, Inc.\nKatie Engleman, 910-509-3977\nkengleman@purecommunications.com\nSource: Rubius Therapeutics", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rubiustx.com%2F&esheet=51761257&newsitemid=20180220006007&lan=en-US&anchor=www.rubiustx.com&index=1&md5=2c5baeacfbb2a25643e708381296f867", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220006007/en/"], "published": "2018-02-20T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T20:20:56.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
