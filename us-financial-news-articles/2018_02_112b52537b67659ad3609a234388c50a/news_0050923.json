The Company’s fourth quarter benefited from higher oil prices relative to the same period a year ago as realized oil prices increased approximately 19%, averaging $48.80 per barrel versus $40.94 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Natural gas prices averaged $2.21 per Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $3.18 a year ago, a 31% decrease. For the full year, realized oil prices averaged $44.35, 29% higher than the full year 2016, while natural gas prices averaged $2.33 per Mcf, 5% lower than 2016.\nRevenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased 262% as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. This was due to a 244% increase in sales volumes period over period, along with higher average realized commodity prices in the quarter versus the comparable period a year ago. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2017, revenues increased 238%.\nUnit operating costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 generally decreased year-over-year as the Company benefited from the growth in production associated with the expanded development program during 2017.\nNet income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $50.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $5.3 million, or $0.03 per share, in the three months ended December 31, 2016.

Peterson, Chairman and CEO of SRC commented, \"Our team continues to execute at a very high level, taking advantage of SRC's consolidated, contiguous footprint and conservative balance sheet to generate strong debt-adjusted per share growth in production and cash flows.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. The use of words such as \"believes\", \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"intends\", \"plans\", \"estimates\", \"should\", \"likely\", “guidance” or similar expressions indicates a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements herein include statements regarding expected 2018 results, including capital expenditures, drilling, completion and plugging and abandonment activities, differentials and production. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management, and information currently available to management. The actual results could differ materially from a conclusion, forecast or projection in the forward-looking information. Certain material factors or assumptions were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection as reflected in the forward-looking information. The identification in this press release of factors that may affect the Company's future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is meant to be illustrative and by no means exhaustive. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the success of the Company's exploration and development efforts; the price of oil and gas; worldwide economic situation; change in interest rates or inflation; willingness and ability of third parties to honor their contractual commitments; the Company's ability to raise additional capital, as it may be affected by current conditions in the stock market and competition in the oil and gas industry for risk capital; the Company's capital costs, which may be affected by delays or cost overruns; costs of production; environmental and other regulations, as the same presently exist or may later be amended; the Company's ability to identify, finance and integrate recent or future acquisitions; the volatility of the Company's stock price; and the other factors described in the “Risk Factors” sections of the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are incorporated by reference in this release.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"), we present certain financial measures which are not prescribed by US GAAP (\"non-GAAP\"). The following is a summary of the measures we currently report.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe use \"adjusted EBITDA,\" a non-GAAP financial measure, for internal managerial purposes because it allows us to evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed in the table below from net income (loss) in arriving at adjusted EBITDA. We exclude those items because they can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under US GAAP and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is widely used in our industry as a measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt covenant requirements. However, our definition of adjusted EBITDA may not be fully comparable to measures with similar titles reported by other companies. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the impact of the items set forth in the table below (amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Adjusted EBITDA: Net income (loss) $ 50,818 $ 5,301 $ 142,482 $ (219,189 ) Depletion, depreciation, and accretion 38,913 13,677 112,309 46,678 Full cost ceiling impairment — — — 215,223 Income tax expense (benefit) (99 ) — (99 ) 106 Stock-based compensation expense 2,835 2,206 11,225 9,491 Mark-to-market of commodity derivative\ncontracts: Total (gain) loss on commodity derivative\ncontracts 6,550 4,133 4,226 7,750 Cash settlements on commodity derivative\ncontracts 164 237 942 5,374 Interest expense (income) 11,526 (16 ) 11,479 (192 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 110,707 $ 25,538 $ 282,564 $ 65,241 PV-10\nPV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and gas properties. It is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure reported in accordance with US GAAP, but rather should be considered in addition to the standardized measure.\nPV-10 is derived from the standardized measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is calculated using the same inputs and assumptions as the standardized measure, with the exception that it omits the impact of future income taxes. It is considered to be a pre-tax measurement.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the standardized measure to PV-10:\nAs of December 31, 2017 2016 Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows $ 1,600,675 $ 434,261 Add: 10 percent annual discount, net of income taxes 1,267,258 427,587 Add: future undiscounted income taxes 285,349 90,195 Future pre-tax net cash flows $ 3,153,282 $ 952,043 Less: 10 percent annual discount, pre-tax (1,396,998 ) (475,695 ) PV-10 $ 1,756,284 $ 476,348 Consolidated Financial Statements\nCondensed consolidated financial statements are included below.
