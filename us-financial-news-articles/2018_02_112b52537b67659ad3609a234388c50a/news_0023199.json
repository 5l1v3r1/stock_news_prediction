Israel said its warplanes came under fire in Syria, though it was still unclear why the jet had come down.\n“Syria’s legitimate government has every right to defend its soil and territory against any foreign aggressor,” Qasemi said, state TV reported.\nEarlier the deputy head of Iran’s IRGC declined to comment on the reports, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency.\n“We cannot confirm this report on the drone because Israelis are liars ... if Syrians confirm it, Iran will confirm it as well,” Brigadier General Hossein Salami said.\nWriting by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T13:55:45.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
