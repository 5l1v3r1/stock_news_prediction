REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach The 35-year-old Randall spoke of the loneliness she felt when she started out skiing internationally, but in Pyeongchang she is surrounded by a young, ambitious team that now sees itself as being the equal of their Scandinavian counterparts.\n“I think we used to get a lot of motivation from being the underdogs, and now we’re in a position when we’re there, fighting beside them. It has helped us lift to a higher level,” Bjornsen explained.\nCross-country skier Kikkan Randall poses for a portrait at the U.S. Olympic Committee Media Summit in Park City, Utah, U.S. September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson “Since they’re so dominant, I think we get extra motivation to know that we are beating the most dominant. That’s the goal at the end of the day, to beat the Scandinavians,” she added.\nThe U.S. are not yet as strong on the men’s side, but Sadie’s younger brother and team mate Erik told Reuters that the American skiers were fast catching up.\n“I think we saw it last week at the world juniors, the men ended up with a silver medal, not too far behind the Norwegians and of course beating the Russians and the Swedish, so I think we’re becoming one of the strongest teams,” he told Reuters.\nAsked if Pyeongchang would finally see an American on the podium, the younger Bjornsen sibling was bullish.\n“Oh, it’ll happen for sure. You can count on it,” he said.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T11:11:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
