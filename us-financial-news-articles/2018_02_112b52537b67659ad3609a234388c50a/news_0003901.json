[L2N1PS20I] \nTrump and many conservatives in Congress insist that any legislation to help Dreamers contain at least three other elements: beefed-up border security including the construction of a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, the termination of a visa lottery program and an end to the awarding of visas for immigrants’ parents and siblings.
