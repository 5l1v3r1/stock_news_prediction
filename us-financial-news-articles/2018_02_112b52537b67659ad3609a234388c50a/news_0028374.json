Consumer spending has been flaccid since the Trump tax overhaul, with a separate report released Wednesday showing underlying retail sales unchanged in January, after dropping a bit in December.\nUncertainty over the economic outlook and particularly how strong inflation pressures could become played into a recent stock market downturn and a jump in long-term bond yields that themselves could impact Powell’s stance on monetary policy.\nStill, says Eric Stein, a portfolio manager at Eaton Vance, “I think the bar for them not to hike due to let’s say stock market volatility is pretty high.”\nIf inflation rises considerably that could change their thinking, he added, “but keep in mind, part of the reason the Fed (has raised rates) even with inflation below target is that they expected inflation to pick up, and now it is picking up.”\nSeveral of Powell’s colleagues have suggested as much. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and San Francisco Fed President John Williams in recent days both signaled that they view recent economic data as validating their expectations for stronger inflation and continued, gradual rate hikes.\nThey’ve also made clear they are looking closely at incoming data, which will include new reads on jobs, spending and overall economic growth before the next policy meeting.\nPowell’s own views may become clearer when he testifies before both houses of Congress in two weeks.\nInvestors widely expect the central bank to raise interest rates at its March meeting and two more times later this year.\nAdditional reporting by Howard Schneider and Lucia Mutikani in Washington and Herb Lash in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T20:29:05.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
