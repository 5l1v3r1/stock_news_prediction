The index had jumped above 50 points during last week’s sell-off.\nCrucial to the rest of this week will be Wednesday’s inflation numbers. The fall in stocks was sparked initially by rises in bond yields, and associated concern over price growth, as U.S. interest rates return steadily to pre-financial crisis levels.\nU.S. 10-year Treasury yields were hovering at 2.8312 percent, falling back from a four-year peak of 2.9020 percent hit on Monday.\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a voting member in the U.S. central bank’s rate-setting committee this year, is due to speak on the economic outlook and monetary policy later on Tuesday.\nMore than three-fifths of the companies on the S&P 500 have reported earnings, with nearly 78 percent of them topping profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is above the 72 percent average beat-rate in the past four quarters.\nShares of Under Armour rose more than 10 percent in premarket trading after the sportswear maker reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts’ estimates.\nDrug distributor AmerisourceBergen jumped nearly 13 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported Walgreens approached the company for a takeover. Walgreens fell 1.8 percent.
