The increase was smaller than the forecast of analysts polled by Reuters, who on average predicted an increase of 2.3 percent in the first month of the year. Inflation stood at 2.5 percent in December. Inflation slowed to 0.3 percent in monthly terms from 0.4 percent in December, the data showed. Russian inflation, once stubbornly high at double-digit levels, is now significantly below the central bank's target of 4 percent. Lower inflation leaves more room for the Russian central bank to cut its key rate before March's presidential election, making it cheaper to get credits and take out mortgages. A Reuters poll showed 18 of 20 analysts expected the central bank to cut its benchmark rate a quarter-point to 7.5 percent from 7.75 percent when it meets on Friday. Following the new inflation figures, analysts at Capital Economics said they now predicted the central bank would cut by 50 basis points on Friday, compared with an earlier forecast of 25 basis points. \"The decline in Russian inflation to just 2.2 percent year-on-year last month, coming alongside weakness in the latest hard activity data and dovish comments from central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina, means we now expect a 50-basis-point cut in the policy rate,\" they said in a note.
