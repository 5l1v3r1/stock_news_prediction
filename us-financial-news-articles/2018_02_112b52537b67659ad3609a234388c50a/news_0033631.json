Cottarelli said he would make a decision after the vote.\nThe center-right wants to introduce a single income tax rate of 23 percent financed through 50 billion euros in cuts to tax breaks.\nCottarelli calculated a flat-tax regime with a “no tax area” for yearly income below 12,000 euros would cost 64 billion euros a year. He said it would be politically difficult to massively reduce tax breaks that amounted to 101 billion euros a year in 2015.\n“It would make the tax system simpler and more efficient, but it would not lower the overall tax burden,” he said of the proposal.\nThe center-right also aims to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio by 25 percentage points by 2022 by doubling Italy’s primary surplus to 4 percent.\n“A 4 percent surplus is consistent with EU requirements, but ... it does not take into account other spending commitments included in their program,” Cottarelli said.\nItaly’s ruling PD party proposes to keep the primary budget surplus - which excludes interest payments - unchanged at 2 percent for 10 years.\n“I’ve hardly ever seen a country that has substantially reduced its debt with just a 2 percent primary surplus” Cottarelli said.\nCottarelli said he was still calculating how strong Italy’s growth would have to be for the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement to achieve its twin goals of cutting the debt-to-GDP ratio by 40 percentage points in 10 years while also running a deficit.\nEditing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:15:20.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
