The engine oil issue in some cases caused a strong odour of gasoline inside the car and in other cases the car’s check-engine light came on, Honda officials said.\nHonda officials said no reports of accidents have been reported because of this particular engine oil issue. They said the engine oil issue doesn’t affect the engine’s performance\nThe measure comes after CR-V and Civic owners turned to the Weibo microblog - China’s Twitter equivalent - and other means to air their complaints since mid January.\nThe issue involving the CR-V and the Civic has occurred in northern China where temperatures can dip well below the freezing point and when drivers of the affected vehicles drive short distances frequently.\nOn short runs, Honda engineers believe the engine doesn’t warm up enough to help un-combusted petrol accumulated in the lubricant oil pan to evaporate.
