(NYSE: WHD) (“Cactus”) announced today the pricing of its upsized initial public offering of 23,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock (“common stock”) at $19.00 per share. The shares are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “WHD” on February 8, 2018. In addition, Cactus has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,450,000 shares of common stock from Cactus at the initial public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The offering is expected to close on February 12, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nCactus expects to receive approximately $405.8 million of net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses (or approximately $467.4 million if the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of common stock is exercised in full). Cactus intends to contribute the net proceeds of this offering to its operating company subsidiary, Cactus Wellhead, LLC (“Cactus LLC”), in exchange for common units representing limited liability company interests in Cactus LLC (“CW Units”).
