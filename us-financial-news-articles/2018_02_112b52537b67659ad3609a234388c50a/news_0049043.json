REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee/File Photo It said it will expand its Greater China franchise business, fitting in with investor expectations for greater emphasis on the booming Chinese market following the appointment of former China head Keith Barr as group CEO last July.\nIHG's shares, however, fell as much as 5.4 percent to 4,443 pence, featuring at the bottom of London's FTSE 100 .FTSE index, after it decided against a special payout.\nThe group has often offered surplus cash to investors and Morgan Stanley analysts, who have an “equal weight” rating and 4,600 pence target price on IHG’s stock, said they had expected a $400 million buyback in 2018.\nThe group said it would record a cash cost of $200 million to help it achieve its target of making about $125 million in annual savings by 2020.\nIt also said it would build a new marketing team and combine its Europe and Middle East, Asia and Africa operations.\n“We are confident that our ambitious plans will... drive industry-leading net rooms growth over the medium term,” Barr said in a statement.\nFor 2018, Marriott and Hilton have forecast 5.5-6 percent and 6.5 percent net rooms growth respectively. IHG recorded 2017 net system growth of 4 percent, its highest organic growth since 2009.\nFourth-quarter revenue per available room grew 4 percent, faster than the 1.7 percent growth a year earlier. Full-year operating profit rose 7 percent to $759 million, above the $752.1 million company-compiled forecast.\nReporting by Esha Vaish in Bengaluru; Editing by Jason Neely and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T15:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:08:17.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
