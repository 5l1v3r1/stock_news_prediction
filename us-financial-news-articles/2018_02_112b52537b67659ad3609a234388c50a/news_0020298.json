Typically the ships begin to carry lucrative “dirty” fuel cargoes such as crude oil after their maiden journey.\nThe cargo adds to roughly 1 million tonnes that are already booked to sail for Lagos alone from Europe this month, according to industry monitor Genscape. That followed a similar amount loading on that route in January, but compared with just under 500,000 tonnes in November, Genscape data showed.\nTrade sources said nearly 1.7 million tonnes of gasoline arrived in West African ports in January from European and Baltic ports.\nNNPC in December said it had more than doubled its daily supply to the country’s drivers. It has in recent weeks leaned heavily on the companies that hold contracts to swap crude oil for products to step up their imports.\nVitol is among 10 pairings of traders and local partners that hold such swap contracts.\nCitizens in the oil-rich country judge politicians harshly for any fuel shortages, and with gasoline prices capped by law, NNPC has imported the bulk of its gasoline over the past year.\nLast month, NNPC cancelled a tender to buy more fuel after prices spiked on the spot market due to its issuance.
