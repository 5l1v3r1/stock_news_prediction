If it’s another speech about what they don’t want, then this is not helpful. What we are looking for is constructive proposals,” a senior EU diplomat said. \n“Since they’ve come up with nothing, we will present something. We will put forward a proposal of a free trade agreement. And they won’t like that either. So we will have a lot of things on the table.” \nBrussels hopes the EU will be able to agree rules on the transition period with Britain in March and open negotiations on the future relationship from April. Negotiators for both sides are due to hold a week of talks in Brussels next week. \nReporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T20:52:07.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
