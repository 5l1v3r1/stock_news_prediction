It’s always a lot of hard work and then I saw my family who were here as well, so there were a lot of emotions,” he told reporters.\nWith the 14 seeded athletes choosing to start in the middle of the 119-strong field, Sweden’s Calle Halvarsson put down a marker with good early split times, but he was soon swallowed up as the specialists over the distance got out on the course.\nFrance’s Maurice Manificat, who leads the World Cup distance race table, set off at a cracking pace and took the lead at the first split, but by the second split Cologna had moved ahead.\nCross-Country Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men's 15km Free – Alpensia Cross-Country Skiing Centre – Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 16, 2018 - Dario Cologna of Switzerland reacts.

In the World Cup I didn’t win the 15km so many times, but in the Olympics everything is perfect,” he said.\n“I had a very good feeling from the beginning ... when I had around 20 seconds gap I was quite comfortable that it should be enough to win,” Cologna said, adding that he still felt nervous as he crossed the line.\n“I knew it but you always want to see it first to be sure,” he said.\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T15:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:34:19.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
