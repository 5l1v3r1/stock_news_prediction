We will analyze it and see where we can improve it tomorrow but I know there is a bigger picture out there,” Fenlator-Victorian added.\n“I am hoping to build upon it in the future. We’re the first women’s team from the islands, that’s why barriers are there to be broken.”\nU.S.-based Nigerians Seun Adigun and Akuoma Omeoga, both track athletes, were also making history as the first African country to compete in bobsleigh at the Games, though they fared even worse, coming in a distant 20th and last on both runs.\nSlideshow (4 Images) “When we came into this whole process it was to bring awareness,” said pilot Adigun. “It was so that people could understand, love and appreciate the sport of bobsleigh, the country of Nigeria, the continent of Africa”.\nTEAM MICA The Jamaican women’s team had marked their debut with an official anthem, “Run the Track, It’s Bobsled Time,” the proceeds of which went to supporting the Jamaica Bobsled Foundation.\nBritain’s “Team Mica”, Mica McNeill and Mica Moore, raised 44,400 ($62,000) via an online campaign after their funding was suddenly cut in September last year.\n“We had to act quite fast and set up a crowd funding page and ask the public to help us get on our journey,” Moore said after Tuesday’s heats, which saw them place an impressive sixth.\n“It’s been an incredible journey,” said Moore.\nCanadian pilot Kaillie Humphries and brakewoman Heather Moyse won gold in Sochi and Vancouver but broke up the partnership and, competing in separate sleds, and will start the third run in fourth and seventh places.\nReporting by James Pearson, editing by Ed Osmond/Mitch Phillips\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:12:52.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
