Police can only make a recommendation, the final decision to indict rests with the attorney-general. \nIn a nationwide TV address, a stern-looking Netanyahu denied allegations that he accepted lavish gifts, including champagne and expensive cigars, from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan in exchange for doing favors. He also is suspected of offering preferential treatment to a newspaper publisher in exchange for favorable coverage.\nNetanyahu said his lengthy political career has been solely \"for the good of the nation.\" He accused police of being on a witch hunt against him and vowed to remain in office. He wrapped up by vowing to stay in office and run for re-election.\nThe police recommendations now go to the attorney general, who will decide whether to press charges.\nBut Tuesday's report is deeply embarrassing to Netanyahu and could fuel calls for him to step aside. In his address, Netanyahu said he \"will continue to lead Israel responsibly and faithfully.\" \n-- Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T21:28:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
