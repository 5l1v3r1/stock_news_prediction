Digital advertising accounts for about one-third of its spend, the company said in September.\nOver the last five years, its spending on digital media has more than doubled while its investment in creating digital content has gone up by 60 percent.\nIts spending on traditional media is down slightly, but under a cost savings drive it has cut the number of ads it makes and agencies it works with. These efficiencies resulted in 35 percent lower investment creating traditional content.\nGoogle, part of Alphabet, and Facebook are estimated to have half of online ad revenue worldwide in 2017 and more than 60 percent in the United States, according to research firm eMarketer.\nOfficials at Google in Europe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Facebook said in a statement: “We fully support Unilever’s commitments and are working closely with them.”\nWeed has recently explained his views in meetings with all of Unilever’s digital partners, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Snap and Amazon.\nHis comments echo complaints made by Procter & Gamble Chief Brand Officer Mark Pritchard, who has lamented fake ad clicks by automated ‘bots’, the risk an ad can appear online next to an ISIS recruitment video and the realisation that people do not watch video commercials any more.\nOnly 25 percent of online ad spending reaches the consumer, with the rest skimmed off by a “murky, non-transparent, even fraudulent supply chain” within the industry, Pritchard told a conference last year.\nLast year, video-sharing site YouTube faced two advertiser boycotts after newspaper reports found ads of major brands appearing next to questionable videos.\nAfter the first boycott, which related to videos from Islamic extremists, there was scant evidence of any impact on revenue of its owner, Alphabet.\nFacebook executives visiting Europe last month made a public show of contrition about the social media giant’s slow response to abuses on its platform, seeking to avoid further legislation similar to a new hate speech law in Germany it says goes too far.
