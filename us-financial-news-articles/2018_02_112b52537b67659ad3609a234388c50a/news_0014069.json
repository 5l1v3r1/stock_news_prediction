This is just a short-term policy,” Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Wednesday, according to a government statement.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip \nSchools had previously been set to shut on different days next week for the Lunar New Year holidays, which run from next Friday to the following Monday. \nSome of those working in education said the government should have given notice earlier. \n“We understand that the situation is very acute and is all of a sudden...but at the same time, we should try to avoid chaos, or even creating a panic situation,” said Ip Kin-yuen, a legislator representing the education sector, in comments carried by the government-funded RTHK. \nPublic hospitals have added beds to tackle an occupancy rate that has risen to 112 percent, with the Hospital Authority’s latest statistics showing more than 1,000 people admitted on Monday to public hospitals across the territory.
