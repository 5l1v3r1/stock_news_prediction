For 2016 the bank paid an ordinary dividend of 1.90 francs and a special dividend of 0.10 francs.\nIn August Vontobel outlined higher asset-gathering and profitability goals as part of new targets for 2020, adding that it had enough capital to spend up to 500 million francs on acquisitions.\nChief Executive Zeno Staub on Tuesday reiterated that appetite for acquisitions on a call with journalists.\nThe group said it was seeking to strengthen profitability further in 2018 but that market conditions are expected to remain challenging with margins still under pressure.\n“Our robust 2017 result once again highlights our successful business model as a globally active Swiss financial expert with a focus on wealth management, asset management and financial products,” Staub said in a statement, adding that the market environment was becoming more competitive.\n“In 2018 we will continue to invest in our relationship with existing and new clients, thus investing in growth.”\nThe asset manager said it expects a 2-3 percent tax rate reduction from recent U.S. tax reforms.\nOn an unadjusted basis, Vontobel said net shareholders’ profit for 2017 fell to 202.4 million francs from 259.8 million francs in 2016, but ahead of an average estimate for 198 million francs in a Reuters poll of five analysts.\nThe previous year’s profit was boosted by the sale of its stake in Helvetia Holding AG.\nShares were seen opening 1.6 percent higher according to pre-market indications provided by bank Julius Baer.‍​ ($1 = 0.9365 Swiss francs) (Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by David Goodman)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:29:01.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
