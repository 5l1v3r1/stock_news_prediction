The index slipped further into negative territory as the yen firmed during the session.\nA miss in industrial output figures for January, which showed a steep fall of 6.6 percent on month, likely weighed on sentiment . That was below a median 4.2 percent decrease projected by Reuters.\nManufacturers, technology, automakers and financials traded in negative territory. Among large caps, Honda Motor fell 2.19 percent, SoftBank Group dropped 2.39 percent and Fast Retailing lost 2.52 percent.\nSymbol Name Price Change %Change NIKKEI --- HSI --- ASX 200 --- SHANGHAI --- KOSPI --- CNBC 100 --- South Korea's Kospi fell 1.17 percent to close at 2,427.36.

Powell also indicated that the central bank raising interest rates more than three times was a possibility as inflation moves \"up to target.\"\n\"The gist is that even as [Powell] espoused that the Fed will continue to normalize policy at a gradual pace, markets suspect his confidence could rub off to four rate hikes for 2018, instead of the three penciled in,\" Chang Wei Liang, a strategist at Mizuho Bank, said in a note.\nU.S. Treasury yields rose on the back of those remarks, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note standing at 2.9 percent during early Asian trade.\nFollowing Powell's Tuesday testimony, the dollar index , which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of rivals, was steady at 90.345 after bouncing in the last session.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar pared overnight gains to trade at 107.06 at 3:34 p.m. HK/SIN, below Tuesday's close of 107.36. The move also came as Japan's central bank slightly reduced the amount of 25 to 40-year Japanese government bonds to 70 billion yen ($652 million) it offered to purchase, Reuters reported.\nMeanwhile, the Australian dollar edged up after falling as low as $0.7780 in the last session with the firmer dollar.
