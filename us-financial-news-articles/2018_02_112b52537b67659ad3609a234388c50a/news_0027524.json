(NYSE: TIER), a Dallas-based real estate investment trust that specializes in owning and operating best-in-class office properties in select U.S. markets, today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter & Full Year 2017 Highlights\nRecognized a net loss of $0.21 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter and net income of $1.75 per diluted common share for the full year 2017 Reported Funds from Operations (FFO) attributable to common stockholders of $0.39 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter and $1.50 per diluted common share for the full year 2017 Reported FFO, Excluding Certain Items, attributable to common stockholders of $0.40 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter and $1.57 per diluted common share for the full year 2017 Recognized Same Store NOI Growth of 3.1% for the full year 2017 Recognized Same Store Cash NOI Growth of 4.2% for the full year 2017 Increased occupancy by 80 basis points during the fourth quarter to 89.1% at December 31, 2017\n“We continue to make strong progress on our strategic plan,” stated Scott W. Fordham, President & Chief Executive Officer, “and are pleased to have successfully executed on our key objectives this past year.”\n“We exited five markets during 2017,” continued Mr. Fordham, “and we announced today that we are under contract on 500 East Pratt in Baltimore, Loop Central in Houston, and Centreport Office Center in Fort Worth. Exiting Baltimore and downsizing our Houston and Fort Worth portfolios will further our continued efforts to sharpen our geographic footprint and improve the overall quality of our portfolio. Subject to normal closing conditions, we expect to complete these transactions during the first quarter.”\n“Looking forward, we are excited by the opportunity to continue creating value within Austin,” added Mr. Fordham. “This includes our recent acquisition of Domain Point, which is comprised of two office buildings that total approximately 240,000 square feet on over 9.5 acres of land. As part of our acquisition, we exercised our exclusive rights to rebrand and include the property as part of The Domain, bringing our total Austin office ownership to over 2.1 million square feet, including properties under construction that are over 95% leased.”\n“We’ve always known Austin is a special city,” remarked Mr. Fordham, “and we are pleased to see its prominence grow not only within our portfolio, but also as one of the nation’s most desirable places to live, work and play. Our existing ability to develop at least 1.2 million square feet inside The Domain, plus future redevelopment opportunities, positions us for significant additional value creation opportunities within Austin.”\nFourth Quarter & Full Year Financial Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net loss attributable to common stockholders was $9.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share, as compared to a net loss of $6.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, net income was $84.3 million, or $1.75 per diluted common share, as compared to a net loss of $29.4 million, or $0.62 per diluted common share, for 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, NAREIT-defined FFO attributable to common stockholders was $19.0 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share, as compared to $18.9 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For 2017, NAREIT-defined FFO was $71.9 million, or $1.50 per diluted common share, as compared to $76.5 million, or $1.60 per diluted common share, for 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, FFO attributable to common stockholders, excluding certain items, was $19.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, as compared to $19.1 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, FFO, excluding certain items, was $75.1 million, or $1.57 per diluted common share, as compared to $79.5 million, or $1.66 per diluted common share, for 2016.\nProperty Results\nOur occupancy at December 31, 2017, was 89.1%, an increase of 80 basis points from September 30, 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we leased 165,000 square feet, which included 30,000 square feet of renewals, 2,000 square feet of expansions, and 133,000 square feet of new leasing.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we continued to abate rent at One & Two Eldridge Place and Three Eldridge Place (collectively known as the “Eldridge Properties”), located in Houston, Texas, because the properties had not been restored to pre-loss condition following Hurricane Harvey. Rent abatements of $5.1 million and $7.0 million were provided to tenants for the fourth quarter of 2017 and for the year, respectively. A total of $6.2 million of these losses was recovered from business interruption insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter, which included $1.9 million for the third quarter and $4.3 million for the fourth quarter, net of a deductible and estimated saved expenses.\nSubsequent to quarter end, the total office space leased at our Third + Shoal development property increased to over 90% (88.7% of the total rentable space).\nReal Estate Activity\nSubsequent to quarter end, on January 4, 2018, we acquired a 96.5% promoted economic interest in Domain Point. Domain Point is located in Austin, Texas, adjacent to our other Domain office properties and includes two buildings with 240,000 rentable square feet (combined).\nFurther, we are currently under contract to sell three properties that are outside of our target growth markets or our target submarkets. These properties consist of 500 East Pratt, located in Baltimore, Maryland, with approximately 280,000 rentable square feet; Loop Central, located in Houston, Texas, with approximately 575,000 rentable square feet; and Centreport Office Center, located in Fort Worth, Texas, with approximately 133,000 rentable square feet. These properties are under contracts for an aggregate anticipated sales price of approximately $145.0 million, and each is expected to close during the first quarter of 2018. The sale of each of these properties is subject to closing conditions, and there is no assurance we will sell these properties on the terms or timing we expect or at all.\nCapital Markets Activity\nOn October 27, 2017, we entered into a construction loan secured by Third + Shoal with available borrowings of up to $103.8 million (at 100%). The loan is scheduled to mature in October 2021, with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions and our payment of an extension fee.\nOn November 3, 2017, our board of directors authorized a distribution of $0.18 per share of common stock for the fourth quarter of 2017, which was paid on December 29, 2017.\nSubsequent to quarter end, on February 7, 2018, our board of directors authorized a distribution of $0.18 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018, payable on March 29, 2018.\nSubsequent to quarter end, on January 18, 2018, we amended our existing multi-bank unsecured credit facility. The amendment provides for total unsecured borrowings under the credit facility to increase from $860 million to $900 million, with the ability to further increase total borrowings by up to an additional $300 million in the aggregate subject to certain requirements. The revolving line of credit was increased to $325 million and the maturity date extended from December 2018 to January 2022, which can be extended one additional year subject to certain conditions and our payment of an extension fee, and the maturity date of the $300 million term loan was extended from December 2019 to January 2025.\nAppointment of Certain Officers\nOn February 8, 2018, our board of directors appointed Dallas E. Lucas as our President and Chief Operating Officer, James E. Sharp as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and Hannah Wrenn as our Chief Accounting Officer, in each case effective as of February 15, 2018. Mr. Fordham will remain our Chief Executive Officer and a director.\n2018 Outlook\nWe have released our 2018 outlook to reflect management’s view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions such as acquisition and disposition activity, rental rates, occupancy levels, operating and general and administrative expenses, weighted average diluted shares outstanding, and interest rates.\nOur 2018 outlook and assumptions are as follows:\n2018 Outlook Projected net loss per basic & diluted common share ($0.15) - ($0.08) Adjustments: Real estate depreciation and amortization $1.92 Gain on sale of depreciable real estate ($0.55) Projected FFO per diluted common share $1.22 - $1.29 Adjustments: Reversal of Fifth Third Center default interest $0.05 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 1 $0.18 Projected FFO, excluding certain items, per diluted common share $1.45 - $1.52 Assumptions used in 2018 outlook above: Dispositions of non-target properties $145mm - $270mm Strategic acquisitions $75mm - $175mm Same store cash NOI growth 6.5% - 7.5% Same store NOI growth 0.5% - 1.5% Straight line rent and lease incentive revenue $5.5mm - $6.5mm Above- and below-market rent amortization $5.5mm - $6.5mm General & administrative expenses, excluding certain items $21.0mm - $22.0mm Year-end occupancy 88.5% - 90.5% Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 48.5mm 1 Represents $8.5mm loss from write-off of deferred financing costs upon recast of our credit facility on January 18, 2018\nSupplemental Information\nA copy of our supplemental information regarding our financial results and operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, is available on our Investor Relations website at www.tierreit.com/ir , or by contacting our Investor Relations department by email to ir@tierreit.com .\nConference Call\nA conference call will be held on Tuesday, February 13, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time/10:00 a.m. Central time to discuss matters pertaining to this release.

Approximately $6.2 million of these losses were recovered from business interruption insurance proceeds, net of a deductible and estimated saved expenses. (1) Includes our pro rata share of consolidated and unconsolidated amounts, including for our period of ownership of properties sold. (2) Interest rate swaps are adjusted to fair value through other comprehensive income (loss). However, because our interest rate swaps do not have a LIBOR floor while the hedged debt is subject to a LIBOR floor, the portion of the change in fair value of our interest rate swaps attributable to this mismatch is reclassified to interest rate hedge ineffectiveness income within “interest expense” on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). (3) We have a non-recourse loan in default which subjects us to incur default interest at a rate that is 500 basis points higher than the stated interest rate.
