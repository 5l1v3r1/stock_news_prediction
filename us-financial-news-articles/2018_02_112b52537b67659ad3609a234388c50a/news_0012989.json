(NASDAQ:CSTE), a manufacturer of high quality engineered quartz surfaces, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 9.8% to a fourth quarter record level of $148.1 million as compared to $135.0 million in the same quarter of the prior year; on a constant currency basis, fourth quarter revenue growth was 7.0%. Increase in revenue was driven primarily by continued strong performance in the United States and Canada, which grew 10.3% and 15.0%, respectively.\nRaanan Zilberman, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “This has been a challenging year, however we were pleased with our top line increase, especially our 10% growth in the U.S. We are also pleased with our first year of direct distribution in the U.K., which yielded significant double digit revenue growth and we believe represents a solid growth opportunity going forward. At the same time, the growing quartz category has continued to evolve with increased competition from manufacturers in low cost countries. Our intention is to accelerate the innovation stream of new products and colors and to continue leading the global market with our premium brand and strong position. In addition, we have accelerated our efforts to diversify our production sourcing to improve our competitive position.”\nGross margin in the fourth quarter was 31.3% compared to 38.1% in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in margin was attributable to lower production throughput in Israel, increased polyester prices, lower average selling prices in some regions and a higher portion of fabrication and installation revenue, which comes with lower margins.\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter were $51.3 million, or 34.6% of revenue, as compared to $32.3 million, or 23.9% of revenue, in the same quarter last year. This increase in expenses was primarily due to legal settlements and loss contingency expenses which totaled $17.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $3.1 million in the same quarter last year. This growth was primarily attributable to the result of the arbitration with Kfar Giladi, an action which commenced in 2011. Excluding legal settlements and loss contingency expenses, operating expenses would have been 23.1% of revenue in this year’s fourth quarter compared to 21.6% in the same quarter last year, reflecting increased sales and marketing investments in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nThe arbitration result described above drove an operating loss in the fourth quarter of $4.9 million, compared to a profit of $19.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which excludes expenses for share-based compensation as well as legal settlements and loss contingencies, was $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a margin of 14.2%. This compares to adjusted EBITDA of $30.0 million in the prior year’s fourth quarter, a margin of 22.2%. This year-over-year margin comparison reflects the gross margin and operating expenses factors mentioned above.\nFinance expenses in the fourth quarter were $1.1 million compared to $1.0 million during the same period in the prior year. Increased expenses related to exchange rate fluctuations were offset by higher interest income from bank deposits and reduced bank fees.\nThe Company reported a net loss attributable to controlling interest for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $6.4 million compared to income of $15.1 million in the same quarter in the prior year. Diluted and basic net loss per share for the fourth quarter was $0.19 compared to diluted net income per share of $0.37 in the prior year's fourth quarter. Adjusted diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.22 compared to last year’s fourth quarter level of $0.53, both calculated on 34.4 million shares.\nFull-Year Results\nThe Company grew revenue for the full year of 2017 by 9.2% to a record of $588.1 million compared to $538.5 million in 2016; on a constant currency basis, growth was 7.4%. Growth was led by the United States and Canada, which grew at rates of 10.2% and 14.1%, respectively.\nGross margin was 33.5% compared to 39.5% in 2016. The year-over-year gross margin difference was driven by lower throughput in Israel, increased polyester prices, an increased portion of total production coming from Richmond-Hill plant which continues to require higher costs, and an increased content of fabrication and installation revenue.\nOperating expenses in 2017 were $156.7 million, or 26.6% of revenue, compared to $119.7 million, or 22.2% of revenue, in the prior year. Legal settlements and loss contingency expenses were $24.8 million in 2017 compared with $5.9 million last year. Excluding legal settlements and loss contingency expenses, operating expenses would have been 22.4% of revenue compared to 21.1% in 2016. This increase in expenses as a percent of sales mainly reflects planned investments in marketing and sales capabilities to support current and future growth in the United States and the shift to a direct distribution in the United Kingdom in early 2017.\nOperating income in 2017 was $40.5 million, a margin of 6.9%, compared to $92.8 million in 2016, a margin of 17.2%.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which excludes share-based compensation expenses, legal settlements and loss contingencies expenses and other non-recurring items, was $100.4 million in 2017, a margin of 17.1%. This compares to adjusted EBITDA of $130.3 million in the prior year, a margin of 24.2%. This year-over-year margin difference reflects the gross margin factors and the increased investment in marketing and sales described above.\nFinance expenses in 2017 were $5.6 million compared to $3.3 million during the prior year. Expenses related to exchange rate fluctuations were up $2.9 million, partially offset by increased interest income from our bank deposits.\nNet income attributable to controlling interest was $26.2 million for the full year of 2017 compared to $74.6 million in 2016. Adjusted net income attributable to controlling interest was $49.8 million compared to $81.2 million in 2016. Adjusted diluted income per share was $1.45 on 34.4 million shares in 2017, compared to $2.33 on 34.8 million shares in the prior year.\nThe Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 including cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits was $138.7 million, an increase of $36.8 million net of bank loans, relative to 2016 year-end.\nDividend\nThe Company declared a special cash dividend of $0.29 per ordinary share to be paid to shareholders of record as of February 21, 2018, payable on March 14, 2018. The dividend payment is subject to withholding tax of 20%.\nThe Company also adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which it intends to pay a quarterly cash dividend in the range of $0.10-$0.15 per share up to the lesser of 50% of the reported net income attributable to controlling interest (i) on a quarterly basis or (ii) on a year-to-date basis, subject in each case to approval by its board of directors.\nThe Company believes that the special dividend and its new dividend policy will not affect its ability to fund its growth strategy, including anticipated capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future.\nGuidance\nThe Company today issued guidance for the full-year of 2018. It expects its 2018 revenue to be in the range of $612 million to $632 million, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $102 million to $110 million.\nConference Call Details\nRaanan Zilberman, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and Yair Averbuch, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the results, followed by a question and answer session for the investment community.
