Five people were rescued.\nThe cause of Wednesday nightâ€™s fire in the city of Sapporo, on the island of Hokkaido, was still being investigated and victims were still being identified, police said.\nPublic broadcaster NHK coverage of the fire showed flames engulfing the three-storey building surrounded by piles of snow.
