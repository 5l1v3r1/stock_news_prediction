Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed optimism about the U.S. economy and said recent data had strengthened his confidence on inflation, prompting increased bets that the U.S. central bank will squeeze in a fourth rate hike this year. Although Asian markets are quite sensitive to U.S. rate increases, strong economic growth in the region is expected to attract steady inflows, said Manny Cruz, an analyst with Asiasec Equities Inc in Manila. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sank 1.1 percent in the session, after Wall Street suffered on Tuesday its biggest daily drop since the selloff three weeks ago. Philippines shares slumped as much as 1.3 percent, dragged by industrials and financials. Conglomerate SM Investments Corp dipped 1.9 percent, while Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc fell 3.6 percent. Malaysian shares fell 0.5 percent, with lender CIMB Group Holdings slipping 0.8 percent and Tenaga Nasional Bhd inching 0.6 percent lower. Malaysia's annual inflation rate, which stayed above 3 percent each month last year, likely cooled to 2.9 percent in January, according to a Reuters poll. The data is due later in the day. Indonesian shares also fell, led by a decline in PT Bank Central Asia Tbk which accounted for most of the losses. Meanwhile, Vietnam shares firmed slightly and Thai shares held steady. Thailand's annual industrial output slightly beat expectations as it rose for a third straight month in January, helped by higher production of cars, petroleum and rubber products, data showed.
