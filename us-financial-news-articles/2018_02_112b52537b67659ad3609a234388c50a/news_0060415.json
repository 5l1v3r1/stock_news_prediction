Thanks in part to robust growth in construction projects during 2017, Burns & McDonnell has for the first time recorded total annual sales of $3.2 billion.\nAfter decades of partnering on projects, Burns & McDonnell, an engineering, architecture, construction and consulting firm, made it official in late 2016 and acquired Appleton, Wisconsin-based AZCO. Since the transaction was completed, AZCO has expanded into a number of additional states, increased employees by nearly 20 percent and achieved annual revenue of $300 million.\n\"As employee-owned companies for decades, it's no surprise that our foundations for success are identical,\" says Burns & McDonnell Chairman and CEO Ray Kowalik. \"Burns & McDonnell and AZCO both believe in hiring the best and brightest and then putting customer service first. We're pleased by the sales and financial results, but we realize they are just an outcome of keeping our focus where it belongs: on the customer.\"\nTogether, AZCO and Burns & McDonnell specialize in taking on the most difficult and complex heavy industrial projects, ranging from new construction to overhauls, upgrades and retrofits. AZCO's in-house fabrication and direct-hire construction give project teams more control over many of the variables that can make or break a project.\n\"AZCO has long been one of the industry's premier industrial contractors,\" says Randy Griffin, Burns & McDonnell executive board member and president of the Construction/Design-Build Group. \"They give our customers the advantage of one team that can take many risk factors out of the most labor-intensive, difficult phases of industrial construction projects. Every project owner wants the predictability of safety, schedule and cost, and we believe the key to delivering on those goals is to take variables out of the equation. AZCO gives us even more ability to do that.\"\nRecent large projects from this pairing include:\nDenton Energy Center, Denton, Texas Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin Marquette Hospital, Marquette, Michigan Boeing Everett Campus 777X Commissioning Program, Everett, Washington\n\"We take great pride in stepping up and competing for large, complex projects like the new Foxconn assembly facility to be built right here in our backyard of Wisconsin,\" says John Trottier, president and CEO of AZCO. \"This project is going to test the abilities of a lot of great construction firms. We believe the construction firms that have the most flexibility in project delivery — from direct-hire to multiple service specialties like steel erection, mechanical construction, heavy rigging and setting of manufacturing equipment — will be in the best position to compete.\"\nFor photos and support materials, please visit our MEDIA KIT .\nAbout Burns & McDonnell\nBurns & McDonnell is made up of more than 6,000 engineers, architects, construction professionals, commissioning specialists, scientists, consultants and entrepreneurs.
