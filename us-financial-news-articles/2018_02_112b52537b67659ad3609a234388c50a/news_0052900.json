Now with this event it’s unbelievable it’s so nice,” said the fourth member of the Swiss team, Denise Feierabend.\n“Most of the time we are for ourselves that’s why it’s really special to compete as a team.”\nFUN EVENT The first new event since super-G joined the Alpine programme at Calgary three decades ago, each tie had two heats for men and two for women racers with the times of the fastest of each sex for each nation combined to decide draws.\n“I think it’s a really fun event. It’s new and we’re still working out the kinks,” said American Megan McJames.\n“But both racing someone head-on-head and being able to train and race with the boys is super fun.”\nThe United States, without Mikaela Shiffron, Lindsey Vonn and Ted Ligety, were, however, knocked out in the first round on that basis by Britain after a 2-2 draw in their tie.\nSweden were among the favourites with both Pyeongchang slalom champions, Andre Myhrer and Frida Hansdotter, in their team but they were thrashed 4-0 by a clinical Austrian outfit in the quarter-finals.\n“We had a tough draw with Sweden in the second so I thought we did very well,” said Matt.\n“The course is short so you have to be more precise than the slalom and GS. It’s a cool event that should be continued.”\nNorway also ended the Olympics of the British skiers on time differential in the last eight despite Dave Ryding winning the final heat for a 2-2 draw.\nThe Norwegians were unable to make it past the Austrians in the semi-finals, however, and it took a brilliant final run by Leif Kristian Nestvold-Haugen to beat Clement Noel by three 10ths of a second to secure the bronze and claim the record.\n“It’s very humbling,” Nestvold-Haugen said.\n“Even underneath the skisuit I get goosebumps talking about it, that the Alpine team of Norway could get that 38th medal.” (Additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan,; Editing by John O‘Brien and Sudipto Ganguly)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T12:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:00:29.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
