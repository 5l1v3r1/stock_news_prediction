Loan syndication is expected to be completed by mid-February, said the sources.\nA spokesman for the Saudi debt management office said: “The DMO is coordinating this transaction directly with all financial institutions and it would be inappropriate to comment further whilst discussions are still ongoing.”\nHSBC declined to comment, while JPMorgan and MUFG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nSaudi Arabia approached banks last month with requests for proposals to refinance its $10 billion loan, and also for further U.S. dollar-denominated bond issuance and potential financing backed by foreign export credit agencies.\nThe loan refinancing will include a repricing of the debt facility and a maturity extension, to 2023 from 2021. It will include an Islamic finance tranche using a murabaha structure, according to a DMO statement last month.\nThe sources said the size of the loan refinancing had not been determined yet and would depend on how much Saudi Arabia planned to raise in each of the fund-raising exercises on which it was working, including its international bond issuance and domestic sales of local currency sukuk.\nOther banks potentially participating in the loan deal will likely include European, American and Japanese banks, said the sources.\nSaudi Arabia raised the syndicated loan facility in 2016, in what was its first jumbo debt transaction after a slump in international oil prices. That deal opened the way to a $17.5 billion bond issue later that year, which was the largest bond ever sold by an emerging market issuer.\nSince then, Saudi Arabia has borrowed extensively, both locally and internationally, through conventional and Islamic debt instruments. A new U.S. dollar-denominated bond deal could be marketed over the next few weeks, banking sources said.\nFahad al-Saif, president of the DMO, said last month that the requests for proposals sent to banks were “another step in realising our ambition to establish a prominent position in international debt markets as part of Vision 2030”.\nThe Vision 2030 economic reform plan aims to move the Saudi economy away from oil dependence and towards the private sector.
