REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger Norway’s Aksel Svindal, who was second after the downhill segment behind Germany’s Thomas Dressen, surprisingly decided not to run the slalom leg.\nA Norwegian team official said that while Svindal did not have an injury, he was concerned about his knee after the warm-up.\nSlideshow (6 Images) Early leader Dressen, who has little slalom pedigree, finished in ninth position on a day when organizers were delighted to finally get action underway following 48 hours of weather postponements.\nWith strong winds still a concern, the competition went ahead with an adjusted downhill stage, racing lower down the course at the designated super-G start and using the ‘blue wind line’ which made for easier jumps.\nDressen was first out and completed the course in one minute, 19.24 seconds and Hirscher, second down, was 1.32 seconds slower.\nThe winds soon whipped up and caused problems on the relatively benign jumps, however.\nRussian Pavel Trikhichev and American Ryan Cochran-Siegle both crashed out after clipping gates.\nItalian Peter Fill somehow managed to land safely when the wind caught him midway through a jump and forced him into an awkward position, but he then crashed out in the slalom.\nReporting by Simon Evans and Nick Mulvenney; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T07:27:25.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
