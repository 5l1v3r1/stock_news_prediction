Net commission income rose 3.9 percent to 740.6 million euros.\nThe bank, which reported a net profit of 176.4 million euros for 2017, said it would pay a dividend of 11 euro cents a share, up from 6 euro cents in the previous year.\nOn Wednesday Banco BPM also stepped up its target for shedding bad debts, aiming to lower them to around 11.5 percent of its total loans by the end of 2020.
