(OTCPink:GOHE) (\"Global\") is pleased to announce that the CEO of its majority owned subsidiary, MoneyTrac Technology, Inc. (\"MTRAC\", the \"Company\"), Vanessa Luna has opted on her own accord to indefinitely suspend her salary effective March 1, 2018. The intent of this move is to contribute to the acceleration of the Company's current vision and objectives which involve leveraging the many different strategic partnerships they have established towards bringing the Company to a point of positive revenue.\nThe end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018 has proven to be a very active and successful period for MoneyTrac. The acquisition of PotSaver at the end of last year brought MTRAC a well-established network of businesses throughout the various verticals that are emerging across the cannabis industry. Banking and financial compliance are among the most underserved of these vertical markets and MTRAC will leverage its network of dispensaries to bring its mission of \"BANKING THE UNBANKABLE\" to fruition in 2018.\nThe indefinite deferment of Ms. Luna's salary will offer the Company the opportunity to earmark additional funds and resources for the specific use of supporting existing endeavors such as the MTRAC-Token. The barriers surrounding payments in the cannabis industry have proven to be significant, and the Company is using the current industry traction to launch this token in an effort to solve this problem.\n\"This moment is pivotal for MoneyTrac's growth and development.\" said MTRAC CEO, Vanessa Luna. \"Our Company has dedicated a tremendous amount of time, effort, and resources, both financial and otherwise, over the past year to put us in the enviable position we are in today within this industry. It is my hope that my willingness to forego my salary for an indefinite period of time will be viewed as a testament to the unwavering confidence and faith I have in the future success of MoneyTrac Technology.\"\nAbout Global Payout, Inc.
