In Australia it is participating in several naval and land sales campaigns alongside partners, he said. \nLeonardo is also seeking to boost sales of maritime security equipment, such as coastal radar and the ATR72MP patrol and electronic surveillance aircraft, in Southeast Asia. \n“The areas around Singapore have similar issues related to security as the Mediterranean - for example, protection of commercial activities, coastal security, anti-piracy,” Mariani said. “These are all threats where we can bring a very wide spectrum of solutions.” \n($1 = 0.8010 euros) Reporting by Jamie Freed in Singapore; Additional reporting by Guilia Segreti in Milan; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T10:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T10:31:16.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
