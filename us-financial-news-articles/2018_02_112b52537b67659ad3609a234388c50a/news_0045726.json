In the transition, the ski came off uncharacteristically. The same thing happened on the second run.”\nFreestyle Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's Ski Halfpipe Final - Phoenix Snow Park - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 22, 2018 - David Wise of the U.S. reacts. REUTERS/Jorge Silva “For run three, we cranked my bindings up as high as they go,” he added.\n“My leg is coming off before my ski does. I dropped in and I knew first of all that I had to make it happen and second of all that I could.”\nWise managed to top a world-class field through being the only man capable of landing four different double corks in the same run.\n“Everybody here can do one of those four tricks. They all have one of them in there, so they are not that hard,” stressed Wise.\nSlideshow (10 Images) ”I am not going to say that all of my tricks are the hardest in the game but putting all four of them into a run is certainly the most challenging thing I have ever done in my life.”\nPorteous produced the run of his young life to step on the podium alongside the two Americans.\nAfter laying down a second run to move into second place, he then decided just to ride down the pipe and not attempt any tricks in the final round, shouting out “can’t do better than that” as he reached the bottom.\nHis score was enough to secure the bronze medal and the teenager said he just had nothing left to give in the final round.\n“I had nothing left. That was me. That was all I had left in the bag,” said the Kiwi.\n“I hope people don’t see it as me being cocky. I had nothing left. It was the best run of my life, hands down.”\nHis compatriot Beau-James Wells finished an admirable fourth, after seeing his brother Byron crash-land during practice and pull out before the start.\nA New Zealand team spokesman confirmed Byron had suffered a knee injury.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by John O'Brien/Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T06:19:01.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
