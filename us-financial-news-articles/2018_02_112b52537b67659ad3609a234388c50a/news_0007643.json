The official number is not disclosed by the party.\nBut Fox, speaking during a trade visit to China with May, called on party colleagues to stop obsessing about domestic politics and take note of how she is viewed by leaders overseas.\nBritain's Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox leaves 10 Downing Street in London, January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville “They look at the Prime Minister in a different way than some of, let’s say, the internal tea room discussions in the UK do,” he told the BBC, referring to the private tea rooms in parliament historically used by lawmakers to plot and gossip.\n“I do wish more of my party colleagues have seen the sort of leadership and commitment and positive agenda that’s been projected for Britain here in China,” Fox said in a separate interview with ITN.\nThe endorsement from Fox - seen as a loyal member of cabinet, but one who is strongly aligned with so-called “Brexiteers” - comes after May announced steps towards closer trade cooperation with China.\nHowever, questions on her future have overshadowed the trip, prompting May to declare “I‘m not a quitter” - the second time during her 18 months in power she has deployed the phrase to try and play down speculation she could quit or be toppled.\n“I will give full support to the prime minister as long as she wants to lead my party,” Fox told ITN.\nReporting by William James; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T08:26:25.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
