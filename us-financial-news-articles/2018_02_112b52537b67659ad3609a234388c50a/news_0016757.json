The line, including the traditional headscarves, will go on sale. Feb. 15, with prices ranging from $13 to $85. \nBeyond hijabs, the collection includes modest dresses, tops, cardigans, and pants. The brand will only be available on macys.com. \nThe line springs from The Workshop at Macy’s, a program that fosters minority- and women-owned businesses. \nThe Verona Collection founder Lisa Vogl started the brand after feeling frustrated with a lack of fashionable choices for people who prefer more demure clothing. \n“Verona Collection is more than a clothing brand. It’s a platform for a community of women to express their personal identity and embrace fashion that makes them feel confident on the inside and outside,” Vogl said in a press release .
