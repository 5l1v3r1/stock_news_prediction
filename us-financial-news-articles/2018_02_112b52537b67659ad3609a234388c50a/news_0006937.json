(NASDAQ GS: MINI) (the “Company” or “Mobile Mini”), the world’s leading supplier of portable storage solutions and a leading provider of tank and pump solutions in the United States, today reported actual and adjusted financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Total revenues were $146.7 million and rental revenues were $138.5 million, as compared to $130.4 million and $124.2 million, respectively, for the same period last year.\nRental revenues for the Storage Solutions and Tank & Pump Solutions businesses for the current quarter were $112.8 million and $25.7 million, respectively.\nThe Company recorded net income of $92.1 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to net income of $19.5 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter net income was $18.1 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, as compared to adjusted net income of $21.2 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $55.6 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.9% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDividend\nThe Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 25.0 cents per share, which will be paid on March 14, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 28, 2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nDelivered a strong 11.0% year-over-year increase in Storage Solutions rental revenues, 9.8% when adjusted for favorable currency fluctuations. Achieved a 14.2% increase in year-over-year Tank & Pump Solutions rental revenue growth. Increased total Storage Solutions average units on rent by 5.3% year-over-year, with average utilization of 75.7% and utilization of 74.1% at December 31, 2017. Raised Storage Solutions rental rates by 4.2% year-over-year, with rates on new rentals up 5.1%. Improved OEC utilization for Tank & Pump Solutions, averaging 73.0% for the quarter, compared to 62.3% in the prior-year quarter, and ending the year at 71.2%. Achieved adjusted EBITDA of $55.6 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.9%, despite year-over-year headwinds of $5.9 million in increased variable compensation expense. Generated net cash from operating activities of $39.8 million and strong free cash flow of $18.2 million.\nCEO Comments\nErik Olsson, Mobile Mini’s President and Chief Executive Officer, remarked, “The fourth quarter of 2017 was exceptional for both of our business segments. In addition to the wide-spread pick up across our Tank & Pump segment, our downstream customers began the turnaround and maintenance activities that had been previously deferred, resulting in a 14.2% year-over-year increase in Tank & Pump Solutions fourth quarter rental revenue. Within Storage Solutions, we saw record-high seasonal rentals, as well as healthy growth in our core business. As expected, variable compensation expense mitigated the fourth quarter profit flow-through; however, our underlying margins are strong and improving quarter by quarter. Excluding the effect of the variable compensation, the adjusted EBITDA margin increased approximately 70 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.”\nMr. Olsson continued, “Mobile Mini is very well positioned to leverage our infrastructure, including the unique suite of digital solutions we introduced in 2017, to further capitalize on the current momentum. In 2017, Tank & Pump Solutions reached an inflection point, with increased sequential revenue throughout the year, and the business is poised to take advantage of the increasingly strong demand from our customers. Additionally, our core North American Storage Solutions business is strong entering 2018, with pending orders considerably in excess of this time in the prior year. As a result, we expect healthy top line and adjusted EBITDA growth, expanded margins and increased free cash flow in 2018.”\nUnited States Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”), which, among other things, reduces the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and requires mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net benefit of $77.6 million. In addition, we recorded a provisional income tax expense of $3.1 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. We estimate that our 2018 consolidated effective tax rate will be between 24% and 26%. We do not expect a significant near-term impact on cash paid for taxes.\nConference Call\nMobile Mini will host a conference call today, Friday, February 2 at 12 noon ET to review these results.

Adjusted net income and related earnings per share information exclude certain transactions that management believes are not indicative of our business. We believe that the inclusion of this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier to compare our financial performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net income before discontinued operations, net of tax (if applicable), interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and debt restructuring or extinguishment expense (if applicable), including any write-off of deferred financing costs. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes certain non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation, as well as transactions that management believes are not indicative of our business. Because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some but not all items that affect our cash flow from operating activities, they may not be comparable to similarly titled performance measures presented by other companies.\nWe present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding our ability to meet our future debt payment requirements, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and an overall evaluation of our financial condition. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations as analytical tools and should not be used as substitutes for net income, cash flows from operations, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins are calculated as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, respectively, divided by total revenues expressed as a percentage.\nFree Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, minus or plus, net cash used in or provided by investing activities, excluding acquisitions and certain transactions. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present free cash flow because we believe it provides useful information regarding our liquidity and ability to meet our short-term obligations. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash available after capital expenditures for, among other things, investments in our existing business, debt service obligations, payment of authorized quarterly dividends, repurchase of our common stock and strategic small acquisitions.\nConstant Currency. We calculate the effect of currency fluctuations on current periods by translating the results for our business in the U.K. during the current period using the average exchange rates from the comparative period. We present constant currency information to provide useful information to assess our underlying business excluding the effect of material foreign currency rate fluctuations. Calculated in constant currency, our rental revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $1.3 million lower than when calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180202005090/en/\nMobile Mini, Inc.\nVan Welch, 602-308-3879\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nwww.mobilemini.com\nor\nInvestor Relations Counsel:\nThe Equity Group Inc.\nFred Buonocore, 212-836-9607\nKevin Towle, 212-836-9620\nSource: Mobile Mini, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180202005090/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobilemini.com&esheet=51752886&lan=en-US&anchor=www.mobilemini.com&index=3&md5=2530268e42cf2be7730f03df8ae27130", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobilemini.com&esheet=51752886&newsitemid=20180202005090&lan=en-US&anchor=www.mobilemini.com&index=1&md5=2c65d58bd116d2fc65aa5555e545a43f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobilemini.com&esheet=51752886&newsitemid=20180202005090&lan=en-US&anchor=www.mobilemini.com&index=2&md5=105767661a1a3c593070b2cf034ca4e6"], "published": "2018-02-02T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T15:21:43.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
