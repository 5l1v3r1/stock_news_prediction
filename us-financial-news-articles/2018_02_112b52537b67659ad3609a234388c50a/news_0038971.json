Volumes were exceptionally light across the complex with less than 200 lots of turnover. * SHFE: The Shanghai Futures Exchange was closed for the Lunar New Year. Markets will reopen on Thursday, Feb. 22. * DOLLAR: The dollar found some traction following last week's steep fall and managed to hold above a three-year low against a basket of currencies. * INVESTORS: Hedge funds and money managers cut their net long positions in COMEX gold and copper contracts in the week to Feb. 13, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed on Friday.
