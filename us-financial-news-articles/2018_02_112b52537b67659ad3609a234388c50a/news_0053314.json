The greenback fell broadly, falling 1% against the Japanese yen, 0.4% against the euro and 0.3% versus the British pound.\nThe dollar had rallied Wednesday after the minutes of the Fed’s Jan. 30-31 meeting showed that several officials believed the pace of economic growth was set to accelerate even after raising their projections at the central bank’s December meeting. Some officials also appeared more certain that over the coming year inflation could head back to the 2% target set by policy makers after years of consistently lagging.\nDespite the optimistic tone, the dollar later lost support as investors failed to discern language indicating that Fed officials are contemplating increasing the pace of interest-rate increases beyond the three they penciled in for 2018 at their December meeting .\n“At this point in time, there isn’t anything the markets could latch onto” that would suggest additional rate increases are in the offing, said Paresh Upadhyaya, who manages currencies at Amundi Pioneer Investments.\nFed officials will offer revised forecasts at their meeting in March, where they are widely expected to raise rates for the sixth time since December 2015.\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T02:01:40.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
