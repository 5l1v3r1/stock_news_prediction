Insurers may cover some of the payout.\nLawyers for the shareholders called the settlement “fair, reasonable, and adequate,” citing the risk of a loss at trial, according to court papers.\nIn Monday afternoon trading, Facebook shares were up 93 cents at $184.22 on the Nasdaq.\nThe case is In re: Facebook Inc IPO Securities and Derivative Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-md-02389.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T21:35:31.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
