It has the capacity to liquefy 0.2 bcf per day of gas.\nAndeavor also operates a 62,700 barrel-per-day refinery in Kenai.\nReporting by Vijaykumar Vedala in Bengaluru\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T00:21:59.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
