During the year, we distributed over $40 million in dividends and ranked #1 in total shareholder return among the 17 U.S. Public Shopping Center REITs (1) . Through the date of this letter, we continue to rank #1 of 17, #2 of 17, and #4 of 15 in total shareholder return for the one-year, three-year and five-year periods (2) , respectively. We believe that our high-quality properties, simple capital structure, forward-thinking strategy, and well-aligned business model and infrastructure will allow us to continue to grow profitably and add long-term shareholder value. Today, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Trustees has approved new long-term goals for our Company, each of which we intend to achieve over the next five years.\nWhitestone’s Unique Value Proposition\nAt the center of Whitestone’s success is our entrepreneurial culture, built on our differentiated strategy that focuses on neighborhood necessities and service-based retail properties. The dominance of Amazon and other e-commerce providers in the retail industry has negatively impacted the retail real estate segment of the REIT industry. This has created a major void in communities to meet and fill neighborhood consumer needs for local necessities and services.\nOur long-term strategy is to become a leading provider of these services within the fastest growing cities in business-friendly states by acquiring, developing, redeveloping and operating Community Centered Properties TM in neighborhoods with high household incomes leading to higher consumer spending. We research consumer behavior, understand the needs of the surrounding community, determine which services and necessities are missing, acquire unique properties in the respective communities, find entrepreneurial tenants to meet the local needs, and provide our infrastructure of people and processes to ensure the shopping center and its tenants are successful. During this age of digital disruption, we focus on the shared needs of the surrounding neighborhood, such as specialty retail, grocery, restaurants and medical, educational and financial services. We believe that this approach will allow us to maximize potential property income and stability, and increase shareholder value.\nWe strive to strategically optimize the tenant mix of each of our community-centered properties and create a “go-to” place for connection, with a high frequency of visits from consumers in the surrounding neighborhoods. We believe that our approach drives increased cash flow with additional upside to grow occupancies, rents, and overall square footage, while limiting our downside from the restrictive leases of tenants that typically occupy big boxes. This approach also minimizes the capital costs that many owners of retail properties will incur over the next several years to downsize or re-purpose these “big boxes.” Our innovative approach and investment in our properties will enable us to provide an attractive return to our shareholders in the form of dividends and ultimately share price appreciation.\nFurther Differentiated by Diversity\nAs we continue to develop new approaches to maximize the income extracted from Whitestone’s real estate assets, we recognize that diversity has long been a key component of our success. Our associates include native speakers of 31 different languages and dialects and our properties serve a diverse mix of communities. The Company's multi-cultural, multi-lingual team of associates has been instrumental in attracting outstanding local tenants – now in excess of 1,600 – enabling us to meet the needs of vibrant, rapidly growing neighborhoods in our target markets.\nWhitestone’s commitment to diversity is also now proudly reflected in our Board of Trustees. During the past year, the Board appointed three new independent Trustees – Nandita Berry, Najeeb Khan and David Taylor. They bring extensive strategic planning and government leadership, technology and human resources expertise, and corporate legal experience, respectively, to complement the Board’s existing leadership and real estate capabilities.\nOur culture and philosophy have also prepared us well for potential challenges. We offer specialized training and education programs for our associates, while meeting our obligations and responsibilities to our various stakeholders. For example, our environmental commitments address climate change in several ways, including re-tenanting space with LED lighting, energy efficient equipment, and air filtration systems.\nLooking to 2018 and beyond, we are energized by the opportunity ahead to continue developing a truly world class company, creating long-term value for our shareholders, providing employment and career opportunities for our associates, and being a positive influence in the communities in which we operate.\nClearly Defined Long-Term Objectives\nAs previously mentioned, our Board recently adopted Whitestone’s new long-term goals. Our 2023 goals include:\n• Targeting reduced leverage, including a Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio range of 6 to 7 times; and • Targeting an improved general and administrative expense-to-revenue ratio range of 8 to 10 percent by scaling our operating infrastructure over a larger base of revenue and assets. Additional Goals\nWe will also continue to be good stewards of our capital – carefully balancing priorities that will fuel our growth and scale our operating infrastructure to continue to:\n• Increase market presence in our existing markets in the Sunbelt states, including: Houston, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Austin, San Antonio, and Phoenix-Scottsdale; • Produce industry-leading growth rates in our financial and operating metrics; • Grow our cash flow targeting an improving dividend payout ratio; • Cultivate valuable, long-term relationships with our shareholders, stakeholders, and tenants; and • Train future leaders and managers through our Real Estate Executive Development program to support additional growth. On behalf of the Board and management team, I would like to express our gratitude for your continued investment. We look forward to an outstanding 2018 and beyond.\nSincerely,\nJames C. Mastandrea\nChairman and CEO\nAbout Whitestone REIT\nWhitestone is a pure-play community-centered retail REIT that acquires, owns, manages, develops and redevelops high quality “e-commerce resistant” neighborhood, community and lifestyle retail centers principally located in the largest, fastest-growing and most affluent markets in the Sunbelt.
