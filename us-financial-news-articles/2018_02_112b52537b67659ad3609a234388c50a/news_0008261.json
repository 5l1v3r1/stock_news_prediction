Some European politicians and human rights groups say the crackdown shows Turkey is sliding into authoritarian rule.\nTurkish authorities have jailed more than 50,000 people and sacked or suspended more than 150,000 since the coup, which Ankara blames on supporters of a Muslim cleric living in self-imposed exile in the United States.\nThe government says such measures are necessary given the multiple security threats it faces. The cleric, Fethullah Gulen, denies involvement in the coup, in which 250 people were killed.\nDozens of German nationals have been detained in Turkey over the past two years, some of them for alleged links to the coup plotters.\nEarlier on Friday, a Greek court ruled that a man accused of being behind a series of suicide bombings in Turkey could not be extradited because his life would be in danger back at home.\nReporting by Thomas Escritt; additional reporting by Michelle Martin, Editing by William Maclean and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T17:24:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
