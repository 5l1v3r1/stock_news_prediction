They have lost 120 billion rupees ($1.86 billion) in market value since Feb. 12, when the lender disclosed fraudulent transactions at a branch.\n“There has been a sense of negativity among market participants (after the fraud) and this has shattered the confidence for PSU banks,” said Saurabh Jain, assistant vice president of research at SMC Global Securities, adding that this was benefiting private sector lenders.\nThe broader NSE index was up 0.14 percent at 10,392.85 as of 0538 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.23 percent higher at 33,851.49.\nThe Nifty IT index rose as much as 1.3 percent.\nPortfolio shuffling, together with expectations of stable earnings, is prompting investors to flock in the IT pack, said Jain of SMC Global Securities.\nTata Consultancy Services and Infosys Ltd were the top percentage gainers on the NSE index, up 1.5 percent and 1 percent respectively.\nThe Nifty PSU bank index dropped for a seventh consecutive session. The index has now erased most of its gains since Oct. 24, when the government first announced its recapitalisation plan for public sector banks.\nPrivate sector lenders ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank climbed 1.4 percent each.\n$1 = 64.4250 Indian rupees Reporting by Tanvi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:16:46.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
