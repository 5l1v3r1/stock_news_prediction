This is the third year that Newton has been recognized as a CRN Channel Chief.\nWayne Newton oversees all commercial sales channels for Belkin's Networking Division, including government and other verticals, direct and indirect resellers, distributor partners, OEM's, and service providers in the channel. He and his team are responsible for channel development and especially the onboarding, development and growth of Linksys' channel partners.\n\"Linksys is continuously innovating to help our channel partners achieve a competitive advantage. We have developed several strategies to help small and medium-sized businesses, and the channel partners who serve them, take advantage of the benefits today's latest technologies enable,\" said Newton. \"We remain committed to developing solutions that help the reseller community reach more and more customers with value-added products and services to grow their businesses.\"\nAmong Newton's early accomplishments include the re-launch of Linksys in the SMB channel and the integration of the Linksys and Belkin Channel programs. Newton was recognized this year based on his proven expertise in developing winning channel strategies and programs that drive increased partner engagement and growth. Focused on making Linksys' PartnerAdvantage program more successful, he and his team worked to partner more deeply with key strategic partners, and to recruit and engage with specialty resellers who were actively selling complementary solutions like VOIP, Professional AV, IP Surveillance, and POS Systems, but lacked strong networking sales. Newton and his team also launched an \"Upgrade to AC\" program, which centered around educating channel partners on the newest wireless format, Wave 2 AC/MU-MIMO. The impact was incremental sales and profits for partners who adopted the approach and actively worked to incorporate Wave 2 wireless solutions into their other offerings. Lastly, he helped build programs for channel partners that allowed them to take advantage of emerging technologies like mesh networking and IoT in the small business space.\n\"The executives on CRN's 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,\" said Robert Faletra, Executive Chairman of The Channel Company.\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list, including the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs, is featured online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs and will appear in the February 2018 issue of CRN.
