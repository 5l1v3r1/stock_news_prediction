Pursuant to the capital increase related to the Tender Offer, the company is authorized to issue 10,000,000,000 new shares, which are subject to the preemptive rights offering and are to be offered for cash at a price of Ch$82 per share.\nEach share of Enel Chile common stock held of record on February 9, 2018 will entitle its holder to receive one transferable right to subscribe for 0.20370 shares of common stock. Five rights are required to subscribe for one new share at a subscription price of Ch$82 per new share. Enel Chile will accept subscriptions for whole shares only and will not issue fractional shares or cash in lieu of fractional shares.

A registration statement on Form F-3 relating to these securities offered in the United States in the rights offering and a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in such registration statement have been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\nNo Offer or Solicitations\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security and does not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction.\nNo offering of securities in the United States with respect to the Tender Offer shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nImportant Information For Investors and Security Holders\nThe Tender Offer described herein has not yet commenced.
