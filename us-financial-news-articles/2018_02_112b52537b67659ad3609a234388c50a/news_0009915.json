The IPO is expected to be issued on Thursday. \nU.S. stock indexes were higher at midday Tuesday, after sliding early in the session, but shares in Europe and elsewhere were down sharply. On Monday, the S&P 500 and the Dow notched their biggest one-day declines in more than six years. \nRosario-based Bioceres develops genes for soy, corn and wheat that withstand drought and cold temperatures. It makes insecticides, fungicides, bio-fertilizers and chemical-based fertilizers. It plans to list itself on the New York Stock Exchange, but it has been tough going for recent Argentina IPOs. \nArgentina power generation company Central Puerto SAâ€™s shares plunged on the Buenos Aires stock exchange on Friday under the weight of a weaker-than-expected debut price of its U.S.-listed stock. \nThe underwhelming debut came a day after airport operator Corporacion America Airports also priced its New York initial public offering below initial guidance, raising concerns that higher U.S. bond yields could sour prospects for a wave of Argentine companies racing to list shares on global markets \nThe indicated price range for the Bioceres IPO is $10 to $12 per share, the company said in an earlier letter to the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.
