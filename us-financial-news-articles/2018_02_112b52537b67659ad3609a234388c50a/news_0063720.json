Under current law, the FCC must deposit such payments with private banks in interest-bearing accounts, but current regulations make that impossible.\nCarriers have spent billions of dollars acquiring spectrum and beginning to develop and test 5G networks, which are expected to be at least 100 times faster than current 4G networks and cut latency to less than one thousandth of a second from one hundredth of a second in 4G, the FCC has said.\nThe technology could allow for eventual virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely and 5G networks allow for use of new bands of spectrum for mobile broadband.\nVerizon Communications Inc has announced it will begin its first 5G commercial rollout in Sacramento, California, in the second half of 2018, Pai noted.\nAT&T Inc earlier this month announced its first 5G commercial rollouts launch in Atlanta, Georgia, and Dallas and Waco, Texas, planned for later this year.\nLast week, the FCC granted to Samsung Electronics Co the world’s first regulatory approval of 28 GHz base stations, which will be used for Verizon’s planned 5G launch.\nCTIA, a U.S. trade group, said the “wireless industry needs the certainty of a spectrum pipeline, and Chairman Pai’s commitment is a critical next step to meeting the United States’ 5G ambitions.”\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T21:44:01.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
