So it is as simple as that,” Koji Tsuruoka said when asked how real the threat was to Japanese companies of Britain not securing frictionless trade. \n“This is all high stakes that all of us, I think, need to keep in mind,” he said. \nMay met the bosses of companies in areas such as banking, life sciences, technology and the manufacturing sector which have poured billions of pounds into Britain but are worried about future trading arrangements.
