The South Korean unit has racked up a total of 1.9 trillion won in net losses in the three years from 2014 to 2016.\nSome of the loans stem from 2012 and 2013, when GM Korea borrowed the funds to buy back $1.2 billion in preferred stock from former creditor and now No.2 shareholder, state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB), officials at GM Korea and KDB said.\n“This has made GM Korea bear the financial burden from its borrowings from GM Headquarters, which was able to take interest,” a former KDB executive involved in the matter told Reuters. He requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\nThe buyback was made ahead of a 2017 deadline to reduce rising dividend obligations on the preferred stock, cutting GM Korea’s costs.\n“We made an early redemption to improve our financial structure and reduce our payments burden,” a GM Korea official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters. “Local banks were reluctant to lend money because of our weak financial position.”\nBLAME GAME A former GM Korea board member with direct knowledge of the matter said GM Korea’s board had asked KDB for loans with lower interest repayments but KDB also refused to lend to the loss making firm.\n“GM couldn’t let GM Korea go bankrupt so it lent money with the same level interest rate that it charged other GM affiliates,” the source said.\n“If this is going to be a blame game over GM taking high interest, this won’t help find a solution,” he added.\nKDB declined to comment.\nIn December, KDB’s chairman delivered a letter to the head of GM Korea, demanding GM cut interest rates to help improve profits, according to a document seen by Reuters.\nKDB had asked to review GM Korea’s financial status but had been rejected by GM, a current KDB official said.\n“We asked GM to find a real cause for the losses but they rejected our proposal twice for due diligence on GM Korea,” the official said, who also requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n“Also since 2016 we keep asking GM to lower the interest rate for its loans to GM Korea, but it is not happening.”\n($1 = 1,069.8100 won)\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-min Park in SEOUL; Additional reporting by Nick Carey in DETROIT; Editing by Lincoln Feast\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T03:33:02.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
