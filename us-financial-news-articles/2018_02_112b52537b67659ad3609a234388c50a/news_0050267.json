A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.\nReporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto and Izumi Nakagawa; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T03:19:22.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
