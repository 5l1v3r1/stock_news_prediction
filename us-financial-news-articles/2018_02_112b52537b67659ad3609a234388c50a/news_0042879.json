Brent crude LCOc1 was trading at around $65 on Monday.\nRoekke’s TRG is also involved in a separate block in the area, which may provide additional resources to the development, Aker said, adding that the plan is to use a floating production, storage and offloading vessel.\nGhana is seeking to develop its oil and gas resources beyond its flagship Jubilee field. Overall it was expected to produce an average of 200,000 barrels of oil per day in 2017, the country’s deputy oil minister told Reuters in June.\nThe deal is the second between an Aker group company and Hess, following Aker BP’s ( AKERBP.OL ) purchase of the Norwegian assets of Hess in a $2 billion transaction.\nWhen the field development plan in Ghana has been approved, Aker expects to draft financial or industrial partners into the project to help pay for it.\nShares in Aker were up 1.6 percent at 1053 GMT, outperforming a 0.2 percent rise in the Oslo benchmark index .OSEBX.\nWriting by Terje Solsvik and Gwladys Fouche; editing by Louise Heavens/Jason Neely/Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T10:05:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
