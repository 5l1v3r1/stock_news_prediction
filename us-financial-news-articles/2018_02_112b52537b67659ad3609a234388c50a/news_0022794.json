Even without it, Nvidia’s revenue from gaming rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, accounting for more than half of its total revenue.\nThe company’s quarterly data center revenue - powered by the Volta-based data center GPU, Tesla V100 - more than doubled to $606 million as companies such as Alibaba ( BABA.N ), Amazon ( AMZN.O ), Alphabet ( GOOGL.O ), IBM ( IBM.N ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) adopted the new chip in their servers.\nData centers outperformed despite high expectations and Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said they should do so again given that Volta is in the early stages of adoption.\nOne pocket of concern was an 8 percent fall in automotive revenue quarter over quarter.\nAuto revenue was down as auto infotainment was becoming commoditized and the company is going through a revenue transition phase to ramping its autonomous driving platforms in volume likely in 2019, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore said.\nReporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing Patrick Graham, Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T18:15:43.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
