They fell nearly 50 percent last year.\nThe INDXX global generics and new pharma index is down 1.1 percent this year after a 17.5 percent rise in 2017.\nTeva earned 93 cents per share, excluding one-time items, in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from $1.38 a year earlier. Revenue fell 16 percent to $5.5 billion. Analysts had forecast Teva would earn 76 cents a share ex-items on revenue of $5.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTeva has already announced a restructuring to combine its generic and specialty medicine businesses, cut more than a quarter of its workforce and close many of its factories.\nThe plan, announced in December, aims to reduce costs by $3 billion by the end of 2019 from about $16.1 billion in 2017.\nGeneric drug sales in the fourth quarter fell to $3.1 billion from $3.7 billion. Sales of Copaxone fell 19 percent to $821 million. Teva forecast Copaxone sales of $1.8 billion in 2018.\n\"We noted further deterioration in the U.S. generics market and economic environment, further limitations on our ability to influence generic medicines pricing in the long term and a decrease in value from future launches,\" Teva said.\nFor 2018, Teva forecast revenue of $18.3-$18.8 billion, down from $22.4 billion in 2017, and EPS ex-items of $2.25-$2.50, down from $4.01. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.94 on revenue of $19.3 billion.\nTeva had been saddled with about $35 billion in debt since acquiring Allergan's Actavis generic drug business for $40.5 billion. Debt fell by $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter to $32.5 billion and by a further $1.1 billion so far in 2018.\nTeva said it expects to pay off at least $3.5 billion in debt this year.\n\"Starting 2018 we are focused on meeting our financial obligations and ensuring a much more solid and sustainable business model,\" Schultz said.\nChief Financial Officer Mike McClellan said Teva might look at more divestitures. The company has closed six plants since December and expects to announce another six this year.\nLast week, the company said it planned to raise $5 billion in debt securities. In December, it announced the suspension of its dividend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T17:28:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
