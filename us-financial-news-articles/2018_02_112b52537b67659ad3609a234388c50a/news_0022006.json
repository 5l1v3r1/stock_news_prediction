REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett \nProperty priced at 1 million pounds or more - which is concentrated in London - was failing to sell at its asking price in two thirds of cases. Typically, discounts of 5-10 percent were needed for it to sell, RICS said. \nAcross Britain, new instructions to sell property fell by the most since May 2017, reflecting a slowdown in the market also seen in Bank of England data last week, which showed new mortgage approvals at a three-year low.

REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo \nRICS said its members expected prices to be flat at a national level over the next three months, but to rise over the course of the year everywhere except London. \nEven in London, the expected decline over the next 12 months was smaller than had been predicted before, RICS added. \nEconomists polled by Reuters at the end of last year on average forecast that prices would grow by 1.3 percent in 2018, but fall 0.3 percent in London. \nCredit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s predicted on Wednesday that prices would rise by 0.5 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2019, as a squeeze on household incomes from high inflation and sluggish wage growth proved slow to ease.
