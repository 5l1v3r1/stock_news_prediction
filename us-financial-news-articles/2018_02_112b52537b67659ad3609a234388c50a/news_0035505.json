He said Baio exposed himself, discussed gay sex acts and once threw a hot cup of tea in his face.\nAnother star of the series, Nicole Eggert, came forward last month with claims that Baio sexually assaulted her when she was a minor while they were working together.\nBaio called those allegations false and said he and Eggert were involved in a consensual relationship when she was of legal age.\nOn Wednesday, Jennifer McGrath, an attorney for Baio, characterized the claims by Polinsky and Eggert as \"ever changing\" and evidence of \"continual hunger for publicity.\" Glicklich also suggested the allegations were motivated by a desire for media attention.\nMcGrath confirmed, however, that the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating Eggert's allegations after the actress filed a police report against Baio last week. Glicklich said attorney Leonard Levine would represent Baio in that matter, and that he would be presenting the LAPD with evidence to refute Eggert's claims.\nMcGrath showed a photo of a smiling Polinsky and Baio that she said was taken at Baio's birthday party seven years ago. Glicklich referenced an interview Eggert had given years ago where she said working with Baio on \"Charles in Charge\" was fun and that she would be happy to work with him again.\nBaio live-streamed the news conference on his Facebook page but did not attend. Glicklich and McGrath said he was at a school party with his daughter.\nAP Entertainment Writer Sandy Cohen is at www.twitter.com/YouKnowSandy .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T08:58:29.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
