The fifth was seized in a container entering Lebanon’s port of Tripoli last month.\nArchaeologists excavated all the statues in the 1960s and 1970s in Sidon at the Temple of Eshmoun, a god of healing.\nThey were carved between the sixth and fourth centuries BC, when Lebanon’s Phoenician civilization was ruled by the Persian empire but influenced by Greek art and culture.\nOne of the statues, a bull’s head, was from the capital of a pillar in the temple. The other statues, of youths and children, included one dedicated to the temple by fond relatives in thanks for the recovery from illness of their child.\n“HERITAGE IS NOT FOR SALE”\nPart of a Phoenician statue is displayed inside Beirut's National Museum in Beirut, Lebanon February 2, 2018. REUTERS/Jamal Saidi They will be added to the Beirut museum’s display of Eshmoun sculptures, which include a complete capital with bull heads facing in each direction and marble statues of babies and children.\nOnly a handful of more than 500 Eshmoun statues pillaged from the storerooms of Byblos citadel in 1981 have been identified and returned to Lebanon.\n“We will put every resource that we have to recover any piece wherever it is and whoever thinks it belongs to him. Our heritage is not for sale,” said Lebanon’s Culture Minister Ghattas Khoury.\nSlideshow (9 Images) Like these pieces, items smuggled from Iraq and Syria may stay hidden for decades before traffickers start selling them to collectors.\n“It is rare that we would see anything on the market for 10 or 20 or even 30 years, because they do have the patience. They stockpile these pieces,” said Bogdanos.\nThe international nature of the trade makes it hard to trace them.\n“If you would follow the pieces which we have here, there was a kind of ping-pong between Europe, America, Europe again ... it’s a globalisation,” said Rolf Stucky, a Swiss archaeologist who registered many of the looted Eshmoun statues on Art Loss in the 1990s, allowing them to be identified now.\nBut countries now share information and help train authorities, both in the main markets for stolen artefacts and in the regions from which they come.\nLebanon itself has stopped many foreign pieces from being shipped through Beirut, said Ghattas. As a neighbor of Syria, it is a major route for items looted from there.\n“In many respects (smugglers) didn’t have to be smart in their trafficking behavior simply because no countries were cooperating enough, were devoting enough resources to stop it,” said Bogdanos.\n“That has all changed.”\nReporting by Angus McDowall; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T18:27:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
