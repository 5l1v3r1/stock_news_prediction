Recurring Operating Income (ROI) of €2.006bn, as expected, down -14.7% at current exchange rates (representing an operating margin of 2.5%), reflecting notably: A strong competitive pressure, particularly in France, An increase in distribution costs in the Group’s main markets, An increase in depreciation after a period of significant investments, A more difficult situation in Argentina.\nROI also includes pockets of losses that continue to weigh on profitability, notably the former DIA store network.\nNet income, Group share of €(531)m, principally impacted by non-recurring charges totalling €(1.3)bn. Free cash flow excluding exceptional items of €950m , vs €1,039m in 2016, with investments of €2,145m (excluding Cargo Property), down €347m.\nAlexandre Bompard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Carrefour, declared:\n“The 2017 results that we are presenting today demonstrate the necessity of implementing without delay Carrefour’s transformation plan. The Group is fully focused on the Carrefour 2022 plan, with ambitious action plans currently being implemented in all of the group’s geographies. With this plan, whose ambition is to make Carrefour the leader of the food transition and build an omnichannel universe of reference, Carrefour is back on the offensive and is investing to resume growth.”\nKey full-year 2017 figures\n(in €m) 2016 2017 Variation\nat constant\nexchange\nrates\nCurrency\neffect\nVariation\nat current\nexchange\nrates\nGross sales 85,700 88,240 +2.7% +0.3% +3.0% Net sales 76,645 78,897 +2.6% +0.3% +2.9% Like-for-like growth ex petrol ex calendar +1.6% Recurring operating income before D&A (EBITDA) 3,886 3,636 -8.1% +1.7% -6.4% EBITDA margin 5.0% 4.6% -46 bp Recurring operating income (ROI) 2,351 2,006 -17.2% -14.7% ROI margin 3.1% 2.5% -52 bp Net income, Group share 746 (531) Adjusted net income, Group share 1,031 773 -25.0% Free cash flow from continuing operations (ex. exceptional items) 1,039 950 €(90)m Net debt at close 4,531 3,743 €(788)m Net debt /Ebitda 1.2x 1.0x -20 bp Income statement\nCarrefour posted 2017 total net sales of €78,897m, up +2.6% at constant exchange rates and up +1.6% on a like-for-like basis.\nGross margin stood at €18,214m, or 23.1% of sales, down 38 bp, principally linked to activity in France and Europe.\nDistribution costs increased by €575m in 2017, notably due to particularly marked cost inflation in Latin America.\nGroup Recurring Operating Income (ROI) stood at €2,006m, down -14.7% at current exchange rates. Operating margin, at 2.5% for the full-year, was down by 52 bp.\nIn France, ROI stood at €692m , representing an operating margin of 1.9%, down 94 bp. Carrefour France suffered from strong competitive pressure. Moreover, operating losses of ex-DIA stores continued to weigh strongly on the country’s profitability (c. -€150m). In other European countries (excluding France), ROI stood at €677m , with margin down slightly, by 34 bp to 3.2%, reflecting contrasting performance: Northern Europe’s operating margin held up well, while Southern Europe’s was down, also impacted by a tough competitive environment, as well as inflation in distribution costs in Spain. In Latin America, 2017 ROI stood at €715m, up by €4m. Operating margin was 4.5%, down 44 bp, principally due to operating losses in Argentina as a result of the macro-economic environment. Brazil delivered a solid operating performance, despite strong food deflation, driven by the confirmed success of the Atacadao model which improved its profitability. In Asia, the second half confirmed the improvement in profitability that began at the start of the year. ROI in 2017 stood at €4m, compared with an operating loss of €58m in 2016. The Group reaped the fruits of the action plans implemented in China, in particular in terms of cost reduction, in a context that remains highly competitive, marked by rapidly-changing consumption habits. In Taiwan, sales growth remained strong and operating margin continued to improve.\nDepreciation, including logistics, increased by nearly €95m, reflecting the high level of investments in past years.\nGroup Ebitda 1 stood at €3,636m, down 6.4% at current exchange rates, with Ebitda margin slipping to 4.6%.\nIn 2017, non-recurring income stood at €(1,310)m . It includes a charge corresponding to depreciation of part of the goodwill in Italy and depreciation of assets linked to the former DIA store network.\nNet income from continuing operations, Group share, stood at €(531)m, including the following items:\nA €42m improvement in net income from companies accounted for by the equity method; Net financial expenses down by €70m, notably reflecting the reduction in the Group’s debt and lower interest rates; An effective tax rate that was impacted by exceptional items in 2017. Excluding exceptional items, the normalized rate stands at 39%, slightly above the 2016 rate. Tax expense was higher in 2017 due to net deferred tax depreciations, notably in Argentina and in the ex-DIA scope.\nAdjusted net income, Group share, stood at €773m.\n1 EBITDA: Recurring operating income before depreciation and amortization (including supply chain depreciation)\nCash flow and debt\nIn 2017, the Group’s cash generation remained solid and resulted from the following elements:\nGross cash flow of €2,653m, compared with €2,964m in 2016; Working Capital Requirements represented an inflow of €189m, driven notably by stricter management of inventory levels; Capex to maintain assets and develop the network stood at €2.1bn excluding Cargo Property, compared with €2.5bn in 2016. This drop reflects the evolution in the Group’s investment strategy and measures implemented in the second half to control capex; Investments linked to Cargo Property for €232m (offset by capital increases subscribed to by the company’s shareholders).\nFree cash flow for 2017 stood at €503m vs €603m in 2016. Restated for exceptional items and investments linked to Cargo Property, free cash flow from continuing operations stood at €950m, vs €1,039m in 2016.\nThe Group’s financial structure at December 31, 2017 remains sound . Net financial debt decreased to €3,743m at close (vs €4,531m at December 31, 2016). Carrefour’s rating at December 31, 2017 is unchanged, at BBB+.\nThe proposed dividend for 2017 is €0.46 per share vs €0.70 per share for 2016, down 34%. This amount represents a payout ratio of 45% of adjusted net income, Group share, in line with the Group’s payout policy. This dividend will be proposed in cash or shares, at the option of the shareholder, and will be subject to shareholder approval at the General Assembly of June 15, 2018.\nOutlook\nThe Group is fully mobilized to execute the « Carrefour 2022 » plan presented on January 23. With this plan, the Group has launched a profound transformation, with 2022 targets that will be re ached through actions in all geographies.\nIn order to invest in growth and rapidly improve its price competitiveness, short-term measures have been launched, notably to reach the target of €2bn in cost cuts by 2020 on a full-year basis.\n2018 Outlook\nRegarding 2018, the Group’s results will remain closely linked to the evolution of foreign exchange rates, in particular that of the Brazilian Real. The spot rate on February 27, 2018 stood at 3.98, whereas the average rate for 2017 was 3.61.\nIn addition, given the investment levels of the past years, the Group should continue to see in 2018 an increase in depreciation despite greater discipline on investments and a Capex budget of €2bn starting in 2018.\n2018 constitutes the first year of the plan and is a pivotal year in the Group’s transformation. More specifically, the plan’s implementation will be materialized by advances in 2018 in each of the plan’s pillars, notably through:\nDeploy a simplified and open organization Faster decision-making process Implementation of the previously-announced departure plans at headquarters Achieve productivity and competitiveness gains Target of shedding 273 ex-DIA stores from our scope A first wave of cost savings within the framework of the plan to achieve savings of €2bn by 2020 on a full-year basis and investments in commercial competitiveness Capex of €2bn Create an omnichannel universe of reference Acceleration of the development of the Cash and Carry format, notably with: The opening of 20 new Atacadão stores in Brazil The conversion of 16 hypermarkets to the Maxi format in Argentina Launch of the single e-commerce platform, Carrefour.fr Extended food e-commerce offer in France with 15 new cities offering home delivery (D+1) and 10 new cities offering one-hour delivery Opening of 170 new Drives in France Implement partnerships aiming in particular at accelerating the group’s digitalization, along the lines of the partnership with Showroomprivé Overhaul the offer to promote food quality Launch of actions to revamp and develop our offer in fresh and organic products and our own brands: Launch of an Agro-ecology plan in several fresh product categories and of the “organic development contract” and the doubling of the number of employees trained in fresh products with the WWF aiming at supporting the upstream segment of the agri-business chain Broadening of our organic product ranges in stores Deployment of the “blockchain” technology in all Carrefour quality lines to improve the traceability of our offer\nConference call\nA conference call will be held today - Wednesday, February 28th – at 6.15pm (Paris time).
