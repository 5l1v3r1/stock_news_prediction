EnBW retains a 6 percent stake, which it will divest fully by the end of 2019.\nEWE has said it wants to find a new strategic partner by 2019 year to raise fresh funds for growth investments, including build glass-fiber networks with Deutsche Telekom ( DTEGn.DE ).\n“EWE is currently dealing with the stake previously held by EnBW, as well as the situation of EWE’s subsidiaries in Turkey,” a spokesman for the group said in e-mailed remarks, declining to comment further.\nMacquarie, Shell, PGGM and ACP, the alternative asset management arm of insurer Allianz, all declined to comment. Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment.\nIn a sign of ongoing high demand for infrastructure assets, ACP is expected to announce shortly a deal to take a 26.2 percent stake in Neuconnect, a subsea power cable worth about 1 billion euros connecting Germany and Britain, sources said.\n($1 = 0.8112 euros)\nEditing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:06:48.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
