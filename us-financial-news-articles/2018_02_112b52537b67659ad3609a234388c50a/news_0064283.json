It believes it only has a narrow window to get the deal done before Fox nears completion of its own takeover of the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own.\nComcast’s action complicates a separate move by Disney to buy a range of Fox assets for $52 billion, including Sky, which was based on the assumption that Fox would complete its purchase.\nDisney’s Bob Iger was in Paris when the news broke. He was Quote: d in Le Figaro newspaper as saying he had not yet studied Comcast’s provisional offer in detail.\n“It does not compromise our agreement with Fox,” he said in the newspaper report. “In this agreement, Fox would bring over the 39 percent of the capital of Sky that it already holds, and would, furthermore, make an offer for the rest of Sky’s capital.”\nFox has said it remains committed to its cash offer announced in December 2016.\nBut investors are now hoping that Fox will make a higher offer or question whether Disney could make its own direct bid for Sky. Shares in Sky were trading at 13.40 pounds on Wednesday, above the 12.50 pounds offered by Comcast.\nFox agreed its deal to buy Sky in December 2016 but it has been forced to go through a comprehensive regulatory review after politicians raised concerns that Murdoch held too much influence in Britain. It agreed to buy Sky at 10.75 pounds per share.\nReporting by Kate Holton.
