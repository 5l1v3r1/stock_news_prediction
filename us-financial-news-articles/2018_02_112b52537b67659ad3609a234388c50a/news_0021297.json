Picture taken January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee/Files The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier, in line with expectations and slowing from December’s gain of 1.8 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.\nOn a month-on-month basis, CPI rose 0.6 percent in January.\nThe food price index declined 0.5 percent from a year earlier due to a higher base last year, after falling 0.4 percent in December. Non-food prices rose 2.0 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in December.\nPeople walk pass vendors at a market in Yanji, Jilin Province, China, November 20, 2016. REUTERS/Sue-lin Wong/Files The milder inflation readings are somewhat at odds with strong import and export data on Thursday, which suggested China’s economy largely retained its momentum or possibly even picked up a step at the start of the year.\nBut analysts said the softer January price data by itself did not suggest the economy is at risk of a sharper slowdown, as it can be too skewed by seasonal factors. Indeed, the consensus view is that China will see only a modest pullback in GDP growth to 6.4 percent this year.\n“It’s really a mathematical game due to the base effect,” said Tommy Xie, a Singapore-based economist at OCBC bank, adding that January could be the last month that CPI was below 2 percent this year.\n“In terms of the economic growth, I think the latest trade data actually points to extended growth momentum.”\nWhile last year’s higher producer prices are expected to percolate down to the consumer level eventually, sources have told Reuters that China’s government will maintain a 3 percent consumer inflation target for 2018.\nThat suggests policymakers are not foreseeing any sharp retail price rises that could force the central bank to change course and tighten policy more quickly.\nGlobal stock markets began to tumble last Friday after a healthy U.S. labour market report sparked fears of rising inflation which could trigger more central bank rate hikes.\nReporting by Lusha Zhang, Stella Qiu and Kevin Yao; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T07:22:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
