In 2016, Macron prefaced Cazenave’s book, “The State in Start-Up Mode”.\n“Like me, the president feels very deeply that these are no longer times where public services can be reformed with small tweaks. Major transformations are needed,” Cazenave said.\nSENSITIVE SUBJECT However, despite frequently referring to transformation and revolution, Macron has taken a cautious approach on belt-tightening measures, with very few details given so far on where the axe will fall.\nHis budget minister said this month a voluntary redundancy plan could be on the cards, but did not elaborate. More details are expected to be announced in March/April but legislation is not expected before early 2019.\nCazenave said taking time to consult employees was necessary to get government employees on board and to review which public services still need to be ran by government, and which can be outsourced or even abandoned.\nHe also said previous spending cut plans, such as former conservative leader Nicolas Sarkozy’s decision not to fill one in two vacancies left by retiring baby-boomers had failed to curb spending because the state’s remit had not been changed.\nOutsourcing some public services is currently being considered, he said, but the example of British outsourcing firm Carillion’s collapse showed it could not be replicated everywhere.\n“There is no place for ideology on the outsourcing debate, in one way or another. The private sector doesn’t have a definitive superiority to the public sector,” he said.\n($1 = 0.8097 euros)\nReporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:18:46.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
