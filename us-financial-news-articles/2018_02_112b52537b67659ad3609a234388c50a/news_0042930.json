The Austrian is also the defending giant slalom world champion.\nNorway’s Leif Kristian Nestvold-Haugen was third quickest in the first run, 0.66 seconds behind Hirscher.\n“That was pretty good I would say. It was a wild run but wild and fast. I knew I would have to put on a good run and go clean and go hard out of the start,” Nestvold-Haugen said.\n“(Hirscher‘s) been on a different level all year. I think everyone knows what they need to keep up with him but he’s got good balance and he skis clean and has good tactics.”\nThe second run is scheduled for 13:15 local (0415 GMT).\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:11:18.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
