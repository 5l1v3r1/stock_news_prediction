In his role, he will deepen the company’s footprint among federal organizations and government agencies.\nCybersecurity is a top priority for the federal government, with President Trump proposing a funding increase of 4 percent across the government, including significant hikes at the Homeland Security Department and Pentagon. The overall increase includes even larger cyber funding spikes at key agencies, including a 23 percent jump at the Energy Department, a 33 percent jump at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a 16 percent hike at the Veterans Affairs Department. Along with these increases comes a jump in the volume of security log data that needs to be stored and analyzed.\n“Government agencies have copious amounts of data that need to feed their security intelligence and analytics efforts, but existing UEBA and SIEM solutions cannot scale to meet the demand at an affordable price,” said Aubin. “Exabeam eliminates high data fees and delivers security that scales with the amount of captured data -- all at a predictable cost. I’m eager to deliver this much-needed solution with its comprehensive detection, analytics, and response capabilities to the U.S. defense and intelligence community.”\nA veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Aubin has spent more than 20 years building and scaling federal sales teams at enterprise technology companies. He joins Exabeam after overseeing federal at some of the most well-known names in security, including Imperva, HyTrust, Lumension and Niksun. His experience ranges a diverse number of security products and services from compliance and endpoint security to firewall and network protection.\n“Bill brings deep knowledge of the federal space, including the nuances of its regulatory compliance hurdles and IT security needs,” said Ralph Pisani, Exabeam executive vice president of field operations. “We welcome his expertise during this momentous time of company growth as he helps us bring our next-gen SIEM solution to major government players and build a robust federal sales team to best support them.”\nAt Exabeam, Aubin will help grow the existing team covering Department of Defense (DOD), intelligence agencies and civilian federal agencies. Exabeam is rapidly expanding its federal partner roster and has already achieved an Authority to Operate (ATO) at a DOD agency. Additionally, Exabeam has started the Common Criteria process with a US-based, NIAP-approved lab to certify each of its solutions for federal use.\nAbout Exabeam\nExabeam provides security intelligence and management solutions to help organizations of any size protect their most valuable information.
