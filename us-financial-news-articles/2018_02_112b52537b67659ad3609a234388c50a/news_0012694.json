It was taken over by France’s Lactalis in 2011. \nWhen Lactalis last year launched a bid for the Parmalat shares it did not own, minority shareholders said the price offered was too low, in part because of the potential cash-in from the lawsuit. \nCitigroup was advised by law firm Clifford & Chance. \n($1 = 0.8098 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T14:10:35.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
