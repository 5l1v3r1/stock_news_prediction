The index hit its highest level since August 2015 on Tuesday.\nInvestors are weighing whether the sharp swings are the start of a deeper correction or just a temporary bump in the nine-year bull market, spurred by concerns over rising interest rates and bond yields.\nDallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Thursday the central bank could hike rates three times this year and the recent market volatility in itself was not enough to change his base scenario.\nPhiladelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari and Kansas City Fed President Esther George are expected to make appearances at different events later in the day.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield crept back to 2.83 percent, near Monday’s four-year peak of 2.885 percent.\nEconomic data at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show weekly jobless claims rose to 232,000 from 230,000 a week earlier.\nAmong stocks, Tesla was down 1.4 percent in premarket trading after the electric automaker said spending could rise in 2018.\nTwitter rose 11.8 percent after it reported its first quarterly net profit and topped Wall Street targets as video ad sales rose.\nYelp fell 11 percent after a host of brokerages cut their price targets on the consumer review website operator’s stock following quarterly results.
