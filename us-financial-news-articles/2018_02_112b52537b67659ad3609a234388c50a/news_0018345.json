CRIMINAL ENERGY \nLawyers for billionaire Ivanishvili have said that fraudulent activities by the adviser lost the former Georgian leader hundreds of millions of dollars. \nZurich-based Credit Suisse has said Lescaudron violated internal rules and Swiss law and worked to conceal these actions from the bank. \n“The former relationship manager demonstrated a high degree of criminal energy, violating internal controls and rules as well as Swiss law and concealing his criminal activities from Credit Suisse colleagues,” the bank said in January. \n“Two years of criminal investigation have not revealed any indication that the former relationship manager was helped with his criminal actions by other Credit Suisse employees.” \nBut lawyers for Ivanishvili have said Lescaudron was not a lone wolf, saying senior management had knowledge of his activity and that the bank did not take action but instead continued to charge commission payments on the products sold. They said in August that Ivanishvili was suing Credit Suisse.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse \nMaurice Harari, a lawyer for Ivanishvili, was quoted by the Swiss daily Le Temps as telling the court during the pleadings: “Surveillance was not insufficient, it was non-existent.” \nIvanishvili’s complaints relate to the handling of portfolios between 2005 and 2015, when it is alleged money was stolen and substantial losses resulted from unauthorised investments. \nProsecutor Yves Bertossa on Friday told reporters he would not comment on the bank’s role in the matter because it was the subject of a parallel procedure. \nLescaudron’s sentence matched what prosecutors had sought.
