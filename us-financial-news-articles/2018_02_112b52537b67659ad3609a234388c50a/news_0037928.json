Antara Foto/Maz Yons/ via REUTERS Sinabung is about 75 km (47 miles) southwest of Kualanamu International Airport in Medan.\nNur Isnin Istianto, head of the regional airport authority, said Kutacane airport in Aceh province had been closed, but the wind direction allowed the airport of Kualanamu, Meulaboh and Silangit to remain open.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Disaster Agency, said the eruption began on Monday morning, accompanied by multiple earthquakes and showering surrounding villages with small rocks.\n“In five districts it became dark with a visibility of about 5 metres,” he said in a statement.\nNo casualties were reported. The agency urged the public to stay out of a 7-km (4-mile) exclusion zone around the crater, and watch for further warnings, which could cover floods.\nThe 2,460-metre (8,071-ft) tall volcano is among Indonesia’s most active. When Sinabung erupted in 2014, more than a dozen people were killed and thousands were evacuated. Prior to recent times, its last known eruption was four centuries ago.\nReporting by Cindy Silviana; Writing by Fergus Jensen; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T14:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T14:24:19.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
