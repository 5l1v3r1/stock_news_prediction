The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful as it excludes the accrual of the capital gain incentive fee, including the portion of such accrual that is not contractually payable under the terms of the Company's investment advisory agreement with GC Advisors. (the \"Investment Advisory Agreement\"). As of December 31, 2017, the cumulative capital gain incentive fee accrued by the Company in accordance with GAAP is $7.6 million, of which $1.2 million was payable as a capital gain incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement as of December 31, 2017. The Company did not pay any capital gain incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any period ended prior to December 31, 2017. Although this non-GAAP financial measure is intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.\nFirst Fiscal Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $21.3 million, or $0.36 per share, as compared to $22.5 million, or $0.38 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017; Net investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $18.5 million, or $0.31 per share, as compared to $18.3 million, or $0.31 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017; Net investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 excluding a $0.7 million accrual for the capital gain incentive fee under GAAP was $19.2 million, or $0.32 per share, as compared to $19.1 million, or $0.32 per share, when excluding a $0.8 million accrual for the capital gain incentive fee under GAAP for the quarter ended September 30, 2017; Net gain on investments for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $2.8 million, or $0.05 per share, as compared to a net gain of $4.2 million, or $0.07 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017; and Our board of directors declared on February 6, 2018 a quarterly distribution of $0.32 per share payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 8, 2018.\nPortfolio and Investment Activities\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had investments in 190 portfolio companies with a total fair value of $1,631.8 million and had investments in Senior Loan Fund LLC (\"SLF\") with a total fair value of $91.6 million. This compares to the Company's portfolio as of September 30, 2017, as of which date the Company had investments in 185 portfolio companies with a total fair value of $1,590.0 million and investments in SLF with a total fair value of $95.0 million. Investments in portfolio companies as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 consisted of the following:\nAs of December 31, 2017\nAs of September 30, 2017\nInvestments\nPercentage of\nInvestments\nPercentage of\nInvestment\nat Fair Value\nTotal\nat Fair Value\nTotal\nType\n(In thousands)\nInvestments\n(In thousands)\nInvestments\nSenior secured\n$\n193,459\n11.2\n%\n$\n195,029\n11.6\n%\nOne stop\n1,380,000\n80.1\n1,334,084\n79.2\nSecond lien\n9,435\n0.6\n9,434\n0.6\nSubordinated debt\n60\n0.0*\n59\n0.0*\nLLC equity interests in SLF\n91,591\n5.3\n95,015\n5.6\nEquity\n48,827\n2.8\n51,394\n3.0\nTotal\n$\n1,723,372\n100.0\n%\n$\n1,685,015\n100.0\n%\n*\nRepresents an amount less than 0.1%.\nThe following table shows the asset mix of our new investment commitments for the three months ended December 31, 2017:\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017\nNew Investment\nCommitments\nPercentage of\n(In thousands)\nCommitments\nSenior secured\n$\n38,498\n27.1\n%\nOne stop\n102,634\n72.1\nEquity securities\n1,114\n0.8\nTotal new investment commitments\n$\n142,246\n100.0\n%\nOverall, total investments at fair value increased by 2.3%, or $38.4 million, during the three months ended December 31, 2017 after factoring in debt repayments, sales of securities, net fundings on revolvers and net change in unrealized gain (loss). Total investments at fair value held by SLF decreased by 7.2%, or $21.7 million, after factoring in debt repayments, sales of securities, net fundings on revolvers and net change in unrealized gain (loss).\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the weighted average annualized investment income yield (which includes interest and fee income and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts) and the weighted average annualized income yield (which excludes income resulting from amortization of capitalized fees and discounts) on the fair value of earning portfolio company investments in the Company's portfolio were 8.5% and 7.9%, respectively.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTotal investment income for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 was $36.5 million and $35.0 million, respectively. This $1.5 million increase was primarily attributable to increased income from our investment in SLF that was attributable to a rise in the credit performance of SLF's portfolio.\nTotal expenses for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 were $17.9 million and $16.7 million, respectively. This $1.2 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the incentive fee due to higher investment income. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, the Company incurred a capital gain incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement of $1.2 million.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net realized gain of $0.5 million and recorded net unrealized appreciation of $2.3 million. The net realized gain was primarily due to the sale of six equity investments which was partially offset by the write off of one non-accrual portfolio company investment. The net unrealized appreciation was due to the reversal of unrealized depreciation associated with the write off of the portfolio company investment coupled with the rise in market prices on several middle market debt and equity investments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's liquidity and capital resources are derived from the Company's debt securitizations, U.S. Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") debentures, revolving credit facilities and cash flow from operations. The Company's primary uses of funds from operations include investments in portfolio companies and payment of fees and other expenses that the Company incurs. The Company has used, and expects to continue to use, its debt securitizations, SBA debentures, revolving credit facilities, proceeds from its investment portfolio and proceeds from offerings of its securities and its dividend reinvestment plan to finance its investment objectives.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $5.8 million, restricted cash and cash equivalents of $71.4 million and $828.3 million of debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $59.7 million of remaining commitments and $59.7 million available for additional borrowings on its senior secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as lender and administrative agent (\"Credit Facility\"), subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of December 31, 2017, through our licensees, we had $58.0 million of SBA debenture commitments, of which $13.0 million was available to be drawn, subject to customary SBA regulatory requirements.\nOn February 6, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.32 per share, payable on March 30, 2018 to holders of record as of March 8, 2018.\nPortfolio and Asset Quality\nGC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of the Company's investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors' internal performance ratings:\nInternal Performance Ratings\nRating\nDefinition\n5\nInvolves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable.\n4\nInvolves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable.\n3\nInvolves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due.\n2\nInvolves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due).\n1\nInvolves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 1 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered.\nOur internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nThe following table shows the distribution of the Company's investments on the 1 to 5 internal performance rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017:\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nInternal\nInvestments\nPercentage of\nInvestments\nPercentage of\nPerformance\nat Fair Value\nTotal\nat Fair Value\nTotal\nRating\n(In thousands)\nInvestments\n(In thousands)\nInvestments\n5\n$\n137,146\n8.0\n%\n$\n91,525\n5.5\n%\n4\n1,411,330\n81.9\n1,378,316\n81.8\n3\n170,010\n9.9\n212,629\n12.6\n2\n3,720\n0.2\n249\n0.0*\n1\n1,166\n0.0*\n2,296\n0.1\nTotal\n$\n1,723,372\n100.0\n%\n$\n1,685,015\n100.0\n%\n*\nRepresents an amount less than 0.1%.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host an earnings conference call at 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on Thursday, February 8, 2018 to discuss the quarterly financial results.
