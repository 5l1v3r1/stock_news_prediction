I didn’t expect that.”\nJan 14, 2018; Vancouver, British Columbia, CAN; Patrick Chan skates during the Gala event at Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre. Mandatory Credit: Anne-Marie Sorvin-USA TODAY Sports The turning point for Chan came at the Skate Canada International event last October, where he finished a disappointing fourth.\nThe triple world champion said he had been “uncomfortable and unhappy” at that event and that he needed a change.\nWalia, who also coaches Canadian women’s medal hope Kaetlyn Osmond, said Chan had come to enjoy his training process, approaching it like a job that needed to be done.\n“I think the last two Games he had a lot of pressure on him,” Walia said. “I think that it’s a priority for him to skate for himself, with that freedom to enjoy it. Because I don’t think he had that. It’s kind of like ending on his own terms.”\nChan, who finished fifth at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, clinched silver behind Japan’s Yuzuyu Hanyu in Sochi four years ago, where he had been favoured to win.\n“He’s put the work in and now he can enjoy it,” Walia said. “That’s the main thing. I want to see him have the Olympic moment that he didn’t have before.”\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T03:47:40.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
