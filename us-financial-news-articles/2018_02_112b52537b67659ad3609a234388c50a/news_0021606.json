(Nasdaq:BECN) announced results today for its first quarter ended December 31, 2017 of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 (“2018” or “Fiscal 2018”).\nPaul Isabella, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Fiscal 2018 is off to an excellent start, highlighted by strong first quarter sales growth. We delivered 8.3% organic sales growth, boosted by post-hurricane rebuilding efforts in Florida and Texas, and strong sales results from our acquired businesses. Importantly, overall product pricing was a positive contributor to first quarter sales growth. In our existing markets, residential roofing posted its 15 th consecutive quarter of positive growth, with a 9.6% increase. Complementary products represented our best performing category, with 11.7% organic growth; the result of our focused efforts and a favorable economic backdrop. Commercial roofing also contributed positively, with a second straight quarter of mid-single digit existing market growth. Our first quarter produced record Adjusted EBITDA, driven by strong sales and excellent operating cost controls. The recently announced tax reform also provided a meaningful benefit to first quarter results. Current and future tax savings will be utilized to further improve our balance sheet, pursue additional growth avenues and invest in our core business, including our 8,500+ employees. Lastly, on January 2, 2018 we announced the closing of the Allied acquisition. This adds approximately $2.6 billion in pro forma revenue, a network of more than 200 branches and an outstanding workforce to our organization. The Allied integration process is proceeding very well, and we anticipate a smooth combination with expected synergies that are consistent with our previously announced plans. Beacon’s near term and long term outlook is bright, and we remain committed to delivering strong growth and operating performance for our shareholders.”\nFirst Quarter\nTotal sales increased 12.0% to a first quarter record of $1.12 billion in fiscal 2018, from $1.00 billion in 2017. Residential roofing product sales increased 11.1%, non-residential roofing product sales increased 5.4% and complementary product sales increased 27.5% over the prior year. Existing markets sales, excluding acquisitions, increased 8.3% for the quarter. The first quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 each had 61 business days.\nNet income for the first quarter was $67.6 million, compared to $20.4 million in 2017. First quarter EPS was $0.98, compared to $0.33 in 2017. Adjusted Net Income (Loss), after removing the impact of acquisition related costs and the net benefit from one-time tax items, was $46.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $34.4 million in 2017. First quarter Adjusted EPS was $0.68, compared to $0.56 in 2017. (See included financial tables for a reconciliation of “Adjusted” financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures). First quarter results were positively impacted by strong net sales growth, attractive operating expense leverage and beneficial tax adjustments. Compared to the prior year, fiscal year 2018 EPS was negatively impacted by lower gross margins and increased interest expense. Furthermore, additional shares outstanding from a September 2017 secondary offering of our common stock had an approximate $0.08 dilutive impact on first quarter 2018 EPS.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, there were three primary impacts from this change: a one-time benefit of $0.68 related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time costs of $0.01 tied to the repatriation tax of foreign earnings and profits and benefits from a lower federal corporate income tax rate. Our Adjusted EPS disclosures remove the net benefit from the initial two items. The overall impact of tax reform raised first quarter EPS by $0.71 and Adjusted EPS by $0.09. For fiscal year 2018, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be approximately 29-30%.\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss these results.

We believe that Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is an operating performance metric that is useful to investors because it permits investors to better understand year-over-year changes in underlying operating performance. Adjusted net income per share or \"Adjusted EPS\" is calculated by dividing the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the period by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding for the period (see Consolidated Statements of Operations for amounts).\n2\nAcquisition costs for the three months ended December 31, 2017 include $17.8 million of non-recurring charges related to acquisitions and $18.2 million of amortization expense related to intangibles, both net of $10.4 million in tax in total. Acquisition costs for the three months ended December 31, 2016 include $2.7 million of non-recurring charges related to acquisitions and $20.1 million of amortization expense related to intangibles, both net of $8.9 million in tax in total.\n3\nThe non-recurring impact of deferred tax asset revaluation and a recognized provisional expense related to the repatriation of earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiary, Beacon Roofing Supply Canada Company.\nWhile we believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS are useful measures for investors, these are not measurements presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). You should not consider Adjusted Net Income (Loss) or Adjusted EPS in isolation or as a substitute for net income and net income per share or diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nBEACON ROOFING SUPPLY, INC. Adjusted EBITDA 1\n(In thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Net income $ 67,596 $ 20,430 Acquisition costs 2 5,569 1,160 Interest expense, net 23,516 13,239 Income taxes (41,068 ) 12,953 Depreciation and amortization 26,904 28,425 Stock-based compensation 3,459 3,816 Adjusted EBITDA $ 85,976 $ 80,023 Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales 7.7% 8.0% 1\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and non-recurring acquisition costs. EBITDA is a measure commonly used in the distribution industry, and we present Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is used in our bank covenants and we use Adjusted EBITDA as an internal performance measurement and as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles, and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. Further, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure because it improves comparability of results of operations, since purchase accounting used for acquisitions can render depreciation and amortization non-comparable between periods. We use these supplemental measures to evaluate performance period over period and to analyze the underlying trends in our business and establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. We expect to compute Adjusted EBITDA using the same consistent method from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\n2\nAcquisition costs reflect all non-recurring charges related to acquisitions (excluding the impact of tax) that are not embedded in other balances of the table. Certain portions of the total acquisition costs incurred are included in interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation.\nWhile we believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for investors, it is not a measurement presented in accordance with GAAP. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows from operations, or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA has inherent material limitations as a performance measure. It does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed money, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation and amortization expense. Because we have capital and intangible assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs. Adjusted EBITDA also does not include stock-based compensation, which is a necessary element of our costs since we make stock awards to key members of management as an important incentive to maximize overall company performance and as a benefit. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA does not include taxes, and payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations. Accordingly, since Adjusted EBITDA excludes these items, it has material limitations as a performance measure. We separately monitor capital expenditures, which impact depreciation expense, as well as amortization expense, interest expense, stock-based compensation expense, and income tax expense. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208006416/en/\nBeacon Roofing Supply, Inc.\nJoseph Nowicki, 571-323-3940\nExecutive VP & CFO\nJNowicki@becn.com\nSource: Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.becn.com&esheet=51755443&newsitemid=20180208006416&lan=en-US&anchor=www.becn.com&index=2&md5=48c04ff5fe048e5a7464c725221c5880", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.beaconroofingsupply.com%2Fevents.cfm&esheet=51755443&newsitemid=20180208006416&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.beaconroofingsupply.com%2Fevents.cfm&index=1&md5=d9785fb20dedec21f95a93b1b6b84fe4", "http://ir.beaconroofingsupply.com/events.cfm", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208006416/en/"], "published": "2018-02-09T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T02:02:19.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
