He sold his shares in insurer firm Storebrand on Wednesday.\nFollowing the transaction, at a price of $42.28 per share, Borr Drilling would own 24 premium jack-up rigs built after 2000, making it the world’s largest premium jack-up rig operator, Borr said. Jack-up rigs drill in shallow waters.\nShares in Borr Drilling were up 5.4 percent at 0839 GMT against an Oslo benchmark index down 0.7 percent.\nMARKET BOTTOMING OUT? Borr Drilling said it expected dayrates to start rising into 2019 as oil firms increase capital spending, a view shared by rival Maersk Energy, owned by A.A. Moller-Maersk, in a Reuters interview on Tuesday.\n“There are clear signs that we have passed the bottom of the offshore drilling cycle and the activity level is picking up,” Borr said.\nStill, Borr said it would not rush to sign new long-term contracts at current low rates and that many of its rigs would remain uncontracted in 2018.\nAs of Jan. 31, Paragon, which last year emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, had a revenue backlog of $204 million. It was spun off by U.S. firm Noble Corp in 2014.\nThe deal’s closure is subject to Paragon completing all actions necessary to acquire ownership of certain rigs currently subject to Chapter 11 proceedings.\nBorr said it has received commitments from holders of 67.9 percent of Paragon’s shares for its tender offer, and expects the transaction to close in March.
