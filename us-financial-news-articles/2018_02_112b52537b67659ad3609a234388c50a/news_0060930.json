The company had been seeking a deal that would spare it from bankruptcy after more than 70 women accused film producer Harvey Weinstein, its ex-chairman and once one of Hollywood’s most influential men, of sexual misconduct including rape. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. “The Weinstein Company has been engaged in an active sale process in the hopes of preserving assets and jobs,” the board said in a statement, reported by newspapers including the San Francisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times. “Today, those discussions concluded without a signed agreement.” The board had “no choice but to pursue its only viable option to maximize the Company’s remaining value: an orderly bankruptcy process.” There was no immediate confirmation of the plan on the company’s website or Twitter feed. editing by John Stonestreet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T09:50:02.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
