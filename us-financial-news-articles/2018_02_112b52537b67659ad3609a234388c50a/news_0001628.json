After the conversion, the deposit’s interest rate was set at 2.86 percent per annum.\nEarlier this year, the finance ministry said it fully drained its Reserve Fund to plug budget holes by the end of 2017, ahead of switching to a new budget mechanism that would insulate the oil-dependent economy from swings on global commodity markets.\nThe ministry said it had decided to terminate the Reserve Fund after converting the funds denominated in foreign currency it held in the fund into roubles and channelling more than 1 trillion roubles of those funds into the budget in late 2017.
