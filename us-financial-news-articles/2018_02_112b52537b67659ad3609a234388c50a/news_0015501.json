The trade surplus had been tipped at $54.1 billion last month from December’s $54.69 billion. \nChina’s trade performance rebounded in 2017 thanks to strong demand at home and abroad. However, expectations of growing trade disputes with the United States are clouding the outlook for exports this year, while a cooling property market may curb domestic demand for imported raw materials such as iron ore.
