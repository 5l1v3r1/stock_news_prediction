Lightowler previously served as Carbon Black’s vice president & managing director, Asia Pacific & Japan (APJ). Replacing Lightowler in APJ is Matt Bennett, who has been named vice president and managing director of the region.\nUnder Lightowler’s leadership, Carbon Black has expanded its international presence and experienced success across APJ. In 2017, Carbon Black was named “Asia-Pacific Emerging Cyber Security Vendor of the Year” by Frost & Sullivan and a joint winner in NetworkWorld Asia’s (NWA) Endpoint & Mobile Data Protection category at the Information Management Awards 2017.\n“Our long-term vision in providing next-generation endpoint security solutions and keeping our customers secure is made possible by recruiting, empowering, and retaining a world-class leadership team,” said Thomas Hansen, chief revenue officer at Carbon Black. “Kane has been a tremendous success for Carbon Black. He joined the company just over two years ago to establish Carbon Black’s presence in APJ and during that time built a solid team and market footprint.”\nLightowler has nearly 20 years of experience, holding numerous roles across the cybersecurity sector ranging from technical to executive commercial and business roles. Prior to joining Carbon Black, Lightowler was vice president of strategic accounts at Imperva, where he spent more than six years driving growth in new markets, new customer segments, and new solutions across APJ.\n“Kane brings international expertise, leadership and proven success to our North American operations,” said Hansen. “I’m certain Kane will hit the ground running in North America and have an immediate impact across our sales and development teams.”\nTaking over Lightowler’s previous role is security and technology veteran Matt Bennett, who has been named vice president and managing director of APJ. Bennett was most recently vice president of APJ for MobileIron. Prior to MobileIron, Bennett worked in a similar role at Zscaler, Inc. and spent nine years at Blue Coat Systems in a variety of roles, including running Blue Coat’s business in Japan. Bennett, who will be based in Hong Kong, brings more than 20 years of experience working with customers around the globe to overcome security challenges.\n“Carbon Black is propelling the industry forward with an innovative approach to endpoint security - one that is marked by big data, analytics, and a transition to the cloud,” said Lightowler. “The appetite for this new approach is truly global, and I know Matt will continue our success at the helm of the APJ region. I couldn’t think of someone better to take the reins, while I get started in North America working with our motivated, committed, and proven leadership team.”\nAbout Carbon Black\nCarbon Black is a leading provider of next-generation endpoint security.
