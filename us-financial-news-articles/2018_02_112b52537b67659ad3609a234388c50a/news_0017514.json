But the package still needed approval from the House of Representatives before it could be signed into law by President Donald Trump.\nThe shutdown is the second in 2018. The government shut down for three days in January, when Congress reached an impasse over government spending levels and immigration legislation. But, since it was largely over a weekend, many government agencies and services were not affected.\nPast government shutdowns have done little lasting economic damage but these events can hurt federal workers, rattle markets and shake confidence in the United States abroad.\nSince Congress implemented the modern budget process in the mid-1970s, there have been 19 gaps in government funding, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), but not all resulted in true government shutdowns.\nFILE PHOTO - U.S. Capitol is seen shortly after beginning of the Government shutdown in Washington, U.S., January 20, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas Here are the three occasions when funding lapsed and significant government shutdowns occurred.\nNovember 1995: Government funding elapsed for five full days from Nov. 14 to 19 and about 800,000 workers were furloughed after Democratic President Bill Clinton vetoed spending legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, according to a CRS report.\nDecember 1995 and January 1996: Clinton’s continued clash with congressional Republicans over funding levels for the Medicare health insurance program for the elderly, education and other issues resulted in a second lapse in government funding for 21 full days from Dec. 16, 1995 to Jan. 6, 1996, when about 280,000 workers were furloughed, according to the CRS.\nOctober 2013: During this standoff, government funding elapsed for 16 full days from Oct. 1 to 17 and about 800,000 federal workers were furloughed, according to the CRS. More than 1 million more reported to work without knowing when they would be paid, according to media reports.\nThe shutdown occurred after conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives attempted to use the budget process to delay or defund implementation of Democratic President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\nThe impasse between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate, along with Obama, ended after both chambers passed a Senate-brokered bill with stricter income verification requirements on people obtaining health insurance through Obamacare. The deal to end the shutdown coincided with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, the country’s borrowing limit.\nCompiled by Amanda Becker; Additional reporting by Blake Brittain; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T16:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:19:46.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
