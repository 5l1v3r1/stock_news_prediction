The world has changed, people travel, they don’t buy in March and September only like they once did,” Ruffini said.\nWith a younger and fickle clientele, whose tastes change at the speed of a social media post, fashion houses are being asked to deliver more than just two collections per year.\nA guest checks a creation from the Moncler Autumn/Winter 2018 women collection during Milan Fashion Week in Milan, Italy February 20, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile But the timing of placing products in stores is becoming an experimental battlefield, as the labels have to juggle the constant demand for novelty with the lengthy manufacturing cycles needed to make their high-end clothes and accessories.\nRuffini, credited for turning the traditional French skiwear group into a trendy fashion label, said Moncler would not focus only on young and digital savvy clients - now a third of the luxury market - but had to “chat with different generations”.\nFrom June 15, the brand will launch a collection approximately once per month, with clothes and accessories from its different lines available in boutiques, multi-brand stores and temporary pop-ups.\nSlideshow (9 Images) The collections vary from monastic long looks by Valentino’s Pierpaolo Piccioli, to preppy and more sporty items by Japan’s Hiroshi Fujiwara, to ruffled and layered looks from Simone Rocha.\nUnder the new strategy, dubbed “Genius”, the group is working with eight different creative directors, including Piccioli, former Gucci menswear designer Sandro Mandrino, and Moncler’s own artistic director Francesco Ragazzi.\nMoncler will start off with the “Fragments” collection by Fujiwara.\n“It’s a brave and daring project, stylistically challenging. Each designer tells a different story, perspective ... it’s total creative freedom,” Piccioli told Reuters.\nRuffini did not rule out taking on new creative directors, though he suggested that the group was not planning frequent changes.\nMilan Fashion Week will run until Feb. 26, with Italy’s biggest names in fashion - such as Prada, Armani, Versace, Cavalli and Dolce & Gabbana - showcasing their products for fall and winter 2018/19.\nThe six-day extravaganza will see almost 160 new collections and 64 catwalk shows.\nReporting by Giulia Segreti, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T09:31:25.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
