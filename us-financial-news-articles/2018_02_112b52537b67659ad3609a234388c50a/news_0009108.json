The latter plans to swap its 8.75 percent stake in Rusal for shares in En+ by the end of March, En+ has said.\nGlencore is also Rusal’s largest customer by total sales. Their current seven-year supply contract will terminate at the end of 2018, Rusal has said in the prospectus for a recent Eurobond issue.\n“If the Group is unable to reallocate the capacity presently purchased by Glencore to other customers following the expiration of the contract or is unable to enter into a new contract with Glencore on similar terms, the Group’s business could be affected,” Rusal said in the prospectus.\nTaking into account current trends in the global aluminium market, Rusal does not foresee any problems with sales of its products, it told Reuters on Monday when asked to comment on the Glencore contract. It did not elaborate.\nRusal estimated that global aluminium demand grew by 6 percent year on year to 64 million tonnes in 2017 amid strong demand across all regions, leaving the global market in a deficit of about 1 million tonnes, it said on Monday.\nDemand for aluminium in China grew 7.8 percent to 34.9 million tonnes, Rusal said.\nThe company’s shares eased by 0.5 percent in Hong Kong on Monday. That compared with a 1 percent fall in the benchmark Hang Seng index.
