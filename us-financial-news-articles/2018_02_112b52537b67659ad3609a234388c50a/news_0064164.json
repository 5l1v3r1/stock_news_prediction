Advertising for the Johnnie Walker range has often focused on adventures fronted by men, including actor Jude Law for its luxury Blue Label line in 2014 and a film starring Robert Carlyle showing the history of the Scotch in 2009.\nBut the Scotch has been influenced by women since its founding, with John Walker's wife Elizabeth being \"fundamental\" to its creation, according to Diageo. John Walker & Sons also bought the Cardhu distillery from Elizabeth Cumming in 1893.\nThe new bottle launch coincides with Women's History Month and International Women's Day, which is on March 8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T14:29:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
