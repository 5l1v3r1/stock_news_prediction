This is the first time lack of supply is causing higher prices,” a U.S. based trader said. \n“End-users coming back to buy for the first quarter are hit with sticker-shock when they hear the new prices. But, in reality there is nothing on the market to buy,” the trader said. \nTraders in the United States and Europe also attributed rising prices to an uptick in demand from manufacturers of military equipment and optic fibres. \nPrices of germanium in Europe GERM-LON, standing at $1,550 per kg, have more than doubled since January 2017 and have gained 7 percent in the past two weeks. \nGermanium metal is used as a semiconductor in transistors and other electronic devices, in optic fibre networks and in infrared night vision systems for military use. \nA recent report from Jane‘s, released by IHS Markit, said global defence spending will grow for the fifth consecutive year in 2018, reaching $1.67 trillion and overtaking the previous post-Cold War record of $1.63 trillion seen in 2010. \nChina produced more than 70 percent of the 155,000 tonnes of total refined germanium production in 2016, U.S. Geological Survey data showed. \nGermanium prices hit a record high $2,000 per kg in 2014, but prices crashed after China’s Fanya Metal Exchange was closed in 2015. The offloading of Fanya’s germanium stocks started the trend of lower prices, which started to reverse in January 2017.
