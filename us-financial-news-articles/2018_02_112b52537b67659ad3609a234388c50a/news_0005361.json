Firms also built up a solid backlog of work and were their most optimistic in at least 5-1/2 years.\nIn a development that is likely also to delight ECB policymakers, who have struggled for years to get inflation anywhere near their 2 percent target ceiling, factories increased their prices at the fastest rate since mid-2011.\nEuro zone inflation dipped as expected to 1.3 percent in December, official data showed on Wednesday, although core inflation rose. The PMI sub-index measuring output prices jumped in January to 58.0 from 56.3.\nLast week, the ECB decided to keep policy unchanged and held off discussing winding down its massive stimulus program, as inflation has yet to show any convincing upward trend.\nThe ECB will stop printing money by the end of the year, but a majority of economists polled by Reuters last month said they should do so much sooner, citing a solid and synchronized growth outlook for the currency bloc.\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:12:41.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
