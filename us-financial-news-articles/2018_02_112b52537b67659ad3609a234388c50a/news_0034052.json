Now the question is: what will it do with the cash?\"\nDanone said it would comment further on the possible use of the proceeds when the deal is completed in March.\nIt has held the Yakult stake for more than a decade but there has long been speculation it would look to divest. The sale will be carried out via a market transaction initiated by Yakult and is expected to be settled in March.\nDanone has lagged the growth of some rivals, largely due to weakness in its European dairy business in the face of sluggish demand and private-label competition.\nPositive development\n\"Indiscriminate investment has been one of the big turn-offs of the Danone investment case since the acquisition of Numico in 2007. Consequently, we regard this as a positive development,\" wrote RBC Capital Markets analysts, retaining a \"sector perform\" rating on Danone and a price target of 65 euros.\nEven though consumer goods groups typically offer up reliable sales and dividends, they have also had to grapple with a slowdown in some markets, pressure on prices and shifting trends from consumers over eating and leisure habits.\nDanone last year bought U.S. organic food maker WhiteWave for $12.5 billion in a bid to attract affluent health-conscious customers and boost margins. It also sold dairy business Stonyfield to Lactalis for $875 million.\nDanone has sometimes been touted as a takeover target. In August 2017, hedge fund Corvex Management bought a 0.8 percent stake, following similar steps at Nestle and Procter & Gamble ( PG.N ).\nIn 2005, the French government stepped in to fend off a rumored bid by Pepsico ( PEP.O ) by publicly describing Danone's business as a protected \"strategic\" industry.\nYakult also announced a 36 billion Japanese yen ($336 million) share buyback in which Danone will participate. The French group will retain a 7 percent stake in Yakult, remaining its largest shareholder.\nDanone also said it was looking at distributing Yakult products in European markets, with Spain as an initial test market. Its shares rose 1.3 percent to 64.71 euros in early trading. The stock had hit a record 72.13 euros in December, but has slipped some 8 percent so far in 2018.\n", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=PG.N", "https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=PEP.O"], "published": "2018-02-14T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T14:59:16.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
