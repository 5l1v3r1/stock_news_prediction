The vessel was constructed at HHIC-PHIL Inc. and commenced a 17-year fixed-rate bareboat charter with MSC. Upon completion of the bareboat charter period, MSC is obligated to purchase the vessel for a pre-determined amount. This delivery was financed with a previously committed lease facility.\nEquity Financings\nIn November 2017, Seaspan entered into a new equity distribution agreement under which it may, from time to time, issue Class A common shares in at-the-market (\"ATM\") offerings for up to an aggregate of $100.0 million.

These increases were partially offset by lower average charter rates for vessels that were on short-term charters.\nRevenue decreased by 5.3% to $831.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower average charter rates for vessels that were on short-term charters and off-charter days that related primarily to three 10000 TEU vessels that were previously on long-term charters and commenced short-term charters with Hapag-Lloyd AG during the first half of 2017. These decreases were partially offset by the delivery of newbuilding vessels in 2016 and 2017.\nThe increases in operating days and the related financial impact thereof for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, relative to the same periods in 2016, are attributable to the following:\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nOperating\nDays Impact\n$ Impact\n(in millions\nof US dollars)\nOperating\nDays Impact\n$ Impact\n(in millions\nof US dollars)\n2017 vessel deliveries\n92\n$\n4.2\n452\n$\n10.3\nFull period contribution for 2016 vessel deliveries\n76\n0.6\n1,621\n32.3\nChange in daily charter hire rate andre-charters\n—\n(8.0)\n—\n(73.0)\nFewer days due to leap year\n—\n—\n(81)\n(2.4)\nUnscheduled off-hire\n200\n(1.6)\n(286)\n(14.5)\nScheduled off-hire\n—\n—\n119\n5.3\nSupervision fee revenue\n—\n0.7\n—\n(6.4)\nVessel disposals\n(75)\n—\n(579)\n(2.8)\nInterest income from leasing\n—\n5.4\n—\n5.0\nOther\n—\n(0.1)\n—\n(0.4)\nTotal\n293\n$\n1.2\n1,246\n$\n(46.6)\nVessel utilization increased for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to fewer off-charter and unscheduled off-hire days. Vessel utilization decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in off-charter days, partially offset by the delivery of newbuilding vessels in 2016 and 2017 and fewer scheduled dry-dock days.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, Seaspan completed dry-dockings for six 4250 TEU vessels, which were completed between their time charters.\nShip Operating Expense\nShip operating expense increased by 2.6% to $48.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to planned higher spending on spares and repairs based on planned maintenance schedules for certain vessels.\nShip operating expense decreased by 4.4% to $183.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to cost savings initiatives achieved even though ownership days increased by 4.6% during 2017. As a result, ship operating expense per ownership day declined by 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 0.6% to $50.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to higher replacement part write-offs during 2017 partially offset by lower depreciation on 16 vessels which were impaired as of December 31, 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by 7.5% to $199.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower depreciation from the impaired vessels as discussed above and lower replacement part write-offs during 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by 54.6% to $11.1 million and by 24.8% to $40.1 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. The increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 is due primarily to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $3.6 million related to the accelerated vesting of restricted shares and the cancellation of performance share units (\"PSUs\") held by Seaspan's former CEO, Gerry Wang, in connection with his retirement. In exchange for the cancelled PSUs, Seaspan issued 200,000 Class A common shares to Mr. Wang. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase was also due to the issuance of 1,000,000 fully vested Class A common shares to the chairman of the board.\nOperating Lease Expense\nOperating lease expense increased by 15.0% to $30.6 million and 34.5% to $115.5 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. The increase for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 is due primarily to the delivery of one vessel in 2017 that was financed through a sale-leaseback transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase was also due to the delivery of three vessels in 2016 that were financed through sale-leaseback transactions, and two operating leases Seaspan entered into in 2016.\nInterest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Fees\nThe following table summarizes Seaspan's borrowings:\n(in millions of US dollars)\nAs at December 31,\n2017\n2016\nLong-term debt, excluding deferred financing fees\n$\n2,468.1\n$\n2,903.4\nLong-term obligations under capital lease, excluding deferred financing fees\n648.8\n498.8\nTotal borrowings\n3,116.9\n3,402.2\nLess: Vessels under construction\n(146.4)\n(306.2)\nOperating borrowings\n$\n2,970.5\n$\n3,096.0\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees increased by $1.6 million to $31.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in LIBOR and financing related to the delivery of newbuilding vessels in 2017.\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees decreased by $3.5 million to $116.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to repayments made on existing operating borrowings in 2016 and 2017, partially offset by an increase in LIBOR and financing related to the delivery of newbuilding vessels in 2017.\nChange in Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe change in fair value of financial instruments resulted in a gain of $6.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and was primarily due to an increase in the forward LIBOR curve. The change in fair value of financial instruments resulted in a loss of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the impact of swap settlements, partially offset by an increase in the forward LIBOR curve.\nAbout Seaspan\nSeaspan provides many of the world's major shipping lines with creative outsourcing alternatives to vessel ownership by offering long-term leases on large, modern containerships combined with industry-leading ship management services. Seaspan's managed fleet consists of 112 containerships representing a total capacity of approximately 900,000 TEUs, including four newbuilding containerships on order scheduled for delivery to Seaspan and third parties by the end of 2018.

Cash Available for Distribution to Common Shareholders\nCash available for distribution to common shareholders is defined as net earnings (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortization, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees, refinancing expenses, share-based compensation, change in fair value of financial instruments, bareboat charter adjustment, gain on sales, gain or loss on disposals, expenses related to customer bankruptcy, adjustments to equity income on investment, termination fee, vessel impairments, amortization of deferred gain, dry-dock reserve adjustment, cash dividends paid on preferred shares, interest expense at the hedged rate, and certain other items that Seaspan believes are not representative of its operating performance.\nCash available for distribution to common shareholders is a non-GAAP measure used to assist in evaluating Seaspan's ability to make quarterly cash dividends before reserves for replacement capital expenditures. Cash available for distribution to common shareholders is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other indicator of Seaspan's performance required to be reported by GAAP. In addition, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet earnings (loss)\n$\n58,553\n$\n1,442\n$\n175,237\n$\n(139,039)\nAdjust:\nDepreciation and amortization\n50,359\n50,045\n199,938\n216,098\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees\n31,328\n29,692\n116,389\n119,882\nRefinancing expenses\n—\n—\n—\n1,677\nShare-based compensation\n5,149\n1,974\n17,526\n6,378\nChange in fair value of financial instruments (1)\n(6,966)\n(46,120)\n12,718\n28,674\nBareboat charter adjustment, net (2)\n1,665\n1,774\n1,879\n16,353\nGain on sales (3)\n—\n—\n31,291\n52,235\n(Gain) loss on disposals (4)\n(6,998)\n15,389\n(13,604)\n31,876\nExpenses related to customer bankruptcy (5)\n—\n849\n1,013\n19,732\nAdjustments to equity income on investment (6)\n—\n—\n—\n5,880\nTermination fee (7)\n—\n—\n6,250\n—\nVessel impairments (8)\n—\n82,420\n—\n285,195\nAmortization of deferred gain (9)\n(5,555)\n(4,860)\n(21,178)\n(18,064)\nDry-dock reserve adjustment\n(5,461)\n(5,601)\n(21,934)\n(22,963)\nCash dividends paid on preferred shares:\nSeries C\n—\n—\n—\n(19,665)\nSeries D\n(2,475)\n(2,475)\n(9,900)\n(9,900)\nSeries E\n(2,769)\n(2,769)\n(11,077)\n(11,077)\nSeries F\n(2,432)\n(2,432)\n(9,730)\n(4,405)\nSeries G\n(3,997)\n(3,997)\n(15,990)\n(5,150)\nSeries H\n(4,430)\n(3,888)\n(17,719)\n(3,888)\nNet cash flows before interest payments\n105,971\n111,443\n441,109\n549,829\nLess:\nInterest expense at the hedged rate (10)\n(40,465)\n(40,491)\n(155,142)\n(176,727)\nCash available for distribution to common shareholders\n$\n65,506\n$\n70,952\n$\n285,967\n$\n373,102\nSEASPAN CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nFOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\n(IN THOUSANDS OF US DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nB. Normalized Net Earnings and Normalized Earnings per Share\nNormalized net earnings is defined as net earnings (loss) adjusted for interest expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing fees), refinancing expenses, gain or loss on disposals, expenses related to customer bankruptcy, change in fair value of financial instruments, termination fee, adjustments to equity income on investment, vessel impairments, interest expense at the hedged rate, share-based compensation to chairman of the board, write-off of vessel equipment, share-based compensation related to CEO retirement, and certain other items Seaspan believes affect the comparability of operating results. Normalized net earnings is a useful measure because it excludes those items that Seaspan believes are not representative of its operating performance.\nNormalized net earnings and normalized earnings per share are not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss), earnings (loss) per share or any other indicator of Seaspan's performance required to be reported by GAAP. In addition, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet earnings (loss)\n$\n58,553\n$\n1,442\n$\n175,237\n$\n(139,039)\nAdjust:\nInterest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing fees\n28,247\n25,262\n104,490\n105,701\nRefinancing expenses\n—\n—\n—\n1,962\n(Gain) loss on disposals\n(6,998)\n15,389\n(13,604)\n31,876\nExpenses related to customer bankruptcy (5)\n—\n849\n1,013\n19,732\nChange in fair value of financial instruments (1)\n(6,966)\n(46,120)\n12,718\n28,674\nTermination fee (7)\n—\n—\n6,250\n—\nAdjustments to equity income on investment (6)\n—\n—\n—\n5,880\nVessel impairments (8)\n—\n82,420\n—\n285,195\nInterest expense at the hedged rate (10)\n(40,465)\n(40,491)\n(155,142)\n(176,727)\nShare-based compensation to chairman of the board (11)\n—\n—\n6,920\n—\nWrite-off of vessel equipment (12)\n—\n—\n—\n9,040\nShare-based compensation related to CEO retirement (13)\n3,610\n—\n3,610\n—\nNormalized net earnings\n$\n35,981\n$\n38,751\n$\n141,492\n$\n172,294\nLess: preferred share dividends\nSeries C (including amortization of issuance costs)\n—\n—\n—\n14,420\nSeries D\n2,500\n2,475\n9,925\n9,900\nSeries E\n2,792\n2,770\n11,100\n11,077\nSeries F\n2,432\n2,433\n9,730\n6,055\nSeries G\n3,997\n3,997\n15,990\n7,404\nSeries H\n4,442\n4,429\n17,731\n6,841\n16,163\n16,104\n64,476\n55,697\nNormalized net earnings attributable to common shareholders\n$\n19,818\n$\n22,647\n$\n77,016\n$\n116,597\nWeighted average number of shares used to compute earnings per share\nReported, basic\n127,385\n106,164\n117,524\n102,869\nShare-based compensation\n127\n60\n81\n70\nReported and normalized, diluted (14)\n127,512\n106,224\n117,605\n102,939\nEarnings (loss) per share:\nReported, basic and diluted\n$\n0.34\n$\n(0.14)\n$\n0.94\n$\n(1.89)\nNormalized, diluted (15)\n$\n0.16\n$\n0.21\n$\n0.66\n$\n1.13\nSEASPAN CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nFOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\n(IN THOUSANDS OF US DOLLARS)\nC. Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss) adjusted for interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees, interest income, undrawn credit facility fees, depreciation and amortization, refinancing expenses, share-based compensation, gain on sales, gain or loss on disposals, expenses related to customer bankruptcy, adjustments to equity income on investment, vessel impairments, termination fee, amortization of deferred gain, bareboat charter adjustment, change in fair value of financial instruments, and certain other items that Seaspan believes are not representative of its operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing Seaspan's results of operations. Seaspan believes that this measure is useful in assessing performance and highlighting trends on an overall basis. Seaspan also believes that this measure can be useful in comparing its results with those of other companies, even though other companies may not calculate this measure in the same way as Seaspan. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings (loss). Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss) or any other indicator of Seaspan's performance required to be reported by GAAP.\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet earnings (loss)\n$\n58,553\n$\n1,442\n$\n175,237\n$\n(139,039)\nAdjust:\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees\n31,328\n29,692\n116,389\n119,882\nInterest income\n(1,113)\n(1,379)\n(4,558)\n(8,455)\nUndrawn credit facility fees\n324\n710\n2,173\n2,673\nDepreciation and amortization\n50,359\n50,045\n199,938\n216,098\nRefinancing expenses\n—\n—\n—\n1,677\nShare-based compensation\n5,149\n1,974\n17,526\n6,378\nGain on sales (3)\n—\n—\n31,291\n52,235\n(Gain) loss on disposals (4)\n(6,998)\n15,389\n(13,604)\n31,876\nExpenses related to customer bankruptcy (5)\n—\n849\n1,013\n19,732\nAdjustments to equity income on investment (6)\n—\n—\n—\n5,880\nVessel impairments (8)\n—\n82,420\n—\n285,195\nTermination fee (7)\n—\n—\n6,250\n—\nAmortization of deferred gain (9)\n(5,555)\n(4,860)\n(21,178)\n(18,064)\nBareboat charter adjustment, net (2)\n1,665\n1,774\n1,879\n16,353\nChange in fair value of financial instruments (1)\n(6,966)\n(46,120)\n12,718\n28,674\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n126,746\n$\n131,936\n$\n525,074\n$\n621,095\nNotes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(1) Change in fair value of financial instruments includes realized and unrealized losses (gains) on Seaspan's interest rate swaps, unrealized losses (gains) on Seaspan's foreign currency forward contracts and unrealized losses (gains) on interest rate swaps included in equity income on investment.\n(2) Certain of Seaspan's vessels are on bareboat charters, which are accounted for as direct financing-type leases. Under these arrangements, the vessels were disposed of and a gross investment in lease was recorded, which is amortized to income through revenue. The bareboat charter adjustment in the applicable non-GAAP measure is included to reverse the GAAP accounting treatment and reflect the transaction as if the vessels had not been disposed of. Therefore, the bareboat charter hire is added back and the interest income from leasing, which is recorded in revenue, is deducted, resulting in a net bareboat charter adjustment. The 2016 adjustment relates to four 4800 TEU vessels on five-year bareboat charters to MSC which commenced in 2011 and which were sold to MSC in the fourth quarter of 2016 pursuant to agreements entered into in 2011. The 2017 adjustment relates to four 11000 TEU vessels which commenced 17-year bareboat charters with MSC during the third and fourth quarters of 2017. Upon completion of the bareboat charter period, MSC is obligated to purchase the vessels for pre-determined amounts.\n(3) The gain on sale relates to the proceeds received in excess of vessel cost upon the sale and leaseback transaction of one 14000 TEU vessel during the year ended December 31, 2017. Under this transaction, Seaspan sold the vessel to special purpose companies and is leasing the vessel back. For accounting purposes, the gain is deferred and amortized as a reduction of operating lease expense over the term of the lease.\n(4) The gain on disposals relates to the sale of two 4250 TEU vessels and four 4250 TEU vessels during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
