Or it may draw us dangerously close to monetary financing of governments.”\nAlthough the ECB has already reduced its stimulus measures since the height of the crisis, its deposit rate stands at a record low of minus 0.4 percent and it holds more than two trillion euros worth of sovereign and corporate debt, all with the aim of keeping borrowing costs super low.\nCoeure argued that flexible markets, including an integrated financial market, should be the first line of defense because they absorb shocks efficiently. But only a fraction of the European Union’s reform proposals have been accepted.\nA finalised capital markets and banking union would also diversify and reduce risk by limiting the financial burden on governments and taxpayers, Coeure argued.\nReporting by Marja Novak; Writing by Balazs Koranyi; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:25:30.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
