The progression of women in the British workforce is in focus following the requirement for companies to publish gender pay gap data by April 2018. Data from insurer Standard Life ( SLA.L ) last week showed men in the company were paid on average over 40 percent more than women at April 2017, while Aviva’s ( AV.L ) pay gap was nearly 30 percent, according to data published last month. Insurers have put the pay gap down to a lack of women at senior levels. “There is a great determination at the very top of our member firms to tackle this issue,” ABI director general Huw Evans said in a statement. Four in five insurers have diversity strategies and provide training in unconscious bias, the ABI said. The ABI’s findings came from data covering more than 82,000 insurance employees.
