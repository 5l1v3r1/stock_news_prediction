He will also raise concerns about French prison conditions.\nWatkins said there were concerns about “manipulation” by the French authorities, citing how they had sought to arrest Djouhri on a visit to Britain rather taking action against him in Switzerland which does not take part in the EAW system.\n“We know there appears to be some manipulation of the extradition process,” Watkins said.\nIn Paris, a Justice Ministry spokesman said he could not make any comment because he had no knowledge of the case.\nEngland’s Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot, who will decide on the extradition, said the main issue would be the political argument, noting “It’s not a normal French request”.\nThe full extradition hearing is due to start on April 17 but Djouhri’s legal team are seeking more time to prepare their case. A decision on whether to change the date will be made on March 2.\nIn the meantime, Djouhri has been granted bail under very strict conditions, which include payment of a one million pound ($1.4 million) security, wearing an electronic tagging device and reporting to police daily.\nReporting by Michael Holden in London and Ingrid Melander in Paris; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T16:22:26.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
