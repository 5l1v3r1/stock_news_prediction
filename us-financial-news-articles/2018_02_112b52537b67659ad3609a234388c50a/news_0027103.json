The event had been due to start at 1330 KST.\nThere will now be no qualification for the event and all 27 athletes go straight into Monday’s final.\nThe cancellation follows an earlier decision to postpone the final of the men’s Alpine skiing downhill until Thursday.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T13:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:41:11.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
