(the “Company” or “SiteOne”) (NYSE:SITE) announced earnings for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (“Fiscal 2017”).\n“We finished 2017 with a strong fourth quarter performance and are pleased with our overall full-year financial results. During the year we improved organic sales growth, achieved solid contribution of sales and profits from acquisitions and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin. The combination of these allowed us to deliver strong adjusted EBITDA and net income growth while keeping our leverage ratio within our targeted range,” said Doug Black, SiteOne’s Chairman and CEO. “We also made important investments in our salesforce, eCommerce, IT, and supply chain to strengthen our company and support future growth and profitability. With positive end-market growth trends, we are excited to continue to execute our strategy and create significant value for all of our stakeholders in the coming years.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017 increased to $415.7 million, or 15%, compared to $361.8 million for the prior-year period. Organic Daily Sales increased 7% compared to prior year period as we saw strength in the construction, repair and remodel and golf markets. Acquisitions contributed approximately $31 million in sales, or 8%, to our overall growth for the quarter.\nGross profit increased to $131.9 million, or 18%, compared to $111.8 million for the prior-year period. Gross margin improved by 80 bps to 31.7% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017. We continue to see margin improvement driven by category management.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017 increased to $133.8 million from $116.2 million in the same period last year due to the additional contribution from acquisitions. SG&A as a percent of net sales increased to 32.2%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the same period last year.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017 was $4.0 million, compared to a net loss of $5.6 million during the same period in the prior year. The improvement in net income was driven by a lower effective tax rate, higher sales and increased profitability.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $15.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, compared to $11.2 million for the prior-year period.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nNet sales for Fiscal 2017 increased to $1.86 billion, or 13%, compared to $1.65 billion for the prior fiscal year (“Fiscal 2016”). Organic Daily Sales increased 5% for Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016. Organic growth was driven by sales of our construction related products like hardscapes, nursery, landscape accessories and irrigation. Acquisitions contributed $135.0 million, or 8%, to our overall net sales growth for Fiscal 2017.\nGross profit for Fiscal 2017 increased to $595.5 million, up 15% compared to $515.7 million for the prior year. Gross margin for the year improved by 70 basis points to 32.0% compared to 31.3% in Fiscal 2016. Operational improvements in category management were the primary contributor to margin gains.\nSG&A for the year increased to $502.2 million from $446.5 million in Fiscal 2016. The increase in SG&A was attributable to our investments made to support future organic growth and profitability along with operating costs associated with our acquisitions. SG&A as a percent of net sales declined to 27.0%, a 10 basis points improvement compared to the prior year period due in part to the non-recurrence of IPO related costs in 2017.\nOur effective tax rate for Fiscal 2017 was 24.8% as compared to 41.0% for Fiscal 2016. The decrease in the effective rate was due primarily to a $6.8 million benefit related to ASU 2016-09, and a $3.2 million benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). The 2017 Tax Act required us to re-measure certain deferred tax assets and liabilities at the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%, and to record a one-time transition tax related to the unremitted earnings of our Canadian subsidiary. We have not finalized our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act; however, our net benefit is based upon a reasonable estimate. We currently expect our 2018 effective tax rate will be between 26% and 27%, excluding ASU 2016-09 and other discrete items.\nNet income for Fiscal 2017 was $54.6 million, compared to net income of $30.6 million for Fiscal 2016. The increase in net income for the year was attributable to the sales growth both organically and through acquisition, gross margin improvement and a lower effective tax rate. For the year, Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $157.2 million, compared to $134.3 million in Fiscal 2016. The Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 30 basis points to 8.4%, compared to Fiscal 2016.\nNet debt, calculated as long-term debt (net of issuance costs and discounts) plus capital leases, net of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, was $458.6 million. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months was 2.9 times.\nOutlook\nFor 2018, we expect Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $180 million to $192 million.\nReconciliation for the forward-looking full-year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA outlook is not being provided, as the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation.\nConference Call Information\nSiteOne management will host a conference call today, February 20, 2018, at 8 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss the Company’s financial results.

Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our 2018 Adjusted EBITDA outlook. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “intend,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions. You should be aware that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: cyclicality in residential and commercial construction markets; general economic and financial conditions; weather conditions, seasonality and availability of water to end-users; laws and government regulations applicable to our business that could negatively impact demand for our products; public perceptions that our products and services are not environmentally friendly; competitive industry pressures; product shortages and the loss of key suppliers; product price fluctuations; inventory management risks; ability to implement our business strategies and achieve our growth objectives; acquisition and integration risks; increased operating costs; and other risks, as described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis release includes certain financial information, not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies calculate non-GAAP financial information identically (or at all), the presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, these measures should not be considered substitutes for the information contained in the historical financial information of the Company prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is set forth herein.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA in order to evaluate the operating performance and efficiency of our business. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for items permitted under the covenants of our credit facilities. EBITDA represents our net income (loss) plus the sum of income tax (benefit), depreciation and amortization and interest expense, net of interest income. Adjusted EBITDA is further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, related party advisory fees, (gain) loss on sale of assets and other non-cash items, other non-recurring (income) and loss. Adjusted EBITDA does not include pre-acquisition acquired Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our liquidity or financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The use of Adjusted EBITDA instead of net income has limitations as an analytical tool. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Net debt is defined as long-term debt (net of issuance costs and discounts) plus capital leases, net of cash and cash-equivalents on our balance sheet. Leverage Ratio is defined as Net Debt to trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA. Free Cash Flow is defined as Cash Flow from Operating Activities, less capital expenditures. We define Organic Daily Sales as Organic Sales divided by the number of Selling Days in the relevant reporting period. We define Organic Sales as Net sales, including Net sales from newly-opened greenfield stores, but excluding Net sales from acquired stores until they have been under our ownership for at least four full fiscal quarters at the start of the fiscal year. Selling Days are the number of business days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, that SiteOne branches are open during the relevant reporting period.\nSiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc.
