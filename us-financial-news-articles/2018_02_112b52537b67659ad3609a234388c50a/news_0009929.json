The Dow had a more than 930-point difference between its high and low on Tuesday. \nThe sharp declines in recent days marked a pullback that had been long-awaited by investors after the market minted record high after record high in a relatively calm ascent. \n“It’s been a crazy period and today the market is probably just trying to find some footing,” said John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 459.21 points, or 1.89 percent, to 24,804.96, the S&P 500 gained 39.5 points, or 1.49 percent, to 2,688.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 122.65 points, or 1.76 percent, to 7,090.18. \nTechnology and consumer discretionary were among the top-performing sectors. Defensive sectors including utilities and real estate lagged.
