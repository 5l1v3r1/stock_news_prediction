Its 464,000 members still have the chance to veto the deal in a postal ballot whose results will be announced on March 4, party sources said.\nSchulz highlighted policies that the SPD had pushed through, notably reducing the scope for short-term work contracts and increasing student loans and minimum wages for trainees - as demanded by the party’s leftist youth wing, which has drummed in new members in the hope that they will vote against the deal.\nCDU CHANCELLOR, SPD GOVERNMENT? Julian Reichelt, editor of Germany’s biggest selling paper, Bild, suggested the SPD had got the better end of the deal, tweeting: “This is the first SPD government led by a CDU chancellor.”\nWhile the talks have dragged on, Europe’s biggest economy has moved into overdrive, offering increased scope for government spending and investment.\nInvestors and partner countries had been alarmed at Merkel’s struggle to assemble a government at a time when Europe faces multiple challenges, including the need for euro zone reform and Britain’s looming departure from the EU.\nIn their 177-page document, the parties laid out plans to develop the euro zone’s bailout fund into a full-blown European Monetary Fund anchored in EU law - and therefore outside the direct control of national government - and support budgetary means to shield the euro zone from crises.\nThey said they would be prepared to pay more into the EU budget. “We want a (European Union) budget for future spending geared toward bringing more benefits for Europe,” they wrote, adding that they backed structural reforms championed by French President Emmanuel Macron.\nChristian Democratic Union (CDU) leader and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Christian Social Union (CSU) leader Horst Seehofer and Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Martin Schulz pose after a statement on coalition talks to form a new coalition government in Berlin, Germany, February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke The SPD also gets the high-profile foreign ministry as well as the labor, justice, family and environment portfolios.\nSchulz is expected to become foreign minister, despite having previously vowed not to take a cabinet position under Merkel.\nThe daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung said that Schulz, tarnished by the SPD’s poor election result, would quit as party leader, and that parliamentary floor leader Andrea Nahles was ready to take over. Schulz declined to comment.\nHamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz, a down-to-earth, pragmatic politician who was worked well with Merkel in the past, is slated to take over as finance minister, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.\nFRAGMENTED PARLIAMENT Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) will get the economy, defense, education and agriculture ministries while their Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), will provide the interior minister, with an added “homeland” portfolio, in the form of Horst Seehofer, who talks tough on migration.\nSlideshow (8 Images) The conservative bloc and the SPD began talks about renewing their alliance only after Merkel failed to agree a coalition last November with two smaller parties in the fragmented parliament.\nSupport for the two blocs that have dominated German post-war politics has waned even further since the election, and their alliance means the mantle of biggest opposition party now falls to the upstart anti-immigrant, eurosceptic Alliance for Germany (AfD).\nAfter a final negotiating session lasting some 24 hours, the parties ultimately agreed to cap arbitrary fixed-term labor contracts at 18 months, down from 24, and to limit their renewal.\nConservatives balked at the SPD’s demand for a complete ban, arguing that firms needed flexibility to be competitive.\nOn healthcare, the parties agreed to set up a commission to work on a joint fee structure for private and public patients to examine whether it was feasible, a negotiating source said.\nRelated Coverage German SPD's Schulz optimistic membership will back coalition Factbox: Social Democrats compromise to secure German coalition deal Factbox: Key points agreed in German coalition pact Doctors currently tend to get more money for treating private patients, and so often favor them over public patients.\nFlorian Hense, an economist at Berenberg, said the labor and healthcare reforms, along with more generous pension entitlements, could be expensive. “Germany may pay a price for them with slightly reduced trend growth and a less solidly financed budget after the next recession.”\nThat prospect may be a way off, however. The DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce raised its 2018 growth forecast for the German economy to a robust 2.7 percent as consumers with rising wages, secure jobs and low borrowing costs spend more while exports and company investments rebound.\n“Companies have never been more upbeat,” DIHK said in its latest business survey, adding that German firms are boosting investment plans at an unprecedented pace.\nBut the BDI industry association said the agreement was “heading towards redistribution rather than shoring up the future”.\nAlice Weidel, parliamentary leader of the AfD, tweeted: “Things could not get worse for Germany,” calling the coalition deal “insane” as it did not contain an upper limit for migration.\nAdditional reporting by Holger Hansen, Michael Nienaber, Joseph Nasr, Thorsten Severin, Andrea Shalal and Thomas Escritt in Berlin and Jan Strupczewski in Brussels; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T08:29:56.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
