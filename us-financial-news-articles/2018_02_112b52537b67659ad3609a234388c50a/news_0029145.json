Brent gained 44 cents to $63.16 a barrel.\nGasoline stocks rose by 3.6 million barrels, more than double the 1.2 million-barrel gain forecast by analysts polled by Reuters.\nRefinery crude runs fell by 635,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell 2.7 percentage points to 89.8 percent, lowest since November, as refiners went into seasonal maintenance periods.\nCrude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 3.6 million barrels, EIA said. Overall inventories in Cushing fell to 32.7 million barrels, lowest since Jan. 2015, and inventories at the hub have been cut in half in just three months’ time.\nCrude production rose again, hitting 10.27 million bpd on a weekly basis, which would be a record if confirmed by monthly figures. November’s monthly data showed production in the United States rose to 10.04 million bpd, and the country now ranks second in overall production, trailing only Russia.\nFlows had been restricted from TransCanada’s Keystone line after a November leak in South Dakota, and the December startup of the Diamond Pipeline from Cushing to Memphis has accelerated outflows from the Oklahoma hub.\nDistillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 459,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 1.1 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.\nNet U.S. crude imports fell last week by 39,000 barrels per day.\nReporting By David Gaffen; Additional reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:26:11.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
