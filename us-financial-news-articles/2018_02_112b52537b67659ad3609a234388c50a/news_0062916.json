Whether or not it will work, we’ll see.”\nGeely Auto’s stock surged 7 percent on Monday, giving it a market value of some $29 billion, as investors cheered the Geely group’s efforts to forge an alliance with Daimler. Shares in Daimler edged 0.6 percent lower in early trade.\nLi, who founded Zhejiang Geely Holding Group - the parent firm of the group - in 1986, said on Saturday that alliances were necessary to respond to the challenge from “invaders” in the global auto market, a reference to firms such as Tesla , Google and Uber.\nChinese carmakers are under particular pressure to jump several leaps forward in technology with Beijing bringing in new quotas from next year for the world’s largest auto market that will require firms to hit strict targets for electric vehicle and hybrid electric plug-in vehicle sales.\nGeely Auto said in a filing on Monday it was not directly involved in the purchase of the shareholding but did not rule out exploring cooperation opportunities with Daimler in the future.\nGermany has said there is no need to take action on the stake owned by Li and Daimler has said it is pleased that it could win another long-term oriented shareholder with Li.\nThe German automaker, however, also underlined its partnership with BAIC on the weekend, announcing an investment of almost $2 billion in a China plant to build premium Mercedes-Benz cars including electric vehicles..\nChao added the purchase of the Daimler stake - amid a broader crackdown by China on outbound deals - seemed to have gone relatively smoothly and was likely helped by the fact that it fitted with Beijing’s strategic goals to bolster China’s tech capabilities, especially in the automotive market.\nGeely has been the most eager of China’s automakers to build a major presence globally.\n“I think we’ll see a lot more on the global stage (from Geely) outside of China,” added Chao. “Clearly they have ambitions that are much greater than what they’ve done so far.”\nZhejiang Geely Holding owns Volvo Cars, LEVC, the maker of London’s black cabs, and last year took a majority stake in sports car maker Lotus, a 49.9 percent stake in Malaysian automaker Proton, a $3.3 billion stake in Volvo Trucks and control of flying car start-up Terrafugia.
