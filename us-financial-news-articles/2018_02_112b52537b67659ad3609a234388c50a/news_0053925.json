Then with 100 meters –- go. I‘m very happy. I focus on team pursuit and mass start.”\nThe race made its Olympic debut in South Korea and was given a touch of celebrity by the presence of Ivanka Trump, daughter of the U.S. President.\nIt was a tactical encounter, with 16 skaters simultaneously vying for an advantage on the track.\nSpeed Skating - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Mass Start competition finals - Gangneung Oval - Gangneung, South Korea - February 24, 2018 - Nana Takagi of Japan celebrates after winning the race.

She made a deep bow to the crowd and took a lap around the track waving her country’s flag.\nKim and her team mate in the women’s team pursuit, Park Ji-woo, faced calls for them to be banned from the national team after they appeared to blame a team mate for their failure to reach the women’s team pursuit semi-finals this week.\n“Because of me, it became controversial and I felt so sorry to everybody and so I bowed before the crowd,” Kim said.\nAdditional reporting by Jane Chung; editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T15:17:13.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
