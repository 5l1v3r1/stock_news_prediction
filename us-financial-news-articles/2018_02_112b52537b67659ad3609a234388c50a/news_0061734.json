Near the Colosseum, students skied down the Oppian Hill.\nIt was the heaviest snowfall in Rome in six years and the largest for the end of February in decades. The city, which is not equipped to deal with snow emergencies due to their rarity, asked other areas to send in snow plows to help clear roads.\nSchools were ordered shut and many people could not reach their work. Police asked residents to stay at home if possible.\nRome’s Fiumicino airport was forced to operate with only one runway during the night, when 10 cm (4 inches) of snow fell in less than four hours. The capital’s second airport, Ciampino, was closed overnight and workers were clearing its two runways.\nItalian aviation officials said Ryanair had canceled all flights to and from Ciampino, its Italian hub. Most of Italy’s other main airports were open, albeit with flight delays.\nHOMELESS\nPeople walk at Villa Borghese during a heavy snowfall in Rome, Italy February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Remo Casilli The weather brought chaos to Italy’s rail network. Most express trains heading north from Rome and Naples faced at least three hours of delays.\nThe chill engulfed much of the country, with the harshest temperatures recorded in the Alps in the Valle d‘Aosta, where a low of -34.9 C was recorded early on Monday.\nIn Brussels, authorities said homeless people sleeping in parts of the city would be detained overnight if they refused shelter, to protect them from sub-zero temperatures this week.\nSlideshow (14 Images) Temperatures in Brussels are set to fall to as low as -10 degrees Celsius (14 F) in the coming week, with strong winds adding a further chill factor. Campaign groups estimate there are more than 3,000 homeless people in the Brussels region.\nIn Germany temperatures plunged to their lowest so far this winter with a low of -27.5 degrees centigrade recorded at the Zugspitze, Germany’s highest mountain. But even in the ordinarily more temperate coastal climes, temperatures were well below zero on Monday, according to the German Weather Service.\nHeavy snow left thousands in western Bulgaria without power, disrupting transport and shutting down schools, prompting the Balkan country’s authorities to warn people to refrain from traveling.\nDozens of villages were left without electricity. Roads were blocked while flights in and out of Sofia Airport were canceled. Schools in several municipalities were closed and strong winds closed the Black Sea port of Burgas.\nSome trains were canceled or delayed due to the weather in Britain, where authorities said the country faced the coldest period for a number of years, with forecasts of snow and temperatures falling to minus 8 Celsius (46.4 F).\nTransport is expected to be badly hit when more severe weather strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nFrank Saunders, Met Office Chief Operational Meteorologist, said daytime temperatures would struggle to rise above freezing this week. Public Health England advised family and neighbors of the elderly to check they were ok.\nThe cold snap triggered a jump in power prices in France, a country still largely reliant on electric heating, though price moves in Germany were less pronounced.\nFrench power grid operator RTE said there was no risk to French electricity supply. Nonetheless, state utility EDF said it was delaying planned maintenance outages at two nuclear reactors by a week.\nAdditional reporting by Crispian Balmer, Robert-Jan Bartunek, Richard Lough, Thomas Escritt, Angel Krasimirov, Michael Holden; Editing by Robin Pomeroy, William Maclean, Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T15:27:57.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
