Wentworth, the morning after the company reported higher fourth-quarter profit, was speaking to Wall Street analysts about its interest in expanding managing the pharmacy benefits provided under the Medicare program for older or disabled people. “If a meaningful book of business is coming to the market, we would take a look,” Wentworth said. Wall Street analysts have speculated CVS and Aetna will need to sell some plans to please antitrust regulators. Neither company was immediately available for comment.
