Improved trends in the Company’s consumer money transfer business and continued strong growth in the bill payments businesses drove the revenue growth.\nGAAP earnings per share in the quarter was negatively impacted by United States tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”) and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Business Solutions reporting unit. GAAP earnings / (loss) per share of ($2.44) compared to ($0.73) in the prior year period, while adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 compared to $0.47 in the same period last year.\n“Our consumer money transfer revenue growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, and our business continued to demonstrate resilience,” said president and chief executive officer Hikmet Ersek. “Solid business performance was again led by our digital channel, as westernunion.com money transfer delivered a 22% revenue increase and represented 10% of our total consumer-to-consumer business in the quarter.”\nErsek added, “We remain focused on leveraging our cross-border capabilities to drive more global funds and transactions through our platform in 2018.”\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Raj Agrawal stated, “We generated strong cash flow and allocation to shareholders in 2017, returning more than $800 million through share repurchases and dividends. Our WU Way business transformation initiatives also delivered solid results and should continue to fuel operating efficiencies and growth initiatives.”\nThe new quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per common share, which represents a 9% increase over the previous dividend of $0.175, is payable March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 16, 2018.\nQ4 Business Unit and Financial Highlights\nConsumer-to-Consumer (C2C) revenues, which represented 80% of total Company revenues in the quarter, increased 5% on a reported basis, or 4% constant currency. Transactions grew 3%, driven by growth in westernunion.com . Geographically, revenue growth was led by transactions originated in Latin America and North America.\nWesternunion.com C2C revenues increased 22% on both a reported and constant currency basis, on transaction growth of 22%. Westernunion.com represented 10% of total C2C revenue in the quarter. Western Union Business Solutions revenues declined 4%, or 8% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to declines in Europe. Business Solutions represented 6% of total Company revenues in the quarter. Other revenues, which primarily consist of bill payments businesses in the U.S. and Argentina and represented 14% of the quarter’s revenues, increased 11%, or 14% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by the Speedpay U.S. electronic and Pago Facil Argentina walk-in bill payments businesses. GAAP operating loss in the quarter was ($253) million, which compares to ($314) million in the prior year period, while adjusted operating income of $258 million compares to $271 million in the prior year period. GAAP operating losses include a $464 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the current quarter and a $571 million expense related to the Joint Settlement Agreements (as defined below) with federal and state governments in the prior year period.\nThe non-cash goodwill impairment charge is related to our Business Solutions reporting unit, as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit declined below its carrying value. The reduction in estimated fair value primarily resulted from a decrease in projected revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins and the impact of the Tax Act. The financial projections were reevaluated due to the declines in revenues and operating results recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017, which were below management’s expectations. The December 2017 enactment of the Tax Act also effectively eliminated contributions to Business Solutions fair value previously derived from cash management strategies that optimized the Company’s U.S. cash flow management utilizing principal payouts for Business Solutions transactions.\nGAAP operating margin was (17.6%), which compares to (22.9%) in the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin of 17.9% in the quarter compares to 19.7% in the prior year period, with the decrease primarily due to timing of expenses, including incremental marketing spending to drive revenue growth, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Tax expense in the quarter includes an estimated incremental expense of $828 million related to the Tax Act, primarily due to taxes on certain of the Company’s previously undistributed foreign earnings, partially offset by benefits from remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax balances. The Company’s 2017 U.S. federal tax cash liability, including the effects of the Tax Act and other Company income and tax attributes, is estimated at $780 million and will be payable over the next eight years, with 8% payable in each of years one through five, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. Due to the complexities and uncertain interpretations of many aspects of the Tax Act, certain of the 2017 impacts have been provisionally estimated and additional effects may be recorded in 2018. The Company returned $92 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, consisting of $12 million of share repurchases and $80 million of dividends.\n2017 Full Year Results\nThe Company’s full year revenue increased 2%, or increased 3% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency translation, net of hedge benefits, negatively impacted revenue by $61 million.\nGAAP operating margin of 8.6% compares to 8.9% in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, which compares to 20.4% in 2016. The adjusted margin decline from 2016 was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign exchange.\nThe full year tax expense was $905 million, which compares to $88 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act and other adjustment items, the adjusted tax rate of 13% for the full year compares to 11% in 2016.\nGAAP earnings / (loss) per share of ($1.19) compares to $0.51 in the prior year, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.80 compares to $1.75 in 2016.\nGAAP cash flow from operating activities for the year was $736 million, which includes the impact of approximately $600 million of outflows related to the Joint Settlement Agreements and $77 million of WU Way spending, partially offset by associated tax benefits. The Company returned $813 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the year.\n2016 and 2017 Income Statement Adjustment Items\nAdjusted metrics in 2017 exclude the impact of the Tax Act (estimated $828 million for Q4 and full year), the non-cash goodwill impairment charge ($464 million for Q4 and full year), expenses related to the WU Way business transformation ($35 million for Q4 and $94 million for full year), an accrual related to a settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services announced in January 2018 (“NYDFS Settlement,” $11 million for Q4 and $60 million for full year), additional expenses for an independent compliance auditor as required by the Joint Settlement Agreements ($8 million for full year), and related tax impacts. Adjusted metrics in the prior year period exclude expenses related to the Joint Settlement Agreements ($571 million for Q4 and $601 million full year) expenses related to the WU Way business transformation ($13 million for Q4 and $20 million full year), and related tax impacts.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company expects solid business performance in 2018, as it continues to execute its long-term growth strategies focusing on cross-border money movement and digital channel expansion. The impact of foreign exchange on 2018 results is expected to be minimal compared to the prior year.\nThe Company expects the following outlook for 2018:\nRevenue\nLow to mid-single digit increase in GAAP and constant currency revenue\nOperating Profit Margin\nOperating margin of approximately 20%\nTax Rate\nEffective tax rate of approximately 15% to 16%\nEarnings per Share\nEPS in a range of $1.78 to $1.90\nCash Flow\nCash flow from operating activities of approximately $800 million, which includes approximately $200 million of outflows for the combination of anticipated final tax payments related to the agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service announced in 2011, the NYDFS settlement payment, and WU Way payments related to 2017 expenses\nAdditional Statistics\nAdditional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental tables included with this press release. As discussed in the Company’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 27, 2017, beginning in the first quarter of 2017 the Company implemented a new region structure in its Consumer-to-Consumer operating segment, due to leadership and organizational structure changes within the Company.\nAlso beginning January 1, 2017, the determination of the geographic split for transactions and revenue in the C2C segment, including transactions initiated through westernunion.com , is based entirely upon the region where the money transfer is initiated. Prior to January 1, 2017, for transactions originated and paid in different regions, the Company split the transaction count and revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%.\nBeginning April 1, 2017, the Company implemented a new segment structure due to leadership and organizational structure changes. The new structure shifted all businesses previously in the historical Consumer-to-Business segment into Other.\nRegional and segment results for the prior periods presented within this press release have been adjusted for the new region and segment structure and geographic split methodology.\nExpenses related to the goodwill impairment, NYDFS Settlement, Joint Settlement Agreements and the WU Way business transformation are not included in operating segment results, as they are excluded from the measurement of segment operating income provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation.\nAll amounts included in the supplemental tables to this press release are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, the percentage changes and margins disclosed herein may not recalculate precisely using the rounded amounts provided.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWestern Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures include consolidated revenue change constant currency adjusted; Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue change constant currency adjusted; Consumer-to-Consumer segment westernunion.com revenue change constant currency adjusted; Business Solutions segment revenue change constant currency adjusted; Other revenue change constant currency adjusted; consolidated operating income/(loss), excluding the impact from goodwill impairment, NYDFS Settlement, the settlement with federal and state governments announced in January 2017 (\"Joint Settlement Agreements\") and WU Way business transformation expenses; consolidated operating margin, excluding goodwill impairment, NYDFS Settlement, Joint Settlement Agreements and WU Way business transformation expenses; effective tax rate excluding the goodwill impairment, NYDFS Settlement, Joint Settlement Agreements, WU Way business transformation expenses and Tax Act; earnings/(loss) per share, excluding the goodwill impairment, NYDFS Settlement, Joint Settlement Agreements, WU Way business transformation expenses and Tax Act; and additional measures found in the supplemental tables included with this press release. Although the expenses related to the WU Way business transformation are specific to that initiative, the types of expenses related to the WU Way business transformation are similar to expenses that the Company has previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the “Investor Relations” section of the Company’s website at http://ir.westernunion.com .\nInvestor and Analyst Conference Call and Slide Presentation\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast, including slides, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today.
