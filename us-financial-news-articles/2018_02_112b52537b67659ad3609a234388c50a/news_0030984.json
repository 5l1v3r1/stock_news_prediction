Also included in the lawsuit were screenshots of text messages between White and Zawaideh in which he asks her to wear a provocative outfit and cut her hair a certain way. \nWhite won his third gold medal in Pyeongchang on Wednesday , adding to the two medals he had already won at previous Olympic Games. When ABC News asked White about the allegations during a press conference, he responded by saying “Honestly, I’m here to talk about the Olympics, not you know, not gossip.” \nSeveral other reporters attempted to ask follow-up questions, which the moderator shot down. White was then rushed offstage. \nLater, White apologized for his “gossip” comment and said he’s “a changed person.” \n“It was a poor choice of words to describe such a sensitive subject in the world today,” White told NBC’s Today show later in the day . “And, you know, I’m just truly sorry. And I was so overwhelmed with just wanting to talk about how amazing today was and share my experience.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T18:46:56.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
