Germany finished 22.8 points behind to take silver and Poland claimed the bronze.\nThe Norwegians took a slender lead into the final round, two points ahead of the Germans and five clear of the Poles.\nThe three leaders illustrated the gulf in class to the rest, leap-frogging ahead of each other in a tense final that provided a superb showcase for the sport.\nDaniel Tande Andre opened up a gap for with the first of Norway’s four jumps in the final, scoring 145.5 points for the world champions and forcing Poland and Germany to play catch-up.\nThe Norwegians sensed their time had come and Andreas Stjernen added 139.8 points with their next jump to put even more daylight between them and the chasing pair.\nSki Jumping - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men’s Team Final - Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 19, 2018 - Gold medalists Daniel Andre Tande, Andreas Stjernen, Johann Andre Forfang and Robert Johansson of Norway celebrate during the victory ceremony.

But anyway, the nerves are coming more and more as its closing in on your jump,” Johansson told a news conference.\n“I just tried to calm myself down and tell myself that I‘m good enough to deliver what it took. Nervous, but a fantastic feeling afterwards,” he added.\nJohansson is hoping his third medal of the Games spurs him on to even greater things.\n“It means a lot for the motivation for the upcoming season and what’s left of this one. It’s way over what I could have expected in my first Olympics,” he said.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor, editing ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:52:32.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
