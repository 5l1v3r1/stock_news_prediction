REUTERS/Toby Melville/Files London City Airport is the city’s fifth biggest and is popular with business travellers. It is London’s most central international airport and is close to major financial districts in the City of London and Canary Wharf.\nThe docklands area of London’s East End was a trading hub in the 1940s and was heavily bombed by German planes in World War Two. The airport was opened in 1987 as part of the broader regeneration of the area.\nThe airport told passengers not to travel there on Monday. Regional airline CityJet said its flights from the airport had been rescheduled to land and take off from London Southend airport, while Italy’s Alitalia said it would operate flights from London Stansted airport.\nBritish Airways said it was trying to minimise disruption for passengers and said in a statement: “We are rebooking customers due to travel today onto alternative flights or offering refunds for those who no longer wish to travel.”\nReporting by Alistair Smout in London and Abinaya Vijayaraghavan in Bengaluru; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T10:15:13.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
