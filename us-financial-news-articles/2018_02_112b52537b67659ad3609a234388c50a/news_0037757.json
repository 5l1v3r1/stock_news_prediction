U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing for changes to the agreement. “If the U.S. violates this agreement... you will see that America will regret this decision,” he said adding his country had always adhered to contracts deals so long as other party did not violate the contract. Rouhani arrived in India on a three-day visit part of efforts to expand bilateral ties and cooperation in economic development.
