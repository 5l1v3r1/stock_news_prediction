Maybe as a brusher, but come on, hit the gym you know,” Norwegian skip and Olympic 2010 silver medalist Thomas Ulsrud told Reuters.\nEven Krushelnitsky’s own Olympic Athletes from Russia team mates were at a loss to understand why a curler would need to dope or how they could, with Russia under the drugs spotlight after being accused of running a state-backed, systematic doping program for years.\nAs a result, its athletes are competing at Pyeongchang as neutral “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (OAR) and on a bond of good behavior before it is decided whether they can march under their own flag at the closing ceremony.\n”We’ve always said how great it is that we have a sport where scandals don’t happen because we really don’t need it,“ said Viktoria Moiseeva, skip of the Olympic Athletes from Russia women’s team. ”With us it’s not faster, higher, stronger , it’s about being more accurate.\n“I can’t imagine what kind of drugs you could use in curling, and for what.”\nAdditional reporting Mark Trevelyan.
