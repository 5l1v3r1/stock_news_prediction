The index has recovered nearly half what it lost between late January and last week’s low. The 4.3 percent gain it ultimately posted last week was its best weekly performance since December 2011.\nINFLATION FEARS January’s two-week rout, triggered by worries about a rise in U.S. inflation, had wiped more than $6 trillion off the value of global stock markets.\nThe sell-off took place despite global growth was helping to improve the corporate earnings outlook.\nJust before the plunge, world shares were trading at 16.66 times expected earnings, the highest levels since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. They are currently at 15.33 times.\n“Investors knew market volatility would be low as the U.S. and Canada celebrate public holidays, and that weighed on enthusiasm in this part of the world,” said David Madden, markets analyst at CMC Markets. “Dealers decided to lock in their profits from week.”\nEquity investors have drawn some reassurance from a fall in the VIX - a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”.\nThe index has remained below 20 for three days, last reading at 19.46. It spiked to a 2-1/2-year high of 50.3 two weeks ago, a jump that caused massive losses among investors who had bet equity markets would stay stable on a combination of solid economic growth and moderate inflation.\nThe German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, February 19, 2018.

Italian bonds came under pressure from jitters ahead of next month’s election.\nBond yields across the euro zone were broadly higher in the absence of any fresh drivers.

Besides the outlook on rates, markets will be keen to see what, if anything, the Fed makes of the gyrations in markets.\nDOLLAR EDGES UP\nMarket prices are reflected in a glass window at the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in Tokyo, Japan, February 6, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai The dollar edged up from three-year lows against a basket of currencies.\nThe euro stood at $1.2396, backing down from Friday’s three-year high of $1.2556.\nThe dollar traded at 106.53 yen, bouncing back from its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb. 16 [FRX/].\nThe U.S. currency has been weighed down by various factors, including worries about widening U.S. trade and budget deficits and speculation that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy.\nThere is also talk that foreign central banks may be re-allocating their reserves out of the dollar.\nCommodities, which enjoyed gains as the dollar weakened, were steady as it edged up.\nOil prices hit their highest level in nearly two weeks, lifted by the recovery in stocks and by tensions in the Middle East.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.2 percent to $62.47 per barrel.\nBrent crude rose over 1 percent to $65.63 per barrel.\nGold was flat.\nReporting by Ritvik Carvalho; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T09:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T03:26:04.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
