It also was their second victory over the Gators.\nThe Gators (17-9, 8-5 SEC) dropped out of second place and into a tie with Missouri and Alabama for third place in the league.\nGuards KeVaughn Allen and Egor Koulechov scored 19 points each to lead Florida.\nAfter the score was 59-59 at the end of 40 minutes, the Bulldogs pulled out to a 66-60 lead less than two minutes into the extra five-minute period. However, the Gators, who shot only 37.3 percent from the field, were down only 71-69 after Chris Chiozza’s layup with five seconds left.\nFlorida still had a chance to tie after Bulldogs guard Juwan Parker hit only one of two free throws with 3.8 seconds remaining. Chiozza managed to get in range for a 3-point attempt but it missed as time ran out.\nAfter leading 34-27 at halftime, Florida led throughout the second half, including by a 50-39 margin midway through the second period, but hit a shooting drought that let the Bulldogs back in the game.\nThe Bulldogs went on an 11-1 run to cut their deficit to 51-50 on guard Derek Ogbeide’s dunk with 3:35 left as the Gators went nearly eight minutes without a field goal.\nStill, the Gators seemed to have survived that when Koulechov hit a 3-pointer and a pair of free throws to put his team up 59-53 with only 24.7 seconds left.\nMaten hit a 3-pointer to cut Florida’s lead in half, and after the Gators turned the ball over when guard Jalen Hudson traveled under pressure, Maten tied the game 59-59 with another triple with 5.1 seconds left to send the game to overtime.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:23:58.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
