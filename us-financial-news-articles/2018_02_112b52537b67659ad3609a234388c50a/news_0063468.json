She was released from police custody to house arrest on Monday until March 4 while a court ordered she stay away from Bezeq for 30 days.\nBezeq’s board is expected to decide on the interim appointment at a special board meeting later on Tuesday.\nAlong with Handler, Bezeq’s controlling shareholder and former chairman Shaul Elovitch and a number of other officials connected to Bezeq were arrested. Most have been released from custody although Elovitch remains in detention.\nThey all deny any wrongdoing.\nElovitch said on Monday he would step down from the board as would his son and daughter-in-law, a step sought by minority shareholders in the wake of the investigation by Israel’s markets regulator that began last year.\nElovitch, a family friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, controls Bezeq through Eurocom Communications.\nReporting by Steven Scheer, editing by Jeffrey Heller and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T13:26:41.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
