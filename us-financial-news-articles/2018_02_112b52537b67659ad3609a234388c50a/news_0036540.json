We therefore disapprove the proposed rule change,” the SEC said in a statement.\nSEC staff had initially approved the sale of privately owned CHX for an undisclosed amount to a consortium led by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group but the regulator put that decision on hold in August of last year for further review.\nThe deal had drawn criticism from U.S. lawmakers who questioned the SEC’s ability to regulate and monitor the foreign buyers if the deal was approved.\nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru and Carmel Crimmins\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:13:04.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
