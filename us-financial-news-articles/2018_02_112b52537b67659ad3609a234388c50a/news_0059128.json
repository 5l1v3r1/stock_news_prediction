Under a management restructuring plan, chief financial officer Chandan Gupta is resigning.\nThe company did not explain the changes but they could point to closer cooperation between GFH and ADFG, which owns nearly half of Shuaa Capital. GFH and Shuaa held merger discussions last year but the talks were called off in June.
