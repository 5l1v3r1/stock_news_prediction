Last week, the two sides squared off in court, and the judge prodded Puerto Rico’s board to reduce the loan to $300 million and rework its terms.\nBond insurer National Public Finance Guarantee Corp had questioned whether PREPA even needed a loan while Puerto Rico’s general obligation bondholders argued the board sought to subsidize PREPA with funds needed by the island’s government.\nPuerto Rico is more than $70 billion in debt and PREPA has more than $14 billion in liabilities, including some $8 billion in Power Revenue Bonds.\nQuarreling over the loan package has been taking place amid a separate fight between Puerto Rico and creditors over the territory’s revised fiscal plan.\nThe plan would use $18 billion from the U.S. government to turn Puerto Rico’s deficit into a $3.4 billion surplus within six years.\nLast week, creditors cast doubt on the plan, saying in a joint statement it “fails to provide a credible basis on which to restructure the island’s debt.”\nThe case is In re the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, U.S. District Court, District of Puerto Rico, No. 17-BK-3283.\nReporting by Jim Christie; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:42:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
