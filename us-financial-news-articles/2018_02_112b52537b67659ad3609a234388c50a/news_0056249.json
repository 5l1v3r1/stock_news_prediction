REUTERS/Toby Melville Like Iivo Niskanen in Saturday’s men’s race, Bjoergen made an early break, gradually opening up a gap and never looking back.\nThe chasing group of Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla, Finns Krista Parmakoski and Kerttu Niskanen and Teresa Stadlober of Austria would have hoped that Bjoergen would burn out and then fade away but instead she built up a lead of almost a minute by the halfway mark.\nSlideshow (2 Images) A change of skis saw Kalla drop out of the chase briefly but it would make little difference to her chance of a gold medal with Bjoergen, rather than tiring, continuing to increase her lead. The Swede was left battling to get on to the podium.\nKalla’s cause was helped when Stadlober took a wrong turn on the tight, winding course but it was team mate Stina Nilsson who came out of the pack to battle for bronze as Niskanen also fell away.\nBjoergen had the luxury of skiing at a leisurely pace over the line, waving a Norwegian flag, while Parmakoski cruised in almost two minutes behind her to claim the silver.\nNilsson, who won the individual sprint medal and took silver in the team sprint, timed a late spurt to pass Ingvild Flugstad Oestberg, rounding her Norwegian opponent and beating her to the line for the bronze.\nBjoergen’s emotions got the better of her as she crossed the line and the most successful Winter Olympic athlete of all time explained that she was thinking of her young son as she did so.\n“I think my feelings were that I could do it on this distance and also that I have been a mother and I have been three weeks away from Marius, and now I knew that I‘m finished and tomorrow I can see him,” she said.\nEditing by Clare Fallon and Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T10:16:08.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
