There was no word on Genena’s situation and the reason for his detention was not immediately clear.\nAn Interior Ministry official said he had no knowledge of the incident.\nThe detention came one day after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, during a visit to Egypt, called for free and fair election.\nAmnesty International slammed Genena’s detention.\n“The arbitrary arrest of Hisham Genena and his referral to the Office of the Military Prosecution show a blatant disregard for the rights to freedom of expression and the right to public participation,” Amnesty International’s North Africa branch said in a message on Twitter.\nGenena had run the short-lived election campaign of former military chief of staff Sami Anan, who was detained last month and accused by the army of running for office without permission, bringing his presidential bid to a halt. Egypt holds its election at the end of March.\nThe military in a statement late on Monday said it would pursue all “legal measures” against anyone who tried to harm Egypt’s national security.\nThe statement appeared to refer to an interview Genena gave to the HuffPost Arabi news website, in which he said Anan possessed documents that were damning for senior Egyptian officials, without giving details.\nINJURIES It was not immediately clear if Tuesday’s incident was linked to the military statement, however. The military was not immediately available for comment.\nAnan’s lawyer criticized Genena, writing on his Facebook page that statements Genena had made were “completely untrue”, without specifying which statements he was referring to.\n“We will take all necessary legal measures against anyone who makes media statements on Anan’s words and actions which harm his legal position,” the lawyer Nasser Amin wrote.\nGenena was beaten up last month shortly after the detention of Anan, and he accused the government of being behind his assault. His alleged assailants said his injuries were the result of a fight after a car accident\nAll main challengers to Sisi, who is seeking a second term in the March 26-28 vote, have pulled out of the race, citing intimidation of their supporters and other tactics designed to give the incumbent an easy win.\nEgypt says the 2018 presidential election will be free and fair.\nEditing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T13:18:45.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
