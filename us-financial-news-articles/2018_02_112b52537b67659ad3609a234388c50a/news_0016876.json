Companies under investigation but not convicted of corruption could opt to form an escrow account managed by the state to ensure its operations continue, it added. \nBut companies would be excluded “entirely or partially” from the restrictions if they broker a plea deal with the attorney general’s office, the ministry said. \nSpeaking at a joint news conference at the opposition-controlled Congress, Justice Minister Enrique Mendoza and Finance Minister Claudia Cooper asked lawmakers to pass its bill in coming days, despite a legislative recess that ends next month. \n“We want to ensure that any company found guilty would be able to pay civil reparations,” Cooper told journalists. \nIt was unclear if the opposition, which has been preparing a new motion to impeach Kuczynski, would support voting on the legislation in a limited congressional committee active during the recess. \nSet to expire Feb. 13, the original rules allowed the government to restrict Brazilian builder Odebrecht’s financial movements to ensure it paid eventual civil reparations for corruption. The company spurred graft inquiries across the Latin America since admitting more than a year ago to U.S. authorities that it had paid bribes to secure lucrative contracts from Peru to Panama. \nBut critics say the Peruvian government’s resulting clampdown on Odebrecht’s assets only deprived construction projects of funding while threatening to punish any other company that joined it in admitting complicity in graft schemes. \nOdebrecht said it could not provide immediate comment.
