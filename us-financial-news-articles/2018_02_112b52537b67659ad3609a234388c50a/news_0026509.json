Under the constitution, Sirisena cannot dissolve the parliament until early 2020.\nPrashan Fernando, CEO at Acuity Stockbrokers, said Sri Lankan financial markets would welcome an outcome that saw the two main parties forming coalitions at the local council level to help ensure political stability.\nReporting by Shihar Aneez\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T13:59:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
