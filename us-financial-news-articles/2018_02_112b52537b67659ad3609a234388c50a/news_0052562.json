Gates is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his probe of Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.\nLegal experts said the move by Gates would likely add to pressure on Manafort to strike his own plea deal with Mueller, although Manafort maintains his innocence and is preparing to go to trial.\nSaturday’s court filing said that Manafort had notified the special counsel’s office of his request to leave his home to attend the services on Monday and Tuesday, but had not received a response.\nA spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.\nKevin Downing, a lawyer who represents Manafort, did not immediately respond to a call for comment.\nManafort is married to Kathleen Manafort, whose father is Joseph Bond. Bond was 89 years old, according to public records.\nMueller has accused Manafort of working with Gates to launder more than $30 million, duping banks into lending money, and using funds from secret offshore accounts to enjoy a life of luxury without paying taxes on that income in the United States.
