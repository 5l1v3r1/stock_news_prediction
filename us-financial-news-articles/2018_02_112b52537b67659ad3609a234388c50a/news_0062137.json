Fourth-quarter EBITDA rose by 17.6 percent.\nIn Cuba, however, its biggest market behind Spain, the group was forced to temporarily close over a third of 28 hotels it then operated there due to damage after Irma struck the island.\nThe company said revenue per available room (RevPAR) on its Cuba portfolio fell 29.7 percent last year, and its total fee revenue dropped 76.1 percent due to Irma’s impact on the island.\nMelia plans to add 30 new hotels this year, and has already opened eight in Cuba, its chief executive Gabriel Escarrer said last month.
