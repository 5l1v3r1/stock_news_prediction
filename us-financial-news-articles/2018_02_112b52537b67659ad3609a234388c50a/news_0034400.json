Permanent jobs were offered to workers based on company’s requirements.\n“Currently, a recruitment drive is going on ... Contract workers who have the experience of working on machines in Avery Dennison are being given preference over external candidates,” he said in an email.\nBRAND CONCERNS The dispute is the latest in a series of rows between workers and management in India’s multi-billion dollar textile and garment industry that employs about 45 million workers.\nCampaigners have complained that a growing number of workers at suppliers have been suspended or dismissed within days of joining unions or attending union events.\nBrands have expressed concerns over accusations of discrimination against unionists, said Martin Buttle of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), which brings together brands, unions, factory-owners and civil society groups.\nAvery Dennison is not an ETI member, but does supply labels to many ETI members, including H&M, Gap and Inditex.\n“ETI members recognize that the human rights of workers, including their rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, should be respected,” Buttle said by email.\nAvery Dennison had “agreed to keep them updated on their actions”, Buttle said.\nGowrish Venkategowda, 32, said Avery Dennison’s factory told him on Feb. 1 that his services as a data-entry operator earning 12,000 rupees ($187) a month were no longer needed.\n“Then they went and hired people on daily wages to do the job I have done for the last 14 years,” he said.\nReporting by Anuradha Nagaraj.
