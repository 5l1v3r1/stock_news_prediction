Better diagnostic tests could improve predictions of whether cancer patients are likely to benefit from the costly treatments.\nProgression-free survival is a measure of how long a treatment can keep the disease from worsening. But analysts said they were waiting to see if it actually helps patients live longer, a standard that Merck's Keytruda has demonstrated in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer.\n\"Overall survival is what matters,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note, noting that regulators favor that standard. \"The survival benefit may not be that great, and perhaps not as good as Merck's.\"\nThe company said it plans to release overall survival data for the Opdivo and Yervoy combination toward the end of the year or early next year.\nBristol-Myers was a pioneer in immunotherapy, but Merck has nearly pulled even, primarily via Keytruda's use in lung cancer. Sales of Keytruda were just shy of the $1.36 billion that BMS pulled in with Opdivo in the quarter.\nThe company posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.33 billion compared with a year-ago profit of $894 million, due to a one-time $2.9 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax reform law.\nExcluding one-time items, Bristol-Myers said it earned 68 cents per share in the quarter, beating analysts' average expectations by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters. \nSales of blood thinner Eliquis, which the company shares with Pfizer , rose nearly 44 percent to match Opdivo's sales of $1.36 billion.\nThe company forecast 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.30. Analysts had forecast $3.23 per share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T15:07:34.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
