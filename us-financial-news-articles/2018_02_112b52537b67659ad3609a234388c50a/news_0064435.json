(NASDAQ:FCBC) ( www.firstcommunitybank.com ) (the “Company”) announced today that the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend to common shareholders of forty-eight cents ($0.48) per common share.\nThe Company’s capital management plan and philosophy require the maintenance of a strong capital base from which to grow and serve its customers. As part of the capital plan, the Company intends to return current earnings not needed to fund growth in core operations or other uses back to shareholders through regular cash dividends and stock repurchases. To the extent current earnings exceed those capital uses, the Company may declare special dividends from time to time.\nThe Company earned approximately $21.49 million in 2017, from which it paid regular dividends of approximately $11.90 million and repurchased treasury shares for approximately $1.26 million. The Board of Directors determined that the Company will have sufficient surplus capital to support all anticipated growth opportunities or other needs after payment of the special dividend totaling approximately $8.14 million.\nThis special cash dividend based on 2017 results is payable on March 23, 2018, to shareholders of record March 9, 2018, and may not be indicative of special cash dividend activity in the future.\nAbout First Community Bancshares, Inc.\nFirst Community Bancshares, Inc., a financial holding company headquartered in Bluefield, Virginia, provides banking products and services through its wholly owned subsidiary First Community Bank.
