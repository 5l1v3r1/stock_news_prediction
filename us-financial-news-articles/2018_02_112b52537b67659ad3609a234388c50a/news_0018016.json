Oklahoma City snapped a four-game losing streak despite seeing Carmelo Anthony leave the game for good midway through the first quarter due to a sprained ankle.\nKevin Durant had a team-high 33 points for the Warriors, who lost a second straight game for the first time this season. They had been 11-0 in games immediately following a loss.\nThe Thunder took command from the get-go, hitting 18 of their first 27 shots while building a 42-28 lead late in the first period. Westbrook had half the field goals on just 11 shots in his 21-point explosion.\nIn leading his team to a second consecutive win over the Warriors, Westbrook made 13 of his 26 shots overall and also found time for nine rebounds and nine assists.\nGeorge, who connected on six 3-pointers in the game, scored 10 points in the third quarter, when the Thunder extended a 70-57 halftime lead to as many as 24 points on two occasions late in the period.\nJerami Grant added 16 points and Steven Adams recorded a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double for the Thunder, who had lost seven straight at Golden State. Anthony missed all four of his shots in a scoreless six minutes before getting hurt.\nFacing Oklahoma City for the third time in Oakland after leaving as a free agent in the summer of 2016, Durant used 14-for-15 success at the free throw line as the main source of his point total.\nDurant had scored 39 and 40 points in his previous two home games against his former club.\nStephen Curry put up 21 points and Klay Thompson 12 for Golden State, which was tipping off a four-game homestand.\nThe loss, which featured the ejection of Warriors forward Draymond Green for drawing two technical fouls, came in Golden State coach Steve Kerr’s 300th game. His record fell to 248-52.\nThe Thunder converted Golden State’s 25 turnovers into 38 points. Oklahoma City entered the game as the league leader in turnovers forced, while the Warriors had committed the league’s fourth-most giveaways.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:34:02.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
