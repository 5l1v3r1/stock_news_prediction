It has said it also plans to form partnerships with German industry, but has not announced any specific partners so far.\nLockheed’s CH-53K, which includes an on-board diagnostic system, is due to make its international debut at the Berlin air show in April.\nThe U.S. Marine Corps plans to buy 200 of the new CH-53K helicopters at an average price of around $88 million per plane and expects to declare it ready for combat use in 2019.\nGermany hopes to start buying its helicopters in 2023, and Israel and Japan have also expressed interest in the CH-53K.\nExperts say the Boeing Chinook could cost Germany less to buy, but it will require upgrades in coming years that could add costs. It also carries less, so it would take more flights to accomplish the same mission as a CH-53K.
