The forest is home to rare species including forest elephants and dwarf chimpanzees.\n“The issuing of new logging concessions sends a clear signal ... that the DRC government is abandoning any pretence at reducing emissions from deforestation,” said Simon Counsell, Executive Director of Rainforest Foundation UK.\nLondon-based campaign group Global Witness, another signatory to the statement, said in a 2015 report that the degradation of Congo’s forests is getting worse due to logging outside of permitted areas and over-exploitation.\nCongo’s former environment minister canceled the logging concessions in question in 2016 following an outcry by environmentalists but the government has chafed against outside criticism and threatened to lift the moratorium altogether.\nLast week, Congo’s oil minister defended the country’s right to explore for oil anywhere on its territory following reports President Joseph Kabila had approved exploration inside Africa’s largest tropical rainforest reserve.\nReporting by Amedee Mwarabu; Writing by Aaron Ross; Editing by Richard Balmforth/Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T23:14:19.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
