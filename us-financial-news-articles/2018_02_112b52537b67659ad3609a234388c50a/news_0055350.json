It proposed raising its dividend and launching a new share buyback worth up to 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.07 billion).\nSwiss Re had said this month it was in talks about SoftBank taking a minority stake in a deal that could be worth $10 billion or more.\nOn Friday it said there was no certainty any deal would be concluded. “Swiss Re’s capital position remains very strong; the issuance of new capital is not under consideration,” it said.
