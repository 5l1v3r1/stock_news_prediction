(\"CEMEX\") (NYSE: CX), announced today that, on a like-to-like basis for the ongoing operations and adjusting for currency fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased by 4% during the fourth quarter of 2017 to US$3.4 billion, and increased 3% for the full year 2017 to US$13.7 billion versus the comparable periods in 2016. Operating EBITDA on a like-to-like basis decreased by 7% during the fourth quarter of 2017 to US$625 million and decreased by 6% for the full year to US$2.6 billion versus 2016.\nCEMEX’s Consolidated Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial and Operational Highlights\nThe increase in quarterly consolidated net sales on a like-to-like basis was due to higher prices of our products, in local currency terms in Mexico, the U.S. and our Europe region, as well as higher volumes in our U.S., Europe and Asia, Middle East & Africa regions. Operating earnings before other expenses, net, in the fourth quarter decreased by 10%, to US$410 million and decreased by 9%, to US$1.7 billion, for the full-year 2017. Controlling interest net loss during the quarter was US$105 million from an income of US$214 million in the same period of 2016. Controlling interest net income for the full year improved to US$806 million from US$750 million in 2016. Operating EBITDA on a like-to-like basis decreased by 7% and 6% during the quarter and the full year, respectively, to US$625 million and US$2.6 billion versus the comparable periods of 2016. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter decreased to 18.3% from 20.7% in the same period of 2016. For the full year, operating EBITDA margin decreased to 18.8% from 20.6% during 2016. Free cash flow after maintenance capital expenditures for the quarter increased by 10% to US$680 million, compared to the same quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, free cash flow after maintenance capital expenditures reached US$1.3 billion and conversion of EBITDA into free cash flow after maintenance capex reached 50%.\nFernando A. Gonzalez, Chief Executive Officer of CEMEX, said, “Although 2017 was a challenging year, our two largest markets, Mexico and the United States, performed well with like-to-like increases in their EBITDA. We also generated free cash flow after maintenance capex of close to US$1.3 billion, with a 50% EBITDA-to-free-cash-flow conversion rate and which, together with our asset-divestment initiatives, resulted in pro-forma debt reduction of close to US$2.1 billion during the year.\n“We had important headwinds during the year: underperformance in Colombia, Egypt and the Philippines as well as increased energy costs, mainly in Mexico. As we have done in the past, we focused on the variables we control to dampen these headwinds and we continued to deliver solid results.”\nConsolidated Corporate Results\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, controlling interest net loss was US$105 million, versus an income of US$214 million in the same period last year.

During 2017, total debt plus perpetual notes was reduced by approximately US$1.7 billion, which represents a 13% reduction from the debt level as of the end of 2016 and a 26% reduction compared to the end of 2015. On a pro-forma basis, including the payment of the 4.75% senior secured notes due 2022 outstanding aggregate principal amount, made on January 2018, total debt plus perpetual notes was reduced by US$2.1 billion during 2017.\nGeographical Markets Fourth-Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet sales in our operations in Mexico increased 6% on a like-to-like basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 to US$781 million, compared with US$701 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
