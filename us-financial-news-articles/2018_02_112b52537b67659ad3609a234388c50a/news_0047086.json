Nonetheless, Quantum assured investors that it would take aggressive action to improve cost structure and generate consistent growth and profitability. According to the complaint, however, the company's financial problems were much more widespread than Quantum had led investors to believe. On February 8, 2018, Quantum announced that it was postponing the release of its fiscal third quarter 2018 results and its earnings conference call, confessing that the company had received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its accounting practices and internal controls related to revenue recognition for transactions beginning April 1, 2016. On this news, Quantum's stock fell nearly 30% to close at $3.90 per share on February 8, 2018.\nQuantum Shareholders Have Legal Options\nIf you would like more information about your rights and potential remedies, contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
