Currently, companies that pay workers the tipped minimum wage, which is lower than the standard minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, cannot pool tips in this way.\nThe proposal on tips is one of several attempts to undo Obama administration labor rules. Federal agencies have taken steps toward repealing rules to extend mandatory overtime pay to 4 million workers and to require companies to report wage data broken down by sex and race.\nThe Trump administration and business groups that support the proposed tipping rule say it will allow employers to redistribute tips to cooks and dishwashers, raising their pay.\nBut critics say that under the proposal, once businesses meet their obligation to pay workers the minimum wage, they could pocket any tips that remain.\nIf the department publishes a final rule that does not include an analysis of how workers would be affected, it could form the basis of a legal challenge, said Christine Owens, the executive director of the union-backed National Employment Law Project.
