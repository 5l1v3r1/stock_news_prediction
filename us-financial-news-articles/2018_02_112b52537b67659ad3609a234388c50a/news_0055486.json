Their new guaranteed offering equips agencies and brand advertisers with the ability to stay ahead of the curve.”\nThe new guarantees are in line with the evolution of the programmatic marketplace, which has shifted emphasis toward effective media and away from simple scale and access to media. Netmining clients interested in purchasing guaranteed media will have the option of buying against different benchmark levels, depending on the metric they’d like guaranteed. Buyers will only pay for media that reaches the guarantee – for example, brands buying around completion rates will not pay for media that fails to help achieve the guarantee.\n“As programmatic continues to evolve, it’s vital that marketers and agencies keep performance top of mind,” said Dean Vegliante, President of Netmining. “Of course, the ongoing evolution has changed the common understanding of performance. Buyers need to achieve their goals for each campaign, and doing so requires more than simply purchasing media. With a team of experienced media managers, we can optimize to ensure that media spend is going toward the goal.”\nAbout Netmining\nNetmining provides intelligent audience targeting, powered by data and shaped by the best analytical minds in the business.
