I switched off from F1,” Ricciardo told Sky Sports television at pre-season testing at a cold and wet Circuit de Catalunya on Wednesday.\n“I think realistically around April things will start to be spoken. After a few races, hopefully I win the first few and I can have a powerful say in what I do.”\nRed Bull already have Dutch driver Max Verstappen under contract until 2020.\nThe 20-year-old is regarded as a world champion of the future, and there has been plenty of speculation about an eventual move to Mercedes or Ferrari.\nMercedes are expected to agree a new long-term deal with four times world champion Lewis Hamilton in the next few weeks but Finland’s Valtteri Bottas has an uncertain future as his team mate.\nSo too does 2007 world champion and fellow-Finn Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari, who have Germany’s four times champion and 2017 runner-up Sebastian Vettel signed up to 2020.\nRicciardo, race winner in Azerbaijan last year, joined former champions Red Bull Racing in 2014 after making his debut with now-defunct HRT in 2011 and racing for Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso for two years.\nThe Australian was fastest on the opening day of pre-season testing on Monday.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T21:13:45.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
