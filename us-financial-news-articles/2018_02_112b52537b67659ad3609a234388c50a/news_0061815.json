The shot found the smallest of openings above the left shoulder of Los Angeles goaltender Jonathan Quick.\nWith exactly one minute remaining and the Kings’ goal empty, Radulov worked hard on the boards just inside the Dallas zone against two Los Angeles players before shooting for the clinching goal.\nDallas outshot the Kings 28-18, won 63 percent of the game’s faceoffs and forged a 41-29 advantage in hits over Los Angeles.\nThe Kings had a three-game winning streak snapped.\nThe game was scoreless after two periods and virtually even statistically, with Dallas holding a 15-13 edge in shots on goal despite recording just two in the first period.\nQuick finished with 26 saves.\nThe Kings continue their three-game homestand when the Edmonton Oilers visit on Saturday. Dallas heads home to host the Winnipeg Jets on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:31:01.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
