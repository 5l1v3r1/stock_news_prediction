McConnell provided a major spark off the bench with his first career triple-double of 10 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds to go along with six steals.\nThe Sixers (29-25) have won eight straight at home to move four games above .500. They also eclipsed last season’s win total.\nMichael Beasley led the Knicks with 22 points while Courtney Lee added 18. Enes Kanter had 17 points and 13 rebounds, and Jarrett Jack chipped in with 11 points.\nThe Knicks struggled with their shooting, most notably going 6 of 24 from beyond the 3-point arc. Tim Hardaway Jr. managed nine points but shot 4 of 16 from the floor and 0 of 8 from 3-point territory.\nPhiladelphia took a 86-79 lead into the fourth quarter. Redick fouled Lee with 0.7 seconds left in the third, and Lee hit both free throws to get the Knicks within seven.\nThe Sixers reeled off the first five points of the fourth to push ahead 91-79 with 9:52 remaining. They kept the pressure up, and Covington eventually followed with a layup for a 93-79 advantage. He missed the free throw on a potential three-point play.\nOn Philadelphia’s next possession, McConnell drove to the basket and made a nifty behind-the-neck pass to Amir Johnson, who missed the layup but knocked down 1 of 2 free throws for a 94-79 edge.\nSimmons attacked the basket and threw down a vicious dunk for a 99-84 lead with 6:36 left.\nSaric sealed the victory with a 3-pointer and a 104-86 lead with 4:23 remaining.\nThe Sixers held a 12-point lead in the first half but saw it sliced to 57-55 by halftime thanks in large part to a sluggish second quarter.\nPhiladelphia guard/forward Justin Anderson sustained a sprained right ankle in the first half. X-rays were negative, though the Sixers announced he would not return to the game.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:38:31.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
