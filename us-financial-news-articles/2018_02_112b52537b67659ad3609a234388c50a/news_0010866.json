He finished 10th overall in the championship.\nThe Malaysian had signed for the Moto2 team managed by Razlan Razali, who runs the Sepang circuit near Kuala Lumpur, but was released last week in an indication of his pending promotion.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T14:34:59.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
