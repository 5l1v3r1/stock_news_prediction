On Wednesday, the company warned 2018 earnings for the segment would be well below historical averages.\nMERGER TALK Schroder declined to comment on market and media reports about Bunge being approached by rivals ADM and Glencore.\nLess than a year ago, Schroder had said he would like to lead consolidation in the global grains industry.\nIn November, Bunge sweetened compensation packages for top executives in the case of a takeover, according to the company’s regulatory filings.\nThe company and other agricultural traders, including ADM and Cargill [CARG.UL], have been trying to diversify into higher-margin sectors such as food ingredients and aquaculture to compensate for the poor returns on their traditional grain handling businesses.\nBunge said fourth-quarter 2017 sales in its agribusiness segment fell 3.5 percent to $7.90 billion even as volumes rose.\nOn an adjusted basis, Bunge earned a profit of 67 cents a share in the quarter, against analyst expectations for $1.37 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company reported a net loss of 48 cents per share, which includes charges related to restructuring.\nBunge took a $66 million charge due to tax law changes in the United States and Argentina.\nNet sales fell 1.6 percent to $11.61 billion.\nAdditional reporting by Anirban Paul in Bangalore.
