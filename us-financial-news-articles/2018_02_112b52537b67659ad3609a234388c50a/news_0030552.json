See a screen shot here:\nA hashtag on Twitter named #UnblockJawar also contained dozens of posts as of Wednesday evening, calling on Facebook to unblock the account.\nHours later Facebook did so.\nAfter CNBC emailed the company asking about the comments on Zuckerberg's post, a Facebook spokesperson sent the following statement:\n\"We're very sorry for this mistake. Our spam-detecting systems incorrectly blocked Mr. Mohammed's account. Once we identified this issue we quickly worked to fix it and have since removed the block,\" the statement said.\nThe account of Mohammed, whose Facebook account identifies him as the executive director of the Oromia Media Network, had earlier this week posted images and videos of politically tumultuous events in Ethiopia.\nA post made Tuesday on Mohammed's timeline included a link to a news report with the headline, \"Ethiopia: Oromia state rocked by protests and killings amid a 3-day market boycott.\"\nAlso Tuesday, he posted pictures of near-empty streets in the eastern city of Harar, which is in the midst of a boycott and protest.\nEthiopia's prime minister resigned Thursday in a bid to quell the protests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T17:34:13.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
