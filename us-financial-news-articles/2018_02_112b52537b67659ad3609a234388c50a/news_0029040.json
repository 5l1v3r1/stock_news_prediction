He said it caused six people to suffer breathing problems and other symptoms indicative of a gas attack.\nTurkey launched an air and ground offensive last month on the Afrin region, opening a new front in the multi-sided Syrian war to target Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.\nTurkish-backed Free Syrian Army fighters are seen in Northern Afrin countryside, Syria, February 16, 2018. REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told Reuters that Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent allies hit the village on Friday with shells. The Britain-based war monitoring group said medical sources in Afrin reported that six people in the attack suffered breathing difficulties and dilated pupils, indicating a suspected gas attack.\nSyrian state news agency SANA, citing a doctor in a Afrin hospital, said Turkish shelling of the village caused choking in six people.\nTurkish-backed Free Syrian Army fighters are seen next to military trucks in Northern Afrin countryside, Syria, February 16, 2018. REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi On Feb. 6, the United Nations called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Syria.\nSince the onset of the conflict in 2011, the YPG and its allies have set up three autonomous cantons in the north, including Afrin. Their sphere of influence expanded as they seized territory from Islamic State with U.S. help, though Washington opposes their autonomy plans as does the Syrian government.\nU.S. support for Kurdish-led forces in Syria has infuriated Ankara, which views them as a security threat along its frontier. Turkey sees the YPG as terrorists and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has waged a three-decade insurgency on Turkish soil.\nReporting by Ellen Francis in Beirut and Rodi Said in northern Syria; Additional reporting by Daren Butler in Istanbul; Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T01:13:39.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
