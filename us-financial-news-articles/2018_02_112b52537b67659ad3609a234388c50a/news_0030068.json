That data includes total Story views, daily reach and engagement metrics, time spent viewing Stories and demographic information. \nThis will help influencers create Stories for a broader audience and snag better advertising deals. Advertisers can access their target audiences more easily now that audience information is available. \nThis is all part of a move to separate the social side of Snapchat from the media side. The newly formatted Discover page shows users content from both publishers and popular influencers, whereas these influencers' content used to be integrated with content from friends. The separation also makes it easier for users to discover new content creators by showcasing them to a broader audience through the Discover page.
