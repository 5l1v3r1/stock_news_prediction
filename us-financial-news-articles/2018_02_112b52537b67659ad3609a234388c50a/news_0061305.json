As CSO, Clark will lead a team of industry-leading security practitioners that will help Netskope customers transform their security strategies to an increasingly cloud-first world. Clark will also leverage his deep security industry expertise and market foresight to help align the company's innovations with the needs of enterprise CISOs.\n\"Enterprise organizations across the world are grappling with how to re-think their technology architecture, processes, and organizational structure in order to fully leverage and take advantage of the benefits provided by the cloud,\" said Sanjay Beri, founder and CEO, Netskope. \"Jason is renowned for his career-long focus on helping the security industry move forward and brings unmatched security and business expertise to Netskope. We are excited to have him and the other CSO team members join the Netskope team and lead the charge on helping our customers and prospects adapt their philosophy to today's cloud-first world.\"\nClark brings decades of experience building and executing successful strategic security programs to Netskope. He was previously the chief security and strategy officer for Optiv, developing a comprehensive suite of solutions to help CXO executives enhance their security strategies and accelerate alignment of those strategies with the business. Prior to Optiv, Clark held a leadership role at Websense, where he was a driving force behind the company's transformation into a provider of critical technology for chief information security officers (CISOs). In a prior role as CISO and vice president of infrastructure for Emerson Electric, Clark significantly decreased the company's risk by developing and executing a successful security program for 140,000 employees across 1,500 locations. He was previously CISO for The New York Times, and has held security leadership and technical roles at EverBank, BB&T and the U.S. Army.\n\"As software and cloud services become entrenched in all corners of the enterprise, we are witnessing a rapid shift toward a world where remote workforces, anytime access to data, and changing perimeters are the norm,\" said Clark. \"Netskope is positioned strongly to enable that shift, and I look forward to working with the team to drive efficiencies, effectiveness, scale, velocity, and maturity in the enterprise security programs of our customers.\"\nJoining Clark in the office of the CSO is Sean Cordero, Head of Cloud Strategy. Cordero brings more than 18 years of information security and IT experience to his role at Netskope. Prior to Netskope, Cordero served as Senior Executive Director, office of the CISO, at Optiv, where he provided executive-level advisement to the company's Fortune 100 clients. Cordero has been a key driver in the cloud adoption space; since 2011 he has led creation of the industry standard control framework for cloud security, the Cloud Security Alliance's (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM). For his contributions to cloud security and adoption, the CSA awarded him the 2013 Ron Knode Service Award for North America and he was inducted in 2016 by the CSA as an Inaugural Research Fellow.\n\"Cloud based technologies provide the greatest opportunity for innovation while also being an area of great exposure for all businesses. We have a chance to leverage them to make long-term, positive change in the security industry. We know what has not worked - it's everywhere in our enterprises. We must have solutions which outpace the rate of change and are designed to handle the realities of today and embrace the future,\" said Cordero. \"I am excited to work with the Netskope team to deliver against the company's unparalleled vision and drive the transformation into how we think and act upon information security risks.\"\nFounded and built by industry veterans with decades of success in enterprise security, Netskope helps the largest organizations in the world take full advantage of the cloud and web without sacrificing security.
