Two of North Korea’s most senior officials will also be there.\nOn Wednesday Pence said Washington will soon impose its harshest-ever sanctions on Pyongyang.\nAfter a year of escalating rhetoric between the Pyongyang and Washington, tensions on the Korean peninsula have eased after the North’s leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year’s address he was willing to open discussions with Seoul.\nSince then the North has agreed to take part in the South’s Winter Olympics with a combined women’s ice hockey team from both sides, and Kim Yo Jong, the 28-year-old sister of the North Korean leader, will attend the opening ceremony.\nSouth Korea wants to use the Olympics to re-engage with North Korea and open the way for talks to resolve one of the world’s most dangerous crises.\nNorth Korea last tested a missile in November, 2017. The intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-15, is believed to be capable of reaching the continental United States, but the North is not yet believed to have the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile.\nReporting by Tim Kelly and Linda Sieg; Editing by Paul Tait and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T06:16:19.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
