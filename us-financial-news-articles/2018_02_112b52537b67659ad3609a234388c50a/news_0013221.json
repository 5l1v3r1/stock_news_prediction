U.S. Treasury yields fell on Monday, as the stocks selloff sparked demand for the low-risk debt, after yields hit four-year highs on Friday.\nUpward pressure on U.S. yields may not be over though as the Treasury is due to significantly increase its borrowing this year to make up for declining purchases from the U.S. central bank and to fund a fiscal deficit widening as a result of the Trump administration’s tax cuts late last year.\n“If you’re still having more of a rally in yields between now and tomorrow’s (stocks) open, that may lead people to think there’s more of a correction to come in equities,” Irigoyen said.\n“If yields stabilize people may be more willing to buy the dip in U.S. equities tomorrow,” this would help underpin emerging equities, he said.\nReporting by Rodrigo Campos, additional reporting by David Randall; Editing by Daniel Bases and Clive McKeef\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:05:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
