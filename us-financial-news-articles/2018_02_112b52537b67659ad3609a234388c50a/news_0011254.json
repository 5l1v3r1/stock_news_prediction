Investors expect the Fed will raise rates in March and policymakers in December signaled three hikes would be warranted this year.\nOn Wednesday, he said he could still support “three or even four” rate increases in 2018 if inflation and other data suggested that would be needed. He told reporters after his speech that recent economic and financial market data suggest there are rising risks that inflation rates could rise. He pointed to rising wages and market-based measures of inflation expectations.\nThe U.S. economy appears to be on solid footing, Evans said, adding that he still expects inflation will hit the Fed’s 2 percent target by the end of 2019 or in 2020.\nReporting by Jason LangeEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T18:27:32.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
