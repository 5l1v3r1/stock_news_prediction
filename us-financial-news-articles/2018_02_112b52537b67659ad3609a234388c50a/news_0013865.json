Fox last week announced a deal to air Thursday Night National Football League games on its broadcast network for the next five seasons. \nTotal revenue rose 4.6 percent to $8.04 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $7.94 billion. \nNet income attributable to shareholders increased to $1.83 billion, or 99 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, from $856 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. \nThe quarter was helped by a $1.34 billion gain from the recent changes to the U.S. tax law. ( 21.cf/2siO7g9 ) \nExcluding items, Fox earned 42 cents per share, topping analysts’ estimate of 38 cents.
