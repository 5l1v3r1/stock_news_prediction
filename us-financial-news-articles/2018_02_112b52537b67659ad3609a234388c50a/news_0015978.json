NTSB officials were not immediately available to elaborate.\nAmtrak President and Chief Executive Richard Anderson told reporters Sunday that CSX was responsible for the wreck because of the locked switch. CSX officials were not available for comment.\nOfficials from both companies expressed condolences to the families of the two people killed, an Amtrak engineer and a conductor.\nTwo of the 116 people injured remained in critical condition overnight, officials said. Specifics were not available.\nA team from the NTSB is expected to be on the scene for five to seven days. No probable cause will be issued at that time, the agency told media outlets.
