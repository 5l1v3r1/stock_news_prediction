Consumer associations and politicians had called for these to be made possible during the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal.\n“That basically gives many diesel car owners the possibility to better advance their interests in future along with consumer protection groups,” Maas told the Funke group of newspapers a day after a court ruled that cities could implement diesel bans.\nThe conservatives and SPD want to form a coalition but the SPD’s members still have the chance to veto that. The results of the SPD postal ballot are due to be announced on Sunday.\nReporting by Michelle Martin Editing by Paul Carrel\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:37:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
