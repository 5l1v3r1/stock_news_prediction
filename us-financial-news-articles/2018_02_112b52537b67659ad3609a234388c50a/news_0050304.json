At least a dozen emergency vehicles responded.\nAbout 100 White House staff were held in a park before authorities began letting some into the White House. Later, the Secret Service allowed staff at the new executive building, as well as the White House, to return to work.\nReporting by Makini Brice, Roberta Rampton, Ginger Gibson and Susan Heavey; Editing by David Alexander, Andrea Ricci and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T15:58:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
