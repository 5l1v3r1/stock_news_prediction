The film, released on Friday in the U.S., grossed an estimated $25 million in its first weekend, out-earning every other film except the decidedly more grown-up Fifty Shades Darker , the final installment of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. \nThe latest update to the classic children’s story features Peter Rabbit engaged in battle with the nephew of his traditional nemesis, the farmer Mr. McGregor. This nephew, as it turns out, has a blackberry allergy, a weakness Peter and his accomplices exploit in one battle scene. The rabbits pelt the younger Mr. McGregor with the berries and one goes into his mouth, causing him to go into anaphylactic shock and administer an EpiPen to himself. \nParents and advocacy groups have taken exception to this portrayal, calling it “allergy bullying” and saying it mocks allergy sufferers. The CEO of Allergy UK told The Telegraph the scene is irresponsible as it doesn’t portray the life-threatening danger of allergies and anaphylactic shock. On Saturday, the U.S.-based Food Allergy Research & Education organization warned on its Facebook page that the scene “might be upsetting” for viewers who have allergies. \nCalls to boycott the film soon took off on Twitter, with people using #BoycottPeterRabbit to air their disappointment. \nWould you laugh at a person with diabetes force fed sugar? No. But that's exactly what you're doing in your movie: continuing to marginalize people with #foodallergies . \nSo throw an allergen at someone? I’m coming for you. #BoycottPeterRabbit \n— ☘️ Jamie ☘️ (@jamiefid) February 10, 2018 As a mother of a toddler allergic to several foods, I am disgusted that Sony would make a joke out of flicking an allergen at a food allergic individual. Doing so is felony aggravated assault! What kind of message does that scene send to kids?! #boycottpeterrabbit \n— hydrogirl71 (@hydrogirl71) February 10, 2018 \nBut others soon began using the hashtag to criticise those encouraging a boycott for being too sensitive. Just read this drivel today, #boycottpeterrabbit people getting offended over kids films. I remember violent cartoons as a child and I don’t recall brutally killing anyone growing up. Have some faith in your kids, breathe, and remember its just a stupid film about talking rabbits \n— Nick Fitzpatrick (@nicknogger) February 11, 2018 \nSony Pictures and the filmmakers have issued an apology for the scene, saying they “should not have made light” of the issue.
