But the incident has been resolved. The head of the Canadian mission has apologized for the behavior of this specialist.” \nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) seemed to acknowledge that an incident had taken place but said it was unclear whether a member of its delegation had been involved. \n“First of all we don’t even know if it is a coach,” Eric Myles, COC Executive Director of Sport, told reporters. \nHe said the delegation had been told it “could be Canada” but it decided to take the matter seriously, sending a note to Canadian team members on expected behavior at the Games and telling the Russians: “‘Hey sorry, if it happens’.” Stanislav Pozdnyakov, chief of mission for the Olympics Athletes from Russia, attends a press conference ahead of the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang , South Korea, February 8, 2018. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard \nMany athletes have called for Russians to be banned from international competition after a 2015 report contained evidence of state-backed, systematic doping in athletics. Later reports alleged the existence of state doping at the 2014 Sochi Games. \nRussia escaped a blanket ban at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and there, too, tensions arose between the Russians and other competitors who branded them cheats. \nThe Court of Arbitration (CAS) is set to deliver a ruling on Friday, the day of the Games’ opening ceremony, on the appeals filed by 47 Russian athletes and coaches over their exclusion from Pyeongchang by the IOC. Two additional appeals were also filed by Russian athletes and coaches, CAS said on Thursday. \nPozdnyakov said he could not comment on the ongoing hearings, but that he would be glad to see additional members of the Russian delegation in Pyeongchang. \nMembers of the Russian delegation must follow an IOC code of conduct preventing them from using the Russian flag and national colors and requiring them to fly an Olympic flag instead. They are also advised against using national symbols on social media. \nIf they follow this code and meet other conditions, the IOC has said it may allow the Russians to use their national flag at the closing ceremony. \nPozdnyakov said the members of his delegation were aware of the code and would comply. \nWhen asked if he expected the Russian tricolor to reemerge at the closing ceremony, he said: “Of course. We do our best.” Additional reporting by Iain Axon; Editing by Mark Bendeich", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:16:01.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
