Petroleum exports rose 24.1% as oil prices recovered from a year earlier, and imports of gasoline and other fuels rose 14.8%.\nNon-oil exports grew 11.6% to $28.4 billion, including a 10.5% rise in shipments abroad of manufactured goods to $26.32 billion.\nImports of intermediate goods, such as components used in manufacturing processes, rose 13% to $26.44 billion, and imports of equipment and machinery were up 18.8% at $3.76 billion. Consumer goods imports excluding petroleum jumped 19.3% to $3.45 billion.\nThe increase in January trade from a year before followed a strong 2017, when Mexican exports increased 9.5% to a record $409 billion and imports grew 8.6% to $420 billion, also a record.\nThe U.S. is the biggest recipient of Mexican exports, accounting for 80%. Mexico had a $71 billion trade surplus with the U.S. last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, up from a $64 billion surplus in 2016.\nNarrowing the deficit with Mexico is among the aims of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump in renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. A seventh round of talks between the U.S., Mexico and Canada is under way in Mexico City this week.\nWrite to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T17:05:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
