The first dividend at the new rate will be paid March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 5, 2018. The previous quarterly dividend rate was $0.1250 per share of common stock.\n“The dividend increase reflects our strong financial performance and ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. In addition, we expect a meaningful impact from the tax reform legislation signed into law in December 2017 and are pleased to share this benefit with the key stakeholders who have been instrumental in our growth and success,” said Stephen H. Marcus, chairman of The Marcus Corporation.\n“The reduction in our effective tax rate will free-up additional cash to invest in our businesses, associates, shareholders and community. In addition to the significantly higher quarterly dividend payment, we have already increased our matching contributions in our 401(k) plan and increased our contributions to The Marcus Corporation Foundation, which invests in deserving programs and projects in our communities,” said Marcus. “We expect to identify additional opportunities to utilize the additional cash to benefit all of our stakeholders in 2018.”\nThe Board of Directors also declared a dividend of $0.1364 per share of the Class B common stock. The dividend on the Class B common stock, which is not publicly traded, will also be paid March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 5, 2018.\nAbout The Marcus Corporation\nHeadquartered in Milwaukee, The Marcus Corporation is a leader in the lodging and entertainment industries, with significant company-owned real estate assets.
