It has also suspended the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC). WELCOME NEWS FILE PHOTO - The Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) is pictured in Lausanne, Switzerland November 15, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse \nAmong those appealing on Friday were athletes who were not sanctioned for doping in their careers and were not named specifically in the investigations but were still excluded from the Games, with the IOC saying the evidence was there as was suspicion of wrong-doing. \n“These decisions come as welcome news for WADA as they will, for athletes and all others worldwide that care for clean sport and the integrity of the Games,” said World Anti-Doping Agency chief Craig Reedie. \nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said on Friday the CAS ruling was understandable but disappointing. \n“It was difficult for CAS to render a decision on the backdrop of past pressure,” Mutko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. “Had they been cleared, it would have been a shock. The Olympics have started. We need to support the team. There are promising athletes.” \n“We support the guys who did not go. There will be competitions for them. And begging for invitations all the time is beyond reasonable,” he said. \nThe IOC had been criticised in 2016 for not banning Russian from the Rio de Janeiro Games following the information provided by three whistleblowers who essentially exposed Russian doping.

The IOC and CAS have been complicit in enabling Russian doping,” Walden said in a statement. \n“I am confident that today’s decision is mostly a reaction to the outcry from clean athletes against Olympic corruption and complicity. I hope IOC President Thomas Bach is listening. For the sake of the Olympic ideal, he needs to resign.” \nThe Games officially open later on Friday and run to Feb. 25.
