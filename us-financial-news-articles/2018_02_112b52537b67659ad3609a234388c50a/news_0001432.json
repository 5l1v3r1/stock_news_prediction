I would think people like Rolex and Heineken wouldn’t have girls there who weren’t presentable.”\nAustria’s retired triple world champion Niki Lauda, who won his titles in the 1970s and 1980s and is also a non-executive director of champions Mercedes, denounced what he saw as a “decision against women” and hoped it could be reviewed.\n“Where is this leading to?” he asked Austria’s Der Standard newspaper. “If you follow through like this, you soon won’t have any cheerleaders anymore in the U.S.”\nAdditional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in Vienna, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:23:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
