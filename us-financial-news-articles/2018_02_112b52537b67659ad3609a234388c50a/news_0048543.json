With Hanyu, we had nearly 50 bags of stuffed animals, short and long (programmes) combined. It took about three minutes to clear the ice.”\nSlideshow (3 Images) Yun agreed that tidying up after Hanyu was hard work.\n“We had so many to pick up for Hanyu, so all of us went out to the ice after his performance. I had fun doing it together with all my friends,” she said.\n“I can see all these great skaters right before my eyes, it’s amazing. We leave the bags of gifts so they can come and pick them up later.”\nKang likes Korean skaters like Cha Junhwan, who competed in men’s singles at Pyeongchang, and Kim Yuna, who achieved legendary status in her homeland when she won gold at Vancouver in 2010 and silver in Sochi in 2014.\nKang’s friend Oh Yoo-jin, also 11, likes American Nathan Chen and Russian skaters like Evgenia Medvedeva and Alina Zagitova.\nAnd then, of course, there is Hanyu.\n“He is good at jumping and does everything else so well,” Kang said.\nAnd being a flower kid may be just the start.\n“I am here dreaming that one day I could be on an Olympics stage myself,” Oh said.\nWriting by Elaine Lies, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T12:20:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
