BMO Capital Markets recently revised its 12-month forecast for GBP-USD up to $1.52, and Berenberg forecast $1.45 by the end of this year. While a stronger currency is harmful for export competitiveness, for the U.K. this development appears welcome.\n\"Unlike other central banks, the BoE should be welcoming a stronger currency as it aides their efforts to return inflation back towards target,\" Hardman said.\nMany observers have long been calling for a rate rise to help bring inflation closer to the government's target rate of 2 percent. The U.K. in November suffered its highest inflation in half a decade at 3.1 percent, coming down ever slightly to 3 percent for December, hinting that the squeeze on British living standards may gradually begin easing.\nIn December, the IMF delivered a grim report card on Britain's economy, blaming Brexit for the country's slow growth in comparison to a broadly based global upswing. GDP growth for 2017 was 1.8 percent, the lowest in five years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:43:20.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
