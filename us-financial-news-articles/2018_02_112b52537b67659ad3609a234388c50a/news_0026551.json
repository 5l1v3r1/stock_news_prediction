They said the study indicates that North Americans may be more vulnerable than previously understood to such infections.\nIf the worms remain in a person’s eye for a prolonged time, they can cause corneal scarring and even blindness, according to the researchers.\n“Cases of eye worm parasitic infections are rare in the USA, and this case turned out to be a species of the Thelazia that had never been reported in humans,” said study lead author Richard Bradbury, who works with the CDC’s Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria.\nThelazia gulosa, a type of eye worm appears in a handout photo provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), February 8, 2018. CDC/Handout via REUTERS Bradbury said previously it was thought there were only two different species of these eye worms that infected humans worldwide, and that Thelazia gulosa is now the third.\nThe researchers said the woman noticed a small, translucent worm in her left eye after experiencing irritation. Her frequent outdoor pastimes during the summer months exposed her to the infection, they added.\nSlideshow (2 Images) She was from the city of Gold Beach, located on Oregon’s coast along the Pacific Ocean about 40 miles (65 km) north of the California border.\nPrevious cases of such eye worm infections have been reported worldwide, predominantly in Europe and Asia and in rural communities with close proximity to animals and with poor living standards, the researchers said.\nEye worms are found in a variety of animals including dogs, cats and certain wild carnivores.\nReporting by Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Scott Malone; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T01:50:19.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
