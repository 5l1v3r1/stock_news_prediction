(\"RSI\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of American Woodmark, for up to $460,000,000 in aggregate principal amount (the \"Tender Cap\") of RSI's 6Â½% senior secured second lien notes due 2023 (the \"RSI Notes\"), and the related solicitation of consents (the \"Consent Solicitation\") to amend the indenture governing the RSI Notes (the \"RSI Indenture\") and to release all of the collateral securing the RSI Notes.\nAmerican Woodmark used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with borrowings of $250 million under its delayed draw term loan facility and cash on hand, to fund the previously announced conditional partial redemption and the \"make-whole\" redemption of the RSI Notes, each as described below, and the payment for RSI Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer, to repay approximately $30 million of revolving loans under its senior credit facilities and to pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing.\nRSI today accepted for purchase, and paid for, $449,118,000 in aggregate principal amount of RSI Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 9, 2018 (the \"Consent Date\"). The Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m. on February 26, 2018, unless extended by RSI (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the \"Expiration Date\"). Subject to the Tender Cap and the other terms and conditions of the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation as described in the Offer Documents (as defined below), RSI Notes that are validly tendered after the Consent Date but on or prior to the Expiration Date and are accepted for purchase by RSI will be paid for on the final settlement date (the \"Final Payment Date\"), which currently is expected to be February 27, 2018.\nAs previously announced, pursuant to the Consent Solicitation, RSI obtained the requisite consents from holders of the RSI Notes to adopt the amendments to the RSI Indenture as described in the Offer Documents and to release all of the collateral securing the RSI Notes.\nPrior to the commencement of the Tender Offer, RSI issued a notice of conditional partial redemption for $115 million in aggregate principal amount of the RSI Notes at a redemption price of 103.000% of the principal amount of the RSI Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date of February 26, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of certain financing conditions. RSI today notified the trustee for the RSI Notes that the conditions to the conditional partial redemption have been satisfied.\nRSI also issued a notice of redemption today for any RSI Notes that will remain outstanding as of February 28, 2018, at a \"make-whole\" redemption price of 105.061% of the principal amount of the RSI Notes being redeemed, as determined in accordance with the RSI Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date of February 28, 2018. As a result, the aggregate principal amount of RSI Notes purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer and redeemed pursuant to the \"make-whole\" redemption will be equal to the Tender Cap.\nRSI also satisfied and discharged its obligations under the RSI Indenture today by irrevocably depositing with the trustee for the RSI Notes funds sufficient to redeem the RSI Notes pursuant to the conditional partial redemption and the \"make-whole\" redemption and to pay related fees and expenses.\nThe Notes are being offered by the initial purchasers solely to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities law and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\nThe Tender Offer and the Consent Solicitation are being made solely pursuant to the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated January 29, 2018, and a related Letter of Transmittal and Consent (together, the \"Offer Documents\"), which more fully set forth the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer and the Consent Solicitation.\nHolders may contact the Tender Agent and Information Agent for the Tender Offer and the Consent Solicitation, D.F.
