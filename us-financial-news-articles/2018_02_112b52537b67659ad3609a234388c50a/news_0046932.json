It has been prescribed to me after testing for respiratory problems in Slovakia in 2017,” Jeglic said in a statement.\n”Unfortunately, I forgot to declare it as a therapeutical exception. I have overlooked the difference between comparable drugs, which are allowed and would enable me to use it for my respiratory problems during the Olympics.\n“I apologize for my negligence to all the persons involved, and I accept the further anti-doping procedures.”\nThe case is the third positive test at the Pyeongchang Games following a Japanese reserve speed skater and Russia’s bronze medal-winning curler Alexander Krushelnitsky.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann,; Editing by Peter Rutherford and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T12:20:55.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
