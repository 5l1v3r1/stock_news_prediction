It is an unsustainable strategy which adds to the weight of suspicion and negative sentiment about the company. Transnet must act on the Werksmans report,” she said.\nTransnet’s spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.\nCiting leaked documents and emails, amaBhungane, a group of non-profit investigative journalists, reported last year the Gupta family and its associates influenced the awarding of the locomotive contract in return for 5.3 billion rand in kickbacks.\nAllegations of corruption in state firms escalated last year after amaBhungane began reporting on more than 100,000 leaked emails and documents which they say show the Gupta family was using its links with the then-president Jacob Zuma to win state contracts.\nZuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.\nReporting by Tiisetso Motsoeneng; Editing by James Macharia\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T12:21:24.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
