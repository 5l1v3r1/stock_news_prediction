Anaya resigned from the party in December to pursue the presidency in an alliance with the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).\nIf Meade fails to gain traction, the election could turn into a head-to-head contest between Lopez Obrador and Anaya.\nOf 1,000 people surveyed in the poll, 31.4 percent said they believe Lopez Obrador will become Mexico’s next president, up from 25 percent in January. That compared with 23.4 percent who see Meade winning, and 20.7 percent that believe it will be Anaya.\nVoters with both the highest and lowest levels of education favored Lopez Obrador, the poll showed.\nThe survey was conducted Feb. 9-11 and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\nReporting by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Daina Beth Solomon and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T16:54:50.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
