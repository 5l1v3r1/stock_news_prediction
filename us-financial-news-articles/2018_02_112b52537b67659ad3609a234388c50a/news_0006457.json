Sources told Reuters that VMware was likely to form a special committee to consider a combination with Dell.\nRound Rock, Texas-based Dell went private five years ago in a $24.9 billion deal with private equity firm Silver Lake.\nDell said on Friday that nothing had been decided and that the company might end up continuing to operate under its current structure.\nShares in VMware, which is 82-percent owned by Dell, were up less than 1 percent at $126.50 on Thursday.\nVMware said it would not speculate on the outcome of Dell's review.\n\"The board of directors follows sound corporate governance practices, and will continue to do so in connection with any potential transaction involving our controlling stockholders,\" VMware's lead director Paul Sagan said in a company statement.
