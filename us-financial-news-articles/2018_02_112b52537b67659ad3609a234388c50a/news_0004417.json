It came after the U.S. Department of Justice in January revoked an Obama administration policy that discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing marijuana-related crimes in states that had legalized the drug. * Technology company Open Text Corp was the biggest gainer, closing up 12.7 percent after reporting a 35 percent increase in second-quarter revenue and seeing ratings upgrades by several analysts. * Technology and consumer cyclicals were the sectors with the biggest gains, while industrials posted the biggest losses. * Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Canopy and Aphria; Bombardier Inc , down 2.3 percent at C$ 3.40; and Ivanhoe Mines , losing 3.1 percent to C$3.41.
