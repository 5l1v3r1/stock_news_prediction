TIM is discussing with the government ways to implement the decree, which gives Rome special powers over companies of strategic national importance.\n“Vivendi has waited until now as a dialogue with the government is open (on the matter),” the source told Reuters, adding that this was a “technical step that had to be made”.\nThe source added that given ongoing talks between TIM and the government, Vivendi had ruled out an appeal to an Italian administrative regional court.\nReporting by Giulia Segreti,\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:28:11.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
