The 30-stock index briefly traded flat earlier in the session. The Dow also broke below 25,000 and erased its 2018 gains.\n\"Breaking the early lows of the day means the correction could go on for longer,\" said Art Cashin, UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe S&P 500 pulled back 3 percent to break below 2,700. The broad index had traded positive earlier on Monday as the tech sector briefly rose. The S&P 500 also traded down more than 5 percent from an all-time high set last month and broke below its 50-day moving average, a key technical level.\n\"As soon as we broke the 50-day moving average ... we saw volatility spike,\" said Jeff Kilburg, CEO of KKM Financial. \"It's just been downhill from there.\"\nThe Nasdaq composite declined 2.4 percent after rising as much as 0.5 percent. Earlier gains in Apple and Amazon helped the tech-heavy index trade off its lows.\n\"We're not used to getting washouts like this anymore,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"The buy-the-dip mentality that has taken over hasn't allowed for that.\"\n\"This sell-off, in the bigger scheme of things, is not that big.
