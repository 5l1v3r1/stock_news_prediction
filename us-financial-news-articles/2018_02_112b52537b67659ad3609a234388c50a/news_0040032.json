I am speechless.”\nGoepper left it late but saved his best for last, jumping up from nowhere into second place with a 93.60 effort on his final run.\nSpeaking after the final, Goepper said he changed his initial plan once the high quality of the field became evident.\n“I made a couple of minor mistakes (on the first two runs) so I knew that even if I landed the final jumps I wouldn’t be in medal contention so I decided to conserve my energy and lay it all out on the third run,” the 23-year-old said.\n“I knew that the calibre of my third run would put me in the top three. There were some really good guys still to drop, so it was a nail-biting moment waiting at the bottom.”\nBRINGING OUT THE BEST His team mate Gus Kenworthy, a silver medallist four years ago as part of a United States podium sweep, failed to record a clean run and finished 12th and last in the final.\nSweden’s Oscar Wester, who top-scored in qualifying with 95.40, was another medal candidate who failed to deliver a clean run in the final.\nBeaulieu-Marchand, 49th in the World Cup rankings, was a surprise bronze medallist, his 92.40 second run leaving him looking stunned as he stood on the podium.\nThe 23-year-old said the Olympic final had drawn out the best performance of his career.\n“I think I am a third-place kind of guy,” joked Beaulieu-Marchand, who has never finished higher than third at a World Cup event. “Today was the best day of skiing I have ever had in my life.”\nThe Canadian edged Great Britain’s James Woods into fourth place by just 1.40 points.\nWoods was the only competitor to score 90 points or over on multiple runs but as only the top score counted towards the final result, he missed out on claiming a second skiing bronze for Britain at these Games.\nCompatriot Izzy Atkin won bronze in the women’s ski slopestyle on Saturday.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:47:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
