Last week it suffered its worst weekly performance since 2013.\nOther cryptocurrencies also suffered double-digit declines in their prices on Monday, according to industry tracker Coinmarketcap.com.\nBritish bank Lloyds Banking Group said on Sunday it was banning customers from buying bitcoin using credit cards.\nIt joined U.S. banking giants JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup who announced similar bans on concerns the lenders could be held liable when the volatile currencies plunge in value.\nAnd on Monday, India said it was planning steps to make virtual currencies illegal within its payments system and to regulate the trading of crypto assets.\n“Cryptocurrencies have seriously fallen out of favour since the middle of December and constant negative news flow and speculation of increased regulation has exacerbated the move lower, much in the same way that the constant flow of positive news stories aided the explosion higher,” Craig Erlam, an analyst at currency broker Oanda, said.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee and Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Sujata Rao and Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T17:24:48.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
