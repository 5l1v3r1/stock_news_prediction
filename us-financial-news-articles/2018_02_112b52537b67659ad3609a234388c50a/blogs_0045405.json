The goals are very much the same.\" \nThat's something the couple is reminded of everyday, thanks to a wedding gift from Bill's parents: A sculpture of two birds side by side.

That's how you actually grow. And so we will have tough conversations.\" \nThe key is to have those tough conversations in private, she adds: \"It's just like a family, with your kids. You show up as a united front. And so in business, we show up as a united front.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T23:19:35.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
