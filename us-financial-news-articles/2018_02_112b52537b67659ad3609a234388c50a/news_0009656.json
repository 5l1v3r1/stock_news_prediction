McDowell said this would not diminish the importance of the capacity already booked from Azerbaijan. \nThe 870-km pipeline will join up with the Trans Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) at the Turkish border, crossing Greece, Albania and the Adriatic Sea. Its shareholders include Azerbaijan energy group Socar, oil major BP and Italian gas group Snam. \nMcDowell said he hoped the EIB’s stamp of approval would smooth the way for the 4.5 billion euro ($5.57 billion) pipeline to seek further financing from the market in the coming weeks. \nTAP has said the final shipment of pipes were delivered in the autumn and are ready to lay. \nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is also expecting to decide on a loan for TAP this year, a spokesman said. In October, it approved a $500 million loan for the TANAP pipeline, through which the first gas flows are expected in 2018. \nBut TAP has been dogged by delays because of protests against it in Italy. \nCampaign groups have also questioned the wisdom of pumping more gas into the EU as the bloc seeks to increase the share of renewables in its energy mix. \nThey have said that funding the Azeri-backed project would go against the EBRD and EIB’s principles. \nThe EIB says it has listened to civil society groups and carried out due diligence on the project.
