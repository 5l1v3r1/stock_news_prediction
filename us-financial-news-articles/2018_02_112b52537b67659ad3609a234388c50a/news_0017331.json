It said the results of a review of its troublesome projects would be published on Monday.\nThe company’s string of earnings downgrades come despite record migration driving the biggest building boom in living memory in New Zealand. Cost blowouts have been blamed on a fast-moving labour market that can turn once-profitable contracts into liabilities as wage bills balloon.\n“People are just getting paid some silly money at the moment” as builders bid wages higher and higher to lure the workers they need, said Kevin Everett, Managing Director of Auckland-based agency Building Recruitment.\nBricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, electricians and even unskilled “hammer hands” can command top dollar, with qualified builders’ hourly rates jumping as high as NZ$50 to NZ$60, he said.\nIndustry-wide costs for non-residential construction rose by half between 2015 and 2017, according to project management firm Rider Levett Bucknall.\nHAMMERED Fletcher, which has two major projects under construction in Auckland and Christchurch, previously warned of cost overruns in March, July, and October 2017. Each time, the blowouts went beyond expectations, shaking investors’ confidence in company forecasts and management.\nShares in the company have lost a quarter of their value in 12 months, and Fletcher is one of the worst-performing stocks on the New Zealand index. Fletcher shares were in a trading halt on Thursday pending the Monday review.\n“I think the company had a view that they’d drawn a line under this last year, but clearly not,” said Andy Bowley, head of research at investment firm Forsyth Barr.\nFletcher has NZ$725 million in borrowings due to be repaid between 2020 and 2022, according to Thomson Reuters Loan Connector data. The company gave no further details about its debts on Thursday.\nIt is due to report half-year results on Feb. 21.
