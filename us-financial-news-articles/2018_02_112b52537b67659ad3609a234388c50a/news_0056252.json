The message came just hours after the North’s state media said it would “never have face-to-face talks” with the U.S. \nThe conflicting signals came as Kim Yong Chol — a North Korean general who isn’t related to leader Kim Jong Un — met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in for about an hour in the South Korean ski resort of Pyeongchang, where the Closing Ceremony was held. \nPyongyang’s overture, as relayed by Seoul, appears to indicate a shift in the North’s attitude toward dialogue with the U.S., and comes not long after Pyongyang backed out of a planned meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and Kim Jong Un’s sister at the Games, according to the White House. \n“The North Korean delegation said that North Korea is fully willing to talk to the U.S. and agreed that North-South Korean relations cannot be separated from North Korea-U.S. relations,” South Korea’s presidential Blue House said in a statement. A spokesman declined to elaborate. The White House said Sunday it would wait to see if Pyongyang’s statement was genuine.
