As a nationally recognized scholar on issues of diversity and equity in higher education and K-12, Robert has served as an award winning STEM teacher in Detroit, a tenured professor of education and African & African American Studies at Loyola University Maryland, and the Director of the Center for Innovation in Urban Education. Robert has spoken across the country and authored over 40 publications.\n\"My long-standing commitment to service stems from my parents attending Spelman and Morehouse colleges, my mother working in the public library system in Detroit for over 20 years, and the challenges and mental incarceration I faced during my father's life in and out of prison. This dedication to service, combined with my devotion to increasing opportunity for young people — both in and out of the classroom — has been the focus of my career for decades. I am eager to continue this important work at Service Year Alliance where, together with the service year sector, we can empower the next generation of young Americans to come together in service to our communities and country,\" said Robert Simmons III, President of Service Year Alliance . \"With deep cultural differences currently threatening to divide us, the need for a bold solution is urgent. Fortunately, a service year can bind diverse young Americans together in common purpose. I look forward to continuing to explore the transformational impact that service year experiences have on young people and our society in my new role.\"\nAs President, Dr. Simmons will spearhead fundraising, business development, and public relations efforts at Service Year Alliance, while also bringing his passion and expertise in youth empowerment, race, and equity to the service year field.\n\"We are delighted to welcome Robert to Service Year Alliance where his experience, passion, and dedication to our mission comes at a pivotal moment for our organization,\" said Shirley Sagawa, CEO of Service Year Alliance . \"Never before has national service had the potential to play such a vital role in overcoming serious challenges facing our country.

A service year before, during, or after college gives young people the chance to transform their lives, make an impact in their community, and become the active citizens and leaders our nation needs. Expanding service years, with programs like AmeriCorps, the Peace Corps, and YouthBuild, has the power to revitalize cities, uplift and educate children at risk, and empower communities struggling with poverty.
