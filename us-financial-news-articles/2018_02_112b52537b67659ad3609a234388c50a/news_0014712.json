DENGUE VACCINE \nSanofi announced in November that Dengvaxia - the world’s first dengue vaccine - might increase the risk of severe disease in people who had never been exposed to the virus. \nA Philippine government agency on Monday filed a lawsuit against Sanofi, seeking compensation for the parents of a 10-year-old girl the agency said had died as a result of receiving Dengvaxia. \n“The Dengvaxia question of course is very worrisome to us. But we have not seen any reaction similar to the one in the Philippines in other countries,” Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt told journalists. \n“We are worried with this insistence of trying to link some deaths of children with the vaccine, something we have absolutely no evidence of,” he said. \nDengvaxia has been approved in almost 20 countries. It is currently under review by European health regulators. \nSanofi’s fourth-quarter business net income fell 10.8 percent at constant exchange rates to 1.33 billion euros. Total sales rose 4.1 percent to 8.7 billion euros. \nAnalysts polled by Reuters in partnership with Inquiry Financial had on average been expecting business net profit of 1.46 billion euros and net sales of 8.7 billion.
