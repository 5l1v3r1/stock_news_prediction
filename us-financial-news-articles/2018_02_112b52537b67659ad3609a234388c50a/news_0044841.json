Net cash provided from operating activities was $217 million for full year 2017.\nIn 2017, global vehicle manufacturers awarded Visteon new business of $7.0 billion in lifetime revenue, with a record $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter wins included all-digital instrument cluster wins with three global automakers – including the company’s first all-digital cluster win in Japan – as well as a software-only Phoenix ™ win in Europe. The ongoing backlog, defined as cumulative remaining life-of-program booked sales, was $19.4 billion as of Dec. 31, 2017, up from $16.5 billion at the end of 2016, an increase of 18 percent.\n\"We finished the year strong, delivering our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin,\" said President and CEO Sachin Lawande. “We accomplished our key strategic priorities for 2017, including strengthening the core business, achieving double-digit sales growth in China, and developing the DriveCore ™ Level 3-plus autonomous driving platform. By winning a record $7 billion in new business, we made excellent progress toward our 2017-18 target of $12 billion in new business. Our 2017 performance keeps us on track to meet our long-term growth targets.\"\nFourth Quarter in Review\nVisteon Corporation\nFourth-quarter sales were $797 million, compared with $816 million for the same period in 2016. The $19 million decrease is primarily related to the exit of Other operations and customer pricing, partially offset by Electronics product launches and favorable currency.\nGross margin was $140 million, compared with $129 million a year earlier. The $11 million increase reflected higher gross margin related to the Electronics Product Group. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $64 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $57 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, driven primarily by higher information technology investments.\nNet income attributable to Visteon was $25 million or $0.79 per diluted share, compared with $2 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the same period in 2016. 2017 fourth-quarter net income included $4 million of restructuring and $34 million of other expense primarily related to the divestiture of certain European assets, partially offset by $9 million in income associated with discontinued operations including a non-income tax settlement.\nElectronics Product Group\nSales for the Electronics Product Group totaled $797 million, a decrease of $6 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily related to customer pricing reductions, partially offset by new product launches and favorable currency impacts. On a regional basis, Asia accounted for 43 percent of sales, Europe 31 percent, North America 23 percent, and South America 3 percent.\nGross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $140 million, compared with $129 million a year earlier. The $11 million increase reflected the impact of improved engineering and material efficiencies, partially offset by customer pricing and unfavorable currency impacts.\nAdjusted EBITDA, as defined below, for the Electronics Product Group was $102 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $98 million for the same quarter last year. The improvement was primarily driven by favorable cost performance including material and engineering cost efficiencies, partially offset by customer pricing and unfavorable product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, 60 basis points higher than the prior-year.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net income was $16 million or $0.51 per diluted share, compared with net income of $20 million or $0.60 per diluted share for the same period in 2016. The decrease in net income included the 2017 loss on divestiture of certain assets in Europe, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring expenses year over year. Adjusted net income (as defined below), which excludes these items, was $52 million or $1.64 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $52 million or $1.55 per diluted share for the same period in 2016.\nOther Operations\nBy the end of 2016, Visteon exited its Other operations, consisting of climate operations in South America and South Africa. The company did not have sales or adjusted EBITDA related to the Other operations in 2017. The fourth quarter of 2016 included sales of $13 million and net income of $7 million. Going forward, the company does not expect sales or adjusted EBITDA for the Other operations.\nCash and Debt Balances\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, Visteon had cash and equivalents totaling $709 million.

presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's performance that management believes is useful to investors because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company's operating activities across reporting periods. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to the Company adjusted to eliminate the impact of depreciation and amortization, restructuring expense, net interest expense, loss on divestiture, equity in net (income) loss of non-consolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on non-consolidated affiliate transactions, other net expense, provision for income taxes, discontinued operations, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and other gains and losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Estimated December 31 December 31 Full Year Total Visteon 2017 2016 2017 2016 2018 Electronics $ 102 $ 98 $ 370 $ 346 Other — (2 ) — (9 ) Adjusted EBITDA 102 96 370 337 $370-$380 Depreciation and amortization 25 22 87 84 90 Restructuring expense, net 4 27 14 49 10 Interest expense, net 4 2 16 12 15 Equity in net (income) loss of non-consolidated affiliates (1 ) 1 (7 ) (2 ) (7) Loss on divestiture 33 — 33 — — Loss (gain) on non-consolidated affiliate transactions\n— 1 (4 ) — — Other expense, net 1 7 2 24 — Provision for income taxes 14 3 48 30 55 Net (income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (9 ) 25 (17 ) 40 — Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 5 4 16 16 15 Non-cash, stock-based compensation expense 3 2 12 8 20 Other (2 ) — (6 ) 1 — Net income attributable to Visteon $ 25 $ 2 $ 176 $ 75 $172-$182\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31 December 31 Electronics 2017 2016 2017 2016 Adjusted EBITDA $ 102 $ 98 $ 370 $ 346 Depreciation and amortization 25 22 87 84 Restructuring expense, net 4 26 14 37 Interest expense, net 4 2 16 12 Equity in net (income) loss of non-consolidated affiliates (1 ) 1 (7 ) (2 ) Loss (gain) on non-consolidated affiliate transactions — 1 (4 ) — Loss on divestiture 33 — 33 — Other expense, net 1 6 2 10 Provision for income taxes 14 14 48 41 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 5 4 16 16 Non-cash, stock-based compensation expense 3 2 12 9 Other (2 ) — (6 ) — Net income $ 16 $ 20 $ 159 $ 139 (Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (9 ) 25 (17 ) 40 All other loss (income), net of tax — (7 ) — 24 Net income attributable to Visteon $ 25 $ 2 $ 176 $ 75 Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and does not purport to be a substitute for net income as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. In addition, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) as a factor in incentive compensation decisions, (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company's business strategies, and (iii) because the Company's credit agreements use similar measures for compliance with certain covenants.\nFree Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow : Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow are presented as supplemental measures of the Company's liquidity that management believes are useful to investors in analyzing the Company's ability to service and repay its debt. The Company defines Free cash flow as cash flow provided from operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company defines Adjusted free cash flow as cash flow provided from operating activities less capital expenditures, as further adjusted for restructuring and transformation-related payments. Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow include amounts associated with discontinued operations. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31 December 31 Total Visteon 2017 2016 2017 2016 Cash provided from operating activities - Electronics $ 82 $ 86 $ 213 $ 198 Cash provided from (used by) operating activities - discontinued operations and other 4 (4 ) 4 (78 ) Cash provided from operating activities total Visteon $ 86 $ 82 $ 217 $ 120 Capital expenditures (30 ) (19 ) (99 ) (75 ) Free cash flow $ 56 $ 63 $ 118 $ 45 Restructuring/transformation-related payments 2 19 30 113 Adjusted free cash flow $ 58 $ 82 $ 148 $ 158\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31 December 31 Estimated Electronics 2017 2016 2017 2016 Full Year 2018 Cash provided from operating activities $ 82 $ 86 $ 213 $ 198 $235 - $255 Capital expenditures (30 ) (20 ) (99 ) (74 ) 100 - 95 Free cash flow $ 52 $ 66 $ 114 $ 124 $135 - $160 Restructuring/transformation-related payments 6 13 34 43 25 - 20 Adjusted free cash flow $ 58 $ 79 $ 148 $ 167 $160 - $180 Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be a substitute for cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools as they do not reflect cash used to service debt and do not reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses. In addition, the Company uses Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow (i) as factors in incentive compensation decisions and (ii) for planning and forecasting future periods.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share : Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share are presented as supplemental measures that management believes are useful to investors in analyzing the Company's profitability, providing comparability between periods by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of recurring business operating results. The Company believes management and investors benefit from referring to these supplemental measures in assessing company performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. The Company defines Adjusted net income as net income attributable to Visteon adjusted to eliminate the impact of restructuring expense, loss on divestiture, gain on non-consolidated affiliate transactions, other net expenses, discontinued operations, other gains and losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations and related tax effects. The Company defines Adjusted earnings per share as Adjusted net income divided by diluted shares. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31 Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31 Net income attributable to Visteon: 2017 2016 2017 2016 Electronics $ 16 $ 20 $ 159 $ 139 Other/discontinued operations 9 (18 ) 17 (64 ) Net income attributable to Visteon $ 25 $ 2 $ 176 $ 75\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Electronics Other/\nDiscontinued\nOperations Total\nVisteon Electronics Other/\nDiscontinued\nOperations Total\nVisteon Diluted earnings per share: Net income attributable to Visteon $ 16 $ 9 $ 25 $ 159 $ 17 $ 176 Average shares outstanding, diluted (in millions) 31.7 31.7 31.7 32.2 32.2 32.2 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.51 $ 0.28 $ 0.79 $ 4.94 $ 0.53 $ 5.47 Adjusted earnings per share: Net income attributable to Visteon $ 16 $ 9 $ 25 $ 159 $ 17 $ 176 Restructuring expense, net 4 — 4 14 — 14 Loss on divestiture 33 — 33 33 — 33 Other expense, net 1 — 1 2 — 2 Gain on non-consolidated affiliate transactions — — — (4 ) — (4 ) Other (2 ) — (2 ) (6 ) — (6 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax — (9 ) (9 ) — (17 ) (17 ) Adjusted net income* $ 52 $ — $ 52 $ 198 $ — $ 198 Average shares outstanding, diluted (in millions) 31.7 31.7 31.7 32.2 32.2 32.2 Adjusted earnings per share $ 1.64 $ — $ 1.64 $ 6.15 $ — $ 6.15 *Tax impacts of adjustments less than $1M.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Electronics Other/\nDiscontinued\nOperations Total\nVisteon Electronics Other/\nDiscontinued\nOperations Total\nVisteon Diluted earnings per share: Net income attributable to Visteon $ 20 $ (18 ) $ 2 $ 139 $ (64 ) $ 75 Average shares outstanding, diluted (in millions) 33.5 33.5 33.5 35.4 35.4 35.4 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.60 $ (0.54 ) $ 0.06 $ 3.93 $ (1.81 ) $ 2.12 Adjusted earnings per share: Net income attributable to Visteon $ 20 $ (18 ) $ 2 $ 139 $ (64 ) $ 75 Restructuring expense, net 26 1 27 37 12 49 Loss on non-consolidated affiliate transactions 1 — 1 — — — Other expense, net 6 1 7 10 14 24 Other — — — 1 — 1 Tax impacts of adjustments (1 ) — (1 ) (1 ) — (1 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax — 25 25 — 40 40 Adjusted net income $ 52 $ 9 $ 61 $ 186 $ 2 $ 188 Average shares outstanding, diluted (in millions) 33.5 33.5 33.5 35.4 35.4 35.4 Adjusted earnings per share $ 1.55 $ 0.27 $ 1.82 $ 5.25 $ 0.06 $ 5.31 Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be a substitute for profitability. Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share have limitations as analytical tools as they do not consider certain restructuring and transaction-related payments and/or expenses. In addition, the Company uses Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nSource:Visteon Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PmuHzoljpFiluNUtL9378BDkWNVQiNF-QCE1SxnVCsfTOlOGb_hmqVqp3JlBVCpGb6tXnut0qulnsncmCnkImGftkr0n8KZGqSwtXG3eear59omtK8l_02RhTGjIo2cs", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PmuHzoljpFiluNUtL9378KFRuzhaMcfuvcjN96zT44mfxYVAp_OhO7h41tZab5Yop-g7HuSTgb5wvQL2XoME3ZapPX-HWmEbTd3Jp61fZUUzFjIRCi_oC8DkioGycNgGrCvu2Ew2Xtc65uvCOvTgrA==", "http://twitter.com/visteon", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3DXcphCE5jmubhNk1Xz1fkD9gDyGiji9fxd_QJfJbEublVMZ1ab_69cpXuVmlffpJdCID2kArfaXPBvVjqfp596WIk0vSIfdgOV-ei4w5SQ=", "http://www.youtube.com/user/visteon?feature=results_main", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3DXcphCE5jmubhNk1Xz1fjTMQl7LLVJD_PYJQWxCYst_vgiW-WiUV9lS9yQWk_YNDvua667OG0xezCWAYH151F-hcooGHzPMyj2EIg58R4b9d9J93Qwkl0V4D0-h-T5iVMgxqmV8SliZhoncVsmb8GFPbV14QtRgDOzBhDCiNNREhwOf29LpVcDgNdHmvyjH", "http://i.youku.com/u/UNDgyMjA1NjUxNg==?spm=a2h0k.8191407.0.0", "https://plus.google.com/+visteon", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3DXcphCE5jmubhNk1Xz1fmCy2uPYjUUoCCqqu3_YToq_s9DsZMHUwch0lZXsvlj-BzQqdgn_FTjnvzIxZIYe3lhU6E0FCNQuXTas_e4XXrM=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uzj21fZzhXM6joEaHrfdweE0oI9yNSZBQqpXI44AADTgM1YPW4-LZVhoxHz257tIqzNXGFGE_PeNngDKPkHmqFixjQQCvmd-zbzWQRoliY7tWVyRsvI-m5ptSaQdxrfC", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HJr7CQurlP-Ml6LHyJOfbZRyNywwruXjk_gGTDZQq6nSUaeqb14AE_wZyP7ozD4SYuAoHLgjBhFbjeuSqhndig==", "http://blog.visteon.com/", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PmuHzoljpFiluNUtL9378Nd2dUBwJFcPrdG-1jYJfwJ9ChBaKKlvR-VhOGW4cSLnLWA_DFQLAmE_hJMCn1hPJo8uqfT4hk0Hjs0YH_gXFdJzWCbdzDvTHsJ-alBDXoTb", "https://www.instagram.com/visteon/", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CsHBOYPJBHWxs66EUeAL1sZOtN4E6ch8SjSM-7IhfbQ7jbFNWX3C_yaFU-0ScQrx2d9LBRGM6T9xtDGgrO1OWJOeSKhmTsOCBe5c_bZxfl8=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3DXcphCE5jmubhNk1Xz1fuXdVmA8VwYgvvA3HLjk4R-GuzwZfqEPrdP_nWBLY1ZAHDO1gBehbUG08Y4ha0anfkSWKCXkhJ6QfXS0sC_5JSdGlXyq926VKZmKoV4zry17lnLxRU8wrPdovRvzPCNxwg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/99a3b9d7-ad10-43d7-a6fc-7cd925c6770b", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3DXcphCE5jmubhNk1Xz1fiZohwhcRsrjky7hc1dxgtwIRVUxOTFQMYpE3AdliK_WtuW08ar55gXdXWh5VoEdyWhkJHeoaO8mIjIrzCZ-2VvUiOqEcbtCzRieMygX93teTMqDdC6UxsXvsD3stey5_nLDs9vmVeZGuZCFEEfWebDaXn3A8z4FdqXv36vJT5Yh", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3DXcphCE5jmubhNk1Xz1fl64CJ1W1J1B8I0psGjn6sS7b7S3bpcvPG37GcLCm6RPhHITeQD0c0vHaUgl535RrmvJzRGyAKuoAQagvldbStSjTFSlyjXD-wads1qylamT2cD5yIiMl35xtWqVMMjZMg_yJ-6Ozkkrgo93ffjAviWkmMtca8dPhvzlGxUH8xG2Xh-2KH0qwW4rqykSBaCMO48K2uJ5npYdF25zCY9Zgniiyw-TQj6sSAuRkyB2CQE_YQprvgmIQHZxsrQKKX7GvjlSWCuwApo4OpieLao9FJtAm3uQVSA1HSM2YJSUyqvETj7Xc0-Shldsln2REukQec91-zZ6aD7MY-0ZgxTTYJWpMkO6jLUyY2tyT2k1ZUOnTheHT4c1nF_n5-Pca0aTuM9z-QXjPSoMNeUJTZpDpwQ=", "http://www.linkedin.com/company/2865?trk=vsrp_companies_res_photo&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId:522343161373310041683,VSRPtargetId:2865,VSRPcmpt:primary", "https://www.facebook.com/VisteonCorporation", "http://www.slideshare.net/VisteonCorporation"], "published": "2018-02-22T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:46:47.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
