ISOLATED \nA growing number of workers in the south Indian garment hub have been suspended or dismissed within days of joining unions or attending events primarily to demand the implementation of revised minimum wages, campaigners and union leaders said. \nA landmark 2016 court ruling declared that garment workers should receive a pay rise of up to 30 percent and that they could claim arrears going back to 2014. \n“We have increasing number of workers coming to our office and saying they were forced to sign resignation letters, but in fact, need the job to support their families,” said Sujata Mody, of Penn Thozhilalargal Sangam, a women workers’ union. \n“Women are suddenly finding themselves unemployed for taking leave to care for a sick family member or if they are found talking to a union member and sometimes even if they happen to have a pamphlet that talks about their rights.” \nMody co-authored a report funded by the International Labour Organization (ILO) which found grievance redressal mechanisms in India’s garment industry were “virtually absent” in factories. \nIt said garment workers in Chennai who raised issues were “isolated” and kept under the watch of human resource officials. \nThe ILO says freedom of association is a “human right” and encourages companies not to discriminate against workers joining or forming unions. \nThe study also criticized factory committees, saying they rarely have guidelines to address workers’ complaints. \nCampaigners say factories are resistant towards workers joining external unions. Like most factories, Celebrity Fashion does not recognize the Garment and Fashion Workers Union (GAFWU), which Murugesan has joined. \nRoy said the union did not have the support of employees. \n“This external union is not able to represent the grievances of our employees in a fair and correct manner to ensure proper redressal,” he said. \nMody said management prefer taking cases before the government’s labor department for conciliation talks but this could mean workers traveling up to 50 km (30 miles) to attend, making it difficult to sustain protracted struggles. \nBut Murugesan is ready for the fight. \n“My co-workers - many are also friends - have been instructed not to talk to me by the managers,” she said. \n“They are scared of losing their jobs and so I hope that my voice is heard and we all get justice.” Reporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Katy Migiro.
