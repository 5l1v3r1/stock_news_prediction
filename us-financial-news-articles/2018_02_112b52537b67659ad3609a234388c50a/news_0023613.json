A second 911 call led deputies and police to an apartment in Paintsville, where three people were found fatally shot, including the gunman, the statement said. \n“This has been a horrific murder spree,” Price said. “There are no words to describe the heartbreak in seeing four lives taken due to the actions of one man. I have worked in law enforcement for 34 years. This is one of the most disturbing acts of violence I have ever seen.” \nOfficials identified the gunman as Joseph Nickell, but no other information about him was made available. \nThe victims were identified on Sunday by Kentucky State Police as the suspect’s mother, Arlene Nickell and his father, James Nickell, killed at the rural home. Also killed, at the apartment in Paintsville, were his girlfriend, Lindsey Vanhoose, and her mother, Patricia Vanhoose. \nThe shooting came about three weeks after the state was rocked by a high school shooting in Benton, where two students were killed and 18 students wounded by a fellow student, who remains in custody.
