In addition to tech support from IBM, they will receive mentorship and guidance on NHS operations and market penetration.\nReporting by Tova Cohen; Editing by Steven Scheer\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T16:16:05.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
