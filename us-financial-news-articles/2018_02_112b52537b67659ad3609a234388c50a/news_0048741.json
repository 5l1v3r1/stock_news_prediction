But for many, staying afloat financially is a lesser-known hurdle as they ski, skate, jump, flip and twirl their way to gold.\nHere are the athletes competing in the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea — and one former Olympian — talking about all things money: how they make ends meet; the financial products they use; and their money stressors, challenges and sacrifices.\nMore from NerdWallet:\nSoFi review: refinancing student loans and borrowing parent loans\nThese 9 students customized their journey to a career\nHow apprenticeships work and how you can land one\nStacey Cook, alpine skiing Age: 33\nHometown: Mammoth Lakes, California\nOlympic experience: Four-time Olympian (2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018).\nHow she earns a living: Sponsorships with businesses including Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in Mammoth Lakes; prize money; and income from the duplex that she owns and rents out.\nHow funding on the ski team works: The U.S. ski team covers ski and travel costs for the top U.S. skiers — a group called the A team, which Cook is on. Athletes on lower-level teams, some of whom still make it to the Olympics, have to pay to be on the team.\nHow sponsorships work: Each contract is unique, but athletes typically earn sponsor money in two ways, Cook says. There's a retainer, or a sum an athlete gets paid for signing a sponsor contract; and performance incentives, or money an athlete gets based on his or her ranking in the sport.\nJust for fun: She enjoys listening to podcasts including NPR's quiz show, \"Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me\" and the \"BiggerPockets Podcast,\" which is about real estate investing.\nJohn K.

He had 37 cards at one point, he says.\nHow he tackled his debt: Coyle consolidated it and worked with a debt settlement company to negotiate down the total amount he owed. But although that strategy works for some people, debt settlement is risky . Chapter 7 bankruptcy or a debt management plan are almost always better options.\nJust for fun: Coyle is a speaker, author and NBC analyst. He'll be in Pyeongchang for the final 10 days of the Olympics doing features for NBC and live broadcasts on his Facebook page, \"John K.
