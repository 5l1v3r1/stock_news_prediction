Carvalhao Gil was given two sentences, one for spying and one for corruption, according to Lusa, which also cited his defense lawyer as saying he would appeal against the decision.\nThe court was not immediately available for comment.\nCarvalhao Gil was arrested in Rome while selling classified documents relating to the European Union and NATO to the Russian agent. He was subsequently extradited to Portugal.\nItaly refused to extradite the Russian man to Portugal and he was later released and returned to Russia, according to Portuguese prosecutors.\nReporting by Axel Bugge, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:35:28.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
