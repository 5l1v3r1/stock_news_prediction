The peak year was 2011, when pirates launched 237 attacks and held hundreds of hostages, data from the International Maritime Bureau shows.\nSeveral foreign navies, including from the European Union and China, operate regularly in the area as part of anti-piracy missions.\nReporting by George Obulutsa; Editing by Alison Williams and John Stonestreet\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:38:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
