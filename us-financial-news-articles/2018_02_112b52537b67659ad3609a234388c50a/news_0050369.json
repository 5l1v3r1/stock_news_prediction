HPE forecast a range of $1.35 to $1.45 EPS for fiscal 2018, whereas analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS of $1.18. \nHewlett Packard Enterprise’s report comes at a key moment for the company. \nCEO Meg Whitman stepped down February 1, handing over the reins to the president and veteran executive Antonio Neri, making the company’s first quarter her last. When Whitman announced her impending departure in November, shares tanked 6 percent, despite an earnings beat. \nWhitman, who served as CEO since 2011, oversaw the company’s split into two brands. She remained CEO at the newly streamlined Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where she prioritized cloud services and spun off product and consumer hardware to HP. Her tenure at HPE saw a ramping up of acquisitions — eight in the last two years.

This could mean a mix of internal investments, partnerships with or acquisitions of smaller companies.
