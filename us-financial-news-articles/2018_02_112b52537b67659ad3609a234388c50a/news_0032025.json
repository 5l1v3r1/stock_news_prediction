It wasn’t the judiciary who brought me here, but the President himself,” Demirtas said.\nDemirtas, who won votes beyond his Kurdish core constituency in recent elections, faces up to four years in jail on the charges of insulting Erdogan.\nThe HDP, the third-largest party in the Turkish parliament, denies authorities’ accusations of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebel group, which has been fighting government forces in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The group is deemed a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and Europe.\nThe opposition party has been hammered by a crackdown that followed an abortive coup in Turkey in July 2016. As many as 5,000 of party members have been detained, HDP says, while several of its lawmakers have also been stripped of their parliamentary status.\nThe hearing will continue on Thursday and Friday.\nReporting by Ece Toksabay\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T22:35:40.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
