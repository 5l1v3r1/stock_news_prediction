Our focus on operational execution in general and growing our mass and premium mass businesses specifically has been rewarded with the Group reporting full year revenue of $62.5 billion, up 18% year-on-year and record full year Adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 billion, up 37% year-on-year.\nOur Q4 2017 Adjusted EBITDA outperformed the market by growing 40% year-on-year and 18% quarter-on-quarter to a record $4.2 billion. This represents our 8 th consecutive quarter of year-on-year EBITDA growth despite the opening of competitive new capacity.\nOn 23 August 2017, Macau experienced Typhoon Hato, the most devastating typhoon in more than 50 years and I am very proud of the fact that the GEG Foundation and the Lui Che Woo Foundation contributed a total of MOP60 million in support of individuals and organizations in need as a results of the typhoon. Additionally, many GEG team members contributed significant hours and effort to help support the community. Macau demonstrated its resilience with the entire community working together to rebuild the city.\nDuring 2017, Macau experienced the first annual gaming revenue growth in recent years. Gross gaming revenue grew 19% year-on-year to $258 billion. Total visitations were 32.6 million, up 5% year-on-year. More importantly, overnight visitors grew at a faster rate of 10% year-on-year.\nDuring 2017, the Group paid two special dividends of $0.26 and $0.33 per share. Subsequently we announced another special dividend of $0.41 per share to be paid on or about 27 April 2018, a 58% increase compared to April 2017. This confirms our commitment to return capital to shareholders, whilst maintaining an exceptionally strong and liquid balance sheet to fund our growth development pipeline and international expansion ambitions.\nOur balance sheet remains one of the strongest in global gaming with cash and liquid investments of $41.4 billion and net cash of $31.7 billion. Our stable cash flows combined with a strong balance sheet provides us with great flexibility in funding our development pipeline and international expansion opportunities. These include Cotai Phases 3 & 4, Hengqin, Japan and Boracay in the Philippines.\nDuring the year, the Macau Government set new standards for financial reporting. We welcome these higher levels of reporting which will bring greater transparency and understanding to the Macau gaming market. Regionally, the Central Government's policy of the Belt and Road initiative and the Greater Bay Area integration plan will drive the macro economy and further increase visitation to Macau.\nI am confident in the medium to longer term outlook for Macau and this confidence is based upon the continued solid economic performance of Mainland China and the significantly underpenetrated tourist markets in China and Asia. Additionally, the opening of new properties in Macau in 2018 and the launch of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge should stimulate growth in the shorter term period.\nWe are committed to continue to support the Macau Government's vision to develop Macau into a World Centre of Tourism and Leisure as demonstrated by GEG's Cotai Phases 3 & 4 and our planned development in Hengqin. Further we fully support the Central Government's Belt & Road initiative as evidenced by our proposed beach front resort development in Boracay, Philippines.\nI would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all of our committed team members who continue to deliver exceptional customer experiences and 'World Class, Asian Heart' service every day.\"\nMarket Overview\nDespite increased competition both in Macau and regionally, combined with a number of geo- political events occurring globally during 2017, we are encouraged to see that Macau is experiencing a continued market recovery. Gross gaming revenue for 2017 was $258 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Q4 2017 gross gaming revenue was $70.3 billion, up 20% year-on-year and up 8% quarter-on-quarter.\nDuring 2017, visitation to Macau was 32.6 million, up 5% year-on-year. Visitors from Mainland were 22 million, up 9% compared to 2016. In particular, overnight visitors grew at a faster rate of 10% year-on-year. New hotel capacity has successfully grown overnight visitation. We view this trend as very positive as overnight visitors have a higher spend per customer than day trippers. The average length of stay of overnight visitors was 2.1 days in 2017.\nInfrastructure continued to progress in 2017. The opening of the new Taipa Ferry Terminal and the additional train lines to Zhuhai added to the high speed train network help make it easier to visit Macau. We look forward to the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge which will further enhance the appeal and accessibility to Macau for both Chinese and International visitors.\nOn the regulatory side, the Macau Government set new standards for financial reporting which helps to bring greater transparency. The revised smoking bill was passed in 2017 and operators will enhance standards of their smoking lounges on the main gaming floor and install smoking lounges into VIP rooms no later than 1 January 2019, thereby enhancing the work place environment.\nGroup Financial Results\nFull Year 2017\nThe Group posted revenue of $62.5 billion, up 18% year-on-year, and generating Adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 billion, up 37% year-on-year in 2017.

In the short term, the Mainland Chinese economy has been performing solidly while new Macau property openings in 2018 should further stimulate tourism demand. In addition, the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge will significantly improve accessibility for international travelers who arrive by air via Hong Kong. In the medium to longer term, tourist markets in Mainland China and Asia remain dramatically underpenetrated, offering opportunities for significant growth in tourism, leisure and travel.\nGEG is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this growth trend thanks to having the largest landbank and development pipeline in Macau with Phases 3 and 4. Additionally, GEG is the only concessionaire with plans for development on Hengqin. We also look forward to international opportunities, such as Boracay Island in the Philippines and an integrated resort in Japan. We will continue to offer guests a \"World Class, Asian Heart\" experience with a focus to drive profitable volumes, yield results, and attract higher spending customers.\nThe Macau Government's initiative of building Macau into a World Centre of Tourism and Leisure continues to progress. New hotel capacity has increased overnight visitation to Macau who have a higher spend per customer than day trippers. Meanwhile, the Central Government's Belt and Road initiative and the Greater Bay Area integration plan will further increase visitation to Macau and drive the macro economy. On the regulatory side, the Macau Government has set new standards for financial reporting that will help bring greater transparency and international understanding of the Macau gaming market. We are committed to invest in Macau's economic diversification and support the Macau Government's vision. We also support the Central Government's Belt & Road initiative as demonstrated by our proposed development in Boracay, Philippines.\nNotes:\n[1] The primary difference between statutory revenue and management basis revenue is the treatment of City Clubs revenue where fee income is reported on a statutory basis and gaming revenue is reported on a management basis.
