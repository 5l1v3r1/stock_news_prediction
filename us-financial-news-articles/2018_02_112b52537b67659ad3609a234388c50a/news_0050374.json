Though softening his tone in recent months, he has been a longstanding skeptic of the energy market opening.\nTrevino is due to meet executives from Bank of America, Citigroup and Credit Suisse [CSAG.UL] as well as other firms, Pemex said in a statement.\nHe will emphasize Pemex’s commitment to Mexico’s energy opening, and to strengthening its finances during the meetings on Feb. 26-27, the company said.\nDavid Ruelas, who was named Pemex’s chief financial officer on Friday, will also take part in the talks.\nThe Mexican oil company, which suffered a sharp decline in crude output last year, is scheduled to present its financial results for the fourth quarter on Monday.\nReporting by Noe Torres; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T23:54:02.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
