The official requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter. \nTemer is expected to issue a decree on Tuesday creating the Ministry of Public Security, which will take over the running of Brazil's federal police and other law enforcement agencies from the Ministry of Justice. \nLast month, the federal government ordered the army to take over command of police forces in Rio de Janeiro state as authorities try to control violence and crime driven by heavily armed drug gangs that control many of the metropolitan area's slums.
