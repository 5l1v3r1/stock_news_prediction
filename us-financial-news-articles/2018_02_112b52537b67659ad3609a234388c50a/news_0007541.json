That was below the market consensus of $4.22 per share, according to Cowen and Co analysts.\nThe forecast assumes higher interest expenses related to some new projects, Chief Executive Edward Breen said on a call with analysts.\nThe company, however, expects to see strong growth trends in 2018.\n“In developed economies in particular, such as the United States, Germany, France, Canada and the U.K., we continue to see strong leading indicators of broad-based growth,” Executive Chairman Andrew Liveris said in the results statement.\nThe chemicals giant said it raised prices by about 5 percent across markets in the fourth quarter, while volumes - a proxy for demand - rose 6 percent.\nNet sales in the quarter were $20.1 billion versus comparable net sales - which the company terms “pro forma” sales - of $17.7 billion a year earlier.\nThe company also said it was pushing ahead with its plans to split into three separate units, starting with the Materials Science business by the end of the first quarter of 2019. Agriculture and Specialty Products are expected to follow by June 1, 2019.\nCurrently trading at a market value of about $177 billion, Dow and DuPont completed the $130 billion merger in September.\nThe merger was welcomed by investors as a way to streamline the companies’ sprawling operations by combining overlapping businesses.\nDowDuPont now expects to save $3.3 billion from the merger, slightly more than the $3 billion it had estimated earlier.\nThe company saw a $1.1 billion benefit from lower U.S corporate taxes in the fourth quarter, but still posted a net loss of $1.2 billion from continuing operations, largely due to merger-related costs.\nAdjusted for the tax benefit and other one-time items, the company said it earned 83 cents per share. Wall Street was expecting 67 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting by Nivedita Bhattacharjee; editing by Patrick Graham and Anil D'Silva\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T13:15:27.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
