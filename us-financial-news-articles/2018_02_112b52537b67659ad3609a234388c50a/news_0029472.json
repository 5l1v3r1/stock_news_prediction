Magic guard Mario Hezonja missed a deep 3-point attempt on the next possession, and LaVine made a pair of free throws to seal the outcome.\nChicago led by 18 points with 8:23 remaining in the fourth quarter before Orlando stormed back with a 23-3 run to grab a 98-96 lead with 3:11 to go. Hezonja, who sparked the comeback bid with 14 points in the fourth quarter, finished with 24 points to lead the Magic.\nRookie forward Lauri Markkanen scored 21 points on 9-for-19 shooting to lead the Bulls. LaVine finished with 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Forward Bobby Portis contributed 19 points off the bench.\nChicago earned its second win in the past three games. The Bulls improved to 13-15 on their home court, compared with 7-21 on the road.\nMagic forward Evan Fournier finished with 22 points on 9-for-16 shooting. Fournier has scored at least 20 points in three consecutive games and 21 times overall this season.\nSimmons added 14 points for Orlando, which has lost back-to-back games after winning the previous three.\nChicago opened up a 93-75 lead after Denzel Valentine sank a pair of free throws. Orlando stormed back behind the hot hand of Hezonja, who hit a jump shot and a pair of 3-pointers to give the Magic the lead.\nThe Bulls established a 53-51 advantage at halftime. Markkanen led the team with 13 points in the first half.\nBulls guard Kris Dunn missed his 11th game in a row as he continues to recover from concussion-like symptoms. Dunn has returned to practice and could be available Wednesday against the Toronto Raptors.\nThe Magic played without Aaron Gordon (hip), Nikola Vucevic (hand), Jonathan Isaac (ankle) and Terrence Ross (knee). Gordon recently withdrew from the NBAâ€™s upcoming slam dunk contest because of his injury.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:43:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
