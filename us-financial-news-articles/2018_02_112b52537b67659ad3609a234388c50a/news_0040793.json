MexusGold S.A. de C.V.’s operating partner, MarMar Holdings, has informed Mexus that 8.2 oz of gold was produced in a test run and subsequently sold. Mexus was hoping for more production having tests from the heap leach pad showing an average of 4.1 grams per ton Au. It is the belief of Mexus that the head engineer for MarMar, who was previously running the mine, may have introduced chemicals to the pad which has made recovery difficult. As previously stated, MarMar has brought in a new engineer whom they believe has the experience and knowledge to correct the issues. Mexus advisors Robert Garcia and Cesar Lemas both agree that this engineer does have the necessary skills to get the job done. This particular manager is making necessary adjustments to the leach pad and is confident that he can recover the gold.\nMexusGold MX, a wholly owned subsidiary of MexusGold US, continues to work towards production at the fully permitted Ures property in Hermosillo, Mexico. President of MexusGold MX, Cesar Lemas, and advisor Elias Badilla continue to assay and map the property to determine the best area to begin mining. Their assaying is showing 5 to 10 grams Au per ton. The VAT gold recovery system is currently under construction in Walnut Grove, CA. It is expected that this system will be completed within a week at which time it will be shipped to Mexico. The VAT system is capable of holding 100 tons of material and the contained material will leach in approximately 72 hours with a 76% or higher recovery rate. The operation will take 4 men to load and unload the ore and process the resulting material. Mr. Lemas plans to do 200 tons a week seeking an average of 5 grams per ton Au. This would provide 32 oz of gold per week at a cost of $150 per oz produced. An additional tank will be moved on site once the initial system is running efficiently which will lower the cost per oz and increase production.\nMexus CEO Paul Thompson added, “The Santa Elena results to date are disappointing. We were expecting to be producing a significant amount of gold by now. I’m hopeful that MarMar will get the job done as we know that there is gold on the leach pad and on the property in general. I will get updates to our shareholders as we receive additional information. I’m optimistic that MarMar has the right staff on site to get the gold from the leach pad. We are pushing forward with our other properties and the outlook for these is extremely promising. You can see that our first target is the Ures property. Getting production from this property will give Mexus the much needed revenue stream to allow for a build out on all of our properties.”\nAbout Mexus Gold US\nMexus Gold US is an American based mining company with holdings in Mexico.
