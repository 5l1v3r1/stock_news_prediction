Morgan chief global strategist David Kelly told CNBC on Wednesday. \nMinutes from that meeting, held Jan. 30-31, were released on Wednesday . They indicated the Fed sees increased economic growth and an uptick in inflation as justification to continue to raise interest rates. \n\"Three weeks is a long time in monetary policy,\" Kelly said in an interview with \" Power Lunch \" shortly after the minutes were released. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images Jerome Powell, nominee to be chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, testifies during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, November 28, 2017. \nFor one, there wasn't a budget agreement. The budget , which President Donald Trump signed into law on Feb. 9, includes a $300 billion boost in spending on military and domestic programs. \n\"That budget agreement is highly stimulative. Also the risk of a government shutdown is gone. Also, we had a wage scare. Also, we had a CPI [Consumer Price Index] inflation scare. So however these minutes read, I think the Fed is more hawkish today,\" Kelly said. \nFears about inflation, which eats away at corporate profit margins and could force the Fed to hike rates faster than it anticipates, helped fuel the recent stock market sell-off. \nKelly said that \"unless there is some shock\" he expects there will be four rate hikes this year.The market currently expects around three rate hikes for 2018, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. \nKelly expects this more hawkish tone to be on display in Fed Chair Jerome Powell 's first semiannual address to Congress, which starts Feb. 28. Powell took the helm of the central bank earlier this month. \nDanielle DiMartino Booth, president of Money Strong and a former advisor to the Dallas Federal Reserve, agreed there's a possibility there will be a \"sea change in the message from the Fed when Powell goes up in front of Congress next week.\" \nTherefore, the market may start upping the chance of more rate hikes this year, she told \"Power Lunch.\" \n— CNBC's Jeff Cox, Patti Domm and Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report. show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T23:09:38.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
