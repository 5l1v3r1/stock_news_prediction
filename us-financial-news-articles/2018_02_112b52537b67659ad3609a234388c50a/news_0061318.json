January’s announcement by the bank of executive moves makes her an even more likely contender. \nIn one respect, Lake would be a historic choice, the first female chief executive of one of the largest U.S. banks. A single mother of three young children, Lake has already become a role model for women in finance, juggling a high-profile job and family demands. \nIn her first year as CFO, 2013, Lake won praise for her handling of the fallout from the bank’s 2012 “London whale” trading loss. She is well known to investors and analysts, a fixture on the bank’s quarterly earnings calls who sometimes acts as a diplomatic foil to her outspoken boss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T14:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T14:05:57.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
