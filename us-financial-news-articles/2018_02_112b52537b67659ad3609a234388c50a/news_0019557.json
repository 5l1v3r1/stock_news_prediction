In Europe, organic revenue was up 2.1 percent, while the rest of the world saw a 4 percent rise.\nThe company’s long-time Chief Executive Richard Cousins, who said in September he would step down from the top job, died in a seaplane crash on the New Year’s eve, forcing Compass to advance the date Dominic Blakemore’s appointment to Jan. 1.\nCousins, who led Compass over the past 11 years, was due to step down in March after being widely credited with turning the company’s business around and making it into one of the best-performing firms on UK’s blue chip index.\nLast month, France’s Sodexo, the world’s second-biggest catering services company, posted lower-than-expected lower quarterly sales, but said it would achieve its full-year targets.
