He said the force would quickly identify troubling price rises to expedite investigations.\nU.S. Senator Chuck Schumer has recommended that the White House nominate one of his top aides, Rebecca Slaughter, to the second Democratic seat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:56:55.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
