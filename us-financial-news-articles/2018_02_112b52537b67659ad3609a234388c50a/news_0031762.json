Excluding this non-cash expense, we would have reported a net income of $164,039, for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\"\nSecond Quarter Financial Highlights:\nAchieved gross margin of $58,270 on total revenues of $105,088, or approximately 55% Accumulated cryptocurrency assets with market value of $43,786 and cash reserves of $17,730 resulting from sales of mining rigs at December 31, 2017 Net cash proceeds from the sale of investments of $579,460 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 Investment in cryptocurrency mining equipment and supporting assets in excess of $310,000 Increase in total assets from $296,280 at June 30, 2017 to $508,105 at December 31, 2017, or an increase of approximately 71% Decrease in total liabilities from $504,210 at June 30, 2017 to $214,946 at December 31, 2017, or a decrease of approximately 57% Positive stockholders' equity of $293,159 at December 31, 2017 Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company had retired and highly dilutive warrants, previously issued to convertible debt holders Eliminated remainder of the convertible debt through share exchange, using OTTV shares and conversion to the common stock Completed an equity based capital raise in the amount of $160,000 by selling a preferred restricted stock Received $720,000 in net proceeds from sale of 462,900 restricted common shares of the Company at $1.62 per share and a three-year warrants for the purchase of 347,175 shares of the Company's common stock, at an exercise price of $2.16 per share.\nThe Company had purchased or assembled in excess of $288,000 of mining rigs and the number of installed miners had reached 125.
