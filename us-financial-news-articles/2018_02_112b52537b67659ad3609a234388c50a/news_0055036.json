Corporate tax is 10 percentage points lower in Albania while VAT is four percentage points lower.\n“I hope a little part of the 20 billion euros in the hall stays in Albania, not only because Albania is growing but also because Italians feel at home,” Rama said, referring to the net worth of businesses present.\n“We would like Albania to be a little, efficient, Italy,” said Rama. “Our ambition is to industrialize Albania in the Italian style,” his economy minister, Arben Ahmetaj, said.\nFabrizio Maggioni, sales manager for specialist electric train and tram maker Mont-Ele, said the sprawling Albanian capital Tirana of 800,000 people might need its services.\nAlbania wants to build a train line to Tirana airport and to its biggest port, Durres, around 40km west of the capital.\n“The kind of traffic we saw last night means this city would need a tram over time,” Maggioni told Reuters.\nItalian butcher Raffaele Tonon told the gathering he was sceptical about grandiose plans for investment, saying the country that abandoned communism 25 years ago needed a more practical focus.\n“We have to teach the youth the skills of trades, be it in meat and milk processing or whatever,” Tonon said. “I have seen businesses who left because of this.” (Reporting By Benet Koleka, Editing by Jon Boyle)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:13:48.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
