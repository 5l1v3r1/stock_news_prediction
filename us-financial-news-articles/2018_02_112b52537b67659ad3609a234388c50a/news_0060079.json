German media reported it happened in December.\nGerman security sources said authorities had been aware of the incident for some time, but the Defence Ministry and the German military were not affected.\nJens Zimmermann, the Social Democrats’ (SPD) spokesman for digital issues, said the German parliament’s Digital Agenda committee had agreed unanimously to hold an extraordinary meeting, likely to be on Thursday.\n“The federal government must inform parliament comprehensively,” he tweeted.\nGerman Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen declined to comment about the reports during an appearance in London.\nNews of the attack on German government computers comes after repeated warnings by German intelligence officials about possible meddling by Russia in last year’s federal election.\nThe head of the German domestic intelligence agency last year said such attacks had not occurred, but the risk of interference remained until a new government is in place.\nGermany’s Social Democrats are voting by postal ballot on an agreement to form another “grand coalition” with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, with the results to be made public on Sunday. If they reject the tie-up, Germany could face new elections or the formation of a minority government for the first time in its post-war history.\nWestern governments and security experts have linked the hacking group known as APT28 or Fancy Bear to a Russian spy agency, and have blamed it for operations including an attack on the Democratic National Committee ahead of the 2016 U.S. elections and the German lower house of parliament in 2015.\nGerman officials have blamed APT28 for the May 2015 hack of the German lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, and other cyber attacks aimed at political groups, Merkel and other individuals, or institutions.\nMoscow has previously denied in any way having been involved in cyber attacks on the German political establishment.\nTop German intelligence officials have urged lawmakers to give them greater legal authority to “hack back” in the event of cyber attacks from foreign powers.\nAdditional reporting by Sabine Siebold and Thorsten Severin; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T18:45:45.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
