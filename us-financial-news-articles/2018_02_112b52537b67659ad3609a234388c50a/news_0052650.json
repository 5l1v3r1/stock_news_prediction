He skated back towards the blue line and fended off Colorado defenseman Samuel Girard as he headed to the net.\nDraisaitl then eluded Nathan Mackinnon and Mikko Rantanen en route to the crease and made a cross-ice pass to McDavid just in front of Semyon Varlamov. McDavid finished it off by burying a shot over Varlamov for his fourth career overtime goal.\nDraisaitl and Zack Kassian scored in the second period for Edmonton, which is 5-0-1 in the last six meetings with Colorado.\nGirard and Colin Wilson scored for Colorado.\nEdmonton’s Cam Talbot made 28 saves while Varlamov turned aside 43 shots.\nThe Oilers broke through on Varlamov 2:45 into the second on their 22nd shot thanks to Draisaitl’s individual effort. He gained possession in the lower left corner and headed towards the blue line before approaching the net from the right side.\nDuring his move, he skated around Nathan Mackinnon and Mikko Rantanen, spun past Gabriel Landeskog and lifted a backhander into the net.\nEdmonton took a 2-0 lead nearly 12 minutes later when Kassian put a rebound of Mark Letestu’s shot by Varlamov.\nColorado scored with 18.9 seconds left when Girard’s slap shot from the left point sailed past Talbot’s glove moments after a turnover by McDavid behind the net. The Avalanche forged a 2-2 deadlock on Wilson’s wrist shot from the low slot 50 seconds into the third after Tyson Jost’s pass from the corner ricocheted off Oscar Klefbom’s skate.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T13:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:48:53.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
