Probably, there will be some difficulties.” \nA representative for Melnichenko later said he was referring to the impact on Russian business in general. Melnichenko was among dozens of Russian billionaires, officials and heads of state companies included on the U.S. list. \nThe list was drafted by the U.S. Treasury Department in line with a sanctions package signed into law last year, but Washington said inclusion on the list did not imply people named were, or would be in the future, subject to any restrictions.
