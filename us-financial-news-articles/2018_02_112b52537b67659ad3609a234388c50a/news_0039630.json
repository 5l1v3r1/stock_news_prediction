British women have won medals at every skeleton event since the sport was reintroduced to the Games in 2002.\nAn initially good run from defending Olympic champion Lizzy Yarnold was slowed by a hit against the wall ahead of one of the last curves at the Olympic Sliding Center.\nReporting by James Pearson; editing by Clare Lovell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:09:03.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
