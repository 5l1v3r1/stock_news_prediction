But in the event that inflation does accelerate, that could lead volatility to continue as the Goldilocks environment may be under further pressure.”\nCleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, a voting member in the central bank’s rate-setting committee this year, said the recent stock market sell-off and jump in volatility will not damage the economy’s overall strong prospects.\nAfter a wildly volatile week that pushed the market into correction territory, U.S. stocks gained roughly 3 percent over Friday and Monday, their best two-day gain since June 2016.\nBy 12:34 p.m. ET (1734 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped half a percent to 24,484.07, the S&P 500 0.3 percent to 2,648.06 and the Nasdaq Composite just 12.38 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,969.58.\nTen of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by losses in the technology and healthcare indexes.\nBenchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were hovering at 2.8439 percent, shy of a four-year peak of 2.9020 percent hit on Monday.\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, a widely-followed measure of short-term stock volatility and seen as a contributing factor itself to the selloff, was last trading at 26.39 points, half the 50-point mark it touched last week.\nThe recent pullback wiped out all of January’s gains for the benchmark S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow, both now down more than 1 percent for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still clinging to a 0.87 percent gain for the year.\nOn a day of heavy trading in healthcare companies, Henry Schein and Patterson Companies fell 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively, after news of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint against the dental supply firms.\nTheir losses were the biggest among healthcare distributors weighing up the possible ramifications of the AmerisourceBergen deal and a report of Amazon’s push into the space.\nOf the 70 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings, nearly 78 percent of them topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is above the 72 percent average beat-rate in the past four quarters.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,668 to 1,165. On the Nasdaq, 1,585 issues fell and 1,220 advanced.
