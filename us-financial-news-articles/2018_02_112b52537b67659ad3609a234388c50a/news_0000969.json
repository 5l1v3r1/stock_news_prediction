For winter it will base seven wide body jets there, including four which were previously based in Cologne/Bonn.\nOverall, German air traffic measured in revenue passenger kilometres rose 3.1 percent in 2017, but would have grown around 5 percent had Air Berlin not collapsed, the BDL said.\nThat underperformed Europe as a whole. The International Air Transport Association said on Thursday that European traffic rose 8.2 percent last year thanks to strong economic activity in the region driving demand.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:51:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
