He is expected to easily win a vote slated for March 26-28. \nThe Civil Democratic Movement includes several notable figures, including a former presidential contender as well as Hesham Genena, a former anti-corruption watchdog head who had been campaigning for former military chief of staff Sami Anan, Sisi’s top opponent before he was arrested. nL8N1PI3DE] \nThe statement follows growing calls to boycott the March vote after all major opposition campaigns withdrew citing intimidation. Anan himself was arrested and halted his presidential bid after the army accused him of breaking the law by running for office without permission. \nSisi now faces a single opponent, who is himself a Sisi supporter, in the March contest. \n“Clearing the political space of candidates in the name of preserving security is unconstitutional and does not promote security,” the statement said. \nSisi said in the speech that he may call on Egyptians to take to the streets to give him a “mandate” in the face of what he described as “villains,” without specifying who he meant. \n“We affirm that states are not run by mandates and the mobilisation of supporters in orchestrated gatherings, but rather by constitutions and respect for freedoms,” the statement said. \n“Is this a mandate in order to uphold freedoms? Or to crush opposition? Or to violate the constitution?” it said.
