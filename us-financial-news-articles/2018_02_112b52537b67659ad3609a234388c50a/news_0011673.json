On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $3.90 for the December quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $1.11 in the prior year quarter. GAAP EPS for the December quarter of fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted by new U.S. tax reform legislation. Adjusted diluted EPS, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes items described below, increased 14.0 percent to $1.55 in the fiscal first quarter and also included a benefit from the Company's expected full fiscal year effective tax rate.\nAmerisourceBergen is updating its outlook for fiscal year 2018. The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, as discussed below in Fiscal Year 2018 Expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance has been raised from the previous expectation of $5.90 to $6.15 to a range of $6.45 to $6.65, reflecting growth of 10 percent to 13 percent versus last fiscal year. The adjusted diluted EPS benefit from U.S. tax reform is expected to be approximately $0.60 in fiscal 2018, offset by a lower than expected contribution from PharMEDium.\n“In the first quarter of the fiscal year, we saw further market, pricing and competitive stability. AmerisourceBergen continued to lead the market in specialty product distribution and pharmaceutical services and our core pharmaceutical distribution businesses executed extremely well - growing volumes with key customers and segments - and continued to effectively manage operating expenses. We are proud of the work our associates have done and pleased with this strong start for the fiscal year,” said Steven H. Collis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of AmerisourceBergen.\n“Our updated outlook for fiscal 2018 reflects this performance and the expected benefit of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by a lower than expected contribution from PharMEDium. We remain confident in PharMEDium's ability to return to its long-term growth trajectory, and committed to providing our customers with the highest quality products and services as we continue to invest in AmerisourceBergen,” Mr. Collis continued. “AmerisourceBergen’s scale, proven ability to execute, strategic evolution and continued investment position the Company for long-term growth as we innovate and deliver value to our shareholders. We are living our corporate purpose and are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.”\nFirst Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Summary Results\nGAAP Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Revenue $40.5B $40.5B Gross Profit $1.1B $1.1B Operating Expenses $694M $625M Operating Income $419M $488M Interest Expense, Net $36M $36M Tax Rate (140.1)% 24.2% Net Income $862M $342M Diluted Shares Outstanding 221M 221M Diluted Earnings Per Share $3.90 $1.55 Below, AmerisourceBergen presents descriptive summaries of the Company’s GAAP quarterly results as well as its adjusted (Non-GAAP) quarterly results. In the tables that follow, GAAP results and GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations are presented. For more information related to Non-GAAP financial measures, including our fiscal year 2018 expectations, please refer to the Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures following the tables.\nFirst Quarter GAAP Results\nRevenue: In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue was $40.5 billion, up 6.0 percent compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, reflecting a 5.8 percent increase in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue and an 11.6 percent increase in revenue within Other. Gross Profit: Gross profit in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $1.1 billion, a 7.2 percent increase over the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the increase in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services and the decrease in LIFO expense of $28.3 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 2.75%, an increase of 3 basis points from the prior year quarter. Operating Expenses: In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, operating expenses were $693.7 million, compared to $637.7 million in the same period last fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by operating additional distribution centers in the current quarter and duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems, as well as increased costs to support our revenue growth. Operating Income: In the fiscal 2018 first quarter, operating income was $419.0 million versus $400.0 million in the prior year period. Interest Expense, Net: In the fiscal 2018 first quarter, net interest expense of $35.9 million was down 3.0 percent versus the prior year quarter. Tax Rate: The effective tax rate of (140.1)% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 benefited from $587.6 million of discrete tax benefits recognized and a reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, both resulting from U.S. tax reform. Diluted Earnings Per Share: Diluted earnings per share was $3.90 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to $1.11 in the previous fiscal year’s first quarter, primarily driven by the benefit from U.S. tax reform. Diluted Shares Outstanding: Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 were 220.8 million, a 0.5 percent decline versus the prior fiscal year first quarter due primarily to share repurchases, net of stock option exercises.\nDefinition of Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Results\nThe comments below compare adjusted results, which exclude:\nWarrants expense; Gain from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense; Acquisition-related intangibles amortization; Employee severance, litigation, and other; Loss on early retirement of debt; and a One-time tax reform adjustment.\nIn addition, we previously issued $600 million of 1.15 percent senior notes that were repaid in May 2017 to fund our initial special share repurchase program. The interest expense incurred relating to this borrowing has been excluded from the Non-GAAP presentation.\nFirst Quarter Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Results\nRevenue: In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue was $40.5 billion, up 6.0 percent compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, reflecting a 5.8 percent increase in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue and an 11.6 percent increase in revenue within Other. Adjusted Gross Profit: Gross profit in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $1.1 billion, which was up 4.5 percent when compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily due to the increase in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 2.75 percent, a decrease of 4 basis points from the prior year quarter. Adjusted Operating Expenses: In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, operating expenses were $624.6 million, an increase of 8.0% compared to the same period in the last fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fiscal 2018 first quarter were 1.54 percent, compared to 1.52 percent for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by operating additional distribution centers in the current quarter and duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems, as well as increased costs to support our revenue growth. Adjusted Operating Income: In the fiscal 2018 first quarter, operating income of $488.1 million increased 0.4 percent from the prior year period. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 6 basis points to 1.21 percent in the fiscal 2018 first quarter compared to the previous fiscal year’s first quarter. Adjusted Interest Expense, Net: In the fiscal 2018 first quarter, net interest expense of $35.9 million was up 3.0 percent from the prior year quarter. Adjusted Tax Rate: The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 24.2 percent, down from 33.1 percent in the previous fiscal year’s first quarter, primarily driven by a reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, as a result of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share: Diluted earnings per share was up 14.0 percent to $1.55 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to $1.36 in the previous fiscal year’s first quarter, driven primarily by a $0.15 benefit from U.S. tax reform. Diluted Shares Outstanding: Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 were 220.8 million, a 0.5 percent decline versus the prior fiscal year first quarter due primarily to share repurchases, net of stock option exercises.\nSegment Discussion\nThe Company's operations are comprised of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment and other operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and, therefore, have been included in Other for the purpose of reportable segment presentation. Other consists of operating segments that focus on global commercialization services and animal health and includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS), World Courier and MWI Animal Health (MWI).\nPharmaceutical Distribution Services Segment\nPharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue was $38.9 billion, an increase of 5.8 percent compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Segment operating income of $388.2 million in the December quarter of fiscal 2018 was up 2.4 percent compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The segment was impacted by reduced production at PharMEDium's Memphis 503B outsourcing facility, where, following inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, operations were voluntarily suspended in December so that the company could execute certain remedial measures.\nOther\nRevenue in Other was $1.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 11.6 percent compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year as all three business units contributed to revenue growth in the quarter. Operating income in Other decreased 6.4 percent to $100.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by performance at ABCS, specifically the Lash Group, and MWI and was partially offset by the contribution from World Courier.\nRecent Company Highlights & Milestones\nCompleted the acquisition of H. D. Smith, the largest independent pharmaceutical wholesaler in the U.S., which enhances and expands our strategic scale, strengthens our support to community pharmacy and drives long-term, durable value. Recorded our 16th consecutive quarter with 10 percent or greater revenue growth in Specialty distribution. Now servicing more than 600 retail pharmacies acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance through its phased acquisition of certain Rite Aid stores. Opened a 6th new distribution center in Newburgh, NY with state-of-the-art automation as part of our commitment to creating the most efficient healthcare and pharmaceutical network. Good Neighbor Pharmacy, AmerisourceBergen's independent pharmacy network, was ranked “Highest in Customer Satisfaction with Chain Drug Store Pharmacies” in the J.D. Power 2017 U.S. Pharmacy Study.

Please refer to the Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures following the tables for additional information.\nFiscal Year 2018 Expectations on an Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Basis\nBased upon the Company’s expectations for U.S. tax reform and evaluation of current business expectations, including the formal recognition of operating expenses associated with our now completed acquisition of H. D. Smith and lower than originally anticipated operating income contributions from PharMEDium and the Lash Group, AmerisourceBergen has updated its fiscal year 2018 financial guidance.
