Rosa Elena Bonilla was detained at her residence on the outskirts of the capital Tegucigalpa, the source said. As part of the operation, police also arrested her brother-in-law and seized documents pertaining to graft accusations, the source said. Local media in Honduras extensively covered the arrest. Bonilla stands accused of illegally obtaining some 12.2 million lempiras ($522,000) in the waning days of her husband’s administration, according to the national anti-corruption council, CNA. Late last year, Bonilla denied the corruption allegations.

Corruption scandals have led to a string of arrests in Central America in recent years, thanks to growing pressure from activists and backing from foreign powers. Slideshow (2 Images) Bonilla’s detention took place a day after U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley visited Honduras to talk about drug trafficking and corruption. Earlier this month, the head of an anti-corruption commission backed by the Organisation of American States resigned citing a lack of support from authorities. Lobo was elected in late 2009 after a military coup ousted then-President Manuel Zelaya, and he served until 2014. The couple’s son, Fabio Lobo, was sentenced to 24 years in prison by a U.S. court last year after pleading guilty to charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.
