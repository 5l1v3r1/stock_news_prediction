Melrose Industries has offered 7.4 billion pounds ($10.3 billion) to buy GKN, sparking a war of words between the two companies and drawing the attention of the government due to the company’s position as a leading engineer and large employer. “We are obviously watching this, we are monitoring this with care. The secretary of state for business, Greg Clark, has spoken to both of the companies involved and as I said in the House of Commons when I was asked about this, we will always act in the national interest.” ($1 = 0.7158 pounds) (Reporting by Kate Holton, Editing by Paul Sandle)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T17:55:51.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
