It is a strategic imperative for us and, clearly, we are very active on the business development front.”\nMeek, an American, took over as CEO in July 2016. The company bought assets from U.S. Merrimack Pharmaceuticals in January last year, including metastatic pancreatic cancer drug Onivyde for $575 million in cash.\nThat followed a deal with Exelixis to have access to its renal cell cancer treatment Cabometyx.\nMeek said Ipsen was now in the top 20 oncology companies worldwide - ranking at 18 by sales in 2016 - and there was room for improvement.\n“I am not saying we will be in the top ten anytime soon but I certainly want to be the fastest growing of the top 20,” he said, adding Ipsen oncology sales were up 32.4 percent at constant exchange rates last year to top 1 billion euros.\nRevenue in North America was up 74.5 percent, driven by continued growth of neuroendocrine tumors treatment Somatuline.\n“North America is 25 percent of our business and most of that is the U.S., our largest single market at this time, and our fastest growing. We expect continued acceleration of our growth in the U.S.,” Meek said.\nThe executive said Ipsen would benefit from a cut in U.S. corporate tax but that he would also closely track budget issues that could potentially have an effect on government health insurance programs for the poor and disabled such as Medicaid and Medicare for the elderly.\n“There are risks and opportunities. We are following the congressional budget debate very closely.”\nEditing by Luke Baker and Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T14:41:57.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
