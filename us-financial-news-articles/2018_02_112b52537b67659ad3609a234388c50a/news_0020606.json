TalkTalk will initially invest 100 million pounds into the project over five years.\nCharles Dunstone, the founder of the smaller rival to BT ( BT.L ), Sky ( SKYB.L ) and Virgin Media ( LBTYA.O ), said the plan would put TalkTalk “at the heart of Britain’s fiber future”.\nBritain’s broadband providers had been slow to commit to the “gold standard” of full fiber to the premises (FTTP). But the government and the regulator has adopted a “fiber first” strategy in the last year or so, which is starting to deliver.\nBT, the owner of the biggest network, said last week it would connect three million homes and business with FTTP by the end of 2020, while Vodafone ( VOD.L ) is partnering with CityFibre ( CITYC.L ) to connect another five million by 2025.\nTalkTalk said its five-year project would target mid-sized cities and towns, such as York, the northern English city where it has built its first network.\nDunstone said its plan would complement BT’s focus on large cities. “The telecoms industry collectively has a very big job to do in upgrading broadband to provide the service people need in a modern economy,” he said.\nTalkTalk will be able to sell access to its new fiber network to rivals, a reversal of roles from the way it operates in most other parts of the country.\nBritain’s Digital Minister Matt Hancock welcomed the move, saying: “It’s fantastic to see TalkTalk stepping up to the plate.”\nBROADBAND RESET Dunstone, along with CEO Tristia Harrison, has been “resetting” TalkTalk since he returned to a hands-on role nine months ago. He is positioning it firmly in the value end of the market with long-term fixed-price plans and has stepped back from services like mobile.\nThe strategy is attracting new customers - Dunstone’s priority - but coming at a cost to earnings.\nThe company added 37,000 customers in its third quarter, and forecast additions of 150,000 to 160,000 in the full year.\n“We have really got the growth going, the growth has accelerated again this quarter and we think this quarter (Q4) is significantly bigger,” Dunstone said\nHe said the fundraising and dividend cut would answer long-running questions about the company’s balance sheet.\n“When we get to two times EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) cover to debt we’d look to normalize the dividend again, an estimate would be perhaps two to three years time,” he said.\nTalkTalk shares, which have fallen 29 percent in the last 12 months, were down 8.6 percent at 109 pence in afternoon trade. It placed shares at a price of 107 pence, with the amount representing around 20 percent of its existing share capital.\nThe company said it now expected full-year core earnings to come in between 230 million and 245 million pounds, down from its previous forecast of 270-300 million.\nIt said it would temporarily reduce its full-year dividend to 2.5 pence. It paid 10.29 pence for its last financial year.\nBarclays and Deutsche Bank are acting as joint global co-ordinators and joint bookrunners for the placing of new shares.\n($1 = 0.7196 pounds)\nEditing by Guy Faulconbridge and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:36:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
