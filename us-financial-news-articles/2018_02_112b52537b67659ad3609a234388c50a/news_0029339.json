Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports Woods made birdie at his opening hole, the par-four 10th, but was inconsistent over the next seven holes that included a double-bogey, two bogeys and two birdies.\nThe 14-times major winner started to steady the ship on his back nine, which he began with a birdie followed by a string of three consecutive pars that was broken at the par-four fifth where Woods opted for an iron off the tee.\nSlideshow (3 Images) He pulled his tee shot left into thick rough and brought his ball back into play with his second shot but was still well short of the green. His pitch from about 40 yards bounced well past the hole en route to a bogey.\nWoods made a another bogey two holes later followed by a birdie on his penultimate hole before closing with a par.\nHe finished the day having hit eight of 14 fairways, seven of 18 greens in regulation and needing 25 putts.\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:23:40.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
