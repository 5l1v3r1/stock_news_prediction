On Tuesday, cybersecurity firm Sikur announced what it claims is a hack-proof smartphone designed to store cryptocurrencies securely . And at Mobile World Congress, Chinese electronics maker Huawei unveiled a new laptop called the MateBook X Pro that has a camera hidden in the keyboard . \nAl Bannai also revealed that 2017 revenue hit $400 million, up from $200 million the year before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T13:33:15.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
