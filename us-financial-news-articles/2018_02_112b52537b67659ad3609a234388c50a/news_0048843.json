Djoos fired one from the left point, and Ovechkin came across the front, lifted his stick and knocked it past Johnson.\nCarlson made it 2-0 with 6:27 remaining in the period by poking the puck just over the line in the midst of a mad scramble on the edge of the crease -- despite three Buffalo players standing right there.\nKyle Okposo cut the lead to 2-1 on a goal for Buffalo with 7:18 left in the third period, but Evgeny Kuznetsov added a goal with 26 seconds left for Washington.\nEvander Kane then scored for Buffalo with four seconds left, but it wasn’t enough.\nThe Capitals made a trade earlier in the day, acquiring defenseman Michal Kempny from Chicago for a 2018 third-round draft pick.\nKempny, 27, had one goal and six assists in 31 games with the Blackhawks this season. Washington coach Barry Trotz said before Monday’s game that he’ll give Washington more defensive depth.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:31:23.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
