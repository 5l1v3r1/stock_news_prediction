( bit.ly/2CqlQ6S )\nSecurity researchers last month disclosed two flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.\nFixes for most affected systems were issued by the companies since then, but some patches slowed down computers.\nSecurity experts had earlier said that Intel would face lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers would likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make.
