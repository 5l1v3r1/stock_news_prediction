It said it could not yet estimate the financial impact of this.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Barclays is seen on the top of one of its branches in Madrid, Spain, March 22, 2016. REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File Photo PLANS IN PLACE Barclays was the worst-performing bank in the FTSE 100 index in 2017, falling nine percent on concerns about both its investment bank and its legal and regulatory troubles.\nStaley has championed an aggressive push in investment banking that has so far largely failed to bear fruit.\nProfit in the Barclays International division was down 22 percent in 2017, driven by a 4 percent fall in income from its investment bank and rising impairments, the bank said.\n“We have strong plans in place to address that underperformance in 2018,” Staley said.\nStaley later told reporters that plans to improve the division’s performance include investment in “people, technology and balance sheet,” without giving further details.\nThe CEO’s pay was down 8.5 percent from the previous year, while the bank also disclosed a gender pay gap of almost 50 percent in its International unit.\nBarclays’ investment bank has struggled to keep pace with U.S. peers in recent quarters, despite plans announced in October to shift some 20 billion pounds in assets from corporate lending to riskier but higher-yielding trading activities.\nChief Financial Officer Tushar Morzaria said that the bank had gained market share, with business down in dollar terms by 10 percent compared with 20 percent at its biggest U.S. rivals.\n($1 = 0.7204 pounds)\nReporting by Lawrence White and Emma Rumney; editing by Sinead Cruise and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T09:40:22.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
