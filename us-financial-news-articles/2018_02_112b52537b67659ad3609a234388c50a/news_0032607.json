That followed an upwardly revised sales pace of 1.209 million units.\nMeanwhile U.S. import prices grew more than expected, rising 1.0 percent in January, boosting the outlook for inflation in the coming months.\nIn morning trading, U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields rose to 2.8840 percent after the data, from 2.8804 percent just before the release of the numbers.\nU.S. 30-year yields increased to 3.1332 percent, from 3.1316 percent before the data.\nHowever, both maturities were still down on the day, compared with the previous sessionâ€™s levels.
