Of the nearly 71,000 cases of gender violence reported in 2014, less than one percent went to trial, government figures show.\nRights groups first brought Lopez’s case to the court’s sister organisation, the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, in 2007.\nIt ruled the Venezuelan government had failed to protect Lopez, did not investigate the case with “due diligence” or provide proper care to her as a rape survivor.\nThe commission later decided Venezuela had failed to act on its recommendations, including improving healthcare for rape survivors and setting up protocols to investigate violence against women, and in 2016 sent the case to the Inter-American Court.\nThe court is expected to rule on the case within a year and issue binding orders to Venezuela.\nReporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by xxxx.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
