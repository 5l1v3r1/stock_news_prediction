It was the first time for him and it was a mistake but the most important thing is to look forward and put it right.

It is a pleasure to watch him... It is important we continue together.” \nMahrez hit out at “untrue assumptions” in a statement ahead of his return, shredding further doubt on the exact reasons for the playmaker’s absence but Puel was tight-lipped on the matter. \n”Everything will stay within the club, remain between me, Riyad, the club and the players,“ Puel added. ”I think it was important he came back quickly with a good attitude. \n”Riyad coming back is a good thing for us and now it is important he has a good focus and concentration about his football. \n“The situation was difficult for him but difficult for everyone. It was important to approach the situation with calm and to come back together on the pitch, and to defend the colours of the club.” \nLeicester have won just one of their last five league games and are eighth in the standings. They play Sheffield United in Friday’s FA Cup fifth-round clash.
