Rating agencies have also cited the policy as a concern, because it might hinder South Africa’s economic growth.\nSupporters of the rule changes, proposed under former President Jacob Zuma who resigned last week, say they are necessary to improve conditions at the mines and more equitably share profits.\n“The Presidency has been in discussion with the Chamber of Mines to resolve the impasse over the mining charter and to facilitate a process of developing a New Mining Charter that all stakeholders can support and defend,” Ramaphosa’s office said in a statement on Sunday.\nThe mining group had agreed to postpone its High Court challenge to the new rules, set for Feb. 19-21.\n“The postponement serves to allow parties the space to engage and find an amicable solution,” the presidency said.\nIn an address to parliament on Friday and his first as president, Ramaphosa said he was committed to “policy certainty and consistency”, in contrast to his Zuma, who was criticised for policy shifts and unpredictable cabinet changes.\n“We welcome the President’s intervention, and his commitment to engaging meaningfully with stakeholders in the industry – and others – on a New Mining Charter,” said Chamber of Mines president Mxolisi Mgojo.\nSouth Africa is one of the world’s top exporters of gold and platinum metals and is heavily reliant on the industry for jobs and tax revenues.
