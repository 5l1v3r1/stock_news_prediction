The programme was initially valued at 20 billion euros but its cost has ballooned to well over 30 billion, sources told Reuters last year.\nNATO buyers agreed in principle to revamp the delivery schedule and requirements for the plane during a meeting in London on Monday. The deal was finalised in recent days.\nThe buyer countries issued a brief communique on Monday about the agreement, and said Monday’s meeting had been “productive”.\n“The discussions focused on the progress and the next steps on the A400M programme which is already delivering much welcomed initial operational capability to several of the Partner Nations Air Forces,” the ministerial communique said.\nAirbus must still work out the exact terms and conditions with each of the individual buyers, a source familiar with the decision said.\nA spokesman for the German defence ministry said details still had to be worked out, but the agreement meant that Germany’s 53rd and final A400M transporter would now likely be delivered in 2026, several years later than initially planned.\nHe said the ministry welcomed Airbus recommitting itself to the A400M programme, which meant the Bundeswehr could now expect to receive aircraft that met its requirements.\nThe countries acknowledged during the meeting that the programme’s problems were caused in part by fresh demands that they had imposed on the programme, the source said.\nOne industry executive said the agreement would provide some relief for Airbus and its suppliers after years of mounting tension between buyer nations and the companies.\nReporting by Reuters bureaus; Editing by Tim Hepher, Clarence Fernandez and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T00:21:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
