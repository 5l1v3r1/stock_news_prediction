That could leave the Wizards without a true point guard, and their next game is Wednesday vs. the Knicks.\nTim Frazier played six minutes and left with a nasal fracture. Ian Mahinmi also played six minutes but the team announced in the third quarter that he also wouldn’t return due to illness.\nStill, the Wizards got enough offense to outlast the struggling Bulls. Satoransky now has scored in double figures four times this month.\nIn this game, Satoransky made 10 of 12 from the field, including a big fourth-quarter three-pointer that stopped a Chicago rally and gave the Wizards a 100-90 lead with 3:25 left, the game’s final basket.\nOtto Porter Jr added 14 points while Mike Scott also came off the bench and scored 14. All-Star Bradley Beal struggled and finished with only seven points but handed out six assists.\nThe Wizards finished with 31 assists on 38 baskets.\nKris Dunn (concussion) again did not play for Chicago. He lasted played on Jan. 17 against the Warriors.\nThe Bulls ended a seven-game losing streak with a one-point win over Minnesota Friday night and now have lost eight of their last 10.\nSeven Chicago players actually finished in double figures but it wasn’t enough. Justin Holiday led the Bulls with 15.\nSatoransky helped the Wizards on offense in the first half, where they led almost all the way but still needed an 11-3 run at the end for a 56-46 halftime lead.\nSatoransky made 6 of 7 shots from the field including all three three-pointers and helped pick up some of the slack. Beal didn’t score a point until the second period and finished the first half with only four.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:11:03.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
