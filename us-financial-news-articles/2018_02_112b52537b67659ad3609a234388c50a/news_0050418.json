The president apparently didn’t like what he saw. Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2018 \nAfter seeing Trump’s tweet, Winfrey said she reviewed her 60 Minutes segment to see if any portion of it was biased. She also called a producer for the program to weigh in. \nIn the end, Winfrey defended her work to DeGeneres, saying that a panel of people critique each 60 Minutes show before it’s aired. The first time she previewed the segment, she said she pointed out to producers that only a Democratic response to one of her questions—“What do you think of America?”—had been included. She said she argued that a response from a right-leaning panel member should also be included. \n“I was trying to do the opposite of what I was hate-tweeted about,” says Winfrey. \nIf Trump decides to attack Winfrey again, he should take into account that DeGeneres is on her side. During Winfrey’s appearance on her show, DeGeneres said, “When you mess with Oprah, you mess with me.” \n", "external_links": ["https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/m1KzAMXW600?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/965442990134251520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-02-23T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T22:25:46.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
