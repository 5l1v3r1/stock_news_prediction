Florida (17-8, 8-4 SEC) pummeled South Carolina on the boards with a 46-24 rebounding edge.\nSenior guard Frank Booker scored 17 points for the Gamecocks (13-12, 4-8), who dropped their fifth consecutive contest. Junior power forward Chris Silva added 10 points, five rebounds and five blocked shots for South Carolina.\nThe Gamecocks shot a woeful 27.8 percent from the field, including 2 of 13 from 3-point range. South Carolina was 9 of 15 from the free-throw line.\nFlorida shot 46.2 percent from the field and rejected 10 shots. Sophomore forward Keith Stone led the way with three blocks.\nThe victory allowed Florida to avenge a 77-72 home loss to the Gamecocks last month to split the season series.\nSouth Carolina also famously defeated the Gators in last season’s NCAA Tournament to reach the Final Four for the first time in school history.\nThe Gators had a 22-10 rebounding edge in the first half while taking a 41-20 lead into the break.\nFlorida began assuming control with a 16-2 surge to open up a 14-point lead. The run was capped by a layup from Chiozza to make it 21-7 with 7:12 left in the first half.\nA dunk by freshman guard Deaundrae Bassett increased the Gators’ lead to 32-16 with 3:27 left.

Hudson scored the final five points of that burst.\nSophomore forward Maik Kotsar connected on a jumper with 9:27 left before the Gamecocks went the remainder of the contest without making another one as they missed their final nine shots. Kotsar’s basket was South Carolina’s only one over its last 15 field-goal attempts.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:12:24.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
