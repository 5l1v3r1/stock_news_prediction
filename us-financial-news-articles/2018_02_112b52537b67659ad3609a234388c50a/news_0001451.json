It has jumped around 14 percent so far in 2018, despite a technical glitch that shut down the market for two days.\nA further 29 percent stake in PV Power would be offered to strategic investors, including both foreign and domestic players. Overseas investors bought 12.15 percent of PV Power at the IPO, exchange data showed.\nThe Vietnamese government also has plans to sell 12 percent of state-owned Vietnam Rubber Group for a projected minimum $272 million and 12.8 percent of electricity generator firm Power Generation Corporation 3 for at least $290 million next month.\n$1=22,710 dong Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:03:48.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
