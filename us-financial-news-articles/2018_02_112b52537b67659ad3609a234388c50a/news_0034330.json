He said he had lost count of the number of people he had killed.\nThe man was one of more than 50 convicted since the trial of hundreds of suspects resumed on Monday, the ministry said on Wednesday.\n“It’s going according to plan with over 50 cases dispensed in two days,” said ministry of justice spokesman Salihu Othman Isah.\nThe Chibok abduction by the group, whose name in the Hausa language roughly translates as “Western education is forbidden”, attained international attention and sparked a campaign called #BringBackOurGirls.\nMore than 20,000 people have been killed and 2 million forced to flee their homes in the northeast of Africa’s most populous nation since the jihadist group began an insurgency in 2009.\nAbba Umar, a 22-year-old man, was jailed for 60 years on Tuesday.\nThe justice ministry, in an emailed statement, called him an “unremorseful sect commander” who “remained adamant to his ideology despite all the efforts by the defense counsel to convince him to have a change of heart”.\nSuspects have appeared in open court after rights groups criticized the use of secret trials in October.\nLast year the ministry of justice said 45 people with Boko Haram links had been convicted and jailed. A further 468 suspects were discharged and 28 remanded for trial.\nReporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T20:00:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
