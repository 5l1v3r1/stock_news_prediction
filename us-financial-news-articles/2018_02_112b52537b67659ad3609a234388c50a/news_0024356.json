He played 20 times in all competitions for the French second division club. \n“He combined well with his team mates. He played simple passes and two touches, and made good penetration,” Puel added. \n“It was a good first half and he showed some strong work defensively, and brought something to our attack.” \nLeicester are eighth in the table with 35 points and travel to league leaders Manchester City on Saturday.
