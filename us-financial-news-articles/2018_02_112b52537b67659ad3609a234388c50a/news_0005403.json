The new listing price values the company at up to 2.57 billion euros, below its net asset value of 2.69 billion euros.\nResidential construction in Spain is thriving with foreign investment pouring into developments in cities and coastal resorts, a decade after a property bubble burst leaving banks laden with developersâ€™ bad loans.\nHouse builder Neinor Homes listed last year, the first flotation by a Spanish residential builder in a decade.\nMetrovacesa was taken over by creditors Santander and BBVA in 2009. The banks are selling stock in the company as part of the listing although they will remain majority shareholders.\nJust under a fifth of its assets are in the northeastern region of Catalonia which embarked on an independence drive from Spain in October, plunging the country into its worst political crisis in decades.\nBBVA, Santander, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are acting as the joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the offer.\nGoldman Sachs and Societe Generale are acting as additional joint bookrunners, the company said in the statement.
