Every month he gets reports summarizing operating results for individual Other Bets. Every quarter he gets reports providing operating results for Alphabet, revenue broken down by product areas within Google and operating results for Google as a whole, and operating results for each Other Bet company. Page does not receive specific profitability and/or expense information for any product areas within Google as part of the weekly, quarterly or any other regular reporting. For example, Page wouldn't receive reports that showed YouTube's versus Google Cloud's profitability. Page proposes compensation for Google CEO Pichai and all the other Other Bet CEOs, but no other executives below that.\nThe Other Bet CEOs include:\nGV – Venture capital — David Krane Capital G — Growth equity investment — David Lawee Verily — Healthcare — Andrew Conrad Calico —Biotech — Arthur Levinson Jigsaw — Geopolitics think-tank —Jared Cohen Chronicle —Cyber-security — Stephen Gillett DeepMind — Artificial intelligence research — Demis Hassabis Waymo — Autonomous vehicles — John Krafcik Sidewalk Labs — Urban innovation — Dan Doctoroff X — R&D lab — Astro Teller Access — Internet provider — Dinesh Jain Google CEO Pichai is totally disconnected from Other Bets While Google accounted for all of Alphabet's profit and more than 98% of its revenue in its last quarter, Google CEO Sundar Pichai neither receives financial information about Alphabet's Other Bets nor has any decision-making power over them. \nThat hands-off relations played out dramatically in the case of Nest , the company Google acquired for $3.2 billion in 2014. When Nest spun-out of Alphabet the two companies had no incentive to work together and ended up building similar products. Ultimately, Alphabet decided to roll Nest back into Google earlier this month . \nPichai also does not have authority over Alphabet's overall resource allocation to Google. \nBut Pichai has a lot of power over Google Within Google:\nPichai receives weekly and quarterly reports which include individual financial information for Google product areas, including YouTube, advertising, and hardware, and include operating results, capital expenditures, and headcount for Google as a whole. Quarterly reports include operating results for product areas and product categories (i.e., one level below product areas) within Google, expenses for certain functions, and headcount. Neither Page nor his co-founder, Alphabet President Sergey Brin, receive the weekly and quarterly reports received by Sundar Pichai. Without Page's approval, Pichai can commit Google to n on-standard licensing or similar arrangements, investments, mergers and acquisitions, and other commitments up to a set dollar threshold. Also, capital expenditures, real estate, commercial arrangements, including licensing, partnership and revenue generating agreements and other similar transactions and expenditures up to a set dollar threshold (which is undisclosed).\nAlthough Susan Wojcicki and Diane Greene both have \"CEO\" titles within Google, for YouTube and Cloud respectively, Pichai is the only Google executive who reports directly to and maintains regular contact with Page.\nHow Sergey Brin and Ruth Porat participate Brin receives all of the same reports as Page. Along with Page, he will give preliminary approval to individual Other Bet annual business plans, but Page has to give the final approval. Both Brin and Page will work with Other Bets and occasionally various product area leaders within Google, but those leaders don't have direct accountability or contact with them. Page and Brin's interactions \"involve advice on engineering and technical specifications related to research and product development initiatives.\"\nAlphabet CFO Ruth Porat participates in the annual business planning process of Google as well as each individual Other Bet. \nRead Alphabet's response in its entirety here .\nshow chapters Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat weighs in on earnings      4:54 PM ET Thu, 1 Feb 2018 | 01:30", "external_links": ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000000000017039681/filename1.pdf", "https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cfannouncements/edgarcorrespondence.htm", "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204417000048/0001652044-17-000048-index.htm"], "published": "2018-02-27T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T23:23:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
