But he was captured again by men with Kalashnikovs while walking home and taken to another prison.\nEventually, he got in touch with a Cameroonian embassy representative who arranged for his repatriation.\nHaunted by his memories, Franck has yet to tell his family much about what happened to him. He said he does not want to dwell on the past; he needs to find work.\nMOTIVATED In that, Franck may benefit from the EU’s 3.2 billion euro Trust Fund for Africa, set up in a bid to stem the flow of migrants to Europe with skills training and jobs back home.\nIt is funding a joint initiative with IOM to reintegrate migrants who have returned to Cameroon and help them learn trades and set up businesses with loans.\n“The trauma of what they went through won’t disappear overnight” said Felix Mbayu, secretary general of Cameroon’s ministry for external relations.\n“But they do come back with a certain advantage over other youths in Cameroon, which is that they now know that the grass is not greener on the other side – so they are more motivated to take advantage of the opportunities back home.”\nThe scheme encourages migrants to set up community-oriented projects in farming, cattle rearing and other fields, which can become self-sustaining, said IOM Cameroon head Boubacar Saybou.\n“We’re looking into setting up the best options possible for them because we need to create lasting opportunities,” he said.\nCameroon also launched a pilot project in January setting up job centers to provide information and advice to those seeking work or to obtain or upgrade their qualifications.\nFranck, who is trained in making and laying floor tiles, said he plans to going into business with a plumber and a carpenter that he met in prison in Libya and returned on the same flight.\nHe is reluctant to migrate again.\n“It’s too risky. I would not recommend anyone to take that route,” he said.\nBut Franck said he will have no choice but to leave if his new business fails.\n“We don’t know how life here is anymore,” he said.\n“We have to really start again from zero.”\nReporting by Inna Lazareva, Editing by Robert Carmichael and Katy Migiro.
