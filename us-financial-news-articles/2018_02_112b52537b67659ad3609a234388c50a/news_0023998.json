Slideshow (2 Images) \nMidfielder Davies all but sealed the victory with a low finish in the 75th minute against a Palace side who showed little threat until Luka Milivojevic converted a late penalty after Ashley Williams handled the ball. \nEverton leapfrogged Bournemouth to climb to ninth on 34 points from 27 games. Palace are 14th with 27 points.
