Net income reflects $11.9 million of incremental income tax expense, or approximately $0.10 per diluted share, due to the application of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017. This amount is a reasonable estimate provided in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance.

We took advantage of favorable market conditions to deploy $110 million of cash to repurchase more than 1 million shares of our stock. As a result of our outstanding third quarter performance and increased fourth quarter forecast, we are raising our fiscal 2018 outlook for Net Bookings.\n“In addition to achieving superb results, we announced the formation of Private Division, our new label that is dedicated to bringing titles from top independent developers to market.

In addition, the Company is increasing its outlook for GAAP net revenue and GAAP net income.\nGAAP net revenue is expected to range from $1.80 to $1.85 billion GAAP net income is expected to range from $170 to $181 million GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to range from $1.50 to $1.60 Share count used to calculate GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be 113.2 million (4) Net cash provided by operating activities is expected to be approximately $300 million Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $60 million Net Bookings (operational metric) are expected to range from $1.99 to $2.04 billion\nThe Company is also providing selected data and its management reporting tax rate of 22% that are used internally by its management and Board of Directors to adjust the Company’s GAAP financial outlook in order to facilitate comparison of its operating performance between periods and to better understand its core business and future outlook:\nTwelve Months Ending March 31, 2018 Financial Data $ in millions GAAP outlook (2)\nChange in\ndeferred\nnet\nrevenue\nand related\ncost of\ngoods sold\nStock-based\ncompensation (3)\nNon-cash\namounts\nrelated to\nconvertible\nnotes\nAcquisition\nrelated\nexpenses\nAmortization &\nimpairment of\nacquired\nintangible\nassets\nBusiness\nreorganization\nexcluding\nstock-based\ncompensation\nNet revenue $1,803 to $1,853 $187 Cost of goods sold $905 to $934 $11 ($30) ($17) Operating Expenses $776 to $786 ($93) (5) $7 ($27) ($13) Interest and other, net $0 ($10) Income before income taxes $123 to $133 $176 $123 $10 ($7) $44 $13 1) For the fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2018, the Company’s fully diluted share count used for both GAAP and management reporting purposes is expected to be 118.8 million, which includes 114.0 million basic shares, 4.1 million shares representing the potential dilution from unvested employee stock grants, and 0.7 million shares representing the potential dilution from convertible notes. For management reporting purposes, the interest expense, net of tax, on the convertible notes, which is added back to net income to calculate diluted net income per share is $0.03 million. 2) The individual components of the financial outlook may not foot to the totals as the Company does not expect actual results for every component to be at the low end or high end of the outlook range simultaneously. 3) The Company's stock-based compensation expense for the periods above includes the cost of approximately 0.6 million restricted stock units previously granted to ZelnickMedia that are subject to variable accounting. Actual expense to be recorded in connection with these shares is dependent upon several factors, including future changes in Take-Two's stock price. 4) For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, the Company’s fully diluted share count used for management reporting purposes is expected to be 118.0 million, which includes 110.1 million basic shares, 3.1 million shares representing the potential dilution from unvested employee stock grants, and 4.8 million shares representing the potential dilution from convertible notes. The interest expense, net of tax, on the convertible notes, which is added back to net income to calculate diluted net income per share for management reporting purposes is $0.83 million. Take-Two’s GAAP net income per diluted share outlook is calculated using a diluted share count of 113.2 million (basic shares plus unvested employee stock grants ), because using the “if-converted” method and the Company’s fully diluted share count of 118.0 million would have been anti-dilutive.\n5)\nIncludes $2.4 million of stock-based compensation related to business reorganization.\nKey assumptions and dependencies underlying the Company’s financial outlook include: the timely delivery of the titles included in this financial outlook; continued consumer acceptance of Xbox One and PlayStation 4; the ability to develop and publish products that capture market share for these new-generation systems while also leveraging opportunities on Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC and mobile platforms; and stable foreign exchange rates.
