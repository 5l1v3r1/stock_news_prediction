As part of that deal, the partners would look at jointly developing Pascua-Lama.\nBarrick is due to release its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 14.\nReporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T06:38:46.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
