Donating proceeds is something he's done before. \"Perhaps $30 to $40 million already,\" said Gross, who co-founded Pimco and now manages the Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund.\nHe plans to sell his collection of about 3,000 stamps through a series of auctions, with the first one expected this fall.\nAmong the treasures Gross has is a letter from the Pony Express.\nAdam Jeffery | CNBC The historic Pony Express cover signed by co-founder William H. Russell estimated to fetch between $75,000 and $100,000 at auction. He also has a block of six of the first U.S. stamps, which were issued in 1847, worth between $500,000 and $750,000.\nCharles Shreve, director for Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries and Gross' stamp advisor for the past 25 years, told CNBC that block of stamps somehow ended up in a Bible, where they remained for \"dozens and dozens of years.\" It remains the only intact block of six of the first U.S. stamps, he said.\nAlso included in the collection is a set of upside-down steamship stamps, the largest known intact multiple of any inverted stamp error, said Shreve. \"Stamp collectors love errors,\" he said.\nAdam Jeffery | CNBC The largest known multiple of any inverted center postage stamp error expected to fetch between $300,000-$400,000 at auction. While the auction is \"at the high-end level,\" Shreve said he expects a good turnout.\n\"There will be hundreds of people around the world who will be bidding. There will be a live auction but people will also be able to bid live on the internet,\" he said.\nThe first set of stamps hitting the auction block are worth an estimated $10 million, while the entire collection is worth tens of millions.\nGross currently holds the record for the biggest single-day stamp auction in 2007 when he auctioned off his collection of British stamps for $9.1 million.\n— CNBC's Kevin Flynn contributed to this report. \nshow chapters \"Bond King\" Bill Gross is parting with his $9 million rare stamp collection      5:26 PM ET Tue, 13 Feb 2018 | 00:57", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T22:26:50.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
