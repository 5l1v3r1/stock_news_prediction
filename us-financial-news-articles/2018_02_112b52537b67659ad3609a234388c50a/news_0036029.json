Agnico Eagle Mines was among the biggest drags on the index, down 3.5 percent at C$54.35, while First Quantum Minerals declined 2.8 percent to C$20.80. * Shares of cannabis companies also came under pressure the day after Canadian government officials said the planned July start date for legalized recreational marijuana was set to be delayed further. * Canopy Growth declined 3.5 percent to C$27, while Aphria Inc declined 5.1 percent to C$14.12. Aurora Cannabis was among the most actively traded companies on the index, down 6.4 percent to $10.16. * Among the day’s corporate earnings, Air Canada rose 3.7 percent to C$25.22 after it reported better-than-expected profit as efforts to improve the company’s operating margins paid off. * The TSX posted three new 52-week highs and two new lows.
