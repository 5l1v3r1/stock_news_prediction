It is also offering to buy other wind projects under development for 187,000 reais per megawatt of installed capacity.\nRenova said it is evaluating the new proposal. It said eventual resources from the deal, if it is accepted, would be used to pay suppliers in the Alto Sertão III complex.\nRenova had approved in November the initial proposal from Brookfield for the acquisition of a controlling stake in the Brazilian company, which is trying to cut a large debt load.\nReporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T01:34:58.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
