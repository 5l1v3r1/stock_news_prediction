The company will have more details when it releases results on Tuesday, a spokeswoman said.\n“This provides even further clarity and confidence in our expected cash flow profile for 2018 and beyond,” Gary W. Willingham, Noble Energy’s executive vice president of operations, said in a statement. Prices under the agreements are linked with Brent oil benchmark pricing, Noble said.\nAn Egyptian government official, who declined to be identified, said the deal did not mean Egypt itself would import any gas from abroad.\n“International private companies will import gas from abroad in the framework of their own needs, and will liquefy and export them again,” the official said, without elaborating.\nFILE PHOTO: A Delek petrol station is seen near the southern city of Ashdod July 27, 2011. REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File Photo Shares in Delek Drilling were up 28 percent on the news and Delek Group shares were up 19 percent.\nBarclays analyst Tavy Rosner said weakness seen in Israeli gas shares over the past several months was due to investors being skeptical that gas exports would ever take place. “We believe today’s announcement will pave the way to a re-rating of the shares,” he said.\nLeviathan, located about 80 miles (130 km) west of Haifa, was discovered in December 2010 and is scheduled to start producing by the end of 2019.\nExports from Tamar, which began production in 2013, are expected to start under the deal some time between the second half of 2020 and the end of 2021.\nDolphinus, Delek said, is a natural gas trade company that plans to supply large industrial and commercial consumers in Egypt. It added that Egypt had amended regulations last week to allow private groups to import gas.\nThe companies did not give a date for when supplies to Egypt were expected to start. The means of delivering the gas to Egypt still needs to be settled.\nOne export option, Delek said in a statement, was to supply the gas through an old pipeline built by East Mediterranean Gas (EMG) originally designed to send gas in the other direction.\nEgypt had once sold gas to Israel, but the deal collapsed in 2012 after months of attacks on the pipeline by militants in Egypt’s Sinai peninsula.\nAnother option would be to use a pipeline being built as part of a separate deal to sell gas from Leviathan to Jordan.\nThe export agreements are conditioned upon receipt of regulatory and government approvals in Israel and in Egypt.\nNoble and Delek Drilling together control 85 percent of Leviathan, with the rest held by Ratio Oil.\nThey are joined in Tamar by Isramco Negev, Tamar Petroleum - a spin-off of Delek - and two other small partners.\nAdditional reporting by Abdelrahman Adel in Cairo; Editing by Adrian Croft and Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T14:56:01.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
