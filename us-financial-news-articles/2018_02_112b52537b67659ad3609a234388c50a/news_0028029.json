NYPD officials declined to comment on that detail. \nU.S. authorities have been on alert for mail containing white powder since 2001, when envelopes laced with anthrax were sent to media outlets and U.S. lawmakers, killing five people.

The apartment may be the home of Vanessa Trump’s mother, local news outlets reported. \nDonald Jr. has been in the public eye for his role in a 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian attorney and others after the Trump campaign was offered potentially damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. \nCongress has held probes into that meeting and whether it was part of a Russian campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. \nRussia denies trying to influence the election. Trump dismisses any talk of collusion. \nIn 2016, white powder, which also proved harmless, was sent to the home of Eric Trump, Trump Jr.’s brother.
