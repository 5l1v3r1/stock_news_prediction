The main drivers of the growth were the Indian rupee, other currency pairs, Indian single stock futures and Sensex futures, it said. \nLast November, the DGCX said it was adding 44 blue-chip Indian companies to its range of single stock futures. Between July and October, it traded 851,108 of the contracts, up ten-fold from 2016, with a value of $5.4 billion, it said.
