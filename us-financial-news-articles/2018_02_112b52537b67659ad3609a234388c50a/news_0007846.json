The vessels were still available for sale and the company has started discussions with interested third parties, it added. \nThe proposed disposal of the vessels is a part of the company’s debt reduction plans. This week, Noble proposed a deal under which existing shareholders’ equity would be nearly wiped out, while the restructured company would have much lower debt.
