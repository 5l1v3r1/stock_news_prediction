Barnaby Joyce who has campaigned on “family values” and who has been married for 24 years, refused to resign when it was made public he was expecting a child with his former staffer. “He needs to step down as leader of the National Party, take a step back into the back bench for a time,” Andrew Broad a member of parliament from Joyce’s National Party told state-owned broadcaster the ABC. The National Party is in a ruling coalition with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s Liberal Party. The coalition holds a one-seat majority in parliament. Turnbull has called Joyce’s affair a “shocking error of judgment”. Broad said he would take up the issue of Joyce’s leadership at a party meeting in the capital, Canberra, on Monday. His call is the latest sign that support for Joyce from within his rural-based party is eroding, amid concern disapproval of the affair could undermine support in state elections. A state branch of the party withdrew its support for Joyce this week because of the affair. Two-thirds of voters want Joyce to resign over the affair, according to the Australian newspaper’s Newspoll.
