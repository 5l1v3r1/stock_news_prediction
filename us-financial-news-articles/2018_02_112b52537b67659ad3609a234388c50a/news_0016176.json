REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi \nWith the ruling Democratic Party (PD) lagging in the polls, 5-Star is seen as the main obstacle to a center-right victory, and Berlusconi and Di Maio have stepped up their attacks on each other while largely ignoring PD leader Matteo Renzi. \n“If Di Maio won power it would be a catastrophe, Italy would be internationally isolated and our economy would be devastated by taxes,” said Berlusconi, 81, who cannot personally run for office due to a 2013 conviction for tax fraud. \nDi Maio said he was “not worried in the least” by the lawsuit and published a Facebook post listing EU treaties on fiscal and immigration policy signed or backed by Berlusconi, which he said had sold Italy short. The post was titled “Berlusconi, seven times a traitor to the country.” \nIn an even more provocative move, 5-Star said its supporters would gather outside Berlusconi’s villa near Milan on Friday to read out a 2014 court document which linked the four-times prime minister to the Sicilian Mafia. \nThe document, which spelled out the reasons the court had sentenced Marcello Dell‘Utri, one of Berlusconi’s closest aides, to seven years in prison for mafia association, said Dell‘Utri had paid members of the mafia on Berlusconi’s behalf. \nBerlusconi himself has never been sentenced for mafia-related crimes.
