At the same time, we continue to work with NSE to create a larger pool of liquidity comprising international and home market participants,” Michael Syn, head of derivatives at SGX said in a statement.\nOver the past two decades, SGX has become the most popular way for foreign investors to bet on Indian equity indexes with Nifty 50 futures tracking the NSE’s main index.\nSGX’s Indian equity derivatives products account for about 12 percent of its total derivatives trading volume. Over the last few years, the exchange has rapidly expanded its suite of derivatives that have helped to power growth in earnings while its cash equities business weakened.\nLast week, global index provider MSCI Inc “strongly” suggested to the Indian exchanges and their markets regulator that they reconsider their “anti-competitive measures.”\nSGX said that along with the NSE, it will also develop a link that will allow global market participants to trade on NSE’s international exchange in the western Gujarat state, where India is developing a new financial centre and offering dollar-based derivative contracts and lower taxes.
