The funds spent 540 million reais ($163 million) on the wind farm construction.\nThe wind farm, which started generation in 2014, used equipment supplied by India’s Suzlon Energy Ltd. But the company left Brazil last year, and the need to look for a new supplier for maintenance may impact the amount potential bidders are willing to pay, the sources added.\nVotorantim and Banco do Brasil’s asset management units declined to comment on the matter.\n$1 = 3.3078 reais Reporting by Luciano Costa; Writing by Tatiana Bautzer, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T20:14:58.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
