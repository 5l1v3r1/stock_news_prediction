Oregon scored the next eight points, six of them by Troy Brown, to push its lead to 14 points, more than enough to finish off the hapless Golden Bears.\nElijah Brown scored 15 points and Mikyle McIntosh added 13 points and 11 rebounds for the Ducks (15-7, 5-4 in Pac-12 play), who led from the first bucket and outshot Cal 55.3 percent to 33.3 percent for the game.\nOregon won its third straight game while Cal lost its ninth consecutive contest after opening the conference campaign with a win over Stanford.\nColeman led the Golden Bears (7-16, 1-9 in Pac-12) with 16 points and Justice Sueing added 13 for Cal, which stayed in the game by outrebounding Oregon 36-31, forging a 28-22 advantage in points in the paint and getting 21 points from its bench.\nOregon led 34-26 at halftime behind Brown’s eight points on a perfect 3-for-3 shooting from the floor that included a pair of 3-pointers. The Ducks outshoot Cal 63.2 percent-39.3 percent in the first half and could have easily put away the game if it could have made more than just five of 11 free throw attempts in the first 20 minutes.\nMcNeil and Coleman paced the Golden Bears with six points apiece but Cal shot just 2 of 7 on 3-pointers in the first half and was only 2 of 8 from the charity stripe.\nOregon continues its trip to Northern California when it plays Stanford in Palo Alto on Saturday afternoon. California returns to the court with a home game, also on Saturday, vs. Oregon State.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:04:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
