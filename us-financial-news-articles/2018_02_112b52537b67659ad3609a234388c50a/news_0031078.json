Edgar) Hoover building,” Lofthus said.\n“This is an important part of the president’s infrastructure program.”\nLofthus added that the projected $3.3 billion would also cover the cost of “swing space,” or space that FBI employees will use on a temporary basis during construction.\nThe agency endorsed the plan, saying in a statement: ”The FBI believes this proposed consolidation strategy enhances mission resiliency, continuity of operations, and will provide the Bureau with the agility necessary to meet future needs.”\nAlso on Monday, the Trump administration unveiled its proposal for the fiscal 2019 budget.\nThat plan asks for a Justice Department budget of $28 billion, a slight decrease of 1.2 percent from the 2017 enacted level.\nMost of the Justice Department’s components would see a funding boost under the plan, with increases proposed for the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration, as well as for U.S. attorneys and the office that oversees immigration courts.\nThe decrease would be achieved by consolidating the COPS grants program into the Office of Justice Programs, and closing two regional Bureau of Prisons offices.\nThe plan also calls for stripping the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) of its powers to police cigarette and alcohol smuggling and transferring them to a tax and trade unit inside the Treasury Department.\nAfter that, the ATF would focus solely on efforts to combat violent crimes such as arson, illegal firearms trafficking and bombings.\n(This story has been refiled to fix the spelling error in “site” in paragraph 7)\nReporting by Sarah N.
