Processing new streams of data from networks of industrial or road sensors also holds promise.\nYet this pits them against the likes of U.S. tech giants Amazon, Google or Facebook that have proven adept at recruiting users and exploiting their data to sell products, services or advertising.\n4-EYED PHONES AND REAL 5G\nAsian smartphone makers will launch an array of new phones this weekend, but many are international versions of models already on sale in China, which with 1.4 billion subscribers is, by far, the world’s biggest mobile market.\nThe big smartphone launch on Sunday evening by Samsung of its new flagship phone, the Galaxy S9, ahead of the conference will have a focus on dual camera features, Wood said.\nCameras, the more the merrier, are all the rage, with some phone models boasting four to five built-in cameras, said.\nThe exhibition halls in Barcelona will be full of talk of ultra-fast mobile video, connected cars, factory automation, digital health and smarter cities.\nAlso, 5G, long the subject of arcane technical debates and an elusive search for concrete applications, is finally getting down to business. The first commercial 5G roll-outs begin this year and next in the United States, Korea and Japan, creating new revenue streams for operators and beaten-down equipment makers.\nBut 5G remains an abstraction for consumers, Forrester analyst Thomas Husson wrote in a blog post ahead of the show.\nEarly 5G devices are set to go on show next week after smartphone chip maker Qualcomm earlier this month announced 5G-ready chips with 18 network operators and 19 device makers, analysts said.\nEditing by Douglas Busvine and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T19:48:42.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
