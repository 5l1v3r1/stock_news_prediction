REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/Files “CPI inflation likely eased in January, driven by a seasonal correction in prices of perishable food items. However, the statistical impact of an unfavorable base will keep the year over year print above 5 percent”, said Shashank Mendiratta, economist at ANZ.\nWholesale price inflation also likely eased in January, to 3.25 percent from a year ago, compared to 3.58 percent in December.\nStill, the central bank is expected to keep rates on hold at least until the second half of 2019, but would consider a hike if inflation breached 6.0 percent, the upper limit of its inflation target, a poll taken ahead of the RBI’s policy Feb. 7 meeting found.\nHighlighting growth concerns, the latest poll also showed industrial production expanded at a slower 6.2 percent pace in December from 8.4 percent in November.\nOutput in eight core industries, which account for nearly 40 percent of India’s industrial output, grew 4.0 percent year-on-year in December, compared with 7.4 percent growth in November, official data showed.\nAdditional reporting by Vivek Mishra; Polling by Khushboo Mittal; Editing by Kim Coghill\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T08:42:36.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
