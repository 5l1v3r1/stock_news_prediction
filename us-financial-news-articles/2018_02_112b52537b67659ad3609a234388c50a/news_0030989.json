The results were bolstered on the client side by consistently growing demand for holistic insurance and investment solutions, and on the corporate front by a diversified investment approach coupled with disciplined expense management.\n\"Our results make clear how we are able to do three key things: pay the benefits we promise to policyowners and their beneficiaries, provide the opportunity to share in a dividend payout that today leads the industry, and remain a company with exceptional financial strength,\" said Chairman and CEO John Schlifske. \"We also continue to invest in a distinctive client experience that will help more people achieve financial security.\"\nAt year-end 2017, the company's results included:\nTotal surplus (including the asset valuation reserve) finished the year at an all-time high of $25.2 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion. The result is even with a one-time $1.2 billion reduction in surplus related to net deferred tax assets due to the recent enactment of tax reform and a lower corporate federal income tax rate. The company expects the tax law changes to be a long-term positive that will benefit earnings beginning in 2018. The highest ever new life insurance premium at $886 million, alongside total premium revenue of $17.9 billion for insurance and annuity products. A record $125.1 billion of client assets under management for investment products and services – up 25 percent from 2016. Growth of the general account investment portfolio to $225.5 billion, an increase of $11.9 billion since year-end 2016. Low life insurance unit costs, a reflection of continued, disciplined expense management.\nThe company expects to pay a total dividend of $5.3 billion to policyowners in 2018, one of the highest payouts in the company's history. 1 It also maintained the highest financial strength ratings awarded to any U.S. life insurer by all four of the major rating agencies. 2\nOther notable 2017 business results included:\nTotal revenue, $28.1 billion, and total assets, $265.0 billion. $10.3 billion in benefits paid to policyowners and their beneficiaries. Approximately 85 percent of dividends paid to traditional permanent life insurance along with expected dividends on individual disability insurance ($377 million) and annuities ($67 million).
