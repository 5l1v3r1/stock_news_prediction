His budget minister Gerald Darmanin also said a voluntary redundancy plan for government employees could be a possible move.\nReporting by Maya Nikolaeva; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T01:53:10.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
