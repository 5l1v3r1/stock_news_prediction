The 21-year-old started slowly at his first Olympics but then burst into life on the cross-country track, winning the individual sprint and the 4x10km relay before storming to his final gold in the team sprint on Wednesday. “Johannes decided early today that enough is enough. He is satisfied with good races and says that he doesn’t feel motivated to do a whole 50km race here at the Olympics,” team boss Tor Arne Hetland told state broadcaster NRK. Klaebo’s place in the race is now expected to be taken by either Emil Iversen or Didrik Toenseth.
