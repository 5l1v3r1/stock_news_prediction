But with no further sightings of a lifeboat, the search has now been suspended.\n“The Rescue Coordination Centre Nadi and Kiribati have decided that it is no longer appropriate for the air search to continue. The international aircraft will be returning,” Vince Cholewa, a spokesman for The Rescue Coordination Centre of New Zealand, told Reuters.\nSeven aircraft from New Zealand, Australia and the U.S. coastguard have been combing around 92,000 square km (35,500 square miles) of ocean for the missing life raft, which was designed to hold about 25 people but capable of squeezing on more.\nKiribati vessels will continue searching, the government said.\nReporting by Colin Packham; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T00:15:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
