It generated $2.84 billion of profit in the first nine months of 2017.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T21:41:59.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
