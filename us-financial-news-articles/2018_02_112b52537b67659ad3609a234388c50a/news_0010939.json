So it’s still possible to beat people that are cheating - that’s what I’ve been telling myself my whole career, knowing that there were some people cheating but that it was still possible to beat them.”\nHarvey said he is looking forward to the competitions on the course in Pyeongchang.\n“Here, it’s a fair course. You’re going to need to be strong physically, but also smart tactically and have really good equipment, so I think it’s a really fair course.”\nReporting by Philip O'Connor; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:49:54.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
