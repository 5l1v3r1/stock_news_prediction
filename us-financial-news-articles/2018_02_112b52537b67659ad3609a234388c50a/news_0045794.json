But the firm still had to be careful: it created Twitter hashtags #RedstripeToTheRescue and #SleighAllDay which skirted its link to the team and made no reference to the Games.\nThe Jamaican team confirmed their agreement with Red Stripe. Red Stripe could not be reached for comment.\nUnder Armour also helped Nigeria’s women bobsledders, outfitting them and making a documentary ahead of Pyeongchang about the first bobsledders to represent an African country.\nOnline fashion magazine Teen Vogue was among media outlets that posted the Under Armour video during the Olympics, a move the outfitter said brought the “story to consumers that we could never have afforded to market to in the traditional sense”.\n‘PLAYING BY THE RULES’\nSome big firms, which support individual Olympic athletes or teams without being Games sponsors, can also ask for Olympic waivers which give them approved marketing opportunities on the condition they cannot use Olympic symbols or references.\nGoPro, whose cameras are used in extreme sports, secured waivers allowing it to stream video starring Olympians such as U.S. snowboarder Jamie Anderson on social media before the Games. Anderson won the women’s slopestyle gold in Pyeongchang.\nAt the Games, GoPro also hunted for smaller marketing opportunities. It planned to fit its cameras to non-competing skiers who test the alpine course right before races and to share the footage online, a GoPro executive said in Pyeongchang.\nGoPro, which sponsors the U.S. ski and snowboard team, did not respond when asked if this went ahead.\n“We try to be very respectful of IOC and USOC (U.S. Olympic Committee) and existing sponsors that we know are paying exorbitant amounts of money to be part of the Olympics,” said GoPro’s global head of marketing, Todd Ballard.\nApple has also found a small opportunity at Pyeongchang.\nIt lent about 15 gold iPads and more than a dozen Apple watches to the U.S. bobsled team’s coaching and support staff at the Olympics. The coaches had been using outdated iPads to analyze training runs and asked Apple last year for new ones.\n“We were surprised when we opened the box from Apple and the iPads were gold. We thought this was a good omen,” said U.S. bobsled and skeleton spokeswoman Amanda Bird.\nOn the sidelines of the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, Apple sold limited edition Apple watchbands in national team colors.\nApple declined to comment.\nCiarallo, the entrepreneur with the upstart dryer company, also knows he must be careful. “I‘m playing by the rules. If I do something not so kosher, I‘m dead.”\n(Refiles to fix typo; no other changes to text)\nAdditional reporting by James Pearson; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T13:53:35.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
