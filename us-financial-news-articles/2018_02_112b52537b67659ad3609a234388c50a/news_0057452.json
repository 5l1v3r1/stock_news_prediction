The companies cited “some constraints to implement a merger”, although they left the door open to one, saying it “remains the ultimate goal”. They did not disclose any additional details. bit.ly/2CHSelD bit.ly/2CKSQat Labourers stand after unloading cement bags from a freight train at Ghaziabad railway station on the outskirts of New Delhi, April 20, 2017. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/Files The two cement companies, owned by Swiss-based LafargeHolcim Ltd, added they had reached an agreement for the sale and purchase of materials and services with a view “to maximise synergies”. ACC and Ambuja had announced last year they were considering a merger, without disclosing a value, to achieve operational and financial efficiencies. “The development is sentimentally negative for both the companies, as it will have much lesser synergetic benefits than envisaged earlier,” retail brokerage Sharekhan wrote in a note. Ambuja Cement shares clocked their biggest intraday fall since July 10, 2017.
