The move builds on the firm’s second consecutive year of growth since re-positioning its DCIO business in 2015.\n“Demand for our retirement plan investment solutions has been robust with our active and index target date strategies seeing particularly high levels of inflows as a result of their competitive performance, strong showing in industry rankings and relatively low costs. Our DCIO business grew nearly 40% in 2017 which is a testament to the competitive offering we have for plan sponsors, consultants and advisors,” said Erin Donnelly, executive vice president and head of Nuveen’s DCIO business. “Our success in this business segment has certainly been an advantage in attracting top talent to support our plans to continue growing in this business in the year ahead.”\nAdditions to Nuveen’s DCIO team include:\nPeter Whitman joined the firm as managing director responsible for DCIO Strategic Accounts reporting directly to Ms. Donnelly. He will oversee the firm’s retirement presence across recordkeeping, retirement intermediary and other third-party retirement platforms and relationships.
