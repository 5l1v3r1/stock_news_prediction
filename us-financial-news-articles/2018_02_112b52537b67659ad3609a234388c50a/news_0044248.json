It is then transported via traders to refineries for further processing, when it enters a company’s supply chain.\nOver the past decade, consumer activist groups have pressed big palm oil buyers such as PepsiCo, Unilever and Nestle with supermarket boycotts and other protests over palm oil’s perceived links to deforestation and human rights abuses.\nPepsi-Co last month suspended procurement from a palm oil supplier over claims of labor abuses on its Indonesian plantations.\nReporting by Astrid Zweynert @azweynert, Editing by Kieran Guilbert.
