I want a fair investigation from Scicluna,” Cruz said. \nAs a teenager, Cruz was sexually abused by the Rev. Fernando Karadima, who was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing him and other teenage boys over many years. Karadima always denied the allegations. \nThe Vatican ordered him to follow a life of prayer and penitence and banned him from public ministry, but he avoided criminal prosecution because under Chilean law too much time had elapsed since the offences. The 87-year-old still lives in Chile. \nCruz says Barros witnessed the abuse by Karadima, who was Barros’s mentor years ago in a Santiago parish. Barros has always denied this and said he was unaware of any wrongdoing by Karadima, who had trained him to become a priest. \nThe Karadima case has gripped Chile for years and many Chileans protested the pope’s decision to make Barros a bishop in 2015. It cast a long shadow over the pope’s trip to Chile last month. FILE PHOTO - Chilean priest Fernando Karadima is seen inside the Supreme Court building in Santiago, Chile, November 11, 2015.

There is not a single piece of evidence against him. It is all slander. Is that clear?” \nHe later apologised to victims, acknowledging that his choice of words and tone of voice had “wounded many”. \nCruz told Reuters the Vatican investigation should end with Barros’s dismissal, which many parishioners and politicians have demanded.

A spokesman for O‘Malley declined to comment on Friday, referring all questions to the Vatican. A Vatican spokesman also had no comment. \nCollins said in a tweet on Friday that only the pope could say if he had read Cruz’s letter or not. Cruz said it was possible that the pope had not read it. \nBut advocates for victims of sexual abuse said that, even if Francis had not read the missive, it was implausible that he was not aware of the many reports of Barros allegedly witnessing abuse by Karadima, given their close relationship at the time. \n“Such ignorance by the pope would suggest that the Vatican has no system in place for responding to allegations, despite 15 years of scandal and assurances to the contrary,” said Anne Barrett-Doyle, co-director of Boston-based research group BishopAccountability.org.
