( reut.rs/2EUOROp )\nAs part of the turnaround plan, Hertz has been overhauling its rental fleet and investing more in technology upgrades of its app amid pressure from industry over-capacity and pricing.\nThe rise of car-sharing companies has also intensified competition for Hertz.\nHertz benefited from a one-time gain of $679 million due to changes in the U.S. tax law and reported net income from continuing operations of $616 million, or $7.42 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $438 million, or $5.28 per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, Hertz reported a loss of 77 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 60 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose to $2.09 billion from $2.01 billion, beating the analysts’ estimates of $2.06 billion.\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:05:13.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
