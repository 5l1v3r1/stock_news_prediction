France, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden also put in a similar request.\nThe EU antitrust enforcer said that based on preliminary data provided by the seven countries, the deal may have a significant adverse effect on competition in Europe.\nApple will now have to formally ask the Commission to approve the deal. The EU regulator can either clear the bid with or without conditions or open a full-scale investigation if it has serious concerns.\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alissa de Carbonnel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T19:06:52.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
