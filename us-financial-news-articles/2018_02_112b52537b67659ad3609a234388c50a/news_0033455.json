REUTERS/Beawiharta She also alleged he was behind a suicide attack last year that killed three police officers at a Jakarta bus station and the bombing of a church in Samarinda on Borneo island that wounded four children.\nAbdurrahman, who wore orange prison clothes with a checkered scarf tied around his head, told the court he understood the charges and did not object to the indictment.\nSlideshow (2 Images) His lawyer was not immediately available for comment.\nThe cleric and ideologue is the founder of Islamic State-linked Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a militant group in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country that the United States has designated as a “terrorist organization”.\nHe was immediately re-arrested by police last year after serving time in prison for setting up a militant training camp in the Indonesian province of Aceh.\nAbdurrahman had reportedly also managed to keep spreading his jihadist message on social media from jail.\n“To put it generally, he is the mastermind behind many of the terrorist acts in Indonesia,” prosecutor Dewayani later told reporters. The maximum penalty for such charges is the death sentence, she said.\nProsecutors have asked for the trial to be adjourned until Feb. 23, when they plan to present witnesses.\nAdditional reporting by Andrew Mangelsdorf; Writing by Ed Davies; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T08:33:57.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
