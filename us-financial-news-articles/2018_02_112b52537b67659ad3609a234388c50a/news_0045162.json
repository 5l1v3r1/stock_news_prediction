Total revenue was $114.9 million as compared to $52.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total influenza revenue increased 44% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $33.5 million. Molecular revenues grew 67% to $4.5 million. Reported GAAP EPS of $(0.15) per share and non-GAAP EPS of $0.56 per diluted share. Received 510(k) clearance and CLIA waiver from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Sofia® Strep A+ assay for use on the Sofia® 2 instrumented system. Received 510(k) clearances from the FDA for the Sofia® Lyme assay for use on the Sofia® instrumented system, for the Solana® GBS and Solana® RSV + hMPV assays for use on the Solana® instrumented system.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights:\nTotal revenue increased by 45% to $277.7 million, as compared to $191.6 million in 2016. Total influenza revenue increased 50% from 2016 to $107.5 million. Reported GAAP EPS of $(0.24) per share and non-GAAP EPS of $1.07 per diluted share for the full year 2017. Received 510(k) clearance and CLIA waiver from the FDA for three Sofia® assays (Influenza A+B, RSV, and Strep A+) for use on the Sofia® 2 instrumented system. Received 510(k) clearances from the FDA for the Sofia® Lyme assay for use on the Sofia® instrumented system, and for 4 new Solana® assays (GBS, C. difficile, RSV + hMPV) for use on the Solana® instrumented system.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $114.9 million, versus $52.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 118% increase in revenue from the fourth quarter of 2016 was driven by the Cardiac Immunoassay revenue from the acquired Triage and BNP Businesses, increased sales of Rapid Immunoassay products, and to a lesser extent, revenue growth from Molecular Diagnostics and Specialized Diagnostics products.\nCardiac Immunoassay revenue, which includes Triage, Triage Toxicology and BNP product revenues, totaled $47.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Rapid Immunoassay product revenue (which includes QuickVue, Sofia and Eye Health products) increased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $49.1 million, led by a 65% rise in Sofia revenue, while QuickVue sales remained even with the fourth quarter of last year. Molecular Diagnostics revenue increased 67% to $4.5 million, led by 221% growth in Solana. Specialized Diagnostics, which includes revenue from DHI, Specialty and Other, grew 5% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $14.2 million.\n“We took great strides in the fourth quarter toward becoming a broader-based business. We completed the acquisition of Alere's Triage and BNP Businesses, which for Quidel, proved to be transformative in nature, and created a more diversified diagnostics company. Notably, the integration of the Alere assets is running ahead of schedule. And organically, we also placed the greatest number of Sofia instruments in any quarter on record, catalyzed by the commercial introduction and CLIA waiver of our Sofia 2 instrument and its companion assays. Further, an increase in Flu, Strep and RSV product utilization due to a robust respiratory disease season provided a year-end tailwind to our legacy business,” said Douglas Bryant, president and CEO of Quidel Corporation. “Thanks to the hard work of many across our company, we had a great year, and believe that Quidel is well-positioned for sustained, long-term success and value creation for our shareholders.”\nGross Profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $59.1 million, the result of increased sales volumes associated with the acquired Triage and BNP Businesses and Rapid Immunoassay products, as well as favorable product mix. Overall, gross margin for the quarter was 51% as compared to 61% for the same period last year. Amortization of intangibles reduced the gross margin by 3 percentage points, and the Triage/BNP inventory step-up of fair value reduced the consolidated gross margin by an additional 10 percentage points. R&D expense increased by $3.2 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the acquisition of the Triage business. Sales and Marketing expense increased by $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, largely due to incremental personnel costs associated with the Triage business. G&A expense increased by $2.3 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher incentive and stock-based compensation and costs associated with the Triage and BNP Businesses. Acquisition and Integration Costs were $9.5 million, driven by due diligence, transaction and integration costs associated with the Triage and BNP Businesses.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.1 million, or $(0.15) per share, as compared to net loss of $2.0 million, or $(0.06) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding amortization of intangibles, stock compensation expense and certain non-recurring items, net income (adjusted) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $20.2 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, as compared to net income (adjusted) of $5.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nTotal revenues for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 were $277.7 million, as compared to $191.6 million for 2016. The 45% increase in revenue was primarily driven by Cardiac Immunoassay revenue from the acquired Triage and BNP Businesses, as well as increased sales of Rapid Immunoassay and Molecular Diagnostics products, that were partially offset by decreased sales of Specialized Diagnostics products.\nCardiac Immunoassay revenue totaled $47.0 million for the year, reflecting Quidel's ownership of the acquired businesses that began in the fourth quarter. Rapid Immunoassay revenue in 2017 increased 36% over 2016 to $165.1 million, as Sofia revenue grew 60% from the prior year to $81.6 million. Specialized Diagnostics declined 14% from 2016 to $52.0 million mostly due to a $6.5 million decrease in grant revenue. Molecular Diagnostics revenue increased 43% to $13.6 million, led by 222% growth in Solana.\nGross Profit for the full year 2017 increased by $44.4 million over 2016 to $156.1 million, due to increased sales volumes associated with the acquired Triage and BNP Businesses and Rapid Immunoassay products. Favorable product mix also contributed to the increase. R&D expense for 2017 decreased by $5.0 million over last year primarily due to decreased spending for our Savanna MDx platform and clinical trials, which was offset by increased Triage expenditures. Sales and Marketing expense increased by $16.8 million over prior year, primarily due to expenses associated with the acquired Triage and BNP Businesses and the InflammaDry and AdenoPlus diagnostic business from RPS Diagnostics. G&A increased by $2.8 million in 2017, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and costs associated with the acquired Triage and BNP Businesses. Acquisition and Integration costs in 2017 were $16.5 million, primarily attributable to due diligence, transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of the Triage and BNP Businesses.\nFor the year ended 2017, net loss was $8.2 million, or $(0.24) per share, as compared to a net loss of $13.8 million, or $(0.42) per share, for the year ended 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the year ended 2017 was $37.5 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $6.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the year ended 2016.\nModification of Revenue Reporting Categories\nDue to the acquisition of the Triage and BNP Businesses, Quidel modified its presentation of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. The revenues of the recently acquired Triage and BNP Businesses will be reported within the Company's Cardiac Immunoassay category. The QuickVue®, Sofia® and Eye Health businesses will be reported within the Company's Rapid Immunoassay category. The revenues of Solana®, AmpliVue® and Lyra® products will be reported in the Company's Molecular Diagnostics category. Quidel's Thyretain® and Diagnostic Hybrids, or DHI, revenues and the Specialty Products Group, or SPG, businesses as well as other revenues (including grant and royalty) will be reported in the Company's Specialized Diagnostics category.\nReclassification of Amortization of Intangible Assets\nThe Company recorded reclassifications of $5.1 million, $6.5 million and $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and three months ended December 31, 2016, respectively, from amortization of intangible assets from acquired business and technology to cost of sales expense as previously reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, the Company recorded reclassifications of $2.1 million, $2.6 million and $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and three months ended December 31, 2016, respectively, from amortization of intangible assets from acquired business and technology to sales and marketing expense to conform to current year presentation. These reclassifications did not affect the net loss as previously reported or any prior amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Cash Flows or Statements of Comprehensive Loss.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company is providing non-GAAP financial information to exclude the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and certain non-recurring items on earnings (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP.\nManagement is providing the adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share information for the periods presented because it believes this enhances the comparison of the Company’s financial performance from period-to-period, and to that of its competitors, although the Company's non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
