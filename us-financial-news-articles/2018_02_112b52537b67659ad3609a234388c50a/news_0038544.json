REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo Varpins said the detention was unlawful. “A complaint is being prepared at the moment,” he told news agency LETA without elaborating.\nThe anti-corruption watchdog declined to comment on Sunday but said it would hold a press conference at 1100 GMT on Monday.\nThe economy in the Baltic state, which gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and shares a border with Russia, has been booming in recent years.\nA logo of the ABLV Bank is pictured in Riga, Latvia February 18, 2018. REUTERS/Ints Kalnins The economy grew by 4.5 percent in 2017, the fastest pace since 2011, and growth is expected to be around 4 percent this year, according to estimates from the finance ministry.\nThe Latvian central bank is an independent institution and Rimsevics has been its head since 2001. He has been a member of the ECB’s Governing Council since January 2014, when Latvia adopted the euro.\nA spokesperson for the European Central Bank declined to comment on Rimsevics’ detention.\nLatvia’s Economics Minister Arvils Aseradens, speaking on Radio Latvia, also said the governor should consider resigning.\nThe home and office of the central bank’s governor were searched on Friday, the state broadcaster said on Saturday.\nIt is a another setback for Latvia’s banking sector, which has also been hit by allegations by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that its third largest financial institution by assets, ABLV Bank, has institutionalised money laundering.\nFinCen said last week that it was seeking to impose sanctions on ABLV. ABLV said in a statement in response on Tuesday that FinCen had referred to unfounded and misleading information about the bank.\nReporting by Gederts Gelzis, writing by Johan Ahlander; Editing by Susan Fenton and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T12:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T13:35:44.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
