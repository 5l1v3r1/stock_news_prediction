Authorities warned the chain reaction of structural failures at the Oroville Dam complex could send a wall of water gushing through their nearby Gold Rush-era towns within the hour.\nDespite evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, however, the feared uncontrolled release of massive amounts of Oroville's reservoir did not happen. California's repair bills for the near-disaster have neared $1 billion. Residents downstream have filed more than $1 billion more in claims.\nLast month, two national dam-safety organizations focused the blame on the dam's overseers. California's Department of Water Resources, which owns Oroville; regulators; and consultants had focused on satisfying routine regulatory requirements for the dam — which anchors a water system that supplies more than half of California's people — but never took stock of whether the dam complex was built well enough in the 1960s to stand up over time, their independent probe concluded.\nOroville shows \"we got a little complacent with what we were doing\" as an industry, \"and now need to re-examine and identify some of the more subtle and latent problems,\" John France, a Colorado-based dams expert who led the probe, says now.\nCalifornia's Department of Water Resources declined to make an official available to comment for this article, but said in an email it is implementing changes called for by France's team.\nThe 19,000 residents of Oroville, the town that would have been first in the path of water from the reservoir, watch the year-round repairs at the dam in the hills behind them, uneasy still.\n\"I'm not sure how much we trust DWR, but that's out of our hands,\" said Julie Jackson, owner of a downtown Oroville flower store.\n\"It was pretty devastating,\" Jackson said of the fear that overrode tens of thousands of people stuck on evacuation-clogged roads as they tried to save families from what authorities said could be imminent disaster.\n\"All our family members and friends we knew were in the path.\"\nFor Lori Spragens, executive director of the national Association of State Dam Safety Officials, the Oroville spillway collapses were the biggest structural failures at a major U.S. dam of her career.\nThe last comparable one was the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Teton Dam in Idaho, which broke apart in 1976, killing 11 people. Teton was less than half the height of Oroville, at 305 feet (93 meters). Other U.S. dam failures since the 1970s involved dams that were just fractions of Oroville's size, but killed multiple people.\nOroville Dam, by contrast, is the height of a 70-story skyscraper. Its size, and the deep, snaking canyon that opened below it took France's breath away when he drove to the foot of the dam after the spillways' collapse.\n\"I can't report exactly what I said without expletives,\" the dam-safety expert said of his reaction. \"It's an enormous structure. The erosion was massive.\"\nDam safety officials, regulators and watchdog groups call Oroville a wake-up call. Most say it's being heard.\n\"Absolutely it's changed things,\" said Kevin Colburn, a national director of American Whitewater, which works on policy issues affecting rivers nationally.\n\"If I lived downstream of a dam, I'd be glad Oroville happened,\" Colburn said.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees Oroville and the nation's other hydroelectric dams, said it's too early to detail whether the post-Oroville reviews it ordered nationally have led to changes at other dams, and declined to make a dam regulator available for interview.\nFor some dam owners, however, Oroville's immense size might make them think lessons there don't apply to ordinary dams, said Jonathan Garton, president of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials and a dam regulator for Iowa.\nSo might the fact that no one died, Garton said.\n\"Definitely from a dam-safety community perspective, it was a wake-up call,\" he said. But \"in terms of owners saying, 'Gosh, that scares me,' I haven't seen that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T06:37:59.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
