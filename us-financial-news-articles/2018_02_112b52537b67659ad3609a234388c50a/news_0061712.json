(NASDAQ:SUPN), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, today reported record financial full year 2017 and associated Company developments.\nCommercial Update\nFourth quarter 2017 product prescriptions for Trokendi XR ® and Oxtellar XR ® , as reported by IQVIA (formerly IMS), totaled 198,715, a 47.3% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 product prescriptions for Trokendi XR ® and Oxtellar XR ® , as reported by IQVIA, totaled 672,709, a 33.8% increase over full year 2016.\nPrescriptions Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Change % FY 2017 FY 2016 Change % Trokendi XR 162,208 101,869 59.2% 533,541 378,584 40.9% Oxtellar XR 36,507 33,081 10.4% 139,168 124,270 12.0% Total 198,715 134,950 47.3% 672,709 502,854 33.8% Source: IQVIA Net product sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $86.3 million, a 41.2% increase over $61.1 million in the same period in the prior year. Net product sales for full year 2017 were $294.1 million, a 40.0% increase over $210.1 million in 2016.\nNet Product Sales ($millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Change % FY 2017 FY 2016 Change % Trokendi XR $69.1 $46.7 48.0% $226.5 $158.4 43.0% Oxtellar XR $17.2 $14.4 19.4% $67.6 $51.7 30.8% Total $86.3 $61.1 41.2% $294.1 $210.1 40.0% “The strong financial results achieved in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 reflect the successful launch of Trokendi XR in migraine, as well as continued double digit growth by Oxtellar XR,” said Jack Khattar, President and CEO of Supernus Pharmaceuticals. “These results substantiate the value our products provide to patients and the impressive execution of our commercial organization.”\nProgress of Product Pipeline\nOverall enrollment in the four Phase III trials for SPN-812, a novel non-stimulant for the treatment of ADHD, is approximately 38% complete. The program consists of four three-arm, placebo-controlled trials: two pediatric trials and two adolescent trials. The Company expects to continue enrollment through mid-2018 and to have data from this Phase III program available by the first quarter of 2019.\nEnrollment continues in both Phase III trials (P301 and P302) for SPN-810, currently in development for Impulsive Aggression in pediatric patients who have ADHD. Enrollment in P301 and P302 is approximately 80% and 65% complete, respectively, and is expected to continue through mid-2018, with data from the trials anticipated by the first quarter of 2019. In addition, a Phase III trial for SPN-810 treating Impulsive Aggression in adolescents who have ADHD is anticipated to start mid-2018. This adolescent trial is not expected to materially affect the overall timing of the regulatory submission process for SPN-810.\nRegarding Oxtellar XR, the investigator-sponsored trial in bipolar disorder is expected to complete enrollment by year end 2018.\n“Our strategy in 2018 is to advance SPN-810 and SPN-812 through Phase III clinical development, moving us closer to our goal of delivering from our current pipeline two novel products, both addressing billion-dollar market opportunities,” said Jack Khattar. “In addition, we remain focused on progressing Oxtellar XR as a potential therapy for bipolar disorder, another clinically important and significant commercial opportunity for Supernus.”\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $16.2 million, as compared to $13.3 million in the same quarter last year, and, for the full year 2017, $49.6 million, as compared to $42.8 million for 2016. These increases were due primarily to the initiation of the four Phase III clinical trials for SPN-812 in the second half of 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $33.8 million, as compared to $29.1 million in the same quarter last year, and, for the full year 2017, $137.9 million as compared to $106.0 million in 2016. The increases for both periods were due primarily to the expansion of the salesforce by 40 salespeople, which was fully deployed in the fourth quarter of 2017, the development and production of promotional materials and marketing programs associated with the launch of the migraine indication for Trokendi XR, and an increase in share-based compensation expense.\nOperating Earnings and Earnings Per Share\nOperating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $34.3 million, a 110.4% increase over $16.3 million in the same period the prior year. Operating earnings in full year 2017 were $99.5 million, an 83.6% increase over $54.2 million in 2016. The improvement in operating earnings in both periods was primarily due to increased net product sales.\nNet earnings (GAAP) in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.7 million, as compared to $14.3 million in the same period last year. Net earnings (GAAP) were $57.3 million in 2017, as compared to $91.2 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to the increase in research and development and selling, general and administrative spending, the increase in income tax expense as a result of the elimination of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in 2016, and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) in 2017.\nFull year 2017 net earnings would have increased by 90.3% to $67.0 million, compared to $35.2 million in 2016, if net earnings were adjusted to eliminate the one-time favorable impact of releasing the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in 2016, and eliminating the one-time unfavorable impact related to the passage of the Tax Act in 2017. (See reconciliation of GAAP net earnings to non-GAAP net earnings in the table at the end of this release).\nDiluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $1.08 in 2017, compared to $1.76 in 2016. Adjusting for the aforementioned tax effects in 2016 and 2017, diluted earnings per share in 2017 would have increased by 85.3% to $1.26, compared to $0.68 in 2016. (See reconciliation of GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS in the table at the end of this release).\nWeighted-average diluted common shares outstanding were approximately 53.5 million and 53.3 million in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively, as compared to approximately 52.0 million and 51.7 million in each of the respective prior year periods.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $273.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and long term marketable securities, a $108.2 million increase over $165.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Guidance\nFor full year 2018, the Company estimates net product sales, research and development expenses, operating earnings, and an effective tax rate as set forth below:\nNet product sales in the range of $375 million to $400 million. Research and development expenses of approximately $80 million. Operating earnings in the range of $125 million to $135 million, including approximately $7 million of licensing and non-cash royalty revenue. Effective tax rate of approximately 23% to 25%.\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will hold a conference call hosted by Jack Khattar, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Patrick, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss these results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, on Wednesday, February 28, 2018. An accompanying webcast also will be provided.\nPlease refer to the information below for conference call dial-in information and webcast registration.

In 2016, the Company eliminated the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. The Company has no recorded valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets in 2017. In 2017, the Company wrote down its net deferred tax assets to reflect the estimated impact of the decrease in federal statutory rates, as specified in the new tax legislation on the value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets. The newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. CONTACTS:\nJack A. Khattar, President and CEO\nGregory S.
