(Nasdaq:ZIOP) today responded to unfounded rumors regarding possible financing plans of the Company. Management states that it knows of no developments at the Company that would be the cause of the recent volatility and decline in the stock price.\nDavid M. Mauney, M.D., interim Chief Operating Officer, stated, “While we always opportunistically assess market dynamics to create meaningful value for our shareholders, we want to address these negative rumors head on. Ziopharm has had no discussions and has no plans to undertake an underwritten stock offering at this time.”\nHe added, “Ziopharm’s Board and management continue to enthusiastically engage several potential corporate and financial partners to advance the Company’s business and clinical programs.”\nIn an effort to protect the company and its shareholders, management is actively monitoring circulating rumors and will take all necessary and appropriate action available to the company including working closely with regulators as appropriate.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, Ziopharm had $70.9 million of unrestricted cash resources and $34.6 million from pre-payment for programs to be conducted by the Company at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The company reaffirms its guidance for all activities in 2018, and states that its current resources will be sufficient to fund its currently planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAbout Ziopharm Oncology, Inc.\nZiopharm Oncology is a Boston-based biotechnology company focused on development of next generation immunotherapies utilizing gene- and cell-based therapies to treat patients with cancer. In partnership with Precigen Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intrexon Corporation (NYSE:XON), Ziopharm is leveraging two platform technologies to deliver safe, effective and scalable cell- and viral-based therapies for the treatment of multiple cancer types: Controlled IL-12 and Sleeping Beauty for genetically modifying T cells. The Company’s lead asset, Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex, has demonstrated in clinical trials the potential to control interleukin-12 leading to an infiltration of T cells that fight brain cancer. The Company also is advancing therapies using Sleeping Beauty , a non-viral approach to genetically modify chimeric antigen receptor (CAR + ) and T-cell receptor (TCR + ) T cells, to target specific antigens in blood cancers and neoantigens solid tumors. This non-viral gene transfer platform enables the company’s point-of-care technology, a shortened manufacturing process which can potentially be developed as a decentralized manufacturing process implemented at hospital treatment centers. These programs are being advanced in collaboration with Precigen and selectively with MD Anderson Cancer Center, the National Cancer Institute and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.\nForward-Looking Safe-Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking information about ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for \"forward-looking statements\" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.
