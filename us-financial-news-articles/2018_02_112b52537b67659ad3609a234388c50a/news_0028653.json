Some cheerleaders immediately averted their gaze as the impersonator, who later only identified himself as Howard, smiled and waved to crowds who came to watch a unified Korean team play Japan at the Pyeongchang Games. “They are playing a good game, they scored one goal.

Still, Howard’s entrance was so spectacular that the North Korean cheerleaders struggled to stifle a quick laugh in between chants of “We are one!” and “Unify the motherland!” “It shows you we’re human after all,” Howard said. “Doesn’t matter if they’re South or North Koreans, a sense of humor and a bit of political satire is always needed.” (This version of the story repeats changing headline) Editing by Mark Bendeich", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T16:15:29.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
