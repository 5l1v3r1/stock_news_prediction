It said Tuesday it's now offering $127.50 per share. The chipmaker said holders of 28 percent of NXP stock have agreed to tender their shares at the higher price.\nAfter news of the higher bid, Broadcom said it's evaluating its options, calling out the Qualcomm board for their \"disregard for its fiduciary duty to maximize value for Qualcomm stockholders.\" The San Jose, California, company continued to urge Qualcomm shareholders to vote for the Broadcom slate of six director candidates at the Qualcomm annual meeting on March 6.\nIn morning trading, NXP shares rose 6.3 percent to $125.91. Qualcomm slid 3.8 percent to $62.41.
