The executives on this annual list represent top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their organization through channel partners.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding channel partner programs.\n“Lisa’s recognition on CRN’s prestigious 2018 Channel Chiefs list is a strong testament to Cloudian’s ongoing dedication to making its channel program stronger, more accessible and more profitable for our partners each year,” said Jon Toor, CMO of Cloudian. “Cloudian’s award-winning channel leadership is a direct result of Cloudian’s continuous commitment to innovation in object storage technology, which has given Cloudian partners the ability to stay relevant, competitive and profitable with a strong portfolio of innovative data storage solutions aimed at meeting their customers’ rapidly evolving storage needs.”\nEnterprises are facing mounting storage challenges as both capacity requirements and frequency of archive access have significantly increased. These evolving storage trends, in turn, have driven a demand for new and innovative archive technologies that can keep pace with this growing demand for capacity. Cloudian’s HyperStore provides organizations with multitenant and multi-datacenter hybrid cloud storage that can scale out quickly to meet expanding capacity needs. In addition, Cloudian recently launched its HyperFile solution, an integrated NAS controller that delivers SMB/NFS file services from on-premises Cloudian HyperStore object storage systems. Both solutions enable partners to boost profitability and add value with the ability to offer enterprise customers a way to overcome major capacity challenges efficiently and cost-effectively.\n“The executives on CRN’s 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,” said Robert Faletra, Executive Chairman of The Channel Company. “These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief’s impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.”\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list, including the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs, is featured online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs and will appear in the February 2018 issue of CRN.\nAbout Cloudian\nCloudian turns information into insight with an infinitely scalable platform that consolidates, manages and protects enterprise data.
