But now this awful stuff is being told about Hollywood and it’s like, you’re going to be the symbol of the downside too,” said Tim Gray, awards editor of Hollywood trade publication Variety.\n“This is new territory for them. I think they haven’t quite figured it out,” said Gray.\nCHALLENGING, FAIR, METHODICAL The job of policing accusations against filmmakers, agents and actors among the academy’s members has proved slow and difficult.\nThe academy issued its first-ever code of conduct in December and set up a task force to handle allegations on a wide range of potential violations. Chief Executive Dawn Hudson told members in a January email that it was “a challenging process that will not be solved overnight.”\nHudson’s email said the Academy’s goal was “not to be an investigative body but rather ensure that when a grievance is made, it will go through a fair and methodical process.”\nThe academy is developing an online form for submitting claims of misconduct that go beyond sexual behavior to include abuses in matters of gender, sexual orientation, race, age, and religion.\nAccording to the guidelines, claimants must supply evidence of alleged behavior and an accused person has 10 days to respond before the academy’s membership committee reviews the matter. Only the board of governors can make a decision whether to suspend or expel a member.\n“Traditionally it’s up to the employer to monitor bad behavior - in this case the studios, TV networks and the agencies,” said Gray. “It’s a slippery slope to get into that. Where do you draw the line?”The membership list of the invitation-only academy has never been published but the academy said that Spacey, Polanski and Cosby are still members.\nDouble Oscar-winner Spacey has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 30 men. He apologized to the first accuser and has retreated from public life.\nPolanski won an Oscar in 2003 despite being wanted in the United States to serve time for his 1977 admission of the rape of a minor. Cosby faces retrial in Pennsylvania in April on a charge of sexual assault and has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 60 other women. He denies the allegations.\nDirector and actor Woody Allen, who won Oscars for “Annie Hall” and “Midnight in Paris,” has repeatedly denied a resurfaced 1992 accusation that he molested his stepdaughter when she was a child.. Allen has never been a member of the academy, it said.\nDave Karger, special correspondent for entertainment website IMDB.com, says he doesn’t expect any quick action.\n“My sense with the academy is that they act judiciously, carefully and deliberately. I can see them making moves to expel certain members, but I see that happening as a multistep process,” Karger said.\nReporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T20:43:26.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
