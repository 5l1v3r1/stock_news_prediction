Florida’s Jamie McGinn was also credited with a goal that actually went in off the stick of Vancouver’s Christopher Tanev.\nSateri, 28, had never won an NHL game before last week. But then he went 3-0 with a 1.67 goals-against average and a .946 save percentage, earning the NHL’s Second Star of the Week, trailing only Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Evgeni Malkin.\nOn Tuesday, Sateri kept his streak going, making 26 saves and allowing only a breakaway, shorthanded goal by Markus Granlund. Sateri is playing only due to injuries to Florida’s top two goalies, who have right-leg injuries but began practicing this week.\nVancouver goalie Jacob Markstrom, a former Panthers draft pick and player, made 37 saves.\nThe Panthers made one change in their lineup, inserting Ian McCoshen for his first game since Jan. 7 and benching rookie MacKenzie Weegar.\nVancouver center Sam Gagner, who had been out due to a concussion, returned to the lineup.\nFlorida opened the scoring with 3:32 left in the first period. After Alexander Edler was sent off for hooking Vincent Trocheck, Florida’s Denis Malgin passed to McGinn at the edge of the crease. McGinn made a move to shoot, but the puck went off his stick and was accidentally shoved in by Vancouver’s Tanev.\nGranlund’s shorthanded goal with 11:40 elapsed in the second period tied the score. The sequence started with a neutral-zone turnover by Panthers defenseman Mike Matheson. Granlund picked up the loose puck and was off on a breakaway, beating Sateri stick-side.\nBarkov gave Florida a 2-1 lead with 16:08 expired in the second period. Barkov, sprung by Mark Pysyk’s great lead pass, beat two defensemen as well as Markstrom on a backhander. Barkov then clinched the win with his empty-net goal.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:12:19.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
