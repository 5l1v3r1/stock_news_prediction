Her allies say her removal for breaking budget rules was a coup. “When you have a parliamentary coup, it has profound consequences for society as a whole at every level and this is what we’re seeing now,” Ramos said. Democracy in Brazil is “sick” and the country needs to deal with big issues, she said. Maria Augusta Ramos, writer and director of the movie O Processo speaks during an interview at the 68th Berlinale International Film Festival in Berlin, Germany, February 22, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke “It’s impossible when you have a coup d‘etat, a parliamentary coup ... to believe that it hasn’t affected democracy at all,” she said. Ramos said she hoped “O processo” would help Brazilians look at those events in a less emotional way.

The festival runs until Feb. 25.
