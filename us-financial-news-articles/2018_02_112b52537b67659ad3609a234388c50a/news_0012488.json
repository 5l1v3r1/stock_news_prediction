The acquisition is an important step in VARIDESK's mission to transform the way people of all ages work and interact every day. Founded in 2013, VARIDESK designs, develops and manufactures affordable, high-quality, height-adjustable standing desk solutions, as well as Active Workspace accessories and furniture systems. VARIDESK products can be found in more than 95 percent of Fortune 500 companies, as well as home offices around the world.\n\"We need to move away from the sedentary behaviors that have plagued our workforce for the past 50 years, and it begins with our children and our schools,\" said Jason McCann, CEO of VARIDESK. \"Everyone who works at a desk should have a healthy, Active Workspace that promotes movement and collaboration. Adding Stand2Learn gives us a chance to create an entire generation influenced by the Active Workspace – one that will be healthier, happier and more productive than ever before.\"\nToday, approximately one in five school-aged children (ages 6 to 19) is obese. 1 The Stand2Learn desk was originally designed by Mark Benden, Ph.D., associate professor and director of the Ergonomic Center at the EOH Department, School of Public Health at Texas A&M University. The product line started as a by-product of a CDC research grant to help fight childhood obesity, which is often the result of high levels of sedentary behavior. In his extensive body of peer-reviewed research, Dr. Benden has identified reduced sedentary time as a key intervention point in the efforts to prevent this epidemic.\n\"At Stand2Learn, we are passionate about designing high-quality standing desks for students,\" Dr. Benden said. \"When kids have the choice to stand while they learn, we see improvements in their mobility and health, as well as higher levels of concentration and classroom engagement.\"\nAccording to McCann, the VARIDESK acquisition will enable Stand2Learn to accelerate its research and development pipeline and increase its market presence more quickly.\n\"Our companies have a shared vision and commitment to providing people of all ages with an Active Workspace,\" McCann said. \"We look forward to working with Stand2Learn's leadership team to leverage their expertise as we continue to innovate and grow, and extend the benefits of an Active Workspace to young people.\"\nAbout VARIDESK®\nVARIDESK launched its trademark height-adjustable standing desk solution in 2013.
