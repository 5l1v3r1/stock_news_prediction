That followed a 0.8 percent bounce last week.\nIt also retreated on the yen to reach 106.66, failing to hold an early 107.28 top amid selling by Japanese exporters for month-end.\nThe euro was firmer at $1.2314, just above last week’s trough at $1.2258, with ECB President Mario Draghi set to appear before the European Parliament later in the day.\nDealers were also looking ahead to the outcome of the Italian general election on March 4.\nA German Social Democrats’ poll of its members on joining another coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives is also due that day, two big political risk events for markets.\nIn commodities, the lapse in the dollar helped spot gold bounce 0.6 percent to $1,336.94 per ounce.\nOil prices extended gains to hit their highest level in nearly three weeks on Monday, supported by comments from Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb exports in line with the OPEC-led effort to cut global supplies.\nU.S. crude futures added 25 cents to $63.80 a barrel, while Brent futures rose 15 cents to $67.46.\nEditing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T05:24:51.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
