The new law would require all fish and their habitat to be protected.\nLarger-scale projects likely to have an impact on fish need special ministerial permits before they can be built but this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\nTo help end uncertainty, Ottawa will lay down criteria making clear which projects will require permits, LeBlanc’s ministry said in a briefing document.\nLater this week the government is due to unveil draft legislation to improve how oil pipelines and mines are assessed to see what environmental harm they might cause.\nReporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T20:57:08.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
