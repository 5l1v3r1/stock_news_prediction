I’d say with five or six years, when I started being on the podiums the motivation grew slowly,” she told Reuters Television.\nFriday’s opening ceremony where Simader, 19, carried the Kenyan flag was “really nice and emotional,” she said.\n“It has always been my dream, but then this dream came true and that I‘m here is simply incredible.”\nSimader will become only the second Kenyan to compete at the Winter Games after Philip Boit, a former middle distance runner who participated in cross-country skiing at the 1998, 2002 and 2006 Games.\nReporting by Ilze Filks, editing by Darren Schuettler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T17:14:20.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
