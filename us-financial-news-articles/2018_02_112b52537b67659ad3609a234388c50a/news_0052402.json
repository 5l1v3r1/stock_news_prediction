Its underwriting loss was $188 million in the fourth quarter. \nBerkshire had made money from underwriting even in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina struck the U.S. Gulf Coast. \nThat storm at the time caused $41.1 billion of U.S. insured losses, according to the Insurance Information Institute. \nNonetheless, insurance helps fund Berkshire’s growth by providing Buffett with float, or premiums collected before claims are paid, that he can invest. \nFloat totaled $114.5 billion at the end of December, and Buffett said it will “probably increase slowly for at least a few years.” \nAs he often does in his letters, Buffett praised his managers for keeping insurance growth on track, calling their work “conservative and careful” despite the occasional hiccup. \n“What counts are brains and capital,” he wrote. “The managers of our various insurance companies supply the brains and Berkshire provides the capital.” \nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York;   Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T22:34:33.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
