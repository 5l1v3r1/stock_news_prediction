The customer was funding his gambling habit by stealing from his employer.\nAnother customer, who also had an annual salary of about 30,000 pounds, gambled 654,000 pounds over nine months with no checks on the source of funds, it said.\nWilliam Hill said it had changed its policies and increased investment in anti-money laundering.\n\"We are fully committed to operating a sustainable business that properly identifies risk and better protects customers,\" Chief Executive Philip Bowcock said.\n\"We will continue to assist the commission and work with other operators to improve practices in the areas identified.\"\nThe bookmaker will pay 5 million pounds for breaking regulations, the commission said. Of the 1.2 million pounds the company made from the bets, 790.000 pounds will be returned to victims identified who had money stolen and more than 230,000 pounds will be paid to charity.\nRival British gaming company 888 Holdings was fined a record 7.8 million pounds last year for failing to protect vulnerable customers from addictive gambling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:45:11.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
