Belgium international Alderweireld has not recovered from a hamstring injury sustained in training last week and compatriot Vertonghen has an ankle problem. Both players missed the 1-0 win at Crystal Palace on Sunday and Alderweireld has made only two FA Cup appearances since injuring his hamstring in November.

We are ready to compete.” Rochdale, bottom of third tier League One, secured a replay at Wembley with a 2-2 draw at home and are the lowest-ranked club in the sixth-round draw. Pochettino will make changes keeping in mind Saturday’s Premier League trip to Huddersfield Town. “We are going to rotate some players to give (them) the possibility to play. They are in a good level and then we are going to play again on Saturday – a short period to recover for a Premier League game – and then the Champions League,” he said.
