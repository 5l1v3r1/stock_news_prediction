Shares of the iPhone maker climbed 1 percent in premarket trading.\nThe purchase shows the influence of Buffett's investment deputies, Berkshire portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. One of them — the billionaire investor has declined to identify him — was responsible for the conglomerate's initial stake in Apple in 2016 , and Buffett has added to it since then. \nApple shares have fallen 1.1 percent this year but are up 23.5 percent over the last 12 months. Shares of Teva are up 2 percent so far this year and down 47.4 percent since last February.\nBuffett is chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, and his business partner is 93-year-old vice chairman Charlie Munger. The conglomerate's many subsidiaries include Duracell, Kraft Heinz and Geico.\nIn January, Berkshire announced the appointment of two new vice chairs, Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain. Buffett said on CNBC the move is \"part of a movement to succession over time.\" But the 87-year-old investor said the news had nothing to do with a change in his health.\n— CNBC's Liz Moyer, Matthew J.
