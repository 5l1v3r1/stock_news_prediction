There’s been great progress,” Graham Briggs, chair of the Working Group on Occupational Lung Disease, told Reuters ahead of a presentation on the topic he was to give at the Mining Indaba 2018 conference in Cape Town. \n“The faster we settle, the faster we can pay compensation to those who are entitled to it,” he said. \nThe six companies involved are Harmony Gold, Gold Fields, African Rainbow Minerals, Sibanye-Stillwater, AngloGold Ashanti and Anglo American. \nAnglo American no longer has gold assets but historically was a bullion producer. \nThe six companies said late last year they were making provisions for about 5 billion rand and Briggs said there was close to 4 billion rand in a compensation fund which companies have been contributing to for years. \n“Close to 9 billion rand will be paid to sufferers of silicosis and occupational tuberculosis,” he said. Silicosis causes shortness of breath, a persistent cough and chest pains, and makes people highly susceptible to tuberculosis. \nGraham said the looming settlement was a “compromise”. \nGold companies have said there are limits to what they can pay in the face of rising costs and often thin margins. \nThe logistics of the payouts will not be easy as many of the affected miners are in remote rural regions. \n“The biggest issue is finding these people so they can be paid,” said Briggs, a former chief executive of Harmony. \nHe said the industry still not know exactly how many claimants were entitled to compensation and estimates have run from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.
