Phillips assumes the role vacated by Rob Manning, who was recently elected to be a member of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Board of Trustees.\nPreviously director of EPRI’s Transmission, Distribution and Substation research area, Phillips has served in various leadership roles over his 21 years with the Institute. His work has focused on transmission and distribution asset research.\nPrior to joining EPRI, Phillips managed research of insulation, aging equipment and lightning for J.A. Jones Power Delivery company and performed research for the South African electric power industry at the University of Witwatersrand – the university where he earned bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering.\n“Andrew is widely known in the industry for his deep knowledge about transmission and distribution issues,” said EPRI President and CEO Mike Howard. “He is a visionary leader with the expertise to guide EPRI’s research at a time when we are focused on integrating solar, wind and microgrids into the energy delivery system while making it more efficient and reliable.”\nAs part of NERC’s 11-member Board of Trustees, Manning will apply his decades of electric industry experience in providing national leadership on reliability issues.\n“Rob’s exceptional leadership has been important to advancing EPRI’s Transmission and Distribution research and development efforts, including his overseeing our ongoing work on the potential impact on the grid of an electromagnetic pulse,” said Howard. “As he transitions to NERC, Rob is well-positioned to continue serving the public interest through this critical industry governing role.”\nBecause the NERC appointment precludes Manning from contributing to EPRI’s work in North America, he has stepped down as vice president of Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Infrastructure and will serve in a limited advisory capacity until April 1.\nAbout EPRI:\nThe Electric Power Research Institute, Inc.
