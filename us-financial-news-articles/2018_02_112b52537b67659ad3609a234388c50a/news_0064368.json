It allows the San Francisco-based appellate court to consider whether the Constitution’s prohibition on arbitrary detention requires that the aliens have some opportunity to seek parole while their cases, which can take years to resolve, move through the courts. \nAhilan Arulanantham, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who argued the aliens’ case, said he was ready to argue that the no-bail policy is unconstitutional. “The Trump administration is trying to expand immigration detention to record-breaking levels as part of its crackdown on immigrant communities. We have shown through this case that when immigrants get a fair hearing, judges often release them based on their individual circumstances,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T03:07:42.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
