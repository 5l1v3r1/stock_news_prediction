USA Hockey and the International Olympic Committee said the helmets worn by Nicole Hensley and Alex Rigsby do not require alterations. “Masks are approved,” USA Hockey spokeswoman Andrea Mazzarelli said in an email. “No modifications needed.” An IOC spokesman said: “It seems to have been a misunderstanding, we have not asked for the symbol to be removed.” Feb 5, 2018; Gangneung, KOR; USA goalie Alex Rigsby (33) looks on during a training session for the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Kwandong Hockey Centre.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon IOC rules state that “no form of publicity or propaganda, commercial or otherwise, may appear on persons, on sportswear, accessories or, more generally, on any article of clothing or equipment whatsoever worn or used by the athletes or other participants in the Olympic Games”. It is not the first time a question has been raised about symbols on a U.S. goaltender’s mask. At the 2010 Vancouver Games American men’s goalie Ryan Miller was required to cover up the words “Miller Time” on his mask. The phrase “It’s Miller Time” is a trademark of MillerCoors, a unit of Molson Coors Brewing Co, and has long been used to promote the Miller High Life and Miller Lite beer brands.
