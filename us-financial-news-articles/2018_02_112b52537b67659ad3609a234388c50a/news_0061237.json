The Environmental Protection Tax Law took effect on Jan. 1 requiring taxpayers to file quarterly, with the first period starting on April 1, it said. The law targets enterprises and public institutions that discharge listed pollutants directly into the environment, and stipulates that companies will have to pay taxes for producing noise, air and water pollutants, as well as solid waste, according to Xinhua. The tax is the latest in a string of measures the government has adopted to try to clean up the environmental legacy of decades of growth-at-all-costs economic development.
