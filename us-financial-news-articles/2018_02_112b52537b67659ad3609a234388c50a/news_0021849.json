Both proposals would require board approval.\nCemex shares were down more than 4 percent at 2128 GMT.\nAnalysts had expected Cemex to post a fourth-quarter net profit of $179 million, compared with $214 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFourth-quarter consolidated net sales were $3.4 billion, up 8 percent from the same period in 2016.\nMaher Al-Haffar, a Cemex executive vice president, said a 15 percent rise in fuel and electricity expenses in the quarter was mostly caused by high energy prices in Mexico.\nFourth-quarter net sales in Mexico, Cemex’s biggest market, rose 11 percent despite a drop in volume. The United States, Cemex’s second-biggest market, registered a 2 percent fall.\n“U.S. results in our view were the biggest disappointment in the quarter,” Barclays analyst Benjamin Theurer wrote in a report.\nThat performance helped push Cemex’s operating earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to slip 5 percent to $625 million during the fourth quarter.\nThe global cement industry is preparing for a slightly better year in 2018 as developed markets recover in Europe and the United States, the head of the World Cement Association said in January.
