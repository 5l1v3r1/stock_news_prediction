And the costs only escalated.\nElise's parents, Jennifer and Matt, downsized to a small apartment and one car. Matt worked two jobs before starting his own engineering business in Colorado Springs, Colorado. \nJennifer estimates that skating costs for Elise, now 11 and at the intermediate level, add up to roughly $60,000 a year — including lessons, registration fees, ice time and travel.\n\"It's a sport that requires technical direction all the time,\" Jennifer Freezer said. \"We tried to cut back on lessons but she struggled.\"\nTo make it work, the Freezers commute to a highly regarded but less expensive training facility in Edmonton, Alberta. They don't take vacations or eat out.\n\"We make the sacrifices and we still wonder if we can continue on this track,\" she said.\nCosts of raising an athlete At this year's Olympic Games, the competitions represent far more than athletic prowess and years of practice. They're also an accumulation of significant financial and emotional sacrifices.\nBeyond the mere 242 American athletes who have made it to the very top of their sport, millions of families invest in after-school activities for their children, starting as young as infancy and through every skill level and at almost any cost.\nAbout 40 percent of American families spend more than $1,000 a year on their children's extracurricular activities, and 20 percent spend more than $2,500 a year, according to a recent report by SunTrust Bank. A separate \"Parents, Kids and Money\" survey by T. Rowe Price found that a little over a quarter of all parents of 8-to-14-year-old children spent more than $200 on athletics alone per child.\nAlthough Americans have been doing a better job at savings, few have families with that kind of cash to spare. According to a 2017 GOBankingRates survey , more than half of Americans, or 57 percent, have less than $1,000 in their savings accounts . \nshow chapters How kids sports turned into a $15 billion industry      2:15 PM ET Fri, 1 Sept 2017 | 03:40 That's why an investment in sports, from Little League to private coaching, almost always requires a tradeoff.\n\"That's the exact money that would have funded a family vacation or been put in a retirement fund,\" said Susan Johnson, SunTrust's chief marketing officer.\nTo enable their children to pursue their passions, parents like the Freezers most often sacrifice dining out, vacations and retirement savings, SunTrust found.\nThe Freezers are realistic about the odds of Elise achieving her own Olympic dreams — let alone landing a triple axel like Mirai Nagasu — but seeing their daughter develop a strong work ethic and maintain a healthy, athletic lifestyle is its own reward, Jennifer said. \n\"When you are involved in a sport, you focus on the health of your body,\" she said. \"You don't have time to get involved in the wrong stuff.\"\nDisclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics.
