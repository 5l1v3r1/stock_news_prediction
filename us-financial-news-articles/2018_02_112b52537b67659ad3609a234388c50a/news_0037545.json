But many are unable to stay and work following graduation, due to visa restrictions. Nikias said that these policies cause the U.S. to lose valuable talent, particularly in STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). With the number of skilled workers in these areas reportedly dropping, the U.S. stands to suffer. \nInternational student enrollment in itself bolsters the U.S. economy. According to international education trade association NAFSA , international students contributed $36.9 billion in economic activity in 2016-17 and supported more than 450,000 jobs. But an increasingly aggressive approach to immigration is already beginning to discourage international students from coming to the U.S. to study. \nRead: Donald Trump, DACA and the Arguments Being Made For and Against Immigration Reform \nThe Institute of International Education found that new foreign enrollment in American universities dropped 3% from 2015 to 2016—the first time the growth trend reversed since the organization began tracking those figures. \nAlthough it may be too soon to place blame on the “Trump effect,” Nikias nevertheless finds cause for concern. “The secret of success in America, if you look at any industry sector, is that our universities have been a magnet for the best and the brightest from all over the world to come, be educated, and contribute in our society,” he said.
