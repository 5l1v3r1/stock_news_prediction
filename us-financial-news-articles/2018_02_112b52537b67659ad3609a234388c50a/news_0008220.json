Luo was meant to help Ford improve ties with local partners like Changan Automobile.\nToyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), which announced a 24.5 percent jump in its January China sales on Friday, will also recall 181,797 vehicles, the quality watchdog said in a separate statement.\nReporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk and Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Amrutha Gayathri\nOur ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:33:55.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
