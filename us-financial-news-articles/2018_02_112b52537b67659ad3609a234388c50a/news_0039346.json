Comparable Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin : 40 basis point decrease to 29.9% for the 21-hotel portfolio and 10 basis point decrease to 33.4% for the 14-hotel portfolio over the same period in 2016. Adjusted Hotel EBITDA : $42.5 million. Adjusted Corporate EBITDA : $37.3 million. Net income available to common shareholders : $27.6 million or $0.46 per diluted common share. Adjusted FFO : $28.4 million or $0.48 per diluted common share. Disposition : Sold the 222-room The Hotel Minneapolis, Autograph Collection for a sale price of $46.0 million.\n“We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter which were in line with our provided outlook. During the quarter, our hotels located in New Orleans and Santa Barbara were negatively impacted by Hurricane Nate and wildfires, respectively. Despite these negative impacts, RevPAR for our 14-hotel portfolio increased 1.2% over 2016, which was the strongest RevPAR quarterly growth rate of 2017 for our stabilized portfolio,” said James L. Francis, Chesapeake Lodging Trust’s President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Francis continued, “As we begin 2018, we are cautiously optimistic that the pro-growth political agenda, including the recent passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, will positively impact lodging demand as we proceed through the year. Furthermore, we believe the headwinds we experienced throughout 2017, resulting from the temporary closure of the Moscone Center in San Francisco and the three significant guestroom renovations, will provide tailwinds and position our hotel portfolio for outperformance relative to the U.S. lodging industry in 2018 and beyond.”\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe following is a summary of the consolidated financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions, except share and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total revenue $ 142.7 $ 145.1 $ 598.3 $ 619.7 Net income available to common shareholders $ 27.6 $ 9.7 $ 66.5 $ 67.0 Net income per diluted common share $ 0.46 $ 0.16 $ 1.11 $ 1.13 Adjusted Hotel EBITDA $ 42.5 $ 44.1 $ 188.6 $ 203.7 Adjusted Corporate EBITDA $ 37.3 $ 39.0 $ 169.5 $ 184.5 AFFO available to common shareholders $ 28.4 $ 28.4 $ 128.6 $ 140.4 AFFO per diluted common share $ 0.48 $ 0.48 $ 2.17 $ 2.39 Weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding 59,311,061 58,737,275 59,255,244 58,717,647 HOTEL OPERATING RESULTS\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Trust owned 21 hotels. The Trust uses the term “comparable” to refer to metrics that include only those hotels owned for the entirety of the two periods being compared. Since The Hotel Minneapolis, Autograph Collection was sold on November 8, 2017, it has been excluded from the hotel portfolio metrics below. During 2017, the following seven of the Trust’s 21 hotels were negatively effected as a result of (1) the negative impact on lodging demand in San Francisco resulting from the temporary closure and expansion of the Moscone Center and/or (2) significant guestroom renovations undergoing during the year: Le Meridien San Francisco, JW Marriott San Francisco Union Square, Hyatt Centric Fisherman’s Wharf, Hotel Adagio San Francisco, Autograph Collection, Boston Marriott Newton, Hilton Denver City Center, and Hyatt Regency Mission Bay Spa and Marina. As such, the Trust is reporting key operating metrics for a 14-hotel portfolio in addition to the 21-hotel portfolio. Included in the following table are comparisons of the key operating metrics for the 21-hotel portfolio and the 14-hotel portfolio for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except for ADR and RevPAR):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change 21-Hotel Portfolio\nComparable Occupancy 80.5 % 80.0 % 50 bps 83.1 % 83.9 % (80) bps Comparable ADR $ 219.48 $ 220.21 (0.3)% $ 225.21 $ 228.58 (1.5)% Comparable RevPAR $ 176.73 $ 176.15 0.3% $ 187.22 $ 191.89 (2.4)% Comparable Adjusted Hotel EBITDA $ 42,219 $ 42,990 (1.8)% $ 185,862 $ 199,169 (6.7)% Comparable Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin 29.9 % 30.3 % (40) bps 31.6 % 32.9 % (130) bps 14-Hotel Portfolio\nComparable Occupancy 82.6 % 81.2 % 140 bps 84.9 % 84.0 % 90 bps Comparable ADR $ 217.94 $ 219.02 (0.5)% $ 222.17 $ 226.01 (1.7)% Comparable RevPAR $ 179.91 $ 177.78 1.2% $ 188.67 $ 189.95 (0.7)% Comparable Adjusted Hotel EBITDA $ 27,120 $ 27,358 (0.9)% $ 117,300 $ 122,226 (4.0)% Comparable Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin 33.4 % 33.5 % (10) bps 34.9 % 35.6 % (70) bps Hotel EBITDA, Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin, Corporate EBITDA, Adjusted Corporate EBITDA, FFO, FFO available to common shareholders and AFFO available to common shareholders are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. See the discussion included in this press release for information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.\nDISPOSITION ACTIVITY\nOn November 8, 2017, the Trust sold the 222-room The Hotel Minneapolis, Autograph Collection located in Minneapolis, Minnesota for $46.3 million, including sold working capital, which resulted in a gain on sale of $6.1 million. The Trust acquired The Hotel Minneapolis, Autograph Collection in October 2012 for $46.0 million, or approximately $207,000 per key. The sale price of $46.0 million, or approximately $207,000 per key, represented a 6.2% trailing twelve month NOI cap rate (after factoring in a needed 2018 renovation estimated at $5.0 million, the sale price represented a 5.6% NOI cap rate).\nDIVIDENDS\nOn October 13, 2017, the Trust paid a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share to its common shareholders of record as of September 29, 2017. On December 18, 2017, the Trust declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share payable to its common shareholders of record as of December 29, 2017. The dividend was paid on January 12, 2018.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nThe Trust's 2018 outlook is as follows, and assumes no future acquisitions, dispositions, or financing transactions (in millions, except RevPAR and per share amounts):\nFirst Quarter\n2018 Outlook\nFull Year\n2018 Outlook\nLow High Low High CONSOLIDATED: Net income available to common shareholders $ 3.9 $ 5.6 $ 62.9 $ 69.4 Net income per diluted common share $ 0.06 $ 0.09 $ 1.06 $ 1.17 Adjusted Corporate EBITDA $ 29.6 $ 31.1 $ 175.5 $ 183.0 AFFO available to common shareholders $ 23.1 $ 24.9 $ 138.1 $ 144.6 AFFO per diluted common share $ 0.39 $ 0.42 $ 2.33 $ 2.43 Corporate cash general and administrative expense $ 3.0 $ 3.2 $ 10.8 $ 11.8 Corporate non-cash general and administrative expense $ 2.0 $ 2.0 $ 7.6 $ 7.6 Weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding 59.5 59.5 59.4 59.4 HOTEL PORTFOLIO: RevPAR $ 168.00 $ 172.00 $ 193.00 $ 197.00 RevPAR change as compared to 2017 (1) 1.0 % 3.0 % 3.0 % 5.0 % Adjusted Hotel EBITDA $ 34.5 $ 36.2 $ 193.8 $ 202.3 Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin 26.2 % 27.0 % 32.1 % 32.9 % Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin change as compared to 2017 (1) (75) bps 0 bps 50 bps 125 bps (1) The comparable 2017 period excludes results of operations for The Hotel Minneapolis, Autograph Collection, which was sold on November 8, 2017. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Trust reports the following eight non-GAAP financial measures that it believes are useful to investors as key measures of its operating performance: (1) Hotel EBITDA, (2) Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, (3) Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin, (4) Corporate EBITDA, (5) Adjusted Corporate EBITDA, (6) FFO, (7) FFO available to common shareholders and (8) AFFO available to common shareholders. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included in the accompanying financial tables.\nHotel EBITDA – Hotel EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, air rights amortization, corporate general and administrative, and hotel acquisition costs. The Trust believes that Hotel EBITDA provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s hotel operating performance, excluding the impact of the Trust’s capital structure (primarily interest), the Trust’s asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), and the Trust’s corporate-level expenses (corporate general and administrative and hotel acquisition costs).\nAdjusted Hotel EBITDA – The Trust further adjusts Hotel EBITDA for certain additional recurring and non-recurring items. Specifically, the Trust adjusts for non-cash amortization of intangible assets and liabilities, including ground lease assets and unfavorable contract liabilities, deferred franchise costs, and deferred key money, all of which are recurring items, and gains (losses) from sales of real estate, which is a non-recurring item. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the Trust also adjusted for the non-recurring impact resulting from the change in management at the Hilton Denver City Center (formerly the Denver Marriott City Center), which included a non-cash write-off of an unfavorable contract liability, a settlement gain, and transition-related expenses. The Trust believes that Adjusted Hotel EBITDA provides investors with another useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s hotel operating performance, excluding the effect of these items.\nAdjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin – Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted Hotel EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. The Trust believes that Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin provides investors another useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s hotel operating performance.\nCorporate EBITDA – Corporate EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. The Trust believes that Corporate EBITDA provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s operating performance, excluding the impact of the Trust’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and the Trust’s asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization).\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA – The Trust further adjusts Corporate EBITDA for certain additional recurring and non-recurring items. Specifically, the Trust adjusts for hotel acquisition costs and non-cash amortization of intangible assets and liabilities, including air rights contracts, ground lease assets and unfavorable contract liabilities, deferred franchise costs, and deferred key money, all of which are recurring items, and gains (losses) from sales of real estate, which is a non-recurring item. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the Trust also adjusted for the non-recurring impact resulting from the change in management at the Hilton Denver City Center (formerly the Denver Marriott City Center), which included a non-cash write-off of an unfavorable contract liability, a settlement gain, and transition-related expenses. The Trust believes that Adjusted Corporate EBITDA provides investors with another financial measure of its operating performance that provides for greater comparability of its core operating results between periods.\nFFO – The Trust calculates FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), which defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization, impairment charges of depreciable real estate, gains (losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most industry investors consider presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. By excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization and gains (losses) from sales of real estate, both of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, the Trust believes that FFO provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s operating performance.\nFFO available to common shareholders – The Trust reduces FFO for preferred share dividends, write-off of issuance costs of redeemed preferred shares, and dividends declared on and earnings allocated to unvested time-based awards (consistent with adjustments required by GAAP in reporting net income available to common shareholders and related per share amounts). FFO available to common shareholders provides investors another financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s operating performance after taking into account the interests of holders of the Trust’s preferred shares and unvested time-based awards.\nAFFO available to common shareholders – The Trust further adjusts FFO available to common shareholders for certain additional recurring and non-recurring items that are not in NAREIT’s definition of FFO. Specifically, the Trust adjusts for hotel acquisition costs and non-cash amortization of intangible assets and liabilities, including air rights contracts, ground lease assets and unfavorable contract liabilities, deferred franchise costs, and deferred key money, all of which are recurring items, and the write-off of issuance costs of redeemed preferred shares, which is a non-recurring item. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the Trust also adjusted for (1) the impact, net of tax, resulting from the change in management at the Hilton Denver City Center (formerly the Denver Marriott City Center), which included a non-cash write-off of an unfavorable contract liability, a settlement gain, and transition-related expenses and (2) the non-cash adjustment to the Trust’s deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, both of which are non-recurring items. The Trust believes that AFFO available to common shareholders provides investors with another financial measure of its operating performance that provides for greater comparability of its core operating results between periods.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Trust will host a conference call on February 15, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results.
