We will speak frankly about this today,” said German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel.\nSerbia’s refusal to recognize the independence of its former province Kosovo - something endorsed by most, though not all, EU states - is just one example of intractable regional disputes that threaten the Western Balkans’ Western integration.\nEU diplomats say that corruption and powerful criminal gangs that smuggle arms, drugs and migrants over European borders top a long list of problems the six Balkan hopefuls would have to crack down on if they are ever to be allowed into the EU.\nPoland, Italy and Austria are among other EU countries in favor of stepping up efforts to open the bloc to the region, which has seen growing Russian and Chinese influence.\n“Who will be first in Belgrade - China or the EU? It is that (which) we have to counteract, as it is our immediate neighborhood,” Austria’s Karin Kneissl told reporters.\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said he would host the heads of the Balkan states on March 1 for talks with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker on building new highways and railways to improve links with the EU.\nBut Slovenian Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec thought that even 2025 was “not realistic” as a goal, saying the Western Balkan states would need more time to settle their disputes and meet criteria for EU entry.\nFrance’s Jean-Yves Le Drian was also cautious. “It’s clear there are conditions and that those conditions are demanding.”\nAdditional reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek, Alissa de Carbonnel and Tsvetelia Tsolova, writing by Gabriela Baczynska; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T15:33:42.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
