His firm owns stakes in housebuilders Barratt Developments, Countryside and Taylor Wimpey, commercial property owners NewRiver REIT, Warehouse REIT and Regional REIT as well as online real estate agent Purplebricks. \nThe group said in January in a portfolio update that they remained convinced the UK housebuilders, including Crest, “all benefited from a more favourable environment than of late, but in our view, remain at very depressed valuation levels”. \nWoodford and Crest were not immediately available for comment on Monday.
