This one being a round brilliant cut - the asking price will be north of that,” Patti Wong, chairman of Sotheby’s Diamonds told Reuters.\nThe diamond is the only stone over 100 carats to have been given the highest grades in every criteria by the Gemological Institute of America, which judges a precious stone’s quality, Sotheby’s said.\nIt has not disclosed the asking price for the stone, which will be sold in a private sale.\nWriting by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T19:26:03.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
