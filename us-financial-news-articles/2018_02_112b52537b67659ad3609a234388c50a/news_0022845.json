In a statement on state television, he did not specify what caused the fire and gave no details of the children who he said were infants.\nA gendarmerie spokesman said: “There were five children who died in the clashes.”\nThe violence is linked to opposition fears that President Alpha Conde may seek to change the constitution to seek a third term at elections in 2020. Conde has declined to comment on his intentions.\nClashes broke out between young people wielding clubs and knives in several cities after opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo alleged fraud in Sunday’s long-delayed vote for mayors and neighborhood chiefs.\nViolence has also been reported since Sunday in the capital Conakry, where young people erected barricades and burned tires in some suburbs, and in the nearby city of Kindia, where a young man died on Monday in confrontations with security forces.\nShortly after the vote, Diallo denounced “massive fraud” and threatened that his supporters would take to the streets. The opposition charges that Conde is trying to install loyalists across different levels of government to smooth the path toward a possible constitutional change.\nConde’s ruling party has denied the accusations of fraud.\nIn a statement, Mohamed Ibn Chambas, the top U.N. official in West Africa, called on all sides “to avoid any acts of violence in order to allow the institutions in charge of the electoral process to pursue their work in serenity”.\nMany Guineans are also angry that the country’s rich reserves of bauxite, used to make aluminum, and iron ore have done little to address constant power cuts, sparse jobs and low public sector salaries.\nThose frustrations led to riots last year near some of the country’s largest bauxite mines, interrupting production and resulting in several deaths.\nReporting by Saliou Samb; Writing by Aaron Ross; Editing by Joe Bavier and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:31:54.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
