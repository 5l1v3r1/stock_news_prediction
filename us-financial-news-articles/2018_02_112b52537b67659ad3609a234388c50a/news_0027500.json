It attributed the latest rise to an 8.1 percent increase in income from financing and investments, an 18.2 percent climb in fees, and a 1.1 percent decline decline in total operating expenses. The latter improved due to a decrease in impairment charges and salary expenses, it said.\nSaudi banks’ performance in 2018 should be bolstered by an improvement in liquidity and an anticipated pick-up in lending as the government embarks on a stimulus of 72 billion riyals to support private-sector growth over the next four years.\nAl Rajhi’s results follow an 11.8 percent rise in fourth-quarter net profit last week by National Commercial Bank (NCB), the kingdom’s largest lender, helped by a drop in expenses and lower impairment charges.\nLoans and advances at the end of December stood at 233.54 billion riyals, gaining 3.8 percent on the same point of 2016, while deposits increased 0.2 percent to 273.06 billion riyals over the same period.
