There is no material impact to Credit Suisse,” the bank had said in a statement. \nA source familiar with the matter said the bank’s exposure to the U.S.-based product launched in 2010 was fully hedged. \nCredit Suisse has around 4.8 million units of the product. \nSuch ETPs seek to provide inverse exposure to VIX short-term futures and, when that measure spikes, the investment loses value, at which time ETP issuers could liquidate the shares. \nIt was not immediately clear if the issuers would opt to liquidate these products.
