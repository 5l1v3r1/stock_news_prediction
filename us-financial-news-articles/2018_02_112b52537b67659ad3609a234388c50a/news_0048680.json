A lawyer authorised to speak for Atul Gupta could not be reached for comment.\nPolice are searching for Ajay Gupta, one of Atul’s brothers, who has been declared a “fugitive from justice,” as part of their investigation into the dairy project.\nHowever, the police aren’t looking for Ajay, a spokesman for the elite police unit, the Hawks, which targets organised crime and corruption, said on Friday. Johannesburg’s main airport said on Friday that Ajay Gupta had left South Africa for Dubai on Feb. 6. Last week, the Hawks raided several Gupta properties in Johannesburg as part of the investigation into the Vrede dairy. The project was meant to benefit the local community, but prosecutors described it as a “scheme designed to defraud and to steal”.\nRelations between the Guptas and Zuma, who resigned last week after being instructed to do so by the ruling African National Congress party, are the focus of a separate judicial inquiry into high-level state corruption.\nA top judge will investigate whether the Guptas sought to influence the appointment of cabinet ministers and were unlawfully awarded state tenders.\nSouth Africa’s new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has made fighting corruption a top priority.\n$1 = 11.6411 rand Reporting by Alexander Winning and Tanisha Heiberg in Johannesburg and Wendell Roelf in Cape Town, editing by James Macharia, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:13:54.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
