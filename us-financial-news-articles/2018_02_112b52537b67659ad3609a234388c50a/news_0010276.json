Broadcom’s previous $70 per share offer consisted of $60 per share in cash and $10 per share in stock. \nBroadcom also plans to offer Qualcomm a higher-than-usual breakup fee in the event regulators thwart the deal, according to the sources. Typically, such break-up fees equate to approximately 3 percent to 4 percent of a deal’s size. \nThe sources cautioned that Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan may decide to significantly change the terms at the last minute. \nThe sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Broadcom and Qualcomm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. FILE PHOTO: A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nBroadcom has said it is very confident a deal can be completed within 12 months of signing an agreement. Qualcomm counters that the regulatory review processes required around the world would take more than 18 months and be fraught with risks. \nQualcomm provides chips to mobile carrier networks to deliver broadband and data, making it an attractive acquisition target for Broadcom, which hopes to expand its offerings in so-called 5G wireless technology. \nQualcomm has argued to its shareholders that Broadcom’s hostile bid is aimed at acquiring the company on the cheap. \nQualcomm reported quarterly profit and revenues last week that beat analysts’ expectations as demand surged for its chips used in smartphones and cars. However, its forecast was below estimates due to tepid mobile phone sales in China. \nQualcomm is engaged in a patent infringement dispute with Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ). Qualcomm has said the litigation is necessary in order to defend is licensing programs. \nQualcomm is also trying to clinch an acquisition of its own, proposing to buy NXP Semiconductors NV ( NXPI.O ) for $38 billion. The deal was approved by European Union antitrust regulators last month, and only China has yet to approve it. Qualcomm expects the government’s blessing later this month. \nThe NXP deal still faces an uncertain future as some of its shareholders, including activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have asked Qualcomm to raise its offer. Qualcomm is expected to make a decision later this month. Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Additional reporting by Liana B.
