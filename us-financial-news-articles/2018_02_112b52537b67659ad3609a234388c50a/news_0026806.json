The special committee of independent directors will also conduct a review of Wynn Resortsâ€™ internal policies and procedures on employee safety and workplace practices, it said. The committee has retained Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP as outside counsel. Steve Wynn resigned last week as CEO of Wynn Resorts following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances. The board of Wynn Resorts has been sued by shareholders, claiming the board knew for years that Steve Wynn, founder and chief executive of the casino operator, had been accused of sexual misconduct and failed to investigate.
