Its chief executive said on Thursday it was very likely the drilling ship would have to be moved to a new location in the coming days. Local media reported earlier on Friday it was heading to Limassol in Cyprus.\nCyprus will officially protest to international forums over the latest incident, Papadopooulos said.\nCypriot President Nicos Anastasiades was expected to discuss the issue with European Union leaders who are meeting in Brussels on Friday. He said this week that Cyprus was determined to press ahead with its plans for oil and gas exploration.\nEni and France’s Total discovered this month a promising natural gas field off Cyprus, which they said looked geologically similar to the mammoth Zohr field off Egypt.\nCyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Peace talks collapsed last year. Greek Cypriots, who are exploring for natural gas, run Cyprus’s internationally recognized government. Turkish Cypriots run a breakaway state in north Cyprus recognized only by Ankara.\nReporting by Renee Maltezou; Additional reporting Angeliki Koutantou in Athens and Stephen Jewkes in Milan; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:41:16.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
