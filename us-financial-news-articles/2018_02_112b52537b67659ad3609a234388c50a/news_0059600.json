( tmsnrt.rs/29xzYxX )\nThe results were also crimped by a slide in prices for iron ore fines, used to make pellets and later steel, which fell to $63.10 per tonne in the fourth quarter from $67.17 in the third quarter and $69.40 in the same period last year.\nHowever, base metals boasted their best quarterly showing since 2011, thanks to higher prices and lower costs.\nCash flow increased to $2.744 billion in the quarter, helping Vale to cut net debt by 14 percent on a sequential basis to $18.143 billion.\nVale has said it expects to slash debt to $10 billion by mid-2018.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 13 percent to $4.109 billion, still exceeding a consensus estimate of $3.865 billion compiled by Thomson Reuters.\nReporting by Alexandra Alper; Editing by Tom Brown and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T02:16:53.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
