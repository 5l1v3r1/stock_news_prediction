We remain on track to double the value of the bank by full-year 2021,” Chief Executive Officer Craig Meller said.\n$1 = 1.2776 Australian dollars Reporting by Sandhya Sampath in Bengaluru and Paulina Duran in Sydney; Editing by Jane Wardell and Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:41:32.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
