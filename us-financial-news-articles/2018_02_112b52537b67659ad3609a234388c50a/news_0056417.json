The scrapping of language that limits a president’s time in power to two terms is part of a set of constitutional amendments lawmakers are expected to rubber stamp at their annual parliamentary session, which starts in a week — a formality in Xi’s march toward dominance. \nWhile the presidency wields no executive powers, lifting the 10-year cap on Xi’s role as head of state would allow him to retain indefinitely a post he has used to champion China’s resurgence as a great power. The move also suggests Xi will try to flout party retirement norms and stay on as the party’s general secretary — the true source of his authority — beyond 2022.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T11:52:37.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
