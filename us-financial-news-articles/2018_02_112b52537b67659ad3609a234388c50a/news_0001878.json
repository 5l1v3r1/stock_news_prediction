The finance ministry is expected to publish the volume of foreign-exchange purchases for February on Feb 5.\nRussia started buying foreign currency early last year to beef up its reserves.\n“The main factor of the increase (of purchases) was the rising Urals price,” Stanislav Murdashov, an analyst with Raiffaisenbank, said.\nUrals, Russia’s blend of crude oil URL-E, was trading at $67.84 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude LCOc1, the global benchmark, was at $69.53 after climbing to three-year highs over $71 per barrel at the end of January.\nRussian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has said his ministry planned to increase purchases of foreign currency in 2018, spending a total of around 2 trillion rubles if Urals prices are at $54 to $55 per barrel.\n($1 = 56.1475 rubles)\nReporting by Zlata Garasyuta, writing by Polina Nikolskaya, editing by Katya Golubkova, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:08:23.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
