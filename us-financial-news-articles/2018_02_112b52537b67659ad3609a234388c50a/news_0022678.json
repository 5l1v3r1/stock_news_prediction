Under the terms of the agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $12.35 in cash, and an additional undisclosed accrued cash distribution.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether CAFD's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, the deal significantly undervalues the Company. According to an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc., this is a disappointing deal with very low \"odds of a competing proposal emerging.\" Further, when commenting about the acquisition, another analyst at JMP Securities LLC did not express much confidence, stating that \"[i]t may not appear that they maximized the value of the [C]ompany.\"\nMoreover, following the acquisition announcement, CAFD shares traded for as low as $11.77, a drop of nearly 20% from the Company's February 2 trading price of $14.55.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether CAFD's Board acted in the best interests of CAFD's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.
