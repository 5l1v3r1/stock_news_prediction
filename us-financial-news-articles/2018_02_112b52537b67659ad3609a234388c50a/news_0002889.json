There will be no passporting rights.”\nMichel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, has already made clear in public that Brussels will reject suggestions from the City of London that institutions maintain those “passports”, which allow them to offer services across the 28-nation bloc.\nHe has, however, said that some British regulations could be treated as “equivalent” to the EU supervisory regime, giving some favourable access.\nAt Tuesday’s meeting, part of a series of “seminars” by the negotiating team with national envoys as the EU prepares for a start of talks in April on a post-Brexit relationship, indicated a broad consensus behind that view, several diplomats said.\nBecause Britain was leaving the EU’s Single Market and rejecting its rules, including arbitration by the EU court, one said: ”It’s clear that they will lose passporting rights as this is part of the internal market and our regulatory regime.\n“When they do that, the only other alternative is what we have in some of our FTAs,” the person added, referring to free trade agreements the EU has with other countries.\nAnd while Barnier has said that free trade accords have in the past offered only very limited access for financial services providers, he has said there was a willingness to look at the possibilities of “equivalence”.\nSome envoys expressed caution about how far that could be done, while others were more open to closer cooperation.\n“Equivalence” would be granted “case by case” to certain types of activity, the diplomats were told.\n“It will, at best, be much less, and only specifically justified per sector. That’s the rub,” one of them said. Some areas of business would not be able to get such a deal.\n“The key message was that given the UK’s red lines,” another diplomat said, “A free trade agreement is the only possible cooperation scheme.” (Writing by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Peter Graff)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:01:05.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
