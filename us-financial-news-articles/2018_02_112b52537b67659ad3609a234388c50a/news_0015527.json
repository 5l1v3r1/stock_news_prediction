Slideshow (2 Images) \nHe was taken to another French prison close to the Belgian border on Monday night. The courtâ€™s president said Abdeslam had now decided he did not wish to appear again on Thursday. \nPolice said Abdeslam fled Paris on the night in November 2015 when attackers including his elder brother killed 130 people. \nPolice conducted what they thought would be a routine search related to the Paris attacks at an apartment in the Brussels district of Forest in March 2016. Four officers were hurt and one gunman killed. His co-accused, Sofien Ayari, told the court on Monday that both he and Abdeslam were in the apartment at the time and fled the scene.
