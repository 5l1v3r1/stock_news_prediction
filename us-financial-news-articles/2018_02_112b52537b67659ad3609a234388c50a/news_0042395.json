Ings, who has recovered from successive knee injuries, has fought his way back into the first team and marked his Champions League debut with an assist as Liverpool ran out 5-0 winners at Porto in the first leg of their last-16 tie last Wednesday. “From the moment I started training back with the lads, I tried to learn every day – especially from Bobby,” Ings told the club’s website. (www.liverpoolfc.com) ”He is a fantastic player with the way he plays and the amount of work he does for the team, not just on the ball but off the ball as well. ”They are the things I have to look at and learn from, and that’s what I did over the months I was out. “Being back training with them every day, you get used to the patterns the manager wants and the intensity he wants. I‘m learning every day from all the lads here and trying to be the best player I can be.” Ings, who missed the majority of the last two seasons, is relishing the opportunity to get more time and helping Liverpool impose themselves in the league and in Europe. “After that long period out and all the hard work I didn’t want to give up. It’s such a great club and a great team, it’s all I wanted to be part of,” Ings added. ”Going into the back end of the season now, I know that if I work hard enough I can get some more minutes and try to contribute to the team as much as I can. “I‘m looking forward to it.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T09:13:37.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
