Following that meeting, our initial enthusiasm for RLJ’s purchase of FelCor Lodging Trust (“FelCor”) abruptly changed to grave concern. While we had hoped to work collaboratively with the Board of Directors (the “Board”) by bringing our questions and concerns to light while encouraging the Company to take corrective measures, in our view the Board did not bring an appropriate level of thoughtfulness or sophistication to addressing these serious concerns.\nSpecifically, we were deeply troubled by our conversations with management regarding the Company’s financials, as detailed below. Mr. Bierkan and Ms. Hale failed to offer concrete answers that demonstrated a definitive working knowledge of the Company’s financials. We believe that the actions of these executives are a strong indication that the interests of RLJ’s Board and management are not aligned with the interests of shareholders.\nFollowing our conversations with Mr. Bierkan and Ms. Hale, we sent a private letter to the Board on June 28, 2017, which expressed our serious misgivings about Mr. Bierkan’s ability to make the transition to CEO, a move that required different skill sets from those needed in his prior roles. We noted the following fact pattern which led us to the following conclusions:\nMr. Bierkan and Ms. Hale had no credible response to our questions about discrepancies brought to light in the Company’s S-4 registration statement/joint proxy statement (the “Proxy”) filed on June 2, 2017. Specifically, the disclosures regarding RLJ’s expected EBITDA for 2017 and 2018 supplied to FelCor on February 12, 2017 are inconsistent with the guidance RLJ provided 10 days later when it announced full year 2016 results. The Proxy contains expectations that are $14 million above what was disclosed when RLJ provided 2017 guidance to the investment community. 1 While the Proxy was subsequently updated by the Company following our private letter, no other formal response has been given. Mr. Bierkan and Ms. Hale seemed to lack an understanding of why there was a nearly 15% material reduction in FelCor’s EBITDA guidance. RLJ’s disclosed estimates of FelCor’s 2017 and 2018 EBITDA are substantially below the guidance FelCor provided investors, as well as the EBITDA FelCor provided to its Board. 2 There has been no meaningful explanation for this discrepancy. Mr. Bierkan and Ms. Hale consistently seemed to be “winging it” when it came to addressing our questions. This apparent lack of sophistication causes us to continue to have grave concerns about the leadership of our Company post-merger and the fairness of the merger to FelCor’s shareholders. Case in point: management denied they gave any guidance regarding second quarter results at NAREIT, yet analyst reports and earnings estimates reflected there are further changes to 2017 estimates which are not reflected in the Proxy that investors are being asked to rely upon when voting on the merger.\nThe RLJ Board is in need of relevant capital markets and REIT experience, coupled with capital allocation and operating expertise, in order to reverse the dismal share price and ultimately place the Company on a path to value creation. This is why we have nominated four independent and highly-qualified candidates for election to the Board at RLJ’s 2018 annual meeting, two of whom are women, and all of whom have the relevant public markets and/or REIT experience necessary to help maximize shareholder value. Unfortunately, rather than work constructively with us regarding opportunities to improve value at RLJ, including with respect to board composition, the Company chose to appoint Robert J. McCarthy, who lacks critical capital markets and REIT experience.\nSincerely,\nJonathan Litt\nFounder & Chief Investment Officer\nLand & Buildings\nAbout Land & Buildings:\nLand & Buildings is a registered investment manager specializing in publicly traded real estate and real estate related securities.
