HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Natixis ( CNAT.PA ) and Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) are advising Novares on its stock market flotation. \nInvestment fund Equistone owns a 72.3 percent stake in Novares, while French state bank BPI holds 15.1 percent. \nPierre Boulet, chairman and chief executive of Novares, said the IPO implied a stock market capitalisation of between 470-550 million euros, and added that Novares planned to pay out a dividend from 2020 onwards. \nNovares’ revenue is expected to grow 7.9 percent to 1.18 billion euros for 2017, rising 7 percent to 1.2-1.25 billion euros in 2018, and by more than 7.5 percent in 2019.
