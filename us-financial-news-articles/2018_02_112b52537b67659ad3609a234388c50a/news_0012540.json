FEMA last month said it would continue to provide water, meals and other basic needs after earlier reports that it was going to halt aid. \nThe House committee’s announcement follows an earlier controversy involving contractor Whitefish Energy Holdings, a small Montana firm hired to restore the island’s power despite a lack of experience. Governor Ricardo Rossello later canceled that deal. \nAfter winning the October 2017 FEMA contract, Tribute delivered just 50,000 meals to the U.S. territory and was terminated for cause 20 days later, said Representative Elijah Cummings, the committee’s top Democrat. \n“It is unclear why FEMA or any agency would have proceeded with a contract worth $156 million in light of this company’s poor contracting history and these explicit warnings,” he wrote, citing documents obtained by panel Democrats. \nCummings and fellow Democrat Stacey Plaskett called on the panel’s Republican chairman, Trey Gowdy, to subpoena FEMA for documents on the company and its alleged failure to deliver millions of meals. \nGowdy’s spokeswoman Amanda Gonzalez said that sending a subpoena was premature but that the panel would continue to review hurricane recovery efforts. \nFEMA said it could not comment on Tribute, but that at the time the contract was terminated food distribution in Puerto Rico “was not affected.” \nAgency spokeswoman Jenny Burke said meals continue to be provided on the island and that “there are sufficient commodities both in Puerto Rico and on the mainland to continue to meet identified needs for current or future disasters.” \nA website for Brown shows her other companies include beauty, fashion, interior design and health and wellness businesses.
