In a dangerous situation in Syria, (Turkey) should not add war to war.” \nFrance has backed the Syrian opposition during the seven-year war and is part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting against Islamic State militants. \nLe Drian said international law “is being violated by Turkey, by the Damascus regime, by Iran and those who are attacking (rebel-held areas) eastern Ghouta and Idlib”.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer \nTurkey launched an operation in Syria last month against Kurdish militia which it views as allies of separatists fighting an insurgency in southern Turkey. Its European Union Minister Omer Celik said Le Drian’s statement reflected “a double standard on the issue of terror”. \n“Turkey’s fight conforms to international law. Those who violate the law and commit crimes are those who arm the PYD-YPG terror groups,” he said of the main Syrian Kurdish militia. \nLe Drian is due in Tehran on March 5 for talks at a time when Washington has put pressure on European allies to toughen their stance on Tehran. Relations between France and Iran have deteriorated in recent months. Le Drian has accused Iran of harboring “hegemonic” aspirations in the region. \nIran is a key ally of the Syrian government in the seven-year civil war and it says it has no intention of withdrawing unless Syria requests it do so.
