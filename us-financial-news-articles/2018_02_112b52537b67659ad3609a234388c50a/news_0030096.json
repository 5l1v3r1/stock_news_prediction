(Reuters) - A shooter opened fire in a Florida high school on Wednesday morning, killing multiple people and sending hundreds of panicked students fleeing into the streets while others huddled in classrooms as police hunted for the gunman. Dozens of police swarmed Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, about 45 miles (72 km) north of Miami after the attack before they took the suspected shooter into custody Wednesday afternoon. “There are numerous fatalities. It’s a horrific situation,” Broward Country Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie told reporters. He said the school district had gotten no warning of a potential shooter and that there was no evidence of more than one shooter. “We have at least 14 victims,” the Broward County sheriff’s office said on Twitter. It did not make clear if that number included people who were wounded in addition to the dead. Students hid in classrooms until they were rescued by police in tactical gear, friends and family members said. McKenzie Hartley, 19, who identified herself as the sister of a student at the school described the scene in a text message to Reuters: “She heard him shooting through the windows of classrooms and two students were shot.” Students are evacuated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School during a shooting incident in Parkland, Florida, U.S. February 14, 2018 in a still image from video.
