There isn’t a better element than nickel to increase energy density, and there isn’t a better element than cobalt to make the stuff stable. So (while) you hear about designing out cobalt, this is not going to happen in the next three decades. It simply doesn’t work.”\nBelgium’s Umicore, a leading supplier of materials for electric vehicle batteries, including cobalt, said last week that it had raised 892 million euros ($1.1 billion) in an equity placement to help fund investments in its fast-expanding rechargeable battery materials business.\nCobalt prices COB-CATH-LON have more than tripled in the last two years after projections of buoyant demand growth for electric cars led to increased consumption of metals used in their batteries, a mix that also typically includes lithium.\nMore than half of annual mined supply of cobalt is sourced from Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been riven by two decades of conflict.\nIn the near term, enough cobalt is being produced to meet demand from the electric vehicle industry, Grynberg said, with Umicore sourcing Congolese metal via a responsible supply agreement audited by PwC.\nIn the longer term, recycled supply will be needed, he said. The company expects to ramp up recycling of spent electric vehicle batteries to “significant” levels in the next seven to nine years, when more feedstock returns to the market.\n“In 10 years’ time it will still be relatively modest, but in 20 years’ time it will be a significant proportion of our (usage),” he said.\n“If you look at a more mature market, like the market for catalysts that contain platinum group metals, about half of our supply is coming from recycling.”\nReporting by Jan Harvey; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:34:43.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
