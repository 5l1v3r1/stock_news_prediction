Revenue rose 37 percent to 2.66 billion ringgit from 1.94 billion, although revenue per available seat km fell 4 percent.\nLoad factor, a measure of how full its planes are, rose 1 percentage point to 88 percent in the quarter while total passenger volume was up 17 percent to 10.4 million to outpace 16 percent growth in capacity.\nThe group said it expects to have an average load factor of 87 percent in the first quarter of 2018, based on current forward booking.\nThe group is also planning for a net increase of five aircraft through operating leases in the first quarter of 2018 to meet growing demand in the region, it said in a bourse filing.\nGroup CEO Tony Fernandes said in a statement that the group intends to more than double its fleet to 500 aircraft by 2027.\nHe also said ongoing internal reorganisation to simplify the group’s structure was on track to complete in the second quarter of 2018.\n“We believe that this new group structure will improve efficiency and transparency, which in time to come will help us achieve the fair valuation that reflects the true value of AirAsia,” he said.\nFernandes also said the group would soon conclude the sale of leasing business Asia Aviation Capital.\nAirAsia announced reorganisation plans last August, aiming to consolidate its various regional affiliates under one holding company while targeting rapid expansion in its core Southeast Asian markets.\nAdditionally, the group has segregated its businesses into airline transportation and digital divisions to provide better clarity and business focus across each division.\n“This new structure will also give our rising digital ventures the same prominence as our traditional airline business,” Fernandes said.\n($1 = 3.9060 ringgit)\nReporting by Liz Lee; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T16:05:59.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
