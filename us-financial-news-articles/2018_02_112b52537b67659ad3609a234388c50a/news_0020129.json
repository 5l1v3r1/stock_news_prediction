Jordan, Lupita Nyong‘o and Angela Bassett, “Black Panther” was hailed by the Daily Beast as “a love letter to every black person” and “a correction for years of diversity neglect” by Rolling Stone. \nThe Disney movie, opening worldwide next week, tells the story of T‘Challa, the newly crowned king of the fictional, technologically advanced African nation Wakanda, who is challenged from factions within his own country. \nThe movie arrives after years of criticism about the under representation of actors and filmmakers of colour in Hollywood, including the #OscarsSoWhite campaign that prompted the Academy of Motion Pictures to increase diversity in its predominantly while, male membership.

And just like ‘Wonder Woman,’ it was worth the wait.” Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Sandra Maler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T20:27:06.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
