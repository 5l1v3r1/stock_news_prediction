A Chinese volunteer medical team saved my life when I was young. Now Chinese kids are building a railroad for us...I love Chinese people. I love China!”\nThe internet lit up with criticism after the show aired on Thursday night, the eve of Lunar New Year.\n“The racial discrimination was so clear,” wrote one microblogger, who goes by the name Chen Fei Tutu.\n“Is this our nation propagating Chinese values? When white people discriminate against us, we are strongly dissatisfied, but now we are discriminating against Africans in such high profile. How shameful.”\nChinese actor Lou Naiming (C) performs a skit on a Lunar New Year gala in Beijing, China, February 15, 2018. Picture taken February 15, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request on Friday from Reuters seeking comment on the racism allegations.\nOn its Weibo microblog, online information platform Tutopia said, “Imagine if it was a white person in blackface saying in an exaggerated accent, ‘I love America,’ and not being blasted by the whole world.”\nChinese actor Lou Naiming (2-R) performs a skit on a Lunar New Year gala in Beijing, China, February 15, 2018. Picture taken February 15, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer Others declared the sketch, aired during the “CCTV Spring Festival Gala” that traditionally draws hundreds of millions of viewers, an embarrassment.\nThe more than four-hour-long program of skits, music and dance has been a television staple since it was first broadcast in 1983. The highlight of this year’s show was a reunion duet by two of China’s most famous pop stars.\nPublic discussion of racial discrimination is unusual in China, which is dominated by the ethnic Han majority but is also home to dozens of minority groups as well as a growing influx of foreign residents, including Africans.\nIn 2016, a laundry detergent company in China apologized after running an advertisement in which a black man was stuffed headfirst into a washing machine only to emerge a moment later as a fair-skinned Asian man.\nAt the time, the Foreign Ministry called the sequence an isolated commercial that had prompted no diplomatic complaints, but added that China respected all countries, no matter their ethnicity or race, and was “good brothers” with African countries.\nChina has forged increasingly close ties with many African nations in its hunt to satisfy demand for commodities in its booming economy. Beijing has rejected accusations of neo-colonialism in Africa, saying its aid there has no strings attached and is widely welcomed.\nReporting by John Ruwitch; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T13:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T14:18:06.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
