REUTERS/Stringer \nAlmost 120,000 people have received some form of asylum to Italy over the past four years, while roughly 200,000 migrants live in shelters awaiting the result of asylum requests. Many others have left Italy and headed to northern Europe. \n“VENDETTA” \nOpinion polls say the centre-left will lose next month’s parliamentary election, with Berlusconi’s centre-right bloc set to win the most seats, lifted in part by rising support for the League though short of an absolute majority.

Italian Carabinieri/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS PICTURE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY \nAfter taking charge of the League in 2013, Salvini shunted the party to the far right, adopting an uncompromising anti-immigration stance and allying himself with the National Front in France and the anti-Islam Freedom Party in the Netherlands. \nHis strategy appears to be paying off - polls suggest the League will win up to 14 percent of the vote against 4.1 percent in 2013, challenging Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party for supremacy in their centre-right bloc. \nShooting attacks are very rare in Italy and it was not clear if Saturday’s violence would damage Salvini. However, pollsters say his calls for mass deportations of the mainly African migrants now living in the country have resonated in the past. \nThe six people injured on Saturday came from Nigeria, Mali, Ghana and Gambia. None suffered life-threatening wounds. \nTraini’s attack came just days after a Nigerian migrant was arrested in connection with the death of an 18-year-old Italian woman, whose dismembered body was discovered stuffed into two suitcases near Macerata. \n“The most likely hypothesis is that (Traini) carried out this mad gesture as a form of vendetta,” Carabinieri police commander Michele Roberti told Sky TG24 on Sunday. “He was lucid, determined and aware of what he had done.” \nTraini is being held in solitary confinement and is expected to be charged in the coming days with attempted murder and racism. It was not clear when a trial might be held.
