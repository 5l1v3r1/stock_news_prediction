Open more than 275 new new locations in the U.S. Adjusted earnings of $2.40 to $2.45 per share. Low- to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth. \"2018 will look a lot like 2017 in terms of performance,\" David Hoffmann, president of Dunkin' Donuts U.S., said at the Investor Day.\nHoffmann said Dunkin' is laying the foundation in 2018 for future growth by simplifying its menu, creating a new store design and refreshing its branding.\nThe company also unveiled its targets for 2020. It expects:\nSame-store sales growth in the low single digits that could accelerate to 3 percent. Open about 1,000 net new Dunkin' locations by the end of 2020. Low-single-digit growth in same-store sales at Baskin-Robbins. Low- to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth. While the company is still focused on morning sales that occur before 11 a.m., it's also working to unlock growth during the afternoon.

The company plans to continue to offer seasonal treats, like heart-shaped doughnuts for Valentine's Day, alongside its traditional 12 best-selling doughnuts.\nIn addition to menu changes, the company is launching a new store design to make ordering at its restaurants simpler and faster for customers.\nIn 2018, the company is set to open 275 net new stores in the U.S., with plans to open 1,000 net new locations by the end of 2020. Hoffmann said 90 percent of these openings will be built outside of the Northeast, its most highly saturated area.\n(Source: Dunkin' Brands)\n(Source: Dunkin' Brands)\nDunkin' said that 75 percent of all new restaurants will have a drive-thru lane, as restaurants with drive-thrus have 40 percent higher sales volume than non-drive-thru locations.

It did not specify how many locations would have these lines.\nHoffmann said that Dunkin' will be doing twice as many remodels as new store openings, with the majority of the focus on locations in the Northeast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T17:46:50.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
