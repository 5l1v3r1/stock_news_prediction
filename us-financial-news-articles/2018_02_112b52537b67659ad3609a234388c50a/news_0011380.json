Dublin has found an ally in Hungary on the issue and has also been boosting alliances with Nordic and Baltic states since like-minded Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU.\nDonohoe said such alliances would help with his nomination of Irish central bank chief Philip Lane for the post of European Central Bank vice president.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Lane is so far the only declared candidate two days before nominations close but Donohoe is “certain” there will be at least one more, likely proposed by Spain. Its economy minister Luis de Guindos has long been considered the favorite for the job.\nECONOMY OVERHEATING? Donohoe, who added the finance ministry to his brief as public expenditure minister in June, inherited an economy that had recovered rapidly from collapse a decade ago and is almost certain to have been the best performing in Europe for a fourth successive year in 2017.\nHaving warned just weeks into his new role that Ireland must be careful not to overheat the economy, Donohoe said on Monday those risks remained unchanged but that he did not believe the economy is currently overheating.\n“We still believe there are people who are not working at the moment who can work again, who want to work again and economic activity has to get to the point to move them back into paid employment,” the 43-year-old economics graduate said.\n“Secondly, if I look at the wage growth that is taking place in the economy, while it does vary very strongly sector to sector, on average it is in line with the kind of growth rate in national income that we are seeing at the moment.”\nDonohoe, whose department last forecast in October that the economy would grow by 3.5 percent in 2018, said he was confident that growth would come in at 3.5 to 3.75 percent this year.\nEditing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T23:22:31.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
