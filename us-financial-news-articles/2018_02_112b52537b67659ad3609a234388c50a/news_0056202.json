The regulation will take effect at the end of April.\nWith several bouts of freezing weather sweeping across China in late January and early February, some coal-fired power plants warned of tight supplies of the fuel as their inventories fell below critical levels due to record daily consumption.\nData released this month showed that China brought in a total of 27.81 million tonnes of coal in January, the highest level in four years.\n“Imported coal will continue to play a key role as a supplement of domestic coal until mid-March as heating demand in northern China remain robust,” said a Zhengzhou-based trader, adding coal imports may tighten again afterwards.\nThe heating season typically ends on March 15 in northern China.\nVessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts suggest China will import about 21.68 million tonnes of seaborne coal in February.\nChina’s thermal coal prices on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange hit 679.8 yuan ($106.89) a tonne on Jan. 29, up from around 390 yuan a year earlier.\nTo ensure stable coal supplies, state- and local-level authorities have ordered miners to ramp up production and asked ports to speed up the process of receiving seaborne coal.\nPrices of spot cargoes of thermal coal from Australia’s Newcastle port, touched a 13-month-high at $109.50 on Jan. 17.\nShipments from Russia also rose in January. It went up 43 percent to 2.53 million tonnes. That compares with 2.14 million tonnes in December.\nImports from Mongolia, however, were down 40.8 percent to 1.85 million tonnes from a year ago and down from December’s 2.83 million tonnes due to congestion at the border with China.\nReporting by Muyu Xu, Josephine Mason and Pei Li; Editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T10:04:30.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
