(“Brighthouse Financial”) (Nasdaq: BHF) announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nThe company reported net income of $668 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, or $5.58 on a per share basis, compared to a net loss of $1,765 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with stockholders’ equity (“book value”) of $14.5 billion, or $121.19 on a per share basis, and book value, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), of $13.1 billion, or $109.71 on a per share basis.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported adjusted earnings* (previously reported as operating earnings) of $992 million, or $8.28 on a per share basis. Results for the fourth quarter included a $947 million favorable impact, or $7.91 on a per share basis, primarily related to the re-measurement of the company’s net deferred tax liability due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“tax reform”) during the quarter. Excluding the impact of tax reform, adjusted earnings for the quarter would have been $45 million, or $0.37 on a per share basis.\nAdjusted earnings for the quarter also included $152 million of net unfavorable notable items, or $1.27 on a per share basis, including:\n$53 million in unfavorable reserve adjustments from recaptured business, partially offset by reserve refinements, in the company’s universal life with secondary guarantees (“ULSG”) book of business; $47 million in establishment costs related to planned technology and branding investments; $38 million increase in reserves related to certain legacy non-retail, group annuity contracts administered by the company’s former parent; and $14 million unfavorable impact from tax items related to the company’s separation from its former parent.\nAnnuity sales increased 26 percent quarter-over-quarter and 25 percent sequentially, primarily driven by sales of Shield annuities, which increased 74 percent quarter-over-quarter and 22 percent sequentially.\n“We are pleased with the sales performance of our annuity products in the quarter, and with the progress we have made in building Brighthouse Financial into a standalone company and a recognizable brand,” commented Eric Steigerwalt, president and chief executive officer, Brighthouse Financial. “As we continue to execute on our strategy in 2018, we believe our sales momentum and focus on expense management will serve as positive drivers towards achieving our goals.”\nKey Metrics (Unaudited, dollars in millions except share and per share amounts)\nAs of or for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Total Per share Total Per share Net income (loss) $668 $5.58 $(1,765) N/A Adjusted earnings (1) $992 $8.28 $(61) N/A Book value $14,515 $121.19 $14,862 N/A Book value, excluding AOCI $13,140 $109.71 $13,597 N/A Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 119,773,106 — N/A N/A Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 119,773,106 — N/A N/A Ending common shares outstanding 119,773,106 — N/A N/A Ending common shares outstanding - diluted 119,773,106 — N/A N/A (1) The company uses the term \"adjusted loss\" throughout this news release to refer to negative adjusted earnings values. * Information regarding the non-GAAP and other financial measures included in this news release and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures discussion below as well as in the tables that accompany this news release and/or the Fourth Quarter 2017 Brighthouse Financial, Inc. Financial Supplement (which is available on the Brighthouse Financial Investor Relations web page at http://investor.brighthousefinancial.com ). Additional information regarding notable items can be found on page 13 of this news release.\nResults by Business Segment and Corporate & Other (Unaudited, in millions)\nFor the Three Months Ended Adjusted earnings December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Annuities $208 $355 $292 Life $5 $6 $(24) Run-off $(80) $83 $(349) Corporate & Other $859 $(1,120) $20 Sales (Unaudited, in millions)\nFor the Three Months Ended December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Annuities (1) $1,341 $1,074 $1,067 Life $3 $5 $33 (1) Annuities sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 include $203 million in sales of a fixed indexed annuity product sold by MassMutual, representing 90% of gross sales of that product. Annuities\nAdjusted earnings in the Annuities segment were $208 million in the current quarter, compared to adjusted earnings of $292 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and adjusted earnings of $355 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nThere were no notable items in the current quarter. The fourth quarter of 2016 included $46 million of favorable notable items and the third quarter of 2017 included $142 million of favorable notable items. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, adjusted earnings reflect higher expenses and lower derivative net investment income. On a sequential basis, adjusted earnings reflect higher expenses.\nAs mentioned above, overall annuity sales increased 26 percent quarter-over-quarter and 25 percent sequentially, primarily driven by strong sales of Shield annuities, which increased 74 percent quarter-over-quarter and 22 percent sequentially.\nLife\nAdjusted earnings in the Life segment were $5 million in the current quarter, compared to an adjusted loss of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and adjusted earnings of $6 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nThere were no notable items in either the current quarter or in the fourth quarter of 2016. The third quarter of 2017 included $17 million of unfavorable notable items. Quarter-over-quarter life insurance product underwriting results, in the aggregate, were flat, reflecting elevated mortality that was offset by lower reinsurance costs. Resegmentation activity between the Life and Run-off segments in the fourth quarter of 2016 makes quarter-over-quarter segment-level analysis between Life and Run-off less meaningful this period. On a sequential basis, adjusted earnings reflect unfavorable underwriting due to elevated mortality.\nLife insurance sales were down, consistent with the company’s strategy of migrating to simpler life insurance solutions and away from products such as participating whole life. The company expects life insurance sales to remain at similar levels over the next 12 to 18 months, as it revamps its life insurance business.\nRun-off\nThe adjusted loss in the Run-off segment was $80 million in the current quarter, compared to an adjusted loss of $349 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and adjusted earnings of $83 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe current quarter contains $91 million of unfavorable notable items, while the fourth quarter of 2016 included $399 million in unfavorable notable items. The third quarter of 2017 included $9 million in favorable notable items. As mentioned above, quarter-over-quarter life insurance product underwriting results, in the aggregate, were flat, reflecting elevated mortality that was offset by lower reinsurance costs. Resegmentation activity between the Life and Run-off segments in the fourth quarter of 2016 makes quarter-over-quarter segment-level analysis between Life and Run-off less meaningful this period. On a sequential basis, adjusted earnings reflect unfavorable underwriting due to elevated mortality coupled with higher expenses.\nCorporate & Other\nCorporate & Other had adjusted earnings of $859 million in the current quarter, compared to adjusted earnings of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an adjusted loss of $1,120 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe current quarter contains $886 million of favorable notable items, primarily due to tax reform, while the fourth quarter of 2016 did not include notable items. The third quarter of 2017 included $1,104 million in unfavorable notable items, primarily related to a non-cash tax expense triggered prior to separation, recognized by the company’s former parent. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, adjusted earnings reflect higher corporate expenses and lower net investment income. On a sequential basis, adjusted earnings reflect higher taxes.\nNet Investment Income\nOn a quarter-over-quarter basis, net investment income decreased $16 million to $769 million, primarily from a reduction in the size of the securities lending program and a lower average asset base. On a sequential basis, net investment income in the quarter reflected a slight increase of $8 million.\nThe net investment income yield was 4.30 percent during the quarter.\nStatutory Capital and Liquidity (Unaudited, in billions)\nAs of December 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nVariable annuity assets above CTE95 (1) $2.6 $2.3 N/A Statutory combined total adjusted capital (2)(3)\n$6.6 $6.6 $5.4 (1) Conditional Tail Expectation (\"CTE\") 95 is defined as the amount of assets required to satisfy contract holder obligations across market environments in the average of the worst 5 percent of 1,000 capital market scenarios over the life of the contracts (\"CTE95\"). (2) Represents combined results for Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY and New England Life Insurance Company. (3) Reflects preliminary statutory results as of December 31, 2017. Capitalization\nHolding company liquid assets were $655 million at December 31, 2017.\nStatutory total adjusted capital on a preliminary basis remained at $6.6 billion.\nAssets above CTE95 increased to $2.6 billion due to strong market performance in the quarter.\nEarnings Conference Call\nBrighthouse Financial plans to hold a conference call and audio webcast to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time 13, 2018.\nTo listen to the audio webcast via the internet, please visit the Brighthouse Financial Investor Relations webpage at http://investor.brighthousefinancial.com .

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business.\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:\nNon-GAAP financial measures:\nComparable GAAP financial measures:\nadjusted earnings net income (loss) adjusted revenues revenues adjusted expenses expenses adjusted earnings per common share earnings per share adjusted return on equity return on equity Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP measures are included in this news release. These adjusted measures were previously referred to as operating measures.\nOur definitions of the non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this news release may differ from those used by other companies. For example, as indicated below, we exclude guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”) revenues and related embedded derivatives gains (losses) as well as GMIB benefits and associated DAC and value of business acquired (“VOBA”) offsets from adjusted earnings, thereby excluding substantially all guaranteed minimum living benefit (“GMLB”) activity from adjusted earnings.\nAdjusted Earnings, Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Expenses\nAdjusted earnings, which may be positive or negative, is used by management to evaluate performance, allocate resources and facilitate comparisons to industry results. This financial measure focuses on our primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, as well as businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by us, referred to as divested businesses.\nProvided below are the adjustments to GAAP revenues and GAAP expenses used to calculate adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses, respectively. Adjusted earnings, as presented in this news release, reflects adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, both net of income tax.\nThe following are significant items excluded from total revenues, net of income tax, in calculating the adjusted revenues component of adjusted earnings:\nNet investment gains (losses); Net derivative gains (losses) except: earned income on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (“Investment Hedge Adjustments”); and Amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (loss) and net derivative gains (losses) and certain variable annuity GMIB fees (“GMIB Fees”). (1)\nThe following are significant items excluded from total expenses, net of income tax, in calculating the adjusted expenses component of adjusted earnings:\nAmounts associated with benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs (“GMIB Costs”); (1) Amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts (“Market Value Adjustments”); and Amortization of DAC and VOBA related to (i) net investment gains (losses), (ii) net derivative gains (losses), (iii) GMIB Fees and GMIB Costs and (iv) Market Value Adjustments. (1)\nThe tax impact of the adjustments mentioned is calculated net of the U.S. statutory tax rate, which could differ from our effective tax rate.\nConsistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance.\nAdjusted Earnings per Common Share and Adjusted Return on Equity\nAdjusted earnings per common share and adjusted return on equity are measures used by management to evaluate the execution of our business strategy and align such strategy with our shareholders’ interests.\nAdjusted earnings per common share is defined as adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average number of fully diluted shares of common stock outstanding for the period.\nAdjusted return on equity is defined as total annual adjusted earnings on a four quarter trailing basis, divided by the simple average of the most recent five quarters of total stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI.\n(1) Collectively, amounts related to GMIB, excluding amounts recorded in NDGL, may be referred to as “GMIB adjustments.”\nOther Financial Disclosures\nBook Value per Common Share, excluding AOCI\nBrighthouse uses the term “book value” to refer to “stockholders’ equity.” Book value per common share is defined as ending stockholders’ equity, including AOCI, divided by ending common shares outstanding - diluted. Book value per common share, excluding AOCI, is defined as ending stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, divided by ending common shares outstanding - diluted.\nSales\nStatistical sales information for Life sales is calculated using the LIMRA definition of sales for core direct sales, excluding company-sponsored internal exchanges, corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance, and private placement variable universal life insurance. Annuity sales consist of 100 percent of direct statutory premiums, except for fixed indexed annuity sales distributed through MassMutual that consist of 90 percent of gross sales. Annuity sales exclude company sponsored internal exchanges. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity.\nHolding company liquid assets\nHolding company liquid assets include liquid assets in Brighthouse Financial, Inc., Brighthouse Holdings, LLC, and Brighthouse Services, LLC. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and collateral financing arrangements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe information presented in this news release is derived from the consolidated financial statements of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. for periods subsequent to the separation from MetLife, Inc. that occurred on August 4, 2017, and is derived from the combined financial information of the MetLife U.S. Retail Separation Business for periods prior to the separation.
