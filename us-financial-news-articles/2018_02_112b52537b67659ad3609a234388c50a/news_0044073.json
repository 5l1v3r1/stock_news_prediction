After REITs have traded at a premium for at least six months but then trade at a discount, a year later data show they have outperformed.\n“You’ve seen time and time again REITs outperform in that scenario,” Durkay told reporters during a presentation on the relationship between rising rates and REIT underperformance.\n“Only at a point in time when you see rising interest rates and decelerating growth do REITs underperform,” she said. “That’s a key component.”\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T01:24:33.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
