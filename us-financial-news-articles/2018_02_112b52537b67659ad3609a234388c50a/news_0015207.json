The world's largest futures exchange, CME, and its competitor, Cboe, launched bitcoin futures trading in December. \nDue to increasing transaction fees and longer confirmation times, bitcoin has also become less effective as a means of commerce. The cryptocurrency has also rapidly plunged from its record high, briefly dropping below $6,000 this week. \n\"I don't really think of bitcoin as a currency. I think of it as a novelty. The idea that these virtual currencies are ever going to compete with the dollar is hard to fathom,\" Kashkari said. He said that although bitcoin itself may be scarce like gold, \"the problem is the barrier for entry for anybody creating another version of bitcoin is zero.\" \nKashkari did acknowledge that in countries with less political stability, such as Venezuela, a virtual currency not tied to the government could be attractive. \nBitcoin traded up about 8 percent by midday Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T19:14:35.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
