Ackman told CNBC's Scott Wapner on Wednesday in a phone call that he had unwound the position. Herbalife shares jumped 9% to an all-time high on Wednesday. The activist investor had placed a massive bet against the nutritional supplement maker he accused of running a pyramid scheme. He expected the shares to fall to zero, enabling him to profit on his short sale of the stock. But the bet proved disastrous. Last November, after Herbalife shares had climbed 51% for the year, he announced he had closed out the short position he had in the shares and converted it into a bet using put options. The Icahn -Ackman fight happened on Jan. 25, 2013, while Ackman was being interviewed by telephone by Wapner. Ackman was responding to attacks by Icahn the previous day over Ackman's claims that Herbalife was \"a well-managed pyramid scheme.\" Icahn called in to the show, saying \" Ackman is a liar \" and that he had \"one of the worst reputations on Wall Street.\" \"I've really about had it with this guy,\" Icahn said. \"He's like the crybaby in the schoolyard.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T19:27:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
