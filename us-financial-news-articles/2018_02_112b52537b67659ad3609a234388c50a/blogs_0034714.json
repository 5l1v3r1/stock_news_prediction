REUTERS/Francois Lenoir NATO currently has a small training team of fewer than 20 people working out of the British embassy in Baghdad that started in early 2017, but is considered by Washington as too small for an alliance of 29 countries with training experience that reaches from the Balkans to Afghanistan.\nStoltenberg’s support for a bigger mission is a sign the alliance may be willing to drop its earlier resistance.\nOPEN-ENDED COMMITMENT?\nEuropean NATO allies fear another open-ended foreign assignment after more than a decade in Afghanistan, but diplomats said France and Germany were showing more openness to a larger Iraq mission, as long as it remains limited in scope.\nTurkey will need to be convinced, the diplomats said, noting that a dispute between Ankara and Washington in the fight against Islamic State in Syria had complicated talks on Iraq.\nNATO’s potential involvement comes as Iraq faces a bill of more than $88 billion to rebuild the country, officials told a donor conference in Kuwait this week. Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December, having taken back all the territory captured by the militants in 2014 and 2015.\nTrump, who as a candidate during the 2016 presidential campaign said NATO would be “obsolete” if it did not do more to combat militants, has urged the allies to act or face more attacks in European cities.\nKatie Wheelbarger, principal U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said Mattis was seeking “an enduring NATO presence in Iraq”.\nAdditional reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T13:18:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
