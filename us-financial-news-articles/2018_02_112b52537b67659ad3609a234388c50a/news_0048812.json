Riley Nash set up the Bruins’ lone All-Star representative for the five-hole goal against Flames goaltender David Rittich.\nDavid Pastrnak also scored his 22nd goal of season and Rask improved to 24-10-4 on the campaign for Boston. The Bruins bounced back from Saturday’s season-worst 6-1 loss at Vancouver and improved to 7-2-0 in February.\nMatthew Tkachuk (22nd goal) had the lone score and Rittich (6-3-3) recorded 30 saves for Calgary, which dropped its second in a row after being outscored 6-3 by Florida on Saturday. The Flames fell to 5-5-0 this month.\nThe Bruins beat the Flames 5-2 last Tuesday in Boston in the first of the two regular-season meetings between the teams this season, with Nash and Patrice Bergeron each netting a pair of goals.\nPastrnak’s first goal since Feb. 3 against Toronto put the Bruins ahead 1-0 with 14:01 to play in the opening period. The deft Czech capitalized on a Flames giveaway and tapped in the puck stick-side past Rittich.\nTkachuk tied it on a power-play goal with 14:32 left in the second, sliding in a rebound of Sean Monahan’s shot from the circle through Zdeno Chara’s legs in the crease.\nCalgary native Morgan Klimchuk made his NHL debut for the Flames, but the 22-year-old left wing did not find his way onto the scoresheet.\nBruins defenseman Kevan Miller missed his eighth straight game with an upper-body injury despite being a game-time decision. Coach Bruce Cassidy said before the game that he expected Miller to return in the next two games.\nBoston continues its five-game road trip Tuesday in Edmonton. Calgary opens a two-game trip Wednesday at Vegas.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:21:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
