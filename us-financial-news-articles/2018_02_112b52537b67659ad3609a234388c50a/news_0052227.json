He said some 15 to 16 migrant families had been turned away at recent sessions without complaints.\nBut Sabine Werth, head of the nationwide Tafel group, said that while no-one had a specific right to receive food from any branch, it was wrong to exclude any particular group.\nRalf Rosenbrock, who heads the German Equal Welfare Association, another charitable organization, was also critical.\n“The volunteer Tafel group in Essen is clearly overwhelmed by growing demand, but you can’t solve that by discriminating along ethnic lines,” he told Reuters TV.\nHe said the federal government was to blame for policies that left many in poverty and lacking food.\nThe Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported that many older German clients had felt uncomfortable coming to the food bank given the large number of migrants, including many young single men.\n“When we opened the door in the morning, there was a lot of pushing and shoving without any regard to the granny in the line,” the paper Quote: d Sartor as saying.\nReporting by Reuters TV; Writing by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:30:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
