They want to defeat you and I am not defeated, I am the same,” she told reporters after training for Wednesday’s downhill.\nAlpine Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women’s Downhill Training - Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 19, 2018 - Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. and Breezy Johnson of the U.S. smile.

Definitely before the race I don’t go on social media, I may post something but I don’t look at anything,” she said.\n”I always try to remember that is people talking behind a computer and they are going to say anything and the most important thing is that I am having a good time, I am enjoying being at the Olympics, my family is here, they love me.\n”There are of course going to be people who hate me and hope I ski off a cliff and die. That’s fine – I‘m not going to do that.\n“I just take it for what it is, at some point you just have to laugh and say it is completely ridiculous.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T07:26:53.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
