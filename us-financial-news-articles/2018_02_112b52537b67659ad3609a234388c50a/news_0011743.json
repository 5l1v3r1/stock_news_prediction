In exchange, the Term Lenders will receive 100% of the equity of Charlotte Russe, subject to dilution from a management equity incentive plan.\nJenny Ming, Chief Executive Officer of Charlotte Russe, said: “This marks an important milestone in Charlotte Russe’s history and we are pleased with the collaborative efforts from all stakeholders that were needed to make this happen. We have accomplished our goals of right-sizing our capital structure and operating expenses, and look forward to executing against our long term vision and strategy. We are excited to work together with our new owners and Board on the next chapter for Charlotte Russe.”\nRecognizing the benefits of an out-of-court process to the Company, its stakeholders, and employees, the Company and the Term Lenders negotiated the framework of a consensual restructuring in late Fall. The restructuring was subject to the Company meeting several conditions set forth in a restructuring support agreement. Most notably, the Company was required to obtain a threshold amount of annualized operational savings, including rent relief, and the commitment of 100% of the Term Lenders to participate in the out-of-court restructuring. The significant annualized operational savings, including rent relief, achieved during this process will allow for the reinvestment needed to grow the business and improve profitability.\nCooley LLP and Moelis & Company LLC served as the Company’s legal and financial advisors. The Term Lenders were advised by Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP and Berkeley Research Group, LLC.\nAbout Charlotte Russe, Inc.\nCharlotte Russe is a fashion brand for young women, offering affordable on-trend apparel, shoes and accessories for all sizes, with a fun and engaging shopping experience wherever and whenever she wants.
