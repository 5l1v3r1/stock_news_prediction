It expects to welcome a record 37.55 million tourists in 2018. \nEnvironmental rights groups have urged successive governments to protect Thailand’s palm-fringed beaches, which are frequently voted among the world’s most beautiful, from unregulated development and littering, among other things. \nA law that came into force on Thursday is aimed at tackling this problem, said Bannaruk Sermthong, a director at the Office of Marine and Coastal Resources Management. \n“Starting today, smoking and cigarette-butt littering are prohibited on beach areas,” Bannaruk told Reuters. \n“Anyone who wants to smoke must do so in designated smoking areas, not on the beaches.” \nThe law protects 24 beaches in 15 provinces located along the Andaman coast and the Gulf of Thailand. \nAnyone who violates the law will be taken to a criminal court and could face up to one year in jail, or a fine of up to 100,000 baht ($3,190), or both. \nThailand has 357 beaches nationwide. \n($1 = 31.34 baht)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T09:23:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
