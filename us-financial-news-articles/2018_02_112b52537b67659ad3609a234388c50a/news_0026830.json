More than 600,000 migrants have arrived on Italy’s shores from North Africa in the last four years. \nOfficials in Macerata, in central Italy, had originally banned the event due to fears of violence involving extreme right-groups, and only authorized it on Friday. \nItalians and migrants peacefully carried Italian flags and banners against violence and racism, and flew red, heart-shaped balloons with the names of the victims of the shooting. \nOne placard read “fascist Salvini” a reference to Matteo Salvini, the leader of the right-wing Northern League party which campaigns strongly against illegal immigrants. \nHowever, in a sign of widespread and growing anti-migrant sentiment in Italy, none of the leaders of the main parties attended the march. \n\nA demonstrator holds a banner reading \"Peace\" during an anti-racism rally in Macerata, Italy, February 10, 2018. REUTERS/Yara Nardi “We are here because we want to be a dam against this mountain of hate which is spreading continuously, a social hate against migrants and, in general, against the poor,” Francesco Piobbicchi told Reuters. \n“The political parties are using populism to create hate, terror and division,” said fellow marcher Valentina Giuliodora. \n\nSlideshow (6 Images) The Feb. 3 shootings happened just days after a Nigerian migrant was arrested in connection with the death of an 18-year-old Italian woman whose dismembered body was discovered stuffed into two suitcases near Macerata. \nThe shooter, 28-year-old Luca Traini, a former Northern League candidate at local elections, told police he was avenging the woman, named as Pamela Mastropietro. \n“Today we are here in Macerata because what happened here was a terrorist act,” said Amin Nour, an African migrant. “We are sorry for what happened to Pamela, it was something horrible, but monsters have no color or origin, they are just monsters.” \nNorthern League leader Salvini, speaking at a rally in northern Italy, said he was “ashamed as an Italian” of the march. \nwriting by Gavin Jones; Editing by Stephen Powell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T21:00:34.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
