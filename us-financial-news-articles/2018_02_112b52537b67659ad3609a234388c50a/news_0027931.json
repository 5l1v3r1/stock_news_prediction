Before Wednesday's revelation, Berkshire was already the fourth-largest Apple shareholder, according to FactSet. \n\"IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors too,\" Buffett told CNBC last year.\nStill, Berkshire's latest announcement comes at an interesting time for both Apple and IBM.\nRivals in the 1980s, IBM and Apple have taken very different paths over the years: IBM has struggled with trends in enterprise technology, while Apple has become a dominant force in consumer electronics. \nBut Big Blue revenue grew in January for the first time in 23 quarters, perhaps a sign that the company's pivot to analytics, cloud, mobile and security has taken hold. Wall Street-darling Apple, meanwhile, has faced an unusual level of criticism, amid product issues like production delays, security patches and battery replacements.", "external_links": ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000095012318002390/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml"], "published": "2018-02-15T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T00:15:34.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
