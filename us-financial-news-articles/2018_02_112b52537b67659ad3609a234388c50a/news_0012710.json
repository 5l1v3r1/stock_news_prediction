They favor an open and transparent competition between political parties and candidates rather than agreements behind closed doors.”\nNATIONAL LEADERS RESIST National politicians, who retain much of the ultimate power in the Union, are however skeptical of Parliament’s democratic credentials -- only 43 percent of eligible voters bothered to cast a ballot last time, and the trend in turnout has been downward.\nFILE PHOTO: French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech in the garden of the French Embassy in Dakar, Senegal, February 2, 2018. REUTERS/Ludovic Marin/Pool After the center-right list led by former Luxembourg prime minister Juncker finished first with 29 percent, many national leaders, including the group’s own leading light, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, were reluctant to nominate him to run the Commission and rejected Parliament’s insistence they must.\nThey did, however, choose Juncker in the end, but some have already made clear they do not want to repeat the experience.\nMany leaders, including Macron, see it as infringing on their collective power as the European Council to name the chief executive. Some argue it is even illegal under the EU treaty.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker delivers a speech during a debate on the Future of Europe at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, February 6, 2018.

The assembly in Strasbourg approved a plan to reduce the chamber by 46 seats and to share out the other 27 of Britain’s 73 seats among the remaining 27 countries, correcting some under-representation determined by population size.\nThat disappointed some of the more strongly federalist groups, who accused the center-right and eurosceptic parties of thwarting their hopes of allocating some of the British seats to the creation of “transnational lists”, which would let voters across the EU vote for some of the same candidates.\nEU officials have played down the chance of national leaders approving such a plan for next year. It requires consensus and some have already spoken against it, partly on fears that winning candidates would mainly come from bigger states.\nMany also doubt that all 27 countries would be able to change their electoral laws in time for the May 2019 EU vote.\nHowever, Macron, who has argued for deeper European integration since setting up his own party and winning power in France last May, said he would go on arguing for the proposal.\nHis new party has yet to form cross-border alliances within the European Parliament, limiting its influence, and he opposes the Spitzenkandidat idea which favors the big parties.\nWriting by Alastair Macdonald in Brussels; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:26:25.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
