The company had guided for 300 million euros negative impact on full-year revenues in October.\nIt expects this trend to continue, with a negative impact of about 1.0-1.1 billion euros on 2018 revenues and about 20 basis points on adjusted EBITA margin.\nEqually, for its current fiscal year, the developer of the Triconex system, a recent target of a hackers attack, expects its organic top-line growth between 3-5 percent and the organic adjusted EBITA margin expansion towards the upper end of the 20-50 basis points range.
