Due to the one-time impacts of U.S. tax reform, reported first quarter net earnings were lower than the comparable 2017 reported net earnings of $45.0 million or $0.41 per share on net sales of $515.8 million. Adjusted 2018 first quarter net earnings were $52.1 million, or $0.48 per share, which includes $0.06 benefit from the lower corporate tax rate, partially offset by $0.03 attributed to the excess tax deduction for share-based compensation, compared to adjusted net earnings of $40.1 million, or $0.37 per share in the comparable 2017 period, an increase of 29.7 percent. Please see the tables and information below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share to the comparable GAAP measures.\nFirst quarter operating earnings as a percent of sales were 12.2 percent, an improvement of 50 basis points compared to 11.7 percent in the same period last year. The reported tax rate for the first quarter was 66.0 percent compared to 24.5 percent last year. The quarter was significantly impacted by the enactment of U.S. tax reform. The increase was driven by the provisional re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and provisional calculation of the deemed repatriation tax, which resulted in discrete tax charges of $20.5 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The unfavorable impact of these one-time charges was partially offset by the benefit resulting from the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate. The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 21.5 percent, compared to the adjusted tax rate of 32.7 percent in the same period last year. The adjusted tax rates exclude the one-time charges associated with U.S. tax reform and the benefit of the excess tax deduction for share-based compensation. The company currently estimates that its full fiscal year adjusted 2018 effective income tax rate will be about 23 percent. For fiscal 2019 the company currently estimates that its adjusted effective income tax rate will be about 21 to 23 percent.\n“Fiscal 2018 is off to a good start, achieving record operating performance in the first quarter,” said Richard M. Olson, Toro’s chairman and chief executive officer. “We continue to build momentum in the professional segment driven by increased demand for product offerings across the portfolio worldwide. Our landscape contractor businesses benefitted from strong orders for our professional zero-turn mowers, led by our Exmark® line which recently expanded its RED Technology platform. This new technology enables unprecedented communication among key mower systems to increase machine efficiency, ease of use, and long term durability.”\n“We are seeing positive trends in our golf business with increased sales of greens mowers and large reel units that feature our Toro® EdgeSeries™ reels. Customers are impressed by the enhanced quality of cut and reduced maintenance costs these reels deliver. The new Outcross™ 9060 also generated excitement at the recent Golf Industry Show. This new turf-friendly machine features smart technology designed to simplify operation providing greater flexibility in the deployment of labor.”\n“As we head into our key selling season, we are prepared to address customer demand by executing consistently and efficiently. With our new Vision 2020 employee initiative underway, we have a renewed focus around our Lean and productivity efforts, which will help the team to better manage working capital and expenses across our businesses. We will continue to strive towards increasing flexibility in our operations, while maintaining our commitment to delivering innovative solutions to our customers in the industries they serve.”\nThe company continues to expect revenue growth for fiscal 2018 to exceed 4 percent, and now expects adjusted net earnings per share to be about $2.67 to $2.73 for the year. For the second quarter, the company expects adjusted net earnings per share to be about $1.17 to $1.22. These adjusted estimates exclude the one-time charges associated with U.S. tax reform and the benefit of the excess tax deduction for share-based compensation.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nProfessional\nProfessional segment net sales for the first quarter were $403.7 million, up 8.6 percent from $371.8 million last year. Strong performance across our professional portfolio drove the positive results for the quarter. Sales of zero-turn riding mowers in our landscape business increased as the channel prepares for the selling season ahead. Demand for golf equipment also contributed to the results as courses make investments in their fleets and irrigation systems. Finally, increased sales of our ag irrigation products also had a positive impact on the quarterly performance. Partially offsetting the revenue growth was the BOSS® snow and ice management business, which was affected by lower than average snowfall in key customer markets. Professional segment earnings for the first quarter were $75.9 million, up 11.4 percent from $68.2 million in the same period last year.\nResidential\nResidential segment net sales for the first quarter were $142.5 million, up 1.5 percent from $140.4 million last year. Channel demand for our zero-turn riding mowers, in preparation for the selling season, drove the results for the quarter. Below average snowfall early in the season, paired with below average snow events in the Midwest, negatively impacted sales of our residential snow thrower product lineup for the quarter. However, late season snowfall did generate favorable retail activity, which helped to further reduce channel inventories at quarter end. Residential segment earnings for the first quarter were $15.7 million, down 5.1 percent from $16.6 million in the comparable period last year.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nGross margin as a percent of sales for the first quarter was 37.3 percent, a decrease of 20 basis points compared to last year. Increased commodity costs and unfavorable product mix within the segments largely contributed to the decline, somewhat offset by the impacts of foreign currency.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percent of sales for the first quarter was 25.1 percent, a decrease of 70 basis points from the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the leveraging of expenses over higher sales volume.\nAccounts receivable at the end of the first quarter were $198.7 million, up 8.1 percent from last year. This increase was due largely to higher sales volume and the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates in the year over year comparison. Net inventories were $439.3 million, up 9.3 percent from last year. This increase was mainly due to higher anticipated planned sales in several businesses and the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates in the year over year comparison. Trade payables were $266.6 million, up 14.7 percent from the comparable period last year.\nAbout The Toro Company\nThe Toro Company (NYSE: TTC) is a leading worldwide provider of innovative solutions for the outdoor environment, including turf, snow and ground engaging equipment and irrigation and outdoor lighting solutions.

Management believes these measures may be useful in performing meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results, to understand the performance of its ongoing operations and how management views the business. Reconciliations of adjusted non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP measures are included in the financial tables contained in this press release. These measures, however, should not be construed as an alternative to any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Toro Company does not attempt to provide reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP EPS guidance to projected GAAP EPS guidance because the combined impact and timing of recognition of these potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts. In addition, we believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of financial performance.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains , which are being made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\nThe following table provides reconciliations of financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP as well as adjusted non-GAAP financial measures presented in the accompanying press release. The company believes these measures may be useful in performing meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results, to understand the performance of its ongoing operations, and how management views the business. The following is a reconciliation of our reported net earnings, reported diluted earnings per share (EPS), and reported effective tax rate to our adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted effective tax rate:\nNet Earnings Diluted EPS Effective Tax Rate February 2, February 3, February 2, February 3, February 2, February 3, Three Months Ended 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 As Reported - GAAP $ 22,604 $ 44,990 $ 0.21 $ 0.41 66.0 % 24.5 % Impacts of tax reform 1 : Net deferred tax asset revaluation 2 20,513 — 0.19 — (30.9 )% — % Deemed repatriation tax 3 12,600 — 0.11 — (19.0 )% — % Benefit of the excess tax deduction for share-based compensation 4 (3,576 ) (4,868 ) (0.03 ) (0.04 ) 5.4 % 8.2 % As Adjusted - Non-GAAP $ 52,141 $ 40,122 $ 0.48 $ 0.37 21.5 % 32.7 % 1 The actual impact of the U.S. tax reform may differ from our estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and changes in our structure or business model. 2\nSigned into law on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0 percent, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the company of 23.3 percent for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. This reduction in rate requires the re-measurement of the company's net deferred taxes as of the date of enactment which resulted in a non-cash charge of $20.5 million.\n3\nThe Tax Act imposed a one-time deemed repatriation tax on the company's historical undistributed earnings and profits of foreign affiliates which resulted in a one-time charge of $12.6 million as of February 2, 2018, payable over eight years.\n4\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2017 the company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock-based Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting, which requires that any excess tax deduction for share-based compensation be immediately recorded within income tax expense. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $3.6 million as an excess tax deduction for share-based compensation. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate which reduced the tax benefit related to share-based compensation by $1.6 million as of February 2, 2018.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222005353/en/\nThe Toro Company\nInvestor Relations\nHeather Hille, 952-887-8923\nDirector, Investor Relations\nheather.hille@toro.com\nor\nMedia Relations\nBranden Happel, 952-887-8930\nSenior Manager, Public Relations\nbranden.happel@toro.com\nSource: The Toro Company", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetorocompany.com%2Finvest&esheet=51762555&newsitemid=20180222005353&lan=en-US&anchor=www.thetorocompany.com%2Finvest&index=4&md5=7d84bc33c20d278786f82242237b41d0", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222005353/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetorocompany.com%2Finvest&esheet=51762555&newsitemid=20180222005353&lan=en-US&anchor=www.thetorocompany.com%2Finvest&index=2&md5=a44d10ec196f91ecf3c2b37fd0c7437d", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.streetevents.com&esheet=51762555&newsitemid=20180222005353&lan=en-US&anchor=www.streetevents.com&index=3&md5=e406f718190891c0de383943b7733331", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetorocompany.com&esheet=51762555&newsitemid=20180222005353&lan=en-US&anchor=www.thetorocompany.com&index=1&md5=7123ba815f4e1b45f1bdff6191950e4a"], "published": "2018-02-22T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:29:34.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
