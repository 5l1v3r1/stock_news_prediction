Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan said last year robots could replace 48,000 of the bank’s human employees, who were too error-prone and inefficient.\nNatWest said its prototype, which can have a two-way verbal conversation with customers via computers, tablets or mobile phones and learn from mistakes, could boost efficiency and provide another channel for customers to get support.\nCora could free up human colleagues to deal with more complex issues, the bank continued, adding that testing has suggested customers who have avoided digital services might be more inclined to interact with a “digital human”.\nReporting by Emma Rumney; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T18:50:50.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
