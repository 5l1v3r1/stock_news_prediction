We are also on track to achieve our year-one cost savings targets. The separation of our U.S. Public Sector business and combination with Vencore and KeyPoint Government Solutions continues to progress with the filing of the Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.”\nFinancial Highlights - Third Quarter Fiscal 2018\nDiluted earnings per share was $2.68 in the third quarter, including $(0.56) per share of restructuring costs, $0.05 per share of pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains, $(0.23) per share of transaction and integration-related costs, $(0.36) per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets and $1.63 per share of tax adjustment related to U.S. tax reform. This compares with $0.21 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.15. Income before income taxes was $438 million in the third quarter, including $(213) million of restructuring costs, $17 million of pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains, $(94) million of transaction and integration-related costs, and $(149) million of amortization of acquired intangibles. This compares with $50 million in the year ago period. Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $877 million compared with $589 million in the year ago period on a pro forma combined company basis. Net income was $779 million for the third quarter, including $(161) million of restructuring costs, $14 million of pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains, $(68) million of transaction and integration-related costs, $(104) million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $473 million of tax adjustment related to U.S. tax reform. This compares with $37 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBIT was $927 million in the third quarter compared with $626 million in the prior year on a pro forma combined company basis. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.0% compared with 9.5% in the year ago quarter which is presented on a pro forma combined company basis. Net cash provided by operating activities was $999 million in the third quarter, compared with $563 million in the year ago period. Adjusted free cash flow was $686 million in the third quarter.\nGlobal Business Services (GBS)\nGBS revenue was $2,315 million in the quarter as compared to $1,046 million for the prior year. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, GBS revenue decreased 6.6% year-over-year in constant currency on a pro forma combined company basis, reflecting headwinds in traditional application services, partially offset by growth in our Enterprise Applications and Business Process Services businesses. GBS profit margin in the quarter was 18.6%, up from 13.9% in the prior year on a pro forma combined company basis, reflecting ongoing cost actions in the business. New business awards for GBS were $3.3 billion in the third quarter.\nGlobal Infrastructure Services (GIS)\nGIS revenue was $3,145 million in the quarter as compared to $871 million for the prior year. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, GIS revenue decreased 6.8% year-over-year in constant currency on a pro forma combined company basis. The GIS revenue reflects headwinds in the legacy infrastructure business, partially offset by client transformations leveraging digital offerings in Cloud and Security. GIS profit margin in the quarter was 14.7%, up from 9.5% in the prior year on a pro forma combined company basis, reflecting cost actions and process automation. New business awards for GIS were $2.2 billion in the third quarter.\nUnited States Public Sector (USPS)\nUSPS revenue was $726 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, USPS revenue decreased 11.9% year-over-year on a pro forma combined company basis, reflecting the benefit of a large one-time contract reset during the third quarter last year. USPS profit margin in the quarter was 15.2%, up from 11.6% in the prior year on a pro forma combined company basis, reflecting ongoing cost actions in the business. New business awards for USPS were $527 million in the third quarter.\nReturning Capital to Shareholders\nDuring the third quarter, DXC Technology returned $51 million to shareholders consisting of common stock dividends.\nEarnings Conference Call\nDXC Technology senior management will host a conference call to discuss these results today at 5 p.m. EST.

The following discussion includes comparisons of our unaudited results of operations for the three and nine months of fiscal 2018 to our pro forma combined company results. The pro forma combined company results are based on the historical quarterly statements of operations of each of CSC and the Enterprise Services Business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPES\"), giving effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on April 2, 2016.\nCSC reported its results based on a fiscal year convention that comprised four thirteen-week quarters, while HPES reported its results on a fiscal year basis ended October 31. As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year-end dates, the pro forma combined company results include the historical unaudited condensed combined statements of operations of CSC for the three and nine months ended December 30, 2016 and of HPES for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2016.\nThe historical financial information of HPES was “carved-out” from the combined statement of operations of HPE and reflects assumptions and allocations made by HPE and only includes revenue and costs directly attributable to HPES and an allocation of expenses related to certain HPE corporate functions and does not necessarily include all expenses that would have been incurred by HPES had it been a separate, stand-alone entity and therefore, does not necessarily reflect what HPES’ results of operations would have been had HPES operated as a stand-alone company during the period presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if HPES had been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, functions outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure.\nThe pro forma combined company results have been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting with CSC considered the accounting acquirer of HPES. These pro forma combined company results include historical results, reflecting preliminary purchase accounting (\"PPA\") adjustments and aligning our accounting policies for consolidated results and reportable segments. These adjustments give effect to pro forma events that were (i) directly attributable to the merger of CSC and HPES, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results of operations of DXC. The pro forma combined company results do not reflect the costs of integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of synergies. No assurances of the timing or the amount of cost synergies, or the costs necessary to achieve those cost synergies, can be provided.\nThe adjustments to historical results included were based upon currently available information and assumptions that management of DXC believes to be reasonable. The pro forma combined company results are provided for illustrative and informational purposes only and are not intended to represent or be indicative of what DXC's results of operations would have been had the merger occurred on April 2, 2016, and should not be taken as being indicative of DXC’s future consolidated financial results. The pro forma combined company results should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.2 of the previously filed to Form 8-K/A that was filed on June 14, 2017, including the accompanying notes.\nSubsequent to the June 14, 2017 8-K/A filing referenced above, we adjusted the preliminary purchase price allocation and related fair value estimates, which would have decreased pro forma combined net loss and loss per common share by $96 million and $0.34, respectively, for the three months ended December 30, 2016, and $292 million and $1.03, respectively, for the nine months ended December 30, 2016.\nSegment Results\nThe following tables summarize segment revenue for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three and nine months ended December 30, 2016:\nSegment Revenue\nGAAP Basis Pro Forma Combined Company Basis (in millions) Three Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017\nHistorical CSC\nfor the Three\nMonths Ended\nDecember 30,\n2016\n% Change (NC) Three Months\nEnded\nDecember 30,\n2016\n% Change % Adjusted\nChange in\nConstant\nCurrency (1)\nGBS $ 2,315 $ 1,046 — $ 2,432 (4.8 )% (6.6 )% GIS 3,145 871 — 3,327 (5.5 )% (6.8 )% USPS 726 — — 826 (12.1 )% (11.9 )% Total Revenues $ 6,186 $ 1,917 — $ 6,585 (6.1 )% (7.4 )% (1) Adjusted for PPA impact of $6 million in GBS, $26 million in GIS and $2 million in USPS.\n(NC) Not comparable Segment Revenue\nGAAP Basis Pro Forma Combined Company Basis (in millions) Nine Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017\nHistorical CSC\nfor the Nine\nMonths Ended\nDecember 30,\n2016\n% Change (NC) Nine Months\nEnded\nDecember 30,\n2016\n% Change % Adjusted\nChange in\nConstant\nCurrency (1)\nGBS $ 6,893 $ 3,130 — $ 7,245 (4.9 )% (4.9 )% GIS 9,256 2,588 — 9,906 (6.6 )% (5.4 )% USPS 2,113 — — 2,207 (4.3 )% (3.9 )% Total Revenues $ 18,262 $ 5,718 — $ 19,358 (5.7 )% (5.0 )% (1) Adjusted for PPA impact of $32 million in GBS, $134 million in GIS and $8 million in USPS.\n(NC) Not comparable We define segment profit as segment revenues less segment cost of services, selling, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets). We do not allocate to our segments certain operating expenses managed at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include certain corporate function costs, stock-based compensation expense, pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses, restructuring costs, transaction and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets.

These non-GAAP financial measures include earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and adjusted free cash flow.\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with meaningful supplemental financial information, in addition to the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items from GAAP results which DXC management believes are not indicative of core operating performance. DXC management believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors supplemental information about the financial performance of DXC exclusive of the impacts of corporate wide strategic decisions. DXC management believes that adjusting for these items provides investors with additional measures to evaluate the financial performance of our core business operations on a comparable basis from period to period. DXC management believes the non-GAAP measures provided are also considered important measures by financial analysts covering DXC as equity research analysts continue to publish estimates and research notes based on our non-GAAP commentary, including our guidance around non-GAAP EPS.\nThere are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. One of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results. We compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or on a pro forma combined company basis. Additionally, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nDXC's non-GAAP adjustments to its performance measures include:\nRestructuring costs - reflects restructuring costs, net of reversals, related to workforce optimization and real estate charges. Transaction and integration-related costs - reflects costs related to integration planning, financing, and advisory fees associated with the merger and other acquisitions. Amortization of acquired intangible assets - reflects amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations. Pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses - reflects pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses. Certain overhead costs - reflects certain fiscal 2017 HPE costs allocated to HPES that are expected to be largely eliminated on a prospective basis. Tax adjustment - reflects the estimated special benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for fiscal 2018 periods and the application of an approximate 27.5% pro forma tax rate for fiscal 2017 periods, which is the midpoint of prospective targeted effective tax rate range of 25% to 30% and effectively excludes the impact of discrete tax adjustments for those periods.\nEBIT and Adjusted
