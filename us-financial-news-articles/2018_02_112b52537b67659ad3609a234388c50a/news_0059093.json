The trade deal underpins some $1.2 trillion in trilateral trade.\nHeineken’s new $500 million brewery in Mexico’s northern Chihuahua state, which borders the United States, will produce Tecate, Dos Equis and Heineken for the Mexican domestic market and for exports.\n“We chose the location because of its proximity to the U.S. and given the importance of the export business of Tecate and Dos Equis to the U.S.,” said Busain.\nMexican brewers have been building up capacity. Beer maker Grupo Modelo, the maker of Corona beer and a unit of global top brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, is planning to invest 14 billion Mexican pesos ($744 million) in a brewing and bottling plant in the central state of Hidalgo.\n$1 = 18.8258 Mexican pesos Reporting by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T03:54:44.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
