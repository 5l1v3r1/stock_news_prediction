But it would not affect already soured debt, which will be covered in a separate proposal. \nAs part of the clarification, the ECB will stress that the rules will be applied on a case-by-case basis and there will be no automatism to force provisioning, a move which could be seen as encroaching on regulatory or legislative prerogatives. \nBad debt weighs on banking balance sheets and holds back lending, countering the very stimulus the ECB is trying to provide with rock bottom interest rates. \nBut Nouy said banks are making progress, primarily because the ECB has been putting pressure on them. \n“Indeed a number of banks are changing their policy using good times to do what they can do, more than they planned in the beginning,” Nouy told a press conference. “This is what in my view good supervision is about.” \nHer deputy Sabine Lautenschlaeger stressed selling the unpaid loans was not the only was to achieve that and a good and efficient “work-out” process inside the bank was essential. \n($1 = 0.8097 euros) Reporting by Francesco Canepa and Tom Sims; Writing by Balazs Koranyi; Editing by Alison Williams, William Maclean", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T13:05:30.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
