UnitedHealth Group Inc, Humana Inc, Aetna Inc and Wellcare Health Plans Inc are among the largest players in the Medicare Advantage market in which private insurers are paid a set rate by the government to cover member healthcare costs.\nThe government payment rates affect how much insurers charge for monthly premiums, plan benefits and ultimately, how much they profit.
