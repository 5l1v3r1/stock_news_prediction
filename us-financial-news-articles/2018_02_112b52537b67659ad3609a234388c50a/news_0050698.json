Without the impairments, the company’s profit would be more than 40 million dinars.\n“We believe the group is fundamentally in great shape and we expect net profits in the range of 40 to 45 million dinars in 2018,” said group Chief Executive Ihab Hinnawi.\nBatelco’s full-year 2017 consolidated net profit was 3.5 million dinars, 91 percent down from the year earlier period.\nThe company was in the market for acquisition opportunities that would boost profitability, he said, adding it hoped to sign a deal in 2018 but declined to be more specific.\nAny acquisition would be financed by capital raising, group chief financial officer Faisal Qamhiyah said, adding that if it did not complete any acquisition the company had enough capital on its balance sheet, sufficient to fund an annual dividend of 25 fils per share for the next three years.\nBatelco earlier announced that its 2017 full-year dividend would be 25 fils per share and that it intended to acquire up to 10 percent of its paid-up capital as treasury shares, subject to required approvals.\nThe impairments related to Yemen were due to a deterioration in the local currency and other economic impacts as a result of the civil war, said Hinnawi.\nBatelco said its business in Jordan was hit by high telecom taxes and increased electricity costs on telecom companies.\nDuring 2017, 128 staff in Bahrain volunteered to take early retirement, costing the company 8.1 million dinars. Hinnawi said he doubted such a move will be repeated in 2018.
