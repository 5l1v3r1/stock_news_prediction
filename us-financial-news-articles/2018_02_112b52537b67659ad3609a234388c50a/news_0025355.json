The performance was fantastic,” Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said. “We have to keep going.” \nPochettino went with the same side that drew at Liverpool, while counterpart Arsene Wenger left Lacazette on the bench, with new signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang up front. \nIt took until the 27th minute for the game’s first real chance to be created, but Kane could not keep his header down. \nArsenal were a threat on the counter, but rarely troubled Hugo Lloris in the home goal during the first half. \n“The game should have been finished at halftime,” Wenger said. “We missed opportunities on the counter attack because of a poor final ball.” \nThe second period was the antithesis of the first, in terms of action, as Spurs took the game to Arsenal. Kane brilliantly headed Ben Davies’ cross into the net four minutes into the half before then missing an easier header moments later. \nArsenal were reeling and had Petr Cech to thank for keeping them in the match after the Arsenal goalkeeper tipped Eriksen’s free kick over. \nAs the visitors pressed for an equaliser, they left gaps at the back, and Dele Alli should have capitalised from such space, but prodded wide. \nThe gilt-edged chances kept coming for Spurs, with Kieran Trippier next to shoot too close to Cech. \nLacazette came mightily close to snatching an undeserved point in stoppage time, but he could not find the target, and Arsenal slipped to a third defeat in five league games.
