FFO available for common shareholders is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is net income (loss) available for common shareholders calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties and its proportionate share of the real estate depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint venture properties and the difference between FFO attributable to an equity investment and equity in earnings of an equity investee but excluding impairment charges on and increases in the carrying value of real estate assets, any gain or loss on sale of real estate, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to GOV. GOV's calculation of Normalized FFO available for common shareholders differs from Nareit's definition of FFO available for common shareholders because GOV includes Select Income REIT's, or SIR's, Normalized FFO attributable to GOV's equity investment in SIR (net of FFO attributable to GOV's equity investment in SIR), GOV includes business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of GOV's core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year and GOV excludes acquisition related costs expensed under GAAP, gains and losses on issuance of shares by SIR and gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt. GOV considers FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss), net income (loss) available for GOV's common shareholders and operating income. GOV believes that FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders may facilitate a comparison of GOV's operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders are among the factors considered by GOV's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to GOV's shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain GOV's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in GOV's credit agreement and public debt covenants, the availability to GOV of debt and equity capital, GOV's expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance, GOV's receipt of distributions from SIR and GOV's expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its obligations. FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss), net income (loss) available for common shareholders or operating income as indicators of GOV's operating performance or as measures of GOV's liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss), net income (loss) available for common shareholders and operating income as presented in GOV's Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders differently than GOV does.\nGovernment Properties Income Trust Calculation and Reconciliation of Consolidated Property Net Operating Income (NOI) and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI (1)\n(amounts in thousands) (unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Calculation of Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI (2) : Rental income (3) $ 107,170 $ 66,030 $ 316,532 $ 258,180 Property operating expenses (41,077 ) (26,091 ) (124,289 ) (102,262 ) Consolidated Property NOI 66,093 39,939 192,243 155,918 Non-cash straight line rent adjustments included in rental income (3) (2,467 ) (902 ) (5,582 ) (2,691 ) Lease value amortization included in rental income (3) 901 355 2,764 1,457 Non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses (4) (121 ) (121 ) (484 ) (484 ) Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI $ 64,406 $ 39,271 $ 188,941 $ 154,200 Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Available for Common Shareholders to Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI: Net income (loss) available for common shareholders $ (18,266 ) $ 12,065 $ 11,815 $ 57,843 Preferred units of limited partnership distributions 275 — 275 — Net income (loss) (17,991 ) 12,065 12,090 57,843 Gain on sale of real estate — — — (79 ) Income (loss) before gain on sale of real estate (17,991 ) 12,065 12,090 57,764 Income (loss) from discontinued operations — 160 (173 ) 589 Income (loss) from continuing operations (17,991 ) 12,225 11,917 58,353 Equity in earnings of investees (767 ) (7,516 ) (21,571 ) (35,518 ) Income tax expense 36 38 101 101 Net (gain) loss on issuance of shares by SIR — 2 (72 ) (86 ) (Gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt — — 1,715 (104 ) Interest expense 21,807 12,774 65,406 45,060 Interest income (119 ) (95 ) (1,962 ) (158 ) Dividend income (304 ) (304 ) (1,216 ) (971 ) Operating income 2,662 17,124 54,318 66,677 General and administrative 6,532 3,547 18,847 14,897 Acquisition related costs — 828 — 1,191 Loss on impairment of real estate 9,260 — 9,490 — Depreciation and amortization 47,639 18,440 109,588 73,153 Consolidated Property NOI 66,093 39,939 192,243 155,918 Non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses (4) (121 ) (121 ) (484 ) (484 ) Lease value amortization included in rental income (3) 901 355 2,764 1,457 Non-cash straight line rent adjustments included in rental income (3) (2,467 ) (902 ) (5,582 ) (2,691 ) Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI $ 64,406 $ 39,271 $ 188,941 $ 154,200 Reconciliation of Consolidated Property NOI to Same Property NOI (5)(6) : Rental income $ 107,170 $ 66,030 $ 316,532 $ 258,180 Property operating expenses (41,077 ) (26,091 ) (124,289 ) (102,262 ) Consolidated Property NOI 66,093 39,939 192,243 155,918 Less: NOI of properties not included in same property results (26,114 ) (331 ) (40,422 ) (4,995 ) Same property NOI $ 39,979 $ 39,608 $ 151,821 $ 150,923 Calculation of Same Property Cash Basis NOI (5)(6) : Same property NOI $ 39,979 $ 39,608 $ 151,821 $ 150,923 Add: Lease value amortization included in rental income (3) 377 354 1,678 1,496 Less: Non-cash straight line rent adjustments included in rental income (3) (142 ) (879 ) (2,464 ) (2,362 ) Non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses (4) (121 ) (121 ) (483 ) (483 ) Same property Cash Basis NOI $ 40,093 $ 38,962 $ 150,552 $ 149,574 (1)\nGOV calculates Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI as shown above. The calculations of Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) available for common shareholders in order to provide results that are more closely related to GOV's consolidated property level results of operations. GOV defines Consolidated Property NOI as consolidated income from its rental of real estate less its consolidated property operating expenses. Consolidated Property NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that GOV records as depreciation and amortization. GOV defines Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI as Consolidated Property NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization and non-cash amortization included in other operating expenses. GOV considers Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI to be appropriate supplemental measures to net income (loss) available for common shareholders because they may help both investors and management to understand the operations of GOV's consolidated properties. GOV uses Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company wide consolidated property level performance, and GOV believes that Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI provide useful information to investors regarding GOV's results of operations because they reflect only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of GOV's operating performance between periods and with other REITs. Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss), net income (loss) available for common shareholders or operating income as indicators of GOV's operating performance or as measures of its liquidity.
