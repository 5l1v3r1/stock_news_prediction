The second increase is partly dependent on the profit achieved by the relevant Lufthansa unit.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T13:38:28.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
