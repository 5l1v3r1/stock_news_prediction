The weather forecast for us as far as the wind is concerned is not that good,” the Norwegian said.\n”It will be a challenge for the racers, it will be a challenge for the (organizers), it will be a challenge for everybody.\n“Who knows what’s going to happen? Hopefully it will not be as strong as forecast but we will stretch our limits as far as possible to run the race tomorrow.”\nAnother reason for the postponement of the men’s downhill was that the gondola at the Jeongseon center was unable to run in such high winds.\nSkaardal said, however, that the gondola at the Yongpyong center had run smoothly on Sunday in winds higher than those forecast for Monday.\n“If the gondola does not run because of the wind we will have a big problem and be sending you some information about delays or cancellations,” he said.\nOrganizers would prepare a reserve start and were prepared to be flexible to get the skiers off and racing, he added.\n“I‘m just saying this so everyone is ready for a windy day but I hope we can have a good race in the end,” he said.\nThe draw was also made at the briefing and favorites Tessa Worley of France, 2010 champion Viktoria Rebensburg and American Mikaela Shiffrin will be among the first skiers out, running in fourth, sixth and seventh positions respectively.\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:43:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
