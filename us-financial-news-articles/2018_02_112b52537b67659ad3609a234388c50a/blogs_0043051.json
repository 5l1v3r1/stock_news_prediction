Chandrashekhar in a statement.\n“There is still some turbulence and it is not clear how some of the known uncertainties will play out. However, FY 2019 is likely to be a better year, based on our current assessment.”\nMajor companies such as Infosys and Wipro have posted improved earnings in the January-March quarter and IT executives in Hyderabad also expressed optimism about a continued recovery as the sector diversifies into more lucrative digital segments such as cloud computing and big data.\n“This is an opportunity for people like us who service enterprises to step up and say: I can help you in the front, I can help you with the business model, I can help you with your operational profile,” said Ananth Krishnan, chief technology officer at top-ranked Tata Consultancy Services.\nCompany officials were particularly excited about artificial intelligence. Krishnan said TCS was already embedding AI in its offerings.\nThe IT sector added 100,000 new jobs in the current fiscal and expects a “similar trend” in hiring to continue in year to March 2019, Chandrashekhar said, as the industry pivots to new offerings.\nHowever, finding fresh talent to work on AI-driven solutions could be a key constraint.\n“There is limited talent available in this space and to me that’s the No.1 challenge today, across the industry,” said Vivek Agarwal, global head of enterprise verticals at Tech Mahindra.\nReporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Rafael Nam and Sunil Nair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:43:30.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
