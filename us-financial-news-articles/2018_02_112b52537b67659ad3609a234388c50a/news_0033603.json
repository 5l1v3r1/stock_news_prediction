Under pressure from the European Central Bank to reduce soured loans on their books, Italian banks have been raising capital to be able to write them down and sell them off. They still hold more than quarter of Europe’s near $1 trillion bad loan pile three years after the country’s deep recession ended. Creval is expected to price its new shares at 0.4 times the value of its assets, one source familiar to the matter said, confirming a press report. “If that’s confirmed it’s a very interesting level,” said Roberto Lottici, a fund manager at Banca Ifigest in Milan. Lottici said Italy’s economic recovery, the prospect of higher interest rates, Italian banks’ growing ability to deal with bad debts once recapitalised and possible further mergers ahead made them an appealing investment over the medium term. “I‘m talking at least two years’ time,” he said. Italy’s fragmented and over-branched banking sector is seen as ripe for consolidation as banks need to cut costs to lift low profitability. Creval is seeking to raise nearly six times its market capitalisation to fund a restructuring plan and prepare for a merger. The bank wants to cut bad loans as a proportion of total lending to below 10 percent by 2020 from 21.7 percent at the end of last year. The share offer is expected to start on Monday ahead of the national elections on March 4, which could potentially feed market volatility as a clear winner may fail to emerge. “We’re confident the market will react well,” said Andrea Vismara, CEO of Equita SIM, one of the banks backing the cash call. A group of 11 banks, led by Mediobanca and including Banco Santander, Barclays, Citi and Credit Suisse, will sign later on Wednesday an underwriting accord to take on unsold shares in the offer, another source close to the matter said. There were initially 12 banks but several sources said Jefferies had pulled out before the final signing. Creval and Jefferies made no comment. Creval’s shares closed down 4.3 percent, bucking a 1.7 percent rise in Italy’s banking sector. The stock has lost 65 percent of its value since Creval announced the bigger-than-expected cash call in early November, the first of a string of Italian banks that have since stepped up bad loan reduction goals to meet regulatory demands.
