He has told a court he was responsible for the attack but denied his motive was terrorism.\nThe prosecutor said his psychiatric assessment would not be published until the trial begins next month.\nBouanane was a “lone wolf” who saw himself as a soldier for the Islamic State militant group, according to the police. ISIS did not take responsibility for the act.\nBouanane arrived in Finland in 2016, lived in a reception center in Turku and had been denied asylum.\nThe case is the Nordic country’s first terrorism-related attack. A life sentence in Finland means at least 12 years in prison.\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T02:18:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
