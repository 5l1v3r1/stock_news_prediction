Sanderson Farms ( SAFM.O ) said it will defend itself against the claims. Privately held Perdue declined to comment.\nU.S. poultry buyers previously claimed in a 2016 lawsuit that Tyson and its competitors had colluded since 2008 to reduce output and manipulate prices. Winn-Dixie, which operates grocery stores throughout the southeastern United States, sued the chicken companies earlier this month.\n“We expect the industry to fight the allegations and come out successful,” Mizuho analyst Jeremy Scott said.\nSysco and US Foods allege processors curbed the supply of chickens by colluding to limit breeder birds that produce flocks that are ultimately slaughtered for meat consumption.\nData provider Agri Stats participated in the conspiracy, according to the lawsuits, by distributing information about chicken production that gave processors insights into rivals’ supplies. Agri Stats, which the complaints say is a subsidiary of Eli Lilly & Co ( LLY.N ), did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n“Follow-on complaints like these are common in antitrust litigation,” Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson said. “Such complaints do not change our position that the claims are unfounded.”\nTyson shares were down 3.6 percent, and Sanderson Farms shares lost 3.8 percent. Shares of Pilgrim’s Pride, mostly owned by Brazilian meat packer JBS SA ( JBSS3.SA ), were down 6 percent.\nLast year, such processors earned some of their highest profit margins in more than a decade as prices for grains used to feed birds slumped due to a global glut.
