In the past as a national bank we would probably be asked at some stage to lend some money. In the future, I would like the bank to be much more proactive, to be more - from the beginning - advising, structuring, distributing, and have a much more investment banking approach,” Durand said.\nThe bank, which also has a presence in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, is looking to increase its investment banking operations in those countries, too, he said.\nDurand joined NBB as chief executive at the end of 2016. He was the Middle East and Africa head of BNP Paribas before that.\nNBB posted a net profit of 61 million dinars ($161.89 million) in 2017, up from 58.2 million one year earlier.\n“We have put in place a three-year development plan, and we expect 2018 to continue growth,” Durand said.\nNBB is not in talks about any potential merger or acquisition, but it is open to potential opportunities.\n“In our three-year strategy plan we have internal growth and we’re open to external growth whenever complimentary,” Durand said. “It’s not necessarily consolidation, could be complementary, such as adding a new business. We’re open because that’s an area of growth.” ($1 = 0.3768 Bahraini dinars)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:31:53.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
