I don’t expect so. I see 2018 as being a successful year for the bank,” John Cryan said.\nCryan cited further steps in cost-cutting and an expected resumption in market volatility as reasons for optimism.\nIn 2018, “we aim for a profit, not only before, but of course also after income taxes,” Cryan said.
