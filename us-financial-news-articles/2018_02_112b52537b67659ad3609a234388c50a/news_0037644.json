The 35-year-old Spaniard has been limited to just six appearances across all competitions for the relegation-threatened club this season and sustained the injury during Swansea’s league defeat to Tottenham Hotspur last month. Rangel, who was named club captain in November, has been hindered by injuries throughout the campaign with Kyle Naughton used as the first-choice right-back for Carlos Carvalhal’s side. Swansea are 16th in the league, a point above the relegation zone with 11 games remaining in the campaign.
