Zach Aston-Reese picked up his first NHL point with an assist on the goal while Ian Cole was also credited with an assist.\nThe Penguins’ Carl Hagelin added a shorthanded tally about two minutes later when he intercepted a pass in the defensive zone, raced ahead on a breakaway and sent a shot into the top of the goal for a 2-0 lead.\nSeguin got one of those goals back for Dallas, as he took a spot-on pass from the corner from Jamie Benn and snapped a shot past the right pad of Pittsburgh netminder Matt Murray with 2:03 left in the first period to cut Pittsburgh’s lead to 2-1.\nKlingberg tied the match at the 2:46 mark of the third period as he took a pass from Alexander Rudulov from behind the net and whipped it between Murray’s pads and into the net. Benn also got an assist on the play.\nFour minutes later, the Stars grabbed the lead when Hamhuis wristed a pass from Greg Pateryn past Murray. Benn also got an assist on that scoring play.\nThat set the stage for Schultz, who took a pass from Malkin and scored to tie the game. Kris Letang also garnered an assist.\nPittsburgh lost for just the second time in its past eight games.\nDallas returns to the ice on Sunday afternoon for a home match against Vancouver while the Penguins travel to St. Louis for a match against the Blues, also on Sunday afternoon.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T12:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:26:49.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
