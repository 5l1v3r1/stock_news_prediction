Sorry!” she told Reuters.\n”But England is a place that means a lot to me. I lived there a long time and all of my friends are in England and they were watching today.\n“I still think a lot about Great Britain but sorry I‘m not going to change countries, sorry, I‘m staying Swiss.”\nCut from a different cloth from the teenage talents of freestyle skiing, Hoefflin only started the extreme sport after university.\nReturning to Switzerland, she later entered a freestyle skiing competition purely because the winner could get a new pair of skis.\nOn Saturday, she pulled out her best routine when it counted in the third and final run, scoring a 91.20 to pip 18-year-old team mate Gremaud by 3.20 points.\nGremaud was courageous in winning the silver, having banged her head in a training accident the day before and been rushed to hospital in an ambulance.\nHoefflin was grateful to Gremaud for showing her the winning blueprint with her first run of the final when she scored an impressive 88.00.\n”Honestly, I was just congratulating Mathilde the whole time,“ said Hoefflin. ”She’s just come back from injury and she’s had a really tough start to the year.\n”And today, she just completely out of nowhere just came out and just had these awesome tricks and it was so impressive.\n“She was the one who just completely motivated me to do the switch double-nine which was a trick she’d done just before I did. So thanks to Mathilde for that.”\nEditing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:10:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
