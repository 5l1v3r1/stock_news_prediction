REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah/File Photo The Seychelles deal builds on 20 years’ worth of similar debt-for-nature swaps that have preserved vast tracts of tropical forests in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nBut it’s the first time the financing technique has been used to secure a marine environment, said Rob Weary, the head of NatureVest, which funds the group’s conservation deals.\nFILE PHOTO: A fisherman's boat is seen at Seychelles port February 29, 2012. REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah/File Photo “There’s not been one example of a country defaulting on a debt-for-nature swap,” he said.\nWeary said the Seychelles deal -- which will also help fund climate-change projects -- could pave the way for other, larger deals where conservationists buy a country’s sovereign debt in return for policy changes designed to help the environment.\nWith an annual operating budget of $650 million per year, The Nature Conservancy’s funds dwarf many other, better-known charities such as Oxfam or the World Wildlife Foundation.\n“Never before has there been so much funds available to support marine-based economic activities, the conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity and adaptation to climate change,” said Vice President Vincent Meriton when announcing the project.\nReaction to the announcement was generally positive. PetroSeychelles’ head Patrick Joseph told Reuters that no explorers had shown an interest in the protected areas, but that he was unsure such stringent protection was necessary.\nFisherman Graham Green, 29, said he hoped it would rejuvenate traditional small-scale fishing.\n“Long ago you would fish for just a few hours and not far out to sea and get a good catch of well-sized fish. But these days what you used to get in just one hour takes you a whole day,” he said.\nReporting by George Thande; Additional reporting and writing by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T15:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T15:29:21.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
