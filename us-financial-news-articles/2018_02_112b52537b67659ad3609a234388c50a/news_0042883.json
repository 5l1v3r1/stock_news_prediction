Bastareaud made the comments during a 36-0 Champions Cup victory against Benetton Treviso last month before apologising on social media. Boudjellal, however, told the French rugby website rugbyrama.fr: “At no point did Mathieu Bastareaud make a judgement on the sexual orientation of the player in question. I‘m not homophobic but I’ve called someone a faggot. It’s become normal, it’s the first thing that comes to mind in an argument.” EPCR, which had started an investigation last month, said in a statement that a hearing date would be set later.
