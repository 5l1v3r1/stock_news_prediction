The market declined another 0.9 percent Friday.\n\"One of the things that I do when we get into a situation like this ... I put ludicrously low bids in, in the stocks I either don't own enough of, or I just totally missed out and it always made me upset ,\" Brown said on CNBC's \" Halftime Report \" Friday. \nBrown explained he uses good 'til canceled (GTC) buy limit orders, which aren't executed until the stock hits his pre-set price. \n\"So I'm not just randomly flinging in a trade when I feel like it. I will set the number where I want to own it,\" he said. \"And usually I won't get hit, but it makes me start to root for the market to get lower.\" \nThe investor said it also keeps him in his other long-term investments. \n\" It's this weird psychological trick I play.
