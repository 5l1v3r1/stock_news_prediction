(NYSE: TCS) (the “Company”), today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 ended December 30, 2017.\nConsolidated net sales were $223.0 million, up 3.1%. Net sales in The Container Store retail business (“TCS”) were $203.9 million, up 2.4%. Elfa International AB (“Elfa”) third-party net sales were $19.1 million, up 10.5%, primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 0.2%, with holiday departments’ sales contributing an approximate 1.0% decline. Consolidated net income per share (“EPS”) was $0.59, inclusive of a $0.50 per share provisional benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), compared with $0.11 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income per share (“Adjusted EPS”) was $0.11 compared with $0.11 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 (see Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table). The Company opened three stores, inclusive of one relocation, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and had 90 stores at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017, as compared to 86 stores as of December 31, 2016.\nMelissa Reiff, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “In the fiscal third quarter we made further progress with our core Custom Closets offering and delivered continued improvement in all of our non-closet categories, with the exception of our holiday departments, which typically represent a small percentage of our annual sales, but historically have had a notable impact on our fiscal third quarter sales. While the softness in our holiday categories is disappointing, we were prudent in our buying for holiday and disciplined in selling through the related inventory, as evidenced by our strong gross margin performance and healthy ending inventory position. With the holiday season behind us, and with a strong start to Our Annual elfa ® Sale that has continued into the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect comparable store sales in the fiscal fourth quarter to improve from the fiscal third quarter, as reflected in our implied fiscal fourth quarter comparable store sales outlook of flat to up low single digits.”\n“We are also very pleased with the progress being made on each of our key strategic priorities. Given our year-to-date performance, as well as the expected impact of the Tax Act, we have narrowed our outlook ranges for fiscal 2017 and look forward to building on this progress as we close out the fiscal year,” concluded Reiff.\nThird Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the third quarter (thirteen weeks) ended December 30, 2017:\nConsolidated net sales were $223.0 million, up 3.1% as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Net sales at TCS were $203.9 million, up 2.4%, with the increase driven by new store net sales, partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in net sales from comparable stores. Elfa third-party net sales were $19.1 million, up 10.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation, which increased third-party net sales by 8.3%, as well as higher sales in Russia. Consolidated gross margin was 58.6%, an increase of 50 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016. TCS gross margin increased 110 basis points to 58.1%, as lower cost of goods associated with the Optimization Plan and the benefit of favorable foreign currency contracts were partially offset by higher costs associated with our installation services business during the quarter. Elfa segment gross margin declined 150 basis points primarily due to higher direct materials costs. On a consolidated basis, gross margin increased 50 basis points as the increase in TCS gross margin was partially offset by the decrease in Elfa gross margin. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $103.9 million compared to $100.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and, as a percentage of net sales, increased 30 basis points. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in marketing and technology-related expenses, as well as deleveraging of occupancy costs associated with comparable store net sales declines during the quarter, partially offset by ongoing savings and efficiency efforts. Consolidated net interest expense increased 77.2% to $7.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 from $4.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 due to the previously announced amendment of our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility in August 2017, which increased the applicable interest rate margins. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was -330.1%, as compared to 39.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the initial estimated impact of the Tax Act enacted in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, which was largely driven by the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. Consolidated net income was $28.4 million, or $0.59 per share (inclusive of $0.50 per share provisional benefit from the Tax Act), in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to net income of $5.1 million, or $0.11 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Consolidated adjusted net income was $5.1 million, or $0.11 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to adjusted net income of $5.2 million, or $0.11 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 (see Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table). Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $25.6 million, compared to $25.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 (see Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table).\nFor the year-to-date (thirty-nine weeks) ended December 30, 2017:\nConsolidated net sales were $624.5 million, up 4.3% as compared to the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016. Net sales at TCS were $573.3 million, up 4.3%, primarily due to new store sales, combined with a 0.2% increase in net sales from comparable stores. Elfa third-party net sales were $51.2 million, up 3.5% compared to the year-to-date ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation, which increased third-party net sales by 2.1%, as well as higher sales in Russia. Consolidated gross margin was 57.7%, a decrease of 50 basis points compared to the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016 due to decreases in gross margin at TCS and Elfa. TCS gross margin declined 30 basis points to 57.3%, primarily due to higher costs associated with our installation services business and a greater portion of sales generated by merchandise campaigns, partially offset by lower cost of goods associated with the Optimization Plan. Elfa segment gross margin declined 150 basis points primarily due to higher direct materials costs. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $306.9 million compared to $288.0 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 100 basis points primarily due to consulting costs incurred as part of the Optimization Plan, which contributed 105 basis points to the increase in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2017. Additionally, the impact of the amended and restated employment agreements entered into with key executives during the first half of fiscal 2016, which led to the reversal of accrued deferred compensation associated with the original employment agreements, net of costs incurred to execute the agreements, contributed a 65 basis points benefit in first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016. This combined 170 basis point increase period-over-period was partially offset by a 70 basis point improvement in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, primarily due to ongoing savings and efficiency efforts, inclusive of savings from the Optimization Plan, as well as lower self-insurance costs, partially offset by increased occupancy costs and an increase in marketing and technology-related expenses. Consolidated net interest expense increased 39.9% to $17.4 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2017 from $12.4 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016 due to the previously announced amendment of our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility in August 2017, which increased the applicable interest rate margins. Additionally, the Company recorded $2.4 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of the amendment to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. The effective tax rate was 429.3%, as compared to 42.5% in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the initial estimated impact of the Tax Act enacted in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, which was largely driven by the remeasurement of deferred tax balances, combined with the impact of a pre-tax loss position in the thirty-nine weeks ended December 30, 2017, as compared to a pre-tax income position in the thirty-nine weeks ended December 31, 2016. Consolidated net income was $19.8 million, or $0.41 per share (inclusive of $0.50 per share provisional benefit from the Tax Act), in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2017 compared to net income of $6.6 million, or $0.14 per share, in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016. Consolidated adjusted net income was $5.2 million, or $0.11 per share, in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2017 compared to adjusted net income of $4.7 million, or $0.10 per share in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016 (see Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table). Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $58.5 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2017 compared to $59.7 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016 (see Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table). The Adjusted EBITDA of $59.7 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016 included a benefit from the impact of amended and restated employment agreements entered into with key executives during the first quarter of 2016, net of costs incurred to execute the agreements, of $3.9 million.\nBalance sheet highlights:\n(In thousands)\nDecember 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Cash\n$22,653 $18,491 Total debt $314,103 $338,290 Liquidity* $102,636 $106,384 *Cash plus availability on revolving credit facilities Optimization Plan\nIn May 2017, the Company announced the implementation of a four-part Optimization Plan to drive improved sales and profitability. This plan includes sales initiatives, certain full-time position eliminations at TCS that were concluded in the fiscal first quarter, organizational realignment at Elfa and ongoing savings and efficiency efforts. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges associated with the Optimization Plan of approximately $11 million in fiscal 2017, or $0.15 on a per share basis. The expected annualized pre-tax savings associated with the Optimization Plan continue to be approximately $20 million, of which approximately $12 to $14 million, or $0.16 to $0.19 on a per share basis, is now expected to be realized in fiscal 2017, for an estimated net benefit of approximately $0.01 to $0.04 on a per share basis.\nOutlook\nThe Company is revising its outlook for fiscal 2017 to incorporate year-to-date fiscal 2017 actual results, as well as the impact of the Tax Act, which was enacted in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nCurrent Outlook Prior Outlook Net sales $850 million to $860 million $845 million to $865 million Net new store openings 4 4 Comparable store sales 0% to increase 1% Decrease 1% to increase 1% Net income per common share (1) $0.60 to $0.66 (2) $0.11 to $0.22 Adjusted net income per common share (3) $0.31 to $0.37 $0.30 to $0.41 Assumed tax rate 35% (4) 39% Estimated share count 49 million 49 million (1) Includes the aforementioned Optimization Plan costs and benefits. (2) Includes a $0.50 per share provisional benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances as well as a $0.01 to $0.02 per share tax benefit related to the reduction in the statutory rate from the Tax Act. Does not include any provisional amounts for the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings as the Company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate. (3) See Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures Table. (4) Does not include any provisional amounts recognized for deferred tax balances under the Tax Act or the tax impact of adjustments to net income (see footnote “e” in Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures Table). Including these items would result in an expected GAAP effective tax rate of approximately -170% for fiscal 2017. The Company is not able to estimate any future adjustments to the provisional amount recognized for the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. The assumed tax rate also does not include any provisional amounts for one-time transition taxes on foreign earnings, as the Company is not able to determinate a reasonable estimate.

The Company has reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in a table accompanying this release. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and they should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. These non-GAAP measures are key metrics used by management, the Company’s board of directors, and Leonard Green and Partners, L.P., its controlling stockholder, to assess its financial performance. The Company presents these non-GAAP measures because it believes they assist investors in comparing the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and because the Company believes it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company. These non-GAAP measures are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future the Company will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company’s presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using non-GAAP measures supplementally. These non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nThe Company defines adjusted net income as net income available to common shareholders before distributions accumulated to preferred shareholders, stock-based compensation and other costs in connection with our IPO, charges related to an Elfa manufacturing facility closure, impairment charges related to intangible assets, losses on extinguishment of debt, certain gains on disposal of assets, certain management transition costs incurred and benefits realized, charges incurred as part of the implementation of our Optimization Plan, and the tax impact of these adjustments and other unusual or infrequent tax items. We define adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. We use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. We present adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance and because we believe it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company.\nWe have included a presentation of adjusted net income for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended December 31, 2016 to show the net impact of the amended and restated employment agreements entered into with key executives during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 31, 2016 (“management transition costs (benefits)”). Although we disclosed the net positive impact of the amended and restated employment agreements in our discussions of earnings per share and SG&A in our earnings press releases in fiscal 2016, we did not include in those press releases a presentation of adjusted net income. However, in the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended December 30, 2017, our Optimization Plan has caused us to incur similar charges that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance, and we expect to continue to incur such charges in the remainder of fiscal 2017. As a result, we believe that adjusting net income in the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended December 31, 2016 for management transition costs (benefits), in addition to adjusting net loss for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended December 30, 2017 for charges incurred as part of the implementation of our Optimization Plan will assist investors in comparing our core operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Likewise, we believe that presenting full year fiscal 2017 adjusted net income guidance and fiscal 2016 adjusted net income as a comparative measure, will assist investors in evaluating our anticipated financial performance as it relates to our core operations.\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated in accordance with its credit facilities and is one of the components for performance evaluation under its executive compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash and other items that the Company does not consider in its evaluation of ongoing operating performance from period to period as discussed further below. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA in connection with covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, and to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare its performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. The Company believes it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company, its executives and its covenant compliance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry.\nThe Container Store Group, Inc.
