The EU proposal is for just 21.\nFILE PHOTO: A demonstrator carries a Union Jack and a European Union flag as the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier visits Downing Street in London, Britain February 5, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah Mckay/File Photo “NOT A GIVEN”\nThe EU and Britain had been expected to agree to a largely status-quo transition quite quickly, but Barnier said this month that a deal was “not a given” after accusing London of bringing up “substantial” objections to the bloc’s offer.\nOne point of conflict is the rights of EU citizens. May has stood by her position that those arriving after March next year should have different rights to those who entered before. The British government says those arriving during the transition period will have different expectations.\nBut May told parliament that she wanted people to stay.\n“They’ve made a huge contribution to our country, that’s why we want them and their families to stay. I‘m absolutely clear that EU citizens living lawfully in the UK today will be able to stay,” May said in parliament.\nOverall, the government’s draft document did little to highlight the areas where the two sides may disagree.\nIt made little more than technical changes to an EU document and simply underlined Britain’s desire to agree swiftly on foreign, security and defence affairs and, after doing so, for any deals to come into force even during the transition.\nBritain also wants a way to object to new EU legislation during the transition - something that may address the fears of hardline Brexit campaigners who have written to May to demand that she toughen her negotiating position.\n“The UK believes this document demonstrates that there is broad alignment between the UK and EU positions, with only a small number of areas requiring discussion,” the paper said.\n“This reflects the desire of both parties to provide certainty as swiftly as possible to individuals and businesses in the UK and across the EU about the arrangements that will apply from the point of the UK’s withdrawal.”\nReporting By Elizabeth Piper and Andrew MacAskill in London; additional reporting by Jan Strupczewski, Gabriela Baczynska, Philip Blenkinsop in Brussels; Editing by Kevin Liffey, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T20:28:06.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
