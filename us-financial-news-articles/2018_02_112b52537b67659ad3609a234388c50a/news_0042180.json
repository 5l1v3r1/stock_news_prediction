I feel that, as Canadians, when you win in Olympics, it’s when you deserve it, and we feel like these Olympics medals, that we deserve (them).”\nVirtue and Moir edged French rivals Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron by less than a point overall to win gold on Tuesday.\nFigure Skating - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Ice Dance free dance competition final - Gangneung, South Korea - February 20, 2018 - Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada react. REUTERS/John Sibley The Canadians earned a total score of 206.07, eclipsing the world record that had been set moments before by the French duo, who finished on 205.28.\nVirtue and Moir, who won gold in Vancouver eight years ago, have dominated ice dance since they returned to competition after retiring following a silver at the Sochi Games in 2014.\nThe duo also won two medals in the team event - silver in Sochi and gold in Pyeongchang.\nThe pair had previously said the Pyeongchang Games would be their last Olympics and hinted that retirement from competition could be in their plans soon.\n“Our heads haven’t come out of the clouds since the end of the music yesterday, how can you make a decision?,” Moir said of the prospect of retiring. “We’re so emotional, so we need some time, we’re going to take it.”\nMoir added that the pair could be looking to halt their careers to dedicate more time to their personal lives.\nReporting by Yiming Woo; Writing by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T08:22:34.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
