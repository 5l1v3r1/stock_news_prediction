EE added 235,000 contract customers in the period.\nThe company’s outlook for the full year sees broadly flat underlying revenue, with core earnings falling to between 7.5 billion and 7.6 billion pounds.\nAnalysts doubt it can meet its earnings target though, predicting they will come in below that range at 7.475 billion pounds, according to Thomson Reuters data.
