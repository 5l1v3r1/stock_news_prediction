Whoever manages the U.S. Olympic Team’s Twitter account saw the tweet and challenged followers to “spot the difference” between the curler and Mario. The tweet included a picture of Hamilton and Mario, side-by-side. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nHamilton, who along with his sister also holds the distinction of winning the first Olympic mixed doubles curling match in history, hasn’t mentioned the Mario jokes directly.
