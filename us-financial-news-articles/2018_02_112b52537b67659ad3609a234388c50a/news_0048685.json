We want to be able to showcase our progression in every regard; power unit, chassis, operations, drivers. Everything must improve and we must continue to grow.”\nNeither of the Renault drivers have stood on the podium in their careers and Hulkenberg now holds the Formula One record for most career starts (135) without a top-three finish.\n“We’re in a good position,” said the German, who joined the team last year from Force India. “For this year we want to build on the good platform of last season. 2017 was about bedding in, now I want to get ready to go.”\nTesting begins at Barcelona’s Circuit de Catalunya on Monday, with the opening race in Australia on March 25.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T19:09:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
