It’s been under development for a number of months. I have consulted with them on the plan, identified areas that we feel need further work.\n“So I think it will be up to the president to decide when he feels it’s time and he’s ready to put that plan forward. I will say it’s fairly well advanced...”\nTrump reversed decades of U.S. policy in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and set in motion the process of moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv.\nThe move triggered outrage in the Arab and Muslim world, and led Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to declare that he would not cooperate with the United States as a mediator.\nTrump has threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that backed a U.N. resolution calling for Washington to reverse its Jerusalem decision. Jordan backed the resolution.\nKing Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman particularly sensitive to any changes of status there.\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi arrive for a meeting in Amman, Jordan February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed Tillerson and Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi signed the non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) for $6.375 billion in aid starting this year. The previous such MoU between Jordan and the United States was for three years.\n“This MOU commitment highlights the pivotal role Jordan plays in helping foster and safeguard regional stability and supports U.S. objectives such as the global campaign to defeat ISIS, counter-terrorism cooperation, and economic development,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement.\nISIS is an acronym for the militant Islamic State group.\nConflicts in neighboring Syria and Iraq have damaged Jordan’s economy, forcing it to borrow heavily from external and domestic sources. Jordan has been an important part of the U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\nTURKEY TIES Tillerson is also expected this week to visit Turkey, with which U.S. ties have become badly strained over Washington’s support for the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, regarded by Ankara as a terrorist group.\n“With respect to my meetings in Ankara, Turkey is still an important NATO ally of the United States ... We need to find a way to continue to work in the same direction. We are committed to the same outcomes in Syria,” Tillerson said.\nTillerson expressed concern over Saturday’s confrontation between Israel and “Iranian assets” in Syria. Syrian air defenses shot down an Israeli F-16 jet on Saturday after it bombed a site used by Iran-backed position in Syria.\nTillerson said Iran should withdraw its forces and militias from Syria, where Tehran backs President Bashar al-Assad.\nResponding to the comments, a senior Iranian official, Ali Akbar Velayati, said Iran’s military presence in Syria was legitimate and based on an invitation from Damascus. He called on U.S. forces to leave Syria.\nReporting by Suleiman al-Khalidi and Yara Bayoumy in Amman; Writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T11:10:04.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
