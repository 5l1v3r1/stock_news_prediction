Violence has increased as rival drug gangs splinter into smaller groups and dispute territory.\nThe description of the video on YouTube said the Jalisco New Generation Cartel was behind the kidnapping, but Reuters could not independently confirm that.\nThe United States regards the cartel as one of Mexico’s most powerful drug gangs.\nNayarit’s then attorney general, Edgar Veytia, was arrested in San Diego last year on U.S. narcotics trafficking conspiracy charges.\nReporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Writing by Christine Murray; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T03:39:23.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
