This supported forecasts of further economic growth by panelists, with business optimism strengthening to a 56-month high.”\nThe survey also showed businesses were the most optimistic about future activity in 56 months, with firms citing planned new store openings and forecasts of continued solid economic growth.\nPrice pressures also continued to build, which will bolster the position of the Bank of Japan that inflation is slowly moving to its long elusive 2 percent target after years of massive monetary stimulus.\nThe index for prices charged by services sector companies rose to the highest since May 2014. Companies surveyed said they raised prices amid strong demand.\nThe composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, rose to 52.8 in January, from 52.2 in December.\nThe Markit/Nikkei manufacturing PMI for January, released last week, rose to 54.8, suggesting factory activity grew at the fastest pace in almost four years.\nJapan’s gross domestic product has expanded for the past seven quarters, the strongest run of growth since 1994, but gains have been largely driven by exports.\nThe output gap shows demand exceeds supply by the most in more than nine years.\nThe labor market is also the tightest it has been in more than 40 years, which economists say will push up wages and support domestic demand.\nReporting by Stanley White; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:16:31.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
