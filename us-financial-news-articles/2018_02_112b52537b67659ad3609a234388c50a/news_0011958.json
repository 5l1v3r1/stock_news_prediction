The referee made his decision together with the linesman. It was good for us that it was saved.” \nKane responded by saying: “I felt contact and I went down. I‘m not going to jump out of the way because it’s football.” \nTelevision sound recording of referee Jon Moss and assistant Eddie Smart revealed confusion about whether the ball had been accidentally played on to Kane by Liverpool’s Dejan Lovren. \nAfter a lengthy discussion with Smart, Moss asked fourth official Martin Atkinson if he had “got anything from TV”, which the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) on Monday said was “misguided”, but the referee was always aware that a Liverpool player had touched the ball on the way through.

Moss knew a Liverpool player had touched the ball but not that it was Lovren. \n“He then asked a question to his fourth official Martin Atkinson and acknowledges that referencing ‘TV’ was misguided. Atkinson did not reply to the question and so had no involvement in the decision.” \nVan Dijk was equally critical of the second penalty decision after Tottenham substitute Erik Lamela collapsed theatrically under his challenge. \n“For the second penalty, I see him coming and I try and hold my leg in, he just pulled his body in front of the ball and he goes down,” Van Dijk said. \n”The ref said play on and I was very disappointed that the linesman said otherwise. Unlucky I think. \n“First of all it was offside and secondly he just put his body in front of me. I don’t think that is a pen and the same with the first one.” \nThe FA will decide whether to take retrospective action against Kane or Lamela, with both penalties likely to be reviewed by an independent panel.
