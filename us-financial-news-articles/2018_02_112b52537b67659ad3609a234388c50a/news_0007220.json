REUTERS/Claudia Daut/File Photo Cuba halted its plant plans that same year because of a lack of funding after the collapse of Cuba’s trade and aid ties with the ex-Soviet bloc and he largely disappeared from public view appearing at the occasional scientific conference or diplomatic event.\nFidelito had been working for his uncle President Raul Castro as a scientific counselor to the Cuban Council of State and Vice-president of the Cuban Academy of Sciences at the time of his death.\nA former British ambassador to Cuba, Paul Hare, who lectures at Boston University’s Pardee School of Global Studies, said Castro Diaz-Balart had seemed “thoughtful, rather curious about the world beyond Cuba” at a dinner in Boston two years ago.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “But he seemed a bit weary about having to be a Castro, rather than himself,” Hare said.\nJonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a Cuba expert at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, said Fidelito had provided him with invaluable help in the 1990s while he was writing a book on Cuba’s nuclear program.\nIn 2000 they met again at a conference in Moscow and Fidelito worked “the room full of international nonproliferation experts, diplomats and journalists with aplomb, speaking no less than four languages -Spanish, English, Russian and French.”\nBenjamin-Alvarado said he suspected Fidelito’s title as scientific advisor was largely ceremonial as his views on energy development were not incorporated into national policies.\n“He had written extensively on Cuba’s need for developing renewable energy resources,” Benjamin-Alvarado said. “And yet almost all efforts by the Cuban government were geared to maintaining the status quo of oil dependency.”\n“I imagine that was disappointing for him.”\nFidelito’s death came just over a year after that of his father on Nov. 25, 2016, aged 90.\nReporting by Sarah Marsh and Marc Frank; Editing by Sandra Maler, Grant McCool and Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T03:41:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
