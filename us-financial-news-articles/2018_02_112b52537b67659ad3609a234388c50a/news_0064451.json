Authorities are probing whether Temer accepted bribes in exchange for extending a concession last year for operating services in the Port of Santos, Latin America’s busiest container port.\nThe port investigation is separate from other corruption cases that have resulted in charges, but no trials or convictions, against Temer.\nOn Tuesday evening, Dodge asked the Supreme Court to include Temer among those being investigated for possibly taking bribes from construction firm Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] in 2014. The investigation centers on a payment by Odebrecht of 10 million reais to Temer’s Brazilian Democratic Movement party.\nCarlos Marun, Temer’s political affairs minister and one of his closest confidants, told journalists in Brasilia that any investigation into the president would only find that he committed no crimes.\nIn her written request to the court, Dodge acknowledged that per Brazil’s Constitution, Temer could not be charged as long as he is the sitting president for any possible crime committed before he took office, but that he can be investigated, and eventually charged once he leaves office.\nCongress voted twice to block Temer from standing trial on those prior charges while in office.\nBrazil’s former top prosecutor, Rodrigo Janot, under whom the country’s unprecedented anti-corruption push began, told Reuters in a December interview that “Segovia was named to complete a mission - to divert the focus of the investigations.”\nSegovia rejected the criticism at that time and said he would strengthen the fight against corruption.\nReporting by Ricardo Brito and Lisandra Paraguassu; editing by Lisa Shumaker and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:19:15.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
