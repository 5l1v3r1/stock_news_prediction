XPO Logistics Inc. XPO -2.14% is focusing new expansion efforts on bulking up delivery of bulky items like appliances in its European operations , WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith reports, as the logistics operator builds up its profitability and looks for ways to keep up its growth pace. XPO reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter financial results, bolstered by a robust holiday peak for e-commerce and improved profitability across its transportation units. The e-commerce trade includes last-mile service that Chief Executive Bradley Jacobs says he wants to scale up in a big but fragmented European market. Mr. Jacobs has said the company has access to $8 billion for acquisitions, but so far the company is building its home-delivery organically in Europe even as the sector draws more interest as e-commerce sales grow. Moves by retailers like IKEA to sell direct to consumers have U.S.-based companies like XPO and Seko Logistics looking to snap up the last-mile logistics.\nProcter & Gamble Co. is resetting its U.S. operations as consumer-goods giant moves to get goods to retailers faster. The company will cut jobs in Kansas and Iowa while shuttering factories and moving production of various products in its lineup to West Virginia, the WSJ’s Sharon Terlep reports, part of a multi-billion dollar effort to overhaul an inefficient network of factories, warehouses and offices built up over the last century. Speed-to-market has gotten more critical as e-commerce, changing consumer tastes and new entrants have put new pressure on established suppliers to get more nimble and efficient. The actions carry important weight in North American distribution channels: P&G ships more than $70 billion a year in products. The company is consolidating distribution into eight main facilities and six sites it calls mixing centers. The result will be a supply chain designed to get 80% of its U.S. production to stores within 24 hours.\nOne of the world’s biggest miners is digging for new commodities. Rio Tinto PLC says it was hunting for acquisitions in new trade areas including lithium, as the company flexes newfound cash muscle that’s come with the global turnaround in commodities. Rio Tinto pushed its net profit up 90% to $8.76 billion in 2017, the WSJ’s Rhiannon Hoyle reports, kicking off a string of earnings reports from big miners expected to show gains in cash flow from the rising prices of coal, copper, aluminum and iron ore . That’s raising questions of what the companies will do with the windfall after years of retrenchment in sagging commodities markets. Rio Tinto’s eyes are on lithium, a drivers in a metals markets rally that’s growing as auto makers ramp up use of lithium and cobalt—key ingredients in batteries that power electric vehicles. Rio Tinto owns one undeveloped lithium deposit, but it has the cash to dig deeper into the market.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES Procter & Gamble’s Tide laundry detergent at a Costco Wholesale Corp. store. Photo: Bloomberg News A board room fight suggests that supermarket giant Supervalu Inc. has more value as a food supplier than as a grocery business. Blackwells Capital LLC is taking steps that could lead to splitting the company’s wholesale and retail divisions, the WSJ’s David Benoit and Heather Haddon report, highlighting the different directions that segments of the food distribution world are taking in a changing wing of the retail world . Grocery retailers are under heavy pressure in a low-margin business as digital commerce and changing consumer buying patterns upend traditional stores. The changes are seeping into the broader distribution channels for food. Supervalu’s wholesale division is thriving, providing the bulk of the company’s profits through its role as a major supplier to grocery chains across the country. Blackwells is impatient with Supervalu’s efficiency efforts and wants to shrink the store holdings and sell off the supplier operation, potentially triggering more consolidation in the wholesale end of food distribution.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We can’t expect the provinces to sit on their hands and take the hits. ’\n—John Boscariol, Toronto-based trade lawyer at McCarthy Tetrault, on retaliation by Ontario against “Buy American” provisions imposed by New York.\nNumber of the Day 32.4% Year-over-year increase in December in California’s exports of non-manufactured goods, chiefly farm products and raw materials, according to Beacon Economics .\nIN OTHER NEWS U.S. congressional leaders agreed to a two-year spending deal that would put $20 billion toward infrastructure, including surface transportation .
