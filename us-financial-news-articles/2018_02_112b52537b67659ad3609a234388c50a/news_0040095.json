It’s an injury we take very seriously and that we handle with the utmost care,” Swedish team doctor Jakob Swanberg said in a statement, adding that Hedberg had undergone further tests.\n“The tests have not given me the result I hoped for, which means that Mans cannot get medical clearance to start the competition,” Swanberg said.\nThe Big Air qualifying runs begin on Wednesday, with the finals due to take place at the Phoenix Extreme Park on Saturday February 24.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:10:34.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
