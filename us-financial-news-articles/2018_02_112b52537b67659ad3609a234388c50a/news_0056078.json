Going forward, we will make our policy decisions comprehensively by looking at the economy, inflation and U.S. monetary policy.”\nCAPITAL FLOWS: “Even if interest rates in the United States grow higher than South Korea‘s, I don’t see foreign capital outflows in the near term.”\n“We have a substantial current account surplus as well as large foreign reserves...Also when looking at the foreign investors in our bonds, we have a high percentage of investors who are known for their long-term investments, like foreign central banks, sovereign funds and international institutions.”\nDOMESTIC ECONOMY: “When we translate (the GM issue) into numbers, I don’t think this issue warrants a change in our economic outlook.”\n“In the case of the GM factory shutdown in Gunsan, the factory operation rate is already very low and the impact of the shutdown on our economy overall will be limited. For the regional economy, however, the impact will be big.”\n“If the United States strengthens its protectionist policies, industries that see the biggest trade surpluses against the United States will be hit the hardest. For example, I think we can say the auto and steel industry would be representative of that.” (Reporting by Christine Kim; Editing by Eric Meijer)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T05:01:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
