But they declined to provide specifics. \nA deadly sarin attack on a rebel-held area in April prompted Trump to order a missile strike last year on the Shayrat air base, from which the Syrian operation is said to have been launched. \n“We reserve the right to use military force to prevent or deter the use of chemical weapons,” one official said, while declining to specify how serious a chemical attack would have to be to draw a fresh U.S. military response. \nIf the international community does not act quickly to step up pressure on Assad, Syria’s chemical weapons could spread beyond Syria and possibly even “to U.S. shores,” a second official said. \n“It will spread if we don’t do something,” the official warned. \nThe officials reiterated U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s recent accusation that Russia, Assad’s ally in Syria’s multi-sided civil war, bears some responsibility for failing to enforce the chemical weapons ban. \nRussia has denied any complicity, and the Syrian government has said it has not carried out any of the attacks. \nMost recently, Western officials have cast suspicion on the Syrian government for a chlorine gas attack on a rebel-held enclave east of Damascus last week that sickened at least 13 people. \nThe U.S. officials also said Islamic State militants have used chemical weapons such as sulfur mustard and chlorine and have employed improvised explosive devices to deliver the chemicals. \nReporting by Matt Spetalnick; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T21:32:37.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
