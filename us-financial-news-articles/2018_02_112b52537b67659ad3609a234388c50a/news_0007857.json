His other shutout this season came last month at Pittsburgh.\nThe Canadiens have scored a total of one goal in two games since the All-Star break.\nMontreal goalie Carey Price made 28 saves.\nThe game had a drastically different tone that a meeting between the teams a week earlier, but the same team won.\nThe Hurricanes won all three meetings with Montreal this season, posting the franchise’s second season sweep in the series. The other came as the Hartford Whalers in the 1994-95 season.\nThe Hurricanes, who are two games into an eight-game homestand, try to match a season-best four-game winning streak when the Detroit Red Wings visit for Friday night’s game.\nPesce’s first goal of the season in 43 games came 2:43 into the second period. He took a blast from the blueline after receiving a pass from Elias Lindholm. The other assist went to Marcus Kruger, who had bene without a point since Dec. 12.\nMcGinn’s eighth goal of the season - and first in a nine-game stretch -- was aided by Justin Williams’ assist.\nMontreal didn’t register a shot on goal for nearly the first 15 minutes. The Canadiens were more of a threat in the second period, with 12 shots.\nThe teams met a week earlier on the eve of the All-Star break with the Hurricanes notching a wild 6-5 victory at Montreal.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:38:15.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
