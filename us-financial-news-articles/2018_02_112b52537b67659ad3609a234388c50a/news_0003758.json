COUNTER MARCH \nResidents and members of far-right groups carrying anti-Islam banners held a counter march through the city a few hours later to protest against what they say is rising crime by migrants. \nMore than 3,000 people shouted “Merkel must go!”, “We are the people!” and “Lying press!” in a main square before marching peacefully through the city escorted by riot police. \nAddressing the crowd through a loud speaker, one organizer urged the demonstrators not to talk to journalists covering the march: “Look, smile, but don’t touch!” she said. \nLast month, two Syrian teenagers injured a 16-year-old German boy with a knife and a group of three Syrians aged under 17 threatened a German couple with a knife outside a mall in Cottbus.

The interior ministry of Brandenburg, the federal state in which Cottbus lies, stopped sending refugees to the city last month. ANXIETY \n“We are here to make a clear stance against a rightist hate campaign,” said Lea Bunke, a 25-year-old German student at the first march, adding that the knife attacks by Syrian teenagers did not justify demands by some residents that all refugees leave the city.

There aren’t enough police, not enough kindergarten places and not enough teachers. We are demanding that Merkel step down.” \nPolice on Wednesday arrested six members of the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) - which Germany’s Constitutional Court last year said resembled Adolf Hitler’s Nazi party - who were handing out tear gas and flyers to Cottbus residents. \nThe city’s technical university draws hundreds of international students each year, and the influx of foreigners and refugees has prevented the population from shrinking below 100,000 from about 145,000 on the eve of German reunification in 1990.
