Kenyatta then won a repeat poll in October after Odinga boycotted it.\nRatings agencies are now circling about a potential downgrade if the strains do further damage to reform efforts.\nFor story on emerging market hit from global volatility click\nCENTRAL FOCUS Elsewhere, Indian markets barely budged as its central bank kept its main interest rate at 6 percent and it policy stance at “neutral” as it bids to balance a slowing economy again fast rising inflation.\nPoland and Romania’s central banks were also holding meetings.\nPoland looked set to keep its rates at a record low of 1.50 percent, though its signals will be key with no rise currently seen until early next year.\nIn contrast, Romania is expected to raise its rates by another quarter point to 2.25 percent after last month saw its first hike in a decade.\nInflation and wages are rising rapidly and analysts expect upcoming data to show the Romanian economy grew a sizzling 7 percent in the final part of last year.\n“Provided that our call for a hike materialises, we could see a short lived appreciation of the RON (Romanian leu),” ING Bank said in a note.\n“In line with the previous two public interventions, we might see NBR governor Isarescu talking down RON strengthening,” it added.\nThe zloty, the world’s best-performing currency last year along with the Czech crown, gained 0.22 percent to 4.1570 to the euro by 0930 GMT. The leu eased 0.1 percent.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see)\nAdditional reporting by Claire Milhench; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T12:45:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
