Shareholders will be called to a meeting to approve the deal on April 12.\nRevenue for the full year hit 7.901 billion euros, representing a 0.1 percent fall from the previous year in organic terms, but beating the 7.797 billion euro consensus estimate provided by the company.\nShares fell 0.5 percent against a flat Italian blue-chip stock index.
