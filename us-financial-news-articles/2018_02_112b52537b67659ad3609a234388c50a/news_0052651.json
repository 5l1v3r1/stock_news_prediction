November was a record of 2.026 million.\nKerosene exports were 890,000 tonnes, up 8.4 percent year-on-year.\nRefineries have ramped up exports over the past year as they have churned out more fuel to take advantage of decent profit margins and after the government issued generous export quotas as domestic demand growth has slowed.\nReporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:52:32.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
