LOUIS, Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Post Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:POST), a consumer packaged goods holding company, today reported results for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights:\nNet sales of $1.4 billion; operating profit of $164.5 million; net earnings of $294.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $281.6 million Completed the acquisition of Bob Evans Farms on January 12, 2018; raised annual run-rate cost synergies to $35-$40 million by fiscal year 2020 Updated fiscal year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) guidance range of $1.22-$1.25 billion US tax reform estimated to reduce fiscal year 2018 cash taxes by approximately $30-$35 million\nFirst Quarter Consolidated Operating Results\nNet sales were $1,433.1 million, an increase of 14.7%, or $183.3 million, compared to the prior year. Pro forma net sales (as defined later in this release under “Pro Forma Information”) increased 3.9%, or $53.7 million, when compared to the same period in fiscal year 2017. Gross profit was $451.7 million or 31.5% of net sales, an increase of $72.5 million compared to the prior year gross profit of $379.2 million or 30.3% of net sales.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $245.7 million or 17.1% of net sales, a decrease of $18.4 million compared to the prior year SG&A expenses of $264.1 million or 21.1% of net sales. SG&A expenses included a provision for $9.0 million and $74.5 million in legal settlements for first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding the impact of the legal settlement provisions, current year SG&A expenses increased $47.1 million driven by the inclusion of Weetabix and increased transaction and integration expenses.\nOperating profit was $164.5 million, an increase of 115.9%, or $88.3 million, compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $294.9 million, an increase of 189.7%, or $193.1 million, compared to net earnings of $101.8 million in the prior year. Net earnings available to common shareholders were $291.5 million, or $3.82 per diluted common share. Net earnings and net earnings available to common shareholders included a $263.6 million one-time income tax net benefit and $37.3 million loss related to early extinguishment of debt, both of which are discussed later in this release. Adjusted net earnings were $67.9 million, or $0.88 per diluted common share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $281.6 million, an increase of 22.4%, or $51.5 million, compared to the prior year.\nPost Consumer Brands\nNorth American ready-to-eat (“RTE”) cereal and granola.\nNet sales were $456.0 million for the first quarter, an increase of 1.9%, or $8.6 million, compared to the reported prior year first quarter. Pro forma net sales (as defined later in this release under “Pro Forma Information”) declined 4.2%, or $20.1 million, over the same period in fiscal year 2017, with pro forma volumes (as defined later in this release under “Pro Forma Information”) declining 2.4%. Volume growth from licensed products, Malt-O-Meal bag cereal and government bid business and private label was offset by declines of branded products. Pro forma net sales were negatively impacted by this unfavorable volume mix and timing of promotional activity.\nSegment profit was $72.9 million and $82.9 million for first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $109.1 million and $111.8 million for first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWeetabix\nInternational (primarily United Kingdom) RTE cereal and muesli.\nNet sales were $99.7 million for the first quarter. Pro forma net sales (as defined later in this release under “Pro Forma Information”) decreased 1.2%, or $1.2 million, over the same period in fiscal year 2017. Pro forma net sales benefitted from a favorable foreign exchange translation rate compared to the prior year which was offset by an unfavorable product mix. Segment profit was $16.8 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA was $25.6 million.\nMichael Foods Group\nEgg, potato, cheese and pasta products.\nNet sales were $577.1 million for the first quarter, an increase of 6.9%, or $37.3 million, over the prior year first quarter. Egg sales increased 9.3% driven by a 3.8% volume increase and increased market-based pricing in the ingredient and retail shell egg channels. Net sales and volume information for potato, cheese and pasta products is disclosed in a table presented later in this release.\nSegment profit (loss) was $74.9 million and ($17.0) million for first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively. Segment profit for the first quarter of 2017 was negatively impacted by a provision for $74.5 million in legal settlements related to egg antitrust class action claims. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $113.4 million and $92.3 million for first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nActive Nutrition\nProtein shakes, bars and powders and nutritional supplements.\nNet sales were $186.0 million for the first quarter, an increase of 20.9%, or $32.1 million, over the prior year first quarter. Net sales growth was primarily driven by strong growth for shake and powder products which were partially offset by declines of bar products. Segment profit was $19.8 million and $24.9 million for first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively. Segment profit for the first quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted by a provision for $9.0 million for a legal settlement. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $35.3 million and $31.1 million for first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nPrivate Brands\nPeanut and other nut butters and dried fruit and nut products.\nNet sales were $114.3 million for the first quarter, an increase of 5.2%, or $5.6 million, compared to the prior year first quarter, with volumes declining 1.6%. Volume growth in tree nut butter and organic peanut butter was offset by declines in certain lower margin dried fruit and nut products. Segment profit was $8.4 million and $5.7 million for first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $13.5 million and $10.6 million for first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest, Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, Other Income and Income Tax\nInterest expense, net was $90.5 million for the first quarter compared to $72.9 million for the prior year first quarter. The increase primarily related to an increase in the outstanding amount of debt principal, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average interest rate.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt of $37.3 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2018 in connection with Post’s redemption of its 6.00% senior notes due 2022.\nOther income, net relates to non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate swaps. Other income, net was $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $144.5 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome tax benefit was $255.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to an expense of $46.0 million and an effective income tax rate of 31.1% in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, as a result of the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Post recorded a $263.6 million one-time income tax net benefit which included (i) a $270.7 million benefit related to an estimate of the remeasurement of Post’s existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering both the expected fiscal year 2018 blended U.S. federal corporate tax rate of approximately 24.5% and a 21% rate for subsequent fiscal years and (ii) a $7.1 million expense related to an estimate of the transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, Post repurchased 0.7 million shares for $56.0 million at an average price of $78.01 per share. At the end of the first quarter of 2018, Post had $176.3 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.\nRecent Announcements\nOn January 10, 2018, Post announced it gave notice for the redemption of all outstanding shares of its 3.75% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock with a redemption date of February 15, 2018.\nOn January 11, 2018, Post announced it plans to combine its private brands businesses, which produce nut butter, dried fruit and nut, pasta and granola products, and explore a range of structural alternatives for these businesses, including an initial public offering, a placement of private equity, a sale of the businesses or a strategic combination.\nOn January 12, 2018, Post completed the acquisition of Bob Evans Farms, Inc. (“Bob Evans”), a leading producer and distributor of refrigerated potato, pasta and vegetable-based side dishes, pork sausage, and a variety of refrigerated and frozen convenience food items. Upon close of the acquisition, Post formed a refrigerated retail business unit and a foodservice business unit.\nOutlook\nPost management has updated its fiscal year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA range to be between $1.22-$1.25 billion, inclusive of Bob Evans.\nPost management estimates U.S. income tax reform will reduce its fiscal year 2018 cash taxes by approximately $30-$35 million.\nPost today announced it now expects to realize $35-$40 million in annual run-rate cost synergies related to the acquisition of Bob Evans by fiscal year 2020, an increase from Post’s initial expectation of $25 million.\nIn fiscal year 2018, Post management now expects to incur integration costs (which are an adjustment to non-GAAP measures) for the integration of Weetabix and Bob Evans of approximately $30 million comprised of severance, retention and third party consulting expenses, an increase from Post’s initial expectation of approximately $25 million.\nPost management expects fiscal year 2018 capital expenditures, inclusive of Bob Evans, to range between $235-$245 million. This includes approximately $50 million related to the previously announced cage-free housing conversion at the Bloomfield, Nebraska facility.\nThe Company provides Adjusted EBITDA guidance only on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide a reconciliation of its forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP guidance measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate swaps, provision for legal settlement, transaction and integration costs, restructuring and plant closure costs, assets held for sale, mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges and other charges reflected in the Company’s reconciliation of historical numbers, the amounts of which, based on historical experience, could be significant. For additional information regarding Post’s non-GAAP measures, see the related explanations presented under “Use of Non-GAAP Measures.”\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP measures in this release to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include total segment profit, Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA. The reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided later in this release under “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.”\nManagement uses certain of these non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA, as key metrics in the evaluation of underlying Company and segment performance, in making financial, operating and planning decisions, and, in part, in the determination of cash bonuses for its executive officers and employees. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides increased transparency and assists investors in understanding the underlying operating performance of the Company and its segments and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. Non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude certain items as described later in this release. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. For additional information regarding the Company’s non-GAAP measures, see the related explanations provided under “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” later in this release.\nConference Call to Discuss Earnings Results and Outlook\nThe Company will host a conference call on Friday, February 2, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. EST to discuss financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2018 outlook and to respond to questions.

These non-GAAP measures include total segment profit, Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA. The reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables following this section.\nNon-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude certain items as described below. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nTotal segment profit\nTotal segment profit represents the aggregation of the segment profit for each of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company believes total segment profit is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because it facilitates period-to-period comparison of results of segment operations.\nAdjusted net earnings and Adjusted diluted earnings per common share\nThe Company believes Adjusted net earnings and Adjusted diluted earnings per common share are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because they exclude items that affect the comparability of the Company’s financial results and could potentially distort an understanding of the trends in business performance.\nAdjusted net earnings and Adjusted diluted earnings per common share are adjusted for the following items:\na. Non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate swaps : The Company has excluded the impact of non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate swaps due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with respect to estimates of fair value and economic conditions and the amount and frequency of such adjustments and settlements are not consistent.\nb. Premium on debt extinguishment : The Company has excluded payments for premiums on debt extinguishment as such payments are inconsistent in amount and frequency. Additionally, the Company believes that these costs do not reflect expected ongoing future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods.\nc. Provision for legal settlement : The Company has excluded gains and losses recorded to recognize the anticipated or actual resolution of certain litigation as the Company believes such gains and losses do not reflect expected ongoing future operating income and expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods.\nd. Transaction costs and integration costs : The Company has excluded transaction costs related to professional service fees and other related costs associated with signed and closed business combinations and divestitures and integration costs incurred to integrate acquired or to-be-acquired businesses as the Company believes that these exclusions allow for more meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods. The Company believes such costs are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of acquired assets as part of the Company or the performance of the divested assets, and are not factored into management’s evaluation of potential acquisitions or its performance after completion of an acquisition or the evaluation to divest an asset. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges varies significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures and the maturity of the businesses being acquired or divested. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions and divestitures, which often drive the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of future acquisitions or divestitures. By excluding these expenses, management is better able to evaluate the Company’s ability to utilize its existing assets and estimate the long-term value that acquired assets will generate for the Company. Furthermore, the Company believes that the adjustments of these items more closely correlate with the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance.\ne. Restructuring and plant closure costs : The Company has excluded certain costs associated with facility closures as the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent. Additionally, the Company believes that these costs do not reflect expected ongoing future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods.\nf. Assets held for sale : The Company has excluded adjustments recorded to adjust the carrying value of facilities and other assets classified as held for sale as such adjustments represent non-cash items and the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent. Additionally, the Company believes that these adjustments do not reflect expected ongoing future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods.\ng. Mark-to-market adjustments on commodity and foreign exchange hedges : The Company has excluded the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on commodity and foreign exchange hedges due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with respect to fair value estimates. Additionally, these adjustments are primarily non-cash items and the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent.\nh. Foreign currency gains and losses on intercompany loans : The Company has excluded the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective legal entity in evaluating Company performance to allow for more meaningful comparisons of performance to other periods.\ni. Income Tax : The Company has included the income tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments using its estimated blended annual income tax rate or its effective income tax rate, as noted in the footnote of the reconciliation tables, as the Company believes that the Company’s GAAP effective income tax rate as reported is not representative of the income tax expense impact of the adjustments.\nj. Preferred stock : The Company has included dividend and weighted-average diluted share adjustments related to its convertible preferred stock using the “if-converted” method when the convertible preferred stock is dilutive on an adjusted basis.\nk. U.S. tax reform net benefit : The Company has excluded the impact of the one-time income tax net benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2018 which reflected (i) the benefit related to an estimate of the remeasurement of the Company’s existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering both the Company’s expected fiscal year 2018 blended U.S. federal corporate tax rate of approximately 24.5% and a 21% rate for subsequent fiscal years and (ii) the expense related to an estimate of a transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. The Company believes that the net benefit as reported is not representative of the Company’s current income tax position and exclusion of the benefit allows for more meaningful comparisons of performance to other periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA\nThe Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and liquidity because (i) we believe it is widely used to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, (ii) it presents a measure of corporate performance exclusive of the Company’s capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired, and (iii) it is a financial indicator of a company’s ability to service its debt, as the Company is required to comply with certain covenants and limitations that are based on variations of EBITDA in the Company’s financing documents. The Company believes that segment Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because it allows for assessment of the operating performance of each reportable segment. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to provide forward-looking guidance and uses Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA to forecast future results.\nAdjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA reflect adjustments for interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, and the following adjustments discussed above: non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate swaps, provision for legal settlement, transaction costs and integration costs, restructuring and plant closure costs, assets held for sale, mark-to-market adjustments on commodity and foreign exchange hedges, and foreign currency gains and losses on intercompany loans. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA reflect adjustments for the following items:\nl. Loss on extinguishment of debt : The Company has excluded losses recorded on extinguishment of debt, inclusive of payments for premiums and the write-off of debt issuance costs, as such losses are inconsistent in amount and frequency. Additionally, the Company believes that these costs do not reflect expected ongoing future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods.\nm. Non-cash stock-based compensation : The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain executives and employees by aligning their long-term compensation interests with shareholders’ investment interests. The Company has excluded non-cash stock-based compensation as non-cash stock-based compensation can vary significantly based on reasons such as the timing, size and nature of the awards granted and subjective assumptions which are unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period and do not contribute to meaningful comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods.\nn. Noncontrolling interest adjustment: The Company has included adjustments for interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization for consolidated joint ventures which are attributable to the noncontrolling owners of the consolidated joint ventures.\no. Equity method investment adjustment: The Company has included adjustments for its portion of interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization for unconsolidated joint ventures.\nRECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS TO ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (Unaudited) (in millions) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Net Earnings Available to
