Mr. McLeod was the subject of a Page One article in The Wall Street Journal in 2015 on the challenges colleges face in balancing the rights of the accuser and the accused in sexual-misconduct cases. He sued Duke in 2014.\nMr. McLeod, 27 years old, completed a law degree in his native Australia while waiting for the case to be resolved, said Rachel Hitch, his lawyer. Mr. McLeod plans to apply to graduate school and hopes the settlement will make employers more willing to hire him, she said.\n“He is happy,” she said. “It’s been a heavy load for him to bear.”\nDuke spokesman Michael Schoenfeld declined to comment on whether the school would grant a diploma or whether there would be any monetary award. He said only, “the parties have settled their differences.”\nThe case involves a November 2013 encounter between Mr. McLeod, then a senior, and a freshman. Mr. McLeod told campus investigators in early 2014 that they met at a bar and later had consensual sex; the woman told campus investigators that she hadn’t wanted to engage in sex.\nA disciplinary panel found that it was “more likely than not” that the woman didn’t agree to sex and was too intoxicated to consent.\nMr. McLeod claimed the disciplinary panel of students and school employees erred in its handling of the case, in part by relying on an anonymous statement and failing to let him question that person.\nThe woman hasn’t been named in court documents. She hasn’t responded to emailed requests for comment, and Duke has previously said she doesn’t wish to be interviewed.\nDurham police investigated but didn’t charge Mr. McLeod.\nIn the lawsuit, he said Duke breached its contract with him by failing to follow its rules on impartial treatment. In its response to the suit, Duke said its procedures were followed correctly and the school had no contractual obligation to him.\nIt isn’t clear whether Mr. McLeod will receive his diploma. Duke decided to expel Mr. McLeod after he finished his final exams and days before graduation. Duke has said he was “not entitled to that honor.”\nMr. McLeod was one of about 50 accused students suing their colleges and universities when his case was originally filed, said Samantha Harris, vice president of policy research at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil-liberties group. Now there are more than 200 cases involving accused students saying they were denied due process, she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T03:31:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
