The trial was conducted without evidence and objectivity; it was imposed,” Son said.\nThe 14-year jail term for Binh, 35, is one of the toughest sentences to have been delivered against an activist in Vietnam.\nAnother prominent blogger, Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, known as “Me Nam” (Mother Mushroom), received a 10-year term last year.\n“The sentences have been more and more severe, perhaps because of weaker interventions from the outsiders and foreigners, and also because the power holders think this sentence could have deterrence effect,” said Son, who has defended many more rights activists.\nLast week, Vietnam listed a U.S.-based group still loyal to the now defunct state of South Vietnam as a terrorist organisation while the Communist nation jailed four men for flying the South Vietnamese flag last month.\nBesides advocating on environmental issues, Binh also participated and called people to join an “independent union” in 2015, local news website Baonghean (Nghe An Newspaper) reported, citing authorities’ documents on Binh.\nEditing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:17:35.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
