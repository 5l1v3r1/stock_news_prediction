The rebound came after a global equity markets sell-off triggered by worries a rise in U.S. inflation may boost dollar funding costs. \"With the U.S. dollar heading lower, improving regional currency sentiment, global investors are moving back into undervalued pockets of local equity markets to pick up yield and gain local currency exposure,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore. The dollar held above three-year lows against a basket of currencies on Monday. The U.S. currency has been weighed down by a variety of factors this year, including concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy.
