Macron, visibly irritated, promised to find \"solutions\" to replace glyphosate, which is thought to be carcinogenic. \nMany farmers are also angry about trade talks with South American countries that could make France import more foreign meat. \nMacron said his policies aim to invest more to raise French food and farming standards and to help farmers facing foreign competition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T17:52:01.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
