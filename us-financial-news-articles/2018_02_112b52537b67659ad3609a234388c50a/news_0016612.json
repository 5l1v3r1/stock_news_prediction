The office was tasked with getting government departments to adopt more user-friendly technologies.\nSince then, though, other efforts have sprung up outside of government to help improve American's access to online services.\nOne, called Code for America, has implemented technology-improvement projects that it says have reduced the average time to fill out applications for some federal and state services.\nRead the full report on the GSA's 18F office here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T20:54:31.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
