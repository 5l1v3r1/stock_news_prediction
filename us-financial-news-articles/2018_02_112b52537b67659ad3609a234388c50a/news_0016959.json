These phones contain essential logistical and competition information for the athletes,” an IOC spokesperson said. \n“Regarding Iran, we can confirm that all participants will be able to keep the phones. Regarding North Korea, all participants are requested not to take the phones back to their home country,” the spokesperson added. \nAn Olympics organizer told Reuters last week that South Korea was unsure if North Korean athletes would be eligible to receive the phones because of U.N. Security Council sanctions. \nThe official declined to elaborate, but experts say the phone could violate a U.N. ban on the sale of luxury items and electronics with a potential “dual” commercial and military use. ENVOY SUMMONED \nIran summoned South Korea’s ambassador to Tehran to the Foreign Ministry, to explain the phone snub. \n“If Samsung does not apologize for its unwise action, this will greatly affect Samsung’s trade relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran”, the state news agency IRNA quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi as saying. \nA spokesman for Seoul’s foreign ministry spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. \nSamsung ( 005930.KS ) said the IOC was responsible for distributing gifts at the Olympics and it had no further comment. \nIran has four competitors at the 2018 Winter Olympics. North Korea has 10 athletes entered to represent their nation, and 12 more in the combined North and South Korea women’s ice-hockey team. \nTough international sanctions including travel restrictions and a ban on the sale of luxury goods and sports gear have complicated South Korean Olympic organizers’ efforts to provide their northern neighbors with the same benefits available to other Olympians. \nHowever, it was unclear why that would affect Iranian athletes, as Samsung products are widely available for sale in Iran, which has good diplomatic and trade relations with South Korea. Almost 18 million Iranians have Samsung phones, according to Iran’s largest app market, Café Bazaar. \nA source from within the Olympic movement told Reuters a delay in delivering the phones had been due to “a misunderstanding”.
