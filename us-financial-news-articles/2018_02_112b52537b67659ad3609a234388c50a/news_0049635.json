They’re going to be smarter and work out where to bowl to me from the series that they did at home.\n“They’re going to challenge me in areas where I’ve been getting out. I‘m prepared for what they bring and I’ve just got to make sure I‘m in the right mental state and I play each ball on its merit.”\nWarner expects a stirring contest against South Africa’s fearsome pace bowlers Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada and Morne Morkel.\nThe trio tormented India’s batsmen on fast and bouncy pitches earlier this year to seal a 2-1 home test series win, with Philander and Rabada claiming 15 wickets each, while Morkel chipped in with 13.\n“They’ve got Vern (Philander) who hits the money every time and if the conditions are in his favour, he’s going to be tough work,” Warner said.\n“You know Morne is going to come into your ribs. It’s exciting, just thinking about it now sends shivers down my spine. I just want to get over there and get into it.”\nSouth Africa take on Australia at Kingsmead, Durban in first of four test matches starting March 1.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T14:06:58.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
