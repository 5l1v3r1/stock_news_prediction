The lawsuits over the energy standards are among a spate of legal actions challenging decisions by the Trump administration to roll back environmental protections.\nThe states argued that the new standards would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save businesses and consumers billions of dollars, and conserve enough energy to power more than 19 million households for a year.\nChhabria gave the DOE 28 days to publish the standards — the step needed to make them legally enforceable.\nThe standards at issue also cover air compressors, commercial packaged boilers and uninterruptable power supplies. There is currently no federal energy standard for air compressors, uninterruptable power supplies or portable air conditioners, according to the states' lawsuit.\nThe Obama administration signed off on them in December 2016 and posted them online for a 45-day review period intended to spot any errors.\nChhabria said the Trump administration did not have the authority assess, modify or withdraw an energy standard after that period.\nThe other states in the lawsuit are: Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Vermont, Washington, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Maryland. The City of New York is also a plaintiff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:57:28.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
