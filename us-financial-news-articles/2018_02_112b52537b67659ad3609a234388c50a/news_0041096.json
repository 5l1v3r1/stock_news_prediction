The fund will be used to acquire underperforming hotels and resorts in the U.S. and select international markets through direct investments and co-investments alongside private equity partners.\nNorthview is led by five partners with over 110 years of combined experience in all phases of the lodging industry. Since forming in 2006, Northview has acquired over $1 billion of lodging and resort real estate assets. Northview targets value-add opportunities in the hotel and resort real estate sectors, where it can leverage its proprietary management systems, best-in-class construction management team, and industry-leading residential sales arm. Its fully-integrated investment platform allows Northview to unlock value at every stage of the deal cycle.\n\"We are thrilled to close our third investment fund, NV Acquisitions III,\" said Northview Partner Mark Mance. \"We are especially proud that all of the investors in our first two funds reinvested in this vehicle, and most increased their commitments, which is a testament to the abilities of our company and our successful track record.\"\n\"Although it's increasingly difficult to identify investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns, our fully-integrated operating platform allows us the ability to identify and unlock value where others cannot. We are closely monitoring all lodging markets with a specific focus on complex resorts and urban assets in Top 50 U.S. markets,\" said Northview Partner, Matt Trevenen.\n\"We recently created a successful partnership with the long-term owner of an iconic, historic resort,\" explained Northview Partner, Simon Hallgarten. \"The partnership allowed the owner to partially monetize the asset, and we were able to provide much needed capital to upgrade the property and implement our proprietary management tools and systems. This structure has created a \"win-win\" for both parties, and is one we are looking to replicate in future transactions.\"\nAbout Northview Hotel Group\nNorthview Hotel Group, led by Mark Mance, Simon Hallgarten, David Zeuske, Matt Trevenen and Brent Mclean, is a fully-integrated hotel and resort community owner/operator that has purchased over $1B of lodging assets since forming in 2004. Northview Hotel Group's current portfolio includes properties ranging from small independent resorts to large urban branded hotels.
