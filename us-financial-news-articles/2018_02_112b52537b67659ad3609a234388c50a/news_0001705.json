The valuation of the two acquired units was on a cash- and debt-free basis.\nKinnevik, which owns 20.0 percent of the capital and 47.6 percent of the votes in MTG, said in a separate statement it supported the merger.\nSome analysts had said a split of MTG into two separate companies was on the cards, as there were no obvious synergies between the firm’s Nordic entertainment operations and its digital arm.
