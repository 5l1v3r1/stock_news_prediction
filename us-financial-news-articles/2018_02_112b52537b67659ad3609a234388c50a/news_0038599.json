I don’t know. I‘m not closing the door.”\nThe Sochi super-G champion said he had found the transition from the speed events to the technical giant slalom too tricky in the opening run of the race on Sunday.\n“You compete in speed disciplines for two or three weeks and you come in and want to make statement in GS (giant slalom) but the consistency is hard. I got kicked out of the gate and it’s over,” he added.\n“The difference between the specialists and the all-rounders was clear today.”\nJansrud will depart South Korea on Monday and said he would do so with a sense of satisfaction over how he had performed in Pyeongchang.\n“The championships have been good, I’ve been close to gold,” he said.\n”I had issues in the combined with the downhill part being shortened but the slalom not shortened. That was a tough day mentally because I figured I had a good chance of a medal there.\n”I thought I had three good chances of a medal here, I got two of them. So all in all, I‘m very happy with the silver and bronze, and as a team, getting the long-awaited downhill gold, that was a big day.\n“I‘m going to have a smile on my face on the plane home.”\nThe two medals on the Jeongseon piste allowed Jansrud to draw alongside Italian great Alberto Tomba and compatriot Lasse Kjus in third place on the list of most decorated male Olympic Alpine skiers.\n“I remember getting Tomba’s autograph in Lillehammer in 1993, I think I still have it,” he smiled. “Now suddenly I‘m being mentioned alongside him. That’s a proud moment.”\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T12:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:10:40.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
