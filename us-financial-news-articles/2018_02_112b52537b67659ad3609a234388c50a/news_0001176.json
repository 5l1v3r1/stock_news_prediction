Reuters first reported the planned reduction. \nU.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan must still deicide whether to approve the revised agreement. \nThe Harley-Davidson settlement resolved allegations that Harley sold about 340,000 “super tuners” enabling motorcycles since 2008 to pollute the air at levels greater than what the company certified. Harley-Davidson did not admit liability, and said previously it disagreed with the government, arguing that the tuners were designed and sold to be used in “competition only.” \nVermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan, joined by Massachusetts, New York, Washington State and others, said Sessions’ new policy “does not apply to projects like the wood stove mitigation project that directly remedies the harm caused by pollutants emitted by the non-compliant Harley-Davidson motorcycles.” \nThe states and the Obama administration said the $3 million wood stove mitigation project would offset additional air pollution caused by the motorcycles’ emissions of excess hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. \nThe Harley-Davidson settlement came amid greater scrutiny on emissions and “defeat devices” by U.S. regulators after Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ) admitted to using illegal software to evade U.S. emissions standards in nearly 600,000 U.S. vehicles in September 2015. \nThe Natural Resources Defense Council also asked the judge to reject the removal of the $3 million mitigation project, saying it “is not reasonable because it does not adequately protect the environment and does not sufficiently compensate the public.” \nThe Environmental Protection Agency and Harley did not immediately comment Thursday.
