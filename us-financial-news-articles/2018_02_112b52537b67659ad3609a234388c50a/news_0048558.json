The company will merge with Water Street's commercialization services platform that specializes in market access solutions and was formed last year through the merger of Alliance Life Sciences, Health Strategies Group and The Access Group.\nWith the addition of DLSS, the platform will become the leading independent provider of commercialization services to life sciences companies. It will serve more than 300 of the industry's top pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies with a portfolio of solutions designed to simplify commercialization, optimize market access and build share for new and existing therapies.\nJim Lang, executive chairman of the global enterprise, said, \"Adding DLSS to our life sciences platform is a game changer. Its client-focused culture and service capabilities are a strong strategic fit with our companies. As one entity, the center of our DNA will be to engage our combined capabilities to go above and beyond to delight our customers.\"\nCynthia LaConte, CEO of DLSS parent, The Dohmen Company, said, \"At Dohmen, we've been creating a more efficient, effective and easy-to-use health experience for 160 years. We built, launched and grew DLSS as a disruptive alternative to traditional models that aren't well suited to serving companies with targeted therapies and smaller patient populations. That's why it was important for us to find partners that could not only scale the business but could add strategically important capabilities for our clients.\"\nDLSS will continue to operate under its existing name with its current leadership team. When the transaction closes, its leadership team will report to the platform's board of directors spearheaded by Mr. Lang.\nDan Agroskin, partner, JLL Partners, said, \"Our global platform is ideally positioned to support the life sciences industry as it continues to develop targeted therapies. We are pleased to partner with Water Street to invest our combined expertise and resources to optimize the impact of these important new products through organic initiatives and targeted acquisitions.\"\nPete Strothman, partner, Water Street, added, \"We are excited to bring together these premium capabilities to continue building a robust, go-to-market services platform for the life sciences industry that is uniquely qualified to ensure client success, particularly for highly specialized patient populations.\"\nFinancial details of the acquisition are not being disclosed.\nAbout Dohmen Life Science Services\nLaunched in 2014, DLSS empowers hundreds of life science companies ranging from start up to fortune 500 with best-in-class outsourced infrastructure, insight and services by providing services in the areas of patient support, supply chain, compliance, finance and technology. DLSS acts as a seamless extension of our clients' companies â€“ reducing cost and complexity while strengthening and simplifying their connection with patients.
