Havermann, CFP® (Arvada): In August 2017, CFP Board's Disciplinary and Ethics Commission (Commission) issued an order in which Mr. Havermann received a Letter of Admonition. The Commission issued its order after determining that Mr. Havermann: 1) failed to act with the duty of care of a fiduciary when he charged clients an unreasonable investment advisory fee because he valued assets under management that he purchased at a discount at the audited price of the asset; 2) failed to disclose or otherwise omitted facts where that disclosure was necessary to avoid misleading clients when he failed to disclose the risks involved with Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and non-traded REITS in his Form ADV Part 2; and 3) failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements when he failed to comply with Colorado statutes and regulations, which resulted in a Stipulation and Consent Order with the State of Colorado. The Commission determined that Mr. Havermann's conduct violated Rules 1.4, 2.1, and 4.3 of CFP Board's Rules of Conduct and provided grounds for discipline pursuant to Articles 3(A) and 3(D) of CFP Board's Disciplinary Rules and Procedures.

Mr. Ostrofsky's use of fee-only was misleading because he was registered with a broker-dealer, licensed, appointed and otherwise eligible to receive insurance commissions, and he collected commissions from the sale of annuities, insurance products, sale of equities, mutual funds, and other types of securities. Mr. Ostrofsky also consented to CFP Board's finding that he communicated false or misleading information to clients or prospective clients when he: 1) stated that he operated without any conflicts of interest; 2) suggested that he was not paid through commissions; and 3) stated that all advisors who earn commissions (a) do not act in the client's best interests, (b) make recommendations based on their own personal enrichment, and (c) fail to disclose to clients all relevant facts.
