As with its supermarkets, Woolworths is cutting prices at Big W and ramping up its online offers.\nCEO Banducci did not give profit guidance for the full year but said food sales growth had slowed to 3.7 percent in the current half.\nThe company declared an interim dividend of 43 cents per share, compared to a dividend of 34 cents a year ago.\n$1 = 1.2752 Australian dollars Reporting by Byron Kaye in Sydney and Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; editing by\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T00:41:15.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
