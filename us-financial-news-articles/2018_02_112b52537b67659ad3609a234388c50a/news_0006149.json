The U.N. has been hit by dozens of cases of alleged sexual harassment committed by its staff globally in 2017 and a recent investigation by British newspaper The Guardian said employees feared that reporting such complaints could cost them their job.\nThe Thomson Reuters Foundation asked the office of the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and four of its most high profile agencies about such cases and their responses - offering a snapshot of U.N.-wide efforts to stamp out harassment.\nUNHCR said it had fired two members of staff over such allegations in 2017.\nWFP fired one employee, suspended another - an investigation is underway - and is probing a third case.\nThe U.N. children’s agency (UNICEF) documented four allegations in 2017 - one was found to be unsubstantiated, one is under investigation, while two other staff members have since left the organization.\nThe U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) said it is examining four cases of sexual harassment, while the secretariat - which administers and coordinates the activities of the U.N. - referred four cases for possible disciplinary action.\nThese cases concern sexual harassment as opposed to cases of sexual exploitation and violence, which have hit headlines in recent years in nations from Haiti to Central African Republic.\nMORE WOMEN WANTED WFP executive director David Beasley this month announced an overhaul of the agency’s sexual harassment policy and vowed to hire more women and give more senior roles to female employees.\n“If you are not willing to treat everyone with dignity and respect and if it bothers you that the workforce of WFP is going to include more women at all levels, then there is no place for you at WFP,” Beasley wrote in a public letter to staff.\nThe U.N. boss in November created a task force on sexual harassment to review, improve and coordinate policies across the various agencies, according to his office.\nYet each agency has its own rules and code of conduct for its staff, while Guterres does not have direct authority over all parts of the U.N. system, said spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n“The Secretariat is committed to continue working on this issue and welcomes the significant social movement which has drawn renewed attention to sexual harassment in the workplace.”\nThe U.N. pledges could be a sign of “concrete change in the industry”, according to Megan Nobert, founder of Report the Abuse, which collects data on sexual abuse against aid workers.\n“This is also what zero tolerance begins to look like in practice, not just in words,” said Nobert, who was raped by a colleague working at a U.N. peacekeeping base in South Sudan.\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Kieran Guilbert and Lyndsay Griffiths.
