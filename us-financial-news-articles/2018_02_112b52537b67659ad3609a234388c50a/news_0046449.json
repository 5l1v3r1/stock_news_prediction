However, figures for the financial year ending in March are unlikely to show such a sharp year-on-year decline, the OBR added. The OBR forecast in November that borrowing would rise slightly to 49.9 billion pounds in 2017/18 from 45.7 billion pounds a year before. A stronger budget outturn for 2017/18 might prompt downward revisions to borrowing for future years, the OBR said, adding it would update its forecasts when finance minister Philip Hammond publishes a budget update on March 13.
