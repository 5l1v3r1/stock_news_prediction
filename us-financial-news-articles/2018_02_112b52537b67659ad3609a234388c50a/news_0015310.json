The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a lack of shipments of electric control systems to Inox during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, partially offset by increased license revenues. Revenues in the Grid segment increased year-over-year.\nAMSC’s net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $4.2 million, or $0.21 per share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.20 per share, for the same period of fiscal 2016. The Company’s non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $3.5 million, or $0.18 per share, compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $2.9 million, or $0.21 per share, in the same period of fiscal 2016. Please refer to the financial table below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on December 31, 2017 totaled $22.3 million, compared with $30.5 million at September 30, 2017.\n“Our Grid segment delivered record revenues in the third quarter,” said Daniel P. McGahn, President and CEO, AMSC. “In 2017, Inox has participated and won in each of the 1st two national power tender auctions. Inox has since resumed production and we look forward to working with them as they ramp up their factory.”\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the fourth quarter ending March 31, 2018, AMSC expects that its revenues will be in the range of $12.0 million to $18.0 million. The Company’s net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 is expected to be less than $7.5 million, or $0.37 per share. The Company's non-GAAP net loss (as defined below) is expected to be less than $6.9 million, or $0.34 per share. The Company expects an operating cash burn of $3.0 million to $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nConference Call Reminder\nIn conjunction with this announcement, AMSC management will participate in a conference call with investors beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, February 6th to discuss the Company’s financial results and business outlook.

Any statements in this release about our work with Inox as they ramp up their factory; our expected financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, our expected operating cash burn during the quarter ending March 31, 2018, and other statements containing the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"will\" , constitute within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such represent management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. There are a number of important factors that could materially impact the value of our common stock or cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such . These important factors include, but are not limited to: A significant portion of our revenues are derived from a single customer, Inox; We have a history of operating losses and negative operating cash flows, which may continue in the future and require us to secure additional financing in the future; Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may fall below expectations in any particular fiscal quarter; Our financial condition may have an adverse effect on our customer and supplier relationships; Our success in addressing the wind energy market is dependent on the manufacturers that license our designs; Our success is dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel and our inability to do so could significantly damage our business and prospects; We rely upon third-party suppliers for the components and sub-assemblies of many of our Wind and Grid products, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations; Failure to successfully execute any move of our Devens, Massachusetts manufacturing facility or achieve expected savings following any move could adversely impact our financial performance; We may not realize all of the sales expected from our backlog of orders and contracts; Our success depends upon the commercial use of high temperature superconductor products, which is currently limited, and a widespread commercial market for our products may not develop; Growth of the wind energy market depends largely on the availability and size of government subsidies, economic incentives and legislative programs designed to support the growth of wind energy; We have operations in and depend on sales in emerging markets, including India, and global conditions could negatively affect our operating results or limit our ability to expand our operations outside of these markets; We face risks related to our intellectual property; We face risks related to our legal proceedings; Tax reform in the U.S. may negatively affect our operating results; and the important factors discussed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in Part 1. Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and our other reports filed with the SEC.

Non-GAAP net loss $(6,900 ) Non-GAAP net loss per share $(0.34 ) Shares outstanding 20,300 Note: Non-GAAP net loss is defined by the Company as net loss before sale of minority investments; stock-based compensation; amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; consumption of zero cost-basis inventory; non-cash interest expense; change in fair value of warrants and contingent consideration; non-cash interest expense; tax effect of adjustments; and other unusual charges. The Company believes non-GAAP net loss assists management and investors in comparing the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding these non-cash, non-recurring or other charges that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company is not able to provide the change in fair value of warrants and contingent consideration on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts because the calculation for that change is primarily driven by the closing price and volatility of the Company's stock at the end of each fiscal quarter, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The Company does not expect to adjust non-GAAP net loss for non-cash interest expense in future quarters due to the repayment of the Company’s term loan during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Actual non-GAAP net loss for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018, including the above adjustments, may differ materially from those forecasted in the table above.\nGenerally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures included in this release, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net loss is set forth in the table above.\nAMSC Investor Relations\nBrion D.
