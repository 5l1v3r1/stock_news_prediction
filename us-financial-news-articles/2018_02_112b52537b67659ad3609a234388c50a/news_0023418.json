Lawyers for Laver did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nWells Fargo is not a defendant and was not accused of wrongdoing. It also had no immediate comment.\nCredit Suisse awarded Wells Fargo the exclusive right to recruit its brokers on Oct. 20, 2015. It told its roughly 275 brokers in 13 U.S. offices that the business was too small to compete absent significant investment or acquisitions.\nWells Fargo is based in San Francisco. Its retail brokerage recently had 14,544 financial advisers and $1.7 trillion of client assets, and its wealth management business recently had $248 billion of client assets.\nThe case is Laver v Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-00828.
