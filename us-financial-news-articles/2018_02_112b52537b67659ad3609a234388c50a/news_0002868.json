The Blazers shot 63.6 percent in the half, making 7 of 16 3-point attempts. Lavine had 12 first-half points for Chicago, which lost its fifth consecutive game.\nThe Bulls were without their top three scorers -- forwards Nikola Mirotic and Lauri Markannen (family reasons) and point guard Kris Dunn (concussion and illness). Mirotic reportedly is shut down while the team explores a potential trade.\nThe Bulls got as close as 88-68 late in the third quarter. McCollum had 50 points as Portland carried a 102-75 lead into the fourth quarter.\nChicago got no closer than 16 points the rest of the way.\nPortland sank nine of its first 11 shots en route to a 23-2 lead in the first 5 1/2 minutes as the Bulls started 1 of 11. It was 38-11 after McCollum knocked down his fourth straight 3-pointer and 43-19 after one quarter. The Blazers knocked down 17 of 23 shots in the quarter, including 5 of 8 from 3-point range.\nMcCollum made 11 of his first 12 shots and finished 11 of 14 from the field, 4 of 5 from 3-point range and 3 of 3 from the free-throw line in the opening quarter.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T13:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:07:33.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
