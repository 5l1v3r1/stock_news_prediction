However, a deal may take a few months as it will involve restructuring 9mobile’s debt.\n“The Board of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has reassured Stakeholders of its commitment to ensure that the nation’s fourth largest Mobile Network Operator, EMTS/9Mobile, is duly taken over by investors with the requisite technical capability and pedigree to manage the organisation,” the board said in a statement.\nReporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by Chijioke Ohuocha; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:21:16.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
