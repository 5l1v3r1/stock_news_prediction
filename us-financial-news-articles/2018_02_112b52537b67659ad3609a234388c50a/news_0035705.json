Pretax profit of 1.793 billion francs matched expectations for 1.803 billion francs in the poll.\n“In 2018, we will remain focused on disciplined execution and on delivering value for our clients and shareholders for the final year of our restructuring plan,” Thiam said.\nThe group said it would propose a reduced dividend of 0.25 francs per share, compared to 0.70 francs in 2016 and average expectations for 0.28 francs amongst eight analysts polled.
