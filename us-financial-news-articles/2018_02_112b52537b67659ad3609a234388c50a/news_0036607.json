I am speechless. I did not expect it. I have not been on the podium before. It feels like a dream, I hope it’s real. I have no words for this moment” Gallhuber said\n“My second run was really good. I stood on the start and thought ‘All in’ because I was really far behind.”\nReporting by Simon Evans, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:27:19.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
