It’s a return to a repressive period we had forgotten about,” said Madowo. “We are becoming another African country with these kinds of issues.”\nKaikai, who is also chairman of the Kenya Editors’ Guild, said editors had been warned by authorities that they could be shut down if they covered the event.\nThe stations would stay off air indefinitely, the government said on Wednesday, as it investigates the symbolic oath by Odinga, directly challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta. [L8N1PQ3JZ]\nInterior Minister Fred Matiang‘i accused media organizations of facilitating the “illegal act”, which he said put the lives of thousands of Kenyans at risk.\n“This is a gross abuse of the law and complete disregard for the constitution,” said Mijungu.\nAlso on Wednesday, police arrested Tom Kajwang, an opposition lawmaker who administered Odinga’s “oath”. He was expected to be charged on Thursday with administering an unlawful oath, a security source told Reuters.\nReporting by Maggie Fick; Additional reporting by Humphrey Malalo; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T09:24:12.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
