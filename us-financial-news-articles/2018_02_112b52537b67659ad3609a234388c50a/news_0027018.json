It also said it would aim to have another 30 gigawatts under construction by the end of the decade. \nBut the pace of planned nuclear construction in the country was scaled back in 2011 in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan. \nDelays to the Sanmen and Haiyang AP1000 projects, as well as the French-designed European Pressurised Reactor units at Taishan in Guangdong province, have held back the sector, and no new nuclear project has been approved in China in two years. \nChina’s nuclear firms are currently building their own homegrown third-generation reactor design known as the Hualong One.
