The 10-year was back up to 2.85 percent in afternoon trading. \n\"We've been in this period of a bit of a La La land of extraordinary monetary stimulus, no volatility, creating distortions,\" said Rieder, who is BlackRock's global chief investment officer of fixed income. \n\"We lived in a world where ... risk asset like equities can do well while Treasurys do well, but when you go the other way, you have this dynamic. Treasurys can move higher in yield, at the same time the market goes down,\" said Rieder. \nGlobal central banks are moving to reverse some of that easing. The European Central Bank has cut its quantitative easing in half, and the Bank of England just on Thursday signaled it could raise interest rates sooner and faster than expected. \nTreasury yields moved higher Thursday on the Bank of England news, but also on a bi-partisan spending bill that widens the U.S. deficit at a time when the Treasury is increasing its issuance. \n\"I do think it argues real rates are too low for a long time, and you should get to the low 3s...I look at free cash flow and a she cost of financing goes higher, equity valuations go lower,\" he said. \"There's a tremendous demand argument when you get to the low 3s and maybe you get to 3.50. I don't think you're going to go much higher than that. There's this tremendous demand from insurance companies, pensions that need yield.\" Patti Domm CNBC Markets Editor Related Securities", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T23:26:20.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
