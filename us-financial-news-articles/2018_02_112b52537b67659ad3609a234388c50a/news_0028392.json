Twenty-five percent said they believed Netanyahu, who denies wrongdoing. The remainder, 26 percent, said they did not know whom to believe.\nBut the poll supported Netanyahu more when people were asked whether Netanyahu should remain in office or temporarily step aside. Forty-nine percent said he should stay put, 43 percent that he should suspend himself.\nMost of the 495 respondents representing a cross-section of Israel’s Hebrew-speaking voters - 44 percent - said they did not think the investigation was a deliberate attempt to topple Netanyahu. Thirty-eight percent thought it was.\nVoters for Netanyahu’s Likud party tended to favor of the prime minister - 50 percent said they believed his denial of wrongdoing. Sixty percent said the investigation was a deliberate attempt to topple him and almost three quarters, 73 percent, said he should stay in his position.\nSeparate polls on Israel’s two other main channels also showed that a majority of respondents preferred the police’s version of events but also said that if elections were held today, Likud would remain as the largest party in parliament. Elections are due to take place in late 2019.\nReporting by Dan Williams, writing by Ori Lewis, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:37:05.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
