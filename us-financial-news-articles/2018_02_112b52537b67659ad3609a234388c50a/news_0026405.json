The other four did not report to police. They face additional charges of breaking a junta order that bans public gatherings and with inciting unrest.\nPolice arrested Ekachai Hongkangwan at his Bangkok home on Saturday. The Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) group said in a statement Ekachai was taken away by four plainclothes police officers.\nThe group said a pro-democracy protest would be held in Bangkok’s historic quarter later on Saturday.\n“This evening at 16:00 hrs there is an appointment to meet ... at Democracy Monument organized by the group Revive Democracy and Startup People,” it said.\nPolice confirmed that Ekachai had been arrested.\n“He handed himself over to police at 9:00 a.m,” said Pasakorn Rattanapanda, an officer in charge of the case.\nKritsadang Nutcharus, a lawyer for TLHR, told Reuters he had not been notified about the warrants.\nReporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat Panu Wongcha-um; Additional reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre, Nick Macfie and Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T12:22:08.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
