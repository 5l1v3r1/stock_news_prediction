Buran, Flushing Financial’s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Our strong financial performance and capital position, as well as our confidence in the opportunities for future growth, underlie our belief that our shares are a good value in today’s marketplace and that the repurchase of our shares represents an attractive investment opportunity that will benefit the Company and our shareholders. While the timing and amount of future share repurchases will depend on market conditions and the attractiveness of alternative capital investments, this action confirms a continuing commitment to utilize share repurchases as one approach for enhancing shareholder value. In addition to the share repurchase, as we strive to enhance our continuing efforts to increase total shareholder return, the Board approved an 11% increase of the dividend.
