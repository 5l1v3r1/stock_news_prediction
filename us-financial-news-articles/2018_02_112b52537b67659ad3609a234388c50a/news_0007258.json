It’s fairly inspirational,” he said. \nBefore Sexton was in position, Ireland went through 41 phases after starting from their own 22 metres. \n“There are so many players involved, we played a number of phases (41), it was difficult to clear out the ball a number of times,” said Schmidt. \n“When he struck the drop goal I was just willing it had enough distance to go over.” \nIreland, however, had dominated the game and it was only on Thomas’s splendid try that they seemed to be in difficulty. \n“We did a lot of things very well -- we started very strongly, we launched at them and there was some good handling from the backline,” Schmidt said. \n“It was a stop-start game with a lot of penalties,” he added to explain why Ireland had failed to score a try. \n”If you try to break a French defence with slow balls you’re really up against it. They’re a tough layer. Maybe people underestimate how hard it is to come here and win. \n“It’s always disappointing not to score tries but it’s hard to put pressure on any team if the ball is slow and France could only score because of Teddy Thomas’s brilliance.” (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Clare Fallon)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T23:50:13.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
