FUNDAMENTALS * LONDON COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper had edged up 0.3 percent to $7131.50 a tonne by 0128 GMT, having finished up a touch in the previous session. Prices have been trading in a $7,000-$7,250 a tonne range since mid-month, slightly down from a four-year peak of $7,312.50 hit in December. * SHANGHAI COPPER: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper eased by 0.3 percent to 53,290 yuan ($8,443) a tonne. Other metals, however, were all slightly higher reflecting a strong rally in Shanghai stocks. * U.S. ECONOMY: Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell for a second straight month in January, weighed down by steep declines in the Northeast and South, which could raise concerns the housing market is losing momentum. * EURO ZONE ECONOMY: Slack in the euro zone economy may be bigger than previously estimated and this could slow the rise of inflation but only temporarily and prices will eventually climb, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Monday. * ALUMINIUM SPREADS: Nearby aluminium spreads are under intense pressure, reflecting a rush on short-dated supply. The cost to roll aluminium for a day surged to $11 three times in the past week, having hit the highest since November, 2016. CMALT-O * ALUMINIUM PREMIUMS: Aluminium premiums have also climbed, spiking to 14.5 cents a tonne last week, the highest since April, 2015. Traders said there is a rush to import nearby metal in case the U.S. slaps a duty on imports of foreign made material. * NICKEL: Two of Russia's richest men could trigger a complicated auction known as a \"shootout\" in a bid to end their long-running battle for control of mining giant Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel). * EV RECYCLING: China will make manufacturers of electric vehicles (EV) responsible for setting up facilities to collect and recycle spent batteries, as part of its efforts to tackle mounting waste in the sector, say new rules published on Monday. * For the top stories in metals and other news, click or MARKETS NEWS * Asian shares extended their recovery on Tuesday, hitting a three-week high as U.S. borrowing costs eased ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's highly-anticipated first congressional testimony later in the day.
