REUTERS/Jorge Duenes \nThe budget plan will request more than $23 billion for border security and immigration enforcement, including $18 billion over two years to build a border wall with Mexico, Mulvaney said. \nTrump has promised to build the border wall to keep out illegal immigrants and drug smugglers. Democrats oppose funding the wall, which they view as unnecessary. \nThe budget proposal also includes $782 million to hire and support 2,750 additional officers and agents at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Mulvaney said. \nCoupled with that proposed spending is a $2.7 billion request to pay for what the White House called an “average daily detention capacity of 52,000 illegal aliens at ICE, the agency’s highest-ever detention level.” \nThe budget also seeks $85.5 billion in discretionary funding for veteran health services, including homelessness programs, readjustment counseling and vocational rehabilitation. \nThe budget request will be delivered to Congress only days after Trump signed into law a bipartisan spending agreement hammered out by lawmakers that will increase domestic spending by $300 billion over two years - including $165 billion in defense spending and $131 billion in non-military domestic spending. \nMulvaney said earlier on Sunday that all that money did not need to be spent.
