But that does not mean the fish does not need some hanky panky.\n“The Amazon molly female produces clones of itself by duping a male of a closely related species to mate with her. The asexual mode of reproduction termed gynogenesis requires the female to mate with a male but none of the male’s genome is passed to the offspring,” said geneticist Wesley Warren of the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis.\nThe Amazon molly’s egg cells are activated to develop into an embryo by a sperm cell that degenerates without fusing with the egg’s nucleus.\nThe fish is up to about 3 inches (8 cm) long and eats insects, plants, algae and other food. The study showed it originated when two other species, the Atlantic molly and the Sailfin molly, mated about 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.\nAnimals that reproduce asexually are rare compared to the overwhelming majority that exist as males and females and reproduce sexually.\n“It was long thought that vertebrates would not be able to exist in such a way. It was a sensation when the Amazon molly was the first asexual vertebrate discovered in 1932,” Schartl said.\nAbout 50 vertebrates are known to use asexual reproduction including fish, amphibians and reptiles.\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.\nReporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T00:14:14.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
