The dispute has caused an extraordinary breach between the White House and law enforcement and deepened partisan rancor.\nSome 73 percent of Republicans agreed that “members of the FBI and Department of Justice are working to delegitimize Trump through politically motivated investigations.”\nBut three in four Democrats said they believed a competing narrative that “members of the Republican Party and the White House are working to delegitimize the FBI and DOJ in the investigation of Russian tampering in the 2016 presidential election.”\nThe poll findings appear to reflect the influence that Trump wields among Republicans, who have long reserved some of their highest levels of trust for the country’s law enforcement agencies.\nNearly 84 percent of Republicans said in a January 2015 Reuters/Ipsos poll that they had a “favorable” view of the FBI.\nLast month, 91 percent of Republicans said they had a “great deal” or “some” confidence in the country’s law enforcement agencies, compared with the 75 percent who expressed a similar level of confidence in the Trump administration and 47 percent who said the same about Congress.\n‘WIN-WIN’\nErroll Southers, a national security expert and former FBI agent, said Trump had shown an uncanny ability to shape his supporters’ views of the world in a way that benefits him. By hammering at federal investigators, Southers said, Trump was inoculating himself from any political fallout that may follow.\nFILE PHOTO: The J. Edgar Hoover Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Building is seen in Washington, U.S., February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Jim Bourg ”It’s a win-win for him,“ Southers said. ”If he’s exonerated, he wins. If he’s not, he explains that the FBI is corrupt and it’s all a witch hunt, and he wins.\n“And his base will be even more energized.”\nLloyd Billiter Jr., a retired Texas oilfield services worker who participated in the poll, said he thought the FBI had become too political and “their people have gone astray.”\nBilliter, 64, said he was shocked to hear reports that investigators said critical things of Trump, and he would not believe anything that comes out of the Russia investigation unless it comes with a trove of evidence.\n“Show me the proof,” he said. “I’ve put them on probation. You have to earn my trust back.”\nRon Krebs, a foreign policy expert at the University of Minnesota, said people usually looked to political leaders and the media for guidance on how to view issues and organizations they do not know much about. He said public trust in the FBI could further erode unless there was a bipartisan effort in Congress to support the investigation.\n“The real question is how long this will last,” Krebs said. “How long will Republicans in Congress move in lockstep with the president?”\nBut among Americans overall, the latest poll showed that people did not appear to have changed their minds about the Russia investigation.\nFifty-two percent of all adults said they believed Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia to influence the election and that it was likely “authorities will find evidence of an illegal relationship between the Trump administration and Russia.”\nThose percentages have not changed since the last time the poll asked those questions in 2017.\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It gathered responses from 2,251 adults, including 941 Democrats and 827 Republicans, and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the entire sample and 4 percentage points for both the Republicans and Democrats.\nReporting by Chris Kahn; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T00:52:38.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
