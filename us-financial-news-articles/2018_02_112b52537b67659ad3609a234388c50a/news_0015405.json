This was the same level that triggered Friday's stock market sell-off. A budget compromise Wednesday among congressional leaders may have also triggered rates to increase.\nBut while many investors remain optimistic about a rise in inflation and 3 percent economic growth, Sri-Kumar said the yields will go back down.\n\"If they go up in the short term because of nervousness is hard to tell,\" he said. \"But if I were a betting person and I was looking six months ahead, I would be looking for them to be significantly lower.\"\nSri-Kumar points to earnings workers took home in January — significantly less than December — as one reason.\n\"When you earn less during a week or a month it is not inflationary, it is disinflationary,\" he said.\nThe number of people holding multiple jobs also increased in January, while the total number of hours worked in a week decreased — from 34.6 hours in January 2017 to 34.3 in January 2018.\n\"Both of those are negative for stocks,\" he said.\n\"All of these things tell me that there is a significant amount of slack in the economy,\" Sri-Kumar said. \"It all depends on how the economy grows. And I don't get the vibe that the economy is picking up significantly.\"\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T00:01:39.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
