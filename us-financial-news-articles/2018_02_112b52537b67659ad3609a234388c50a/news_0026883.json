Ryan Spooner and David Backes each scored for Boston, which snapped its four-game winning streak.\nBuffalo won its second straight game following a four-game skid. The Sabres entered the night in the Eastern Conference cellar with the second-fewest points in the NHL and dead last in scoring, averaging 2.3 goals per game.\nJack Eichel left the game with a lower-body injury after the Sabres’ former No. 2 overall pick out of Boston University collided with Boston’s Matt Grzelcyk -- another BU product -- behind the Bruins’ net late in the first period.\nRask made 24 saves as he was outdueled by his former backup Chad Johnson, who had 25 stops. Johnson improved to 12-1-0 at TD Garden.\nKane opened the scoring with a breakaway goal with 12:18 left in the second period, beating Rask high glove-side. His 17 goals are second only to Eichel’s 22 for the Sabres this season.\nWilson scored his third of the year with 7:16 left in the second, firing a rebound past Rask glove-side after he tipped a blue-line shot from Nathan Beaulieu off Boston’s Adam McQuaid in front of the net.\nSpooner’s goal gave the home crowd some life with 5:21 to go in the second, sending a backhanded feed from Jake DeBrusk in front of the crease past Johnson.\nEx-Bruin Pouliot scored his 10th of the year with 1:11 to play in the period after McQuaid’s giveaway led to a 3-on-1 opportunity.\nWith Rask on the bench, Backes tipped in his 10th goal off a shot from Patrice Bergeron with 59 seconds to play. Ristolainen’s empty-netter, his fourth goal of the year, ended hopes of a Boston comeback with 28.2 ticks left.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:08:36.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
