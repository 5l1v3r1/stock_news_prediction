REUTERS/Enrique Calvo \nBut Froome and Team Sky remain intent on the 32-year-old riding out the controversy with a full racing program, including May’s Tour of Italy and July’s Tour de France. \nLappartient said last month that it could be “at least a year” before a ruling is reached. \n“On balance I think it’s the right thing to do; for Chris to continue, and us to work in the background to support him and demonstrate there’s been no wrongdoing,” Team Sky principal Dave Brailsford told reporters in Colombia last week. \nTeam Sky’s stance will be vindicated if they can convince the UCI there was no wrongdoing on Froome’s part, but the risk of widespread damage to cycling should they fail is high. \nItalian riders Alessandro Petacchi and Diego Ulissi received 12 and nine-month bans respectively for excess Salbutamol levels. Should Froome receive a similar, backdated ban, his results from last year’s Tour of Spain through to at least this year’s Tour of Italy would be scrapped.
