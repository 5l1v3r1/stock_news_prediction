The reverse stock split became effective at 5:00 pm Eastern Time on February 8, 2018, and the Company’s shares of common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market at the commencement of trading on February 9, 2018 under the Company’s existing symbol “BPTH.” The Company’s common stock has been assigned a new CUSIP number of 09057N 201 in connection with the reverse stock split.\nThe reverse stock split is intended to increase the per share trading price of the Company’s shares of common stock to satisfy the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 10 shares of common stock issued and outstanding were consolidated into one issued and outstanding share. The reverse stock split reduced the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 113.4 million to approximately 11.3 million. In addition, proportionate adjustments will be made to the exercise prices of the Company's outstanding stock options and warrants and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company's existing stock incentive plans.\nThe Company has retained its transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”), to act as its exchange agent for the reverse split. AST will provide stockholders of record a letter of transmittal providing instructions for the delivery of their current certificates. AST will be issuing all of the post-split shares through their paperless Direct Registration System, also known as “book-entry form.” AST will hold the shares in an account set up for the stockholder. Stockholders who wish to hold paper certificates may obtain such certificates upon request to AST. Stockholders owning shares via a broker or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, subject to brokers’ particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the reverse stock split. No fractional shares of common stock will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. If as a result of the reverse stock split, a stockholder of record would otherwise hold a fractional share, the stockholder will receive one whole share in lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share.\nAbout Bio-Path Holdings, Inc.\nBio-Path is a biotechnology company developing DNAbilize ® , a novel technology that has yielded a pipeline of RNAi nanoparticle drugs that can be administered with a simple intravenous transfusion.
