(NASDAQ:CARB), a leader in data protection, today announced financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mozy, Inc. (\"Mozy\") from a subsidiary of Dell Technologies Inc. The deal expands Carbonite’s customer base and better positions Carbonite to offer its data protection platform to every segment of the market.\n“We are thrilled to announce the acquisition of Mozy,” said Mohamad Ali, President and CEO of Carbonite. “Carbonite’s competitive advantage is our flexible data protection platform, which serves every scenario, from backing up individual laptops to maintaining uptime for hundreds of business servers. This deal provides Mozy customers scalable options for the future and gives Carbonite a broader base to which we offer our solutions.”\nThe total purchase price for Mozy is $145.8 million in cash. The Company will fund the transaction with existing cash and newly secured financing commitments in the form of a $120.0 million revolving credit facility. The credit agreement will allow the Company to borrow, as needed, for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Barclays acted as financial advisor to the Company for the acquisition of Mozy. Stifel also acted as an advisor.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights:\nRevenue of $239.5 million increased 16% year-over-year.

We launched new programs and tools to better enable our partners, and again we were recognized for excellence in customer support. I am confident in our path forward and our ability to continue to execute the long-term strategic transformation we started just a few years ago,” said Mohamad Ali, President and CEO of Carbonite.\n“We delivered solid bookings and revenue growth for the year and a meaningful increase in profitability. We remain focused on operational excellence, continuing to streamline the business and efficiently drive results. Our guidance for 2018 calls for balanced organic and inorganic growth with another significant increase in non-GAAP net income per share,” said Anthony Folger, CFO of Carbonite.\nThe Company uses a variety of operational and financial metrics, including non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate its performance and financial condition. The accompanying financial data includes additional information regarding these metrics and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to GAAP. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results:\nRevenue for the fourth quarter was $61.7 million, an increase of 15% from $53.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Adjusted free cash flow for the full year was $20.2 million, compared to $18.2 million in 2016. 5\n1 Non-GAAP revenue excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for significant acquisitions.\n2 Bookings represent the aggregate dollar value of customer subscriptions and software arrangements, which may include multiple revenue elements, such as software licenses, hardware, professional services and post-contractual support, received during a period and are calculated as revenue recognized during a particular period plus the change in total deferred revenue, excluding deferred revenue recorded in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, net of foreign exchange during the same period.\n3 Non-GAAP gross margin excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired deferred revenue, amortization expense on intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and intangible asset impairment charges.\n4 Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired deferred revenue, amortization expense on intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, litigation-related expense, restructuring-related expense, acquisition-related expense, intangible asset impairment charges, non-cash convertible debt interest expense and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments.\n5 Adjusted free cash flow is calculated by subtracting the cash paid for the purchase of property and equipment and adding the payments related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and the cash portion of the lease exit charge from net cash provided by operating activities.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on the information available as of February 13, 2018, Carbonite expects the following for the first quarter and full year of 2018:\nFirst Quarter 2018:\nCurrent Guidance\n(2/13/2018) GAAP Revenue $61.7 - $63.7 million Non-GAAP Revenue $63.0 - $65.0 million Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share $0.20 - $0.24 Full Year 2018:\nCurrent Guidance\n(2/13/2018) Business Bookings $223.8 - $234.8 million Consumer Bookings Y/Y Growth 5% - 15% growth GAAP Revenue $294.0 - $304.0 million Non-GAAP Revenue $302.5 - $312.5 million Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share (Diluted) $1.45 - $1.55 Non-GAAP Gross Margin 76.0% - 77.0% Adjusted Free Cash Flow $32.0 - $38.0 million The guidance provided above reflects the estimated impact of ASC 606, which Carbonite is adopting in the first quarter of 2018. Carbonite’s expectations of non-GAAP net income per share for the first quarter and full year of 2018 excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired deferred revenue, amortization expense on intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, litigation-related expense, restructuring-related expense, non-cash convertible debt interest expense, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP net income per share assumes an effective tax rate of 11% for the full year of 2018. Non-GAAP net income per share assumes fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 29.7 million for the first quarter and 29.9 million for the full year of 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nIn conjunction with this announcement, Carbonite will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 13, 2018 at 5:30 p.m. ET to review the results. This call will be webcast live and can be found in the investor relations section of the Company's website at http://investor.carbonite.com . The conference call can also be accessed by dialing (877) 303-1393 in the United States or (315) 625-3228 internationally with the passcode 1669107.\nFollowing the completion of the call, a recorded replay will be available on the Company’s website, http://investor.carbonite.com , under “Events & Presentations”.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including bookings, non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, non-GAAP operating expense and adjusted free cash flow.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and ordinary results of operations. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods and uses these measures in financial reports prepared for management and the Company’s board of directors. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other software-as-a-service companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nThe Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant items that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the tables at the end of this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\nWith respect to our expectations under \"Business Outlook\" above, the Company has not reconciled non-GAAP net income per share to net (loss) income per share in this press release because we do not provide guidance for stock-based compensation expense, litigation-related expense, acquisition-related expense, amortization expense on intangible assets, non-cash convertible debt interest expense, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments as we are unable to quantify certain of these amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts. In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this press release, including under “Business Outlook,” have \"forward-looking statements\" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
