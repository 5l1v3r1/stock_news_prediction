The armed forces did not specify who the militants behind the attack were. A civilian member of the Turkish contingent was also wounded, they said.\nThe army began setting up the outpost on Monday southwest of Aleppo city, the deepest position they have established so far inside northwestern Syria under the agreement with Moscow and Tehran aimed at “de-escalating” the violence.\nTurkey, which supported rebel fighters trying to overthrow Assad, has worked with Assad’s main international backers Russia and Iran in recent months to try to stem some of the bloodshed in Syria’s nearly seven-year-old civil war.\nBut all three countries remain deeply involved in the fighting, and stark divisions remain.\nIran urged Turkey on Monday to stop its two-week-old military offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia in northern Syria’s Afrin region, which neighbors Idlib.\n“Turkey’s actions can bring back insecurity, instability and terrorism to Syria,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was Quote: d as saying by state news agency IRNA.\nIn Idlib, Russia has intensified air raids on rebel-held towns after jihadist fighters shot down a Russian warplane and killed its pilot. Iran-backed Shi‘ite militias also helped the Syrian army advance in the region last week.\nIn a warning to Ankara, a commander in the military alliance supporting Assad said the Syrian army had deployed new air defenses and anti-aircraft missiles to frontlines with rebels in the Aleppo and Idlib areas close to Turkey.\n“They cover the air space of the Syrian north,” the commander told Reuters. That would include the Afrin area where Turkish warplanes have been supporting a ground offensive by the Turkish army and Free Syrian Army factions.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the observation post being established by Turkey was near the village of al-Eis, which would place it less than five km (three miles) from territory held by Syrian government forces and their allies.\nA week ago, a large Turkish military convoy heading for the same area pulled back after it was hit by a car bomb which killed one person.\nAdditional reporting by Tom Perry in Beirut; Writing by Dominic Evans, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T08:56:35.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
