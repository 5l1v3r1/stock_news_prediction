The company reported revenue for Q4 of $2.1 million, doubling revenue for the year, and signed agreements for 337 instruments. Contracts for customer evaluations covered 259 instruments while revenue placements totaled 78 across the U.S., European, and Middle East regions.\nNet sales were $4.2 million for the year compared to $246,000 for the prior year, 2016. The increase was driven by sales of the company’s solution for sepsis intervention and antimicrobial stewardship, the Accelerate Pheno™ system and Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC kit. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed and permitted marketing of the system and kit in late February 2017.\n“We were optimistic going into our launch year, and by most measures it was a success,” said Lawrence Mehren, President and CEO. “Now, with the recent data showing significant reductions in sepsis mortality from our first clinical customer, we’ve reached an important point where other hospitals, and the government, have started to notice. This is good news and we believe points to an exciting year ahead. A huge thanks to the entire team and especially our customers.”\nWith its initial diagnostic for antimicrobial stewardship and sepsis intervention underway, the company recently announced initiatives focused on 2018 revenue and its respiratory test, the Accelerate PhenoTest™ sv BP kit, targeting severe pneumonia. Clinical trials for this new kit are expected to begin in Q2 or Q3 of 2018, followed by a submission for review by the FDA.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Lawrence Mehren, and Chief Financial Officer, Steve Reichling, will host a conference call to review the financial results, commercial progress, and development updates at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on February 15, 2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nNet sales of $2.1 million, a 54 times increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 Gross margin realized was 69% including inventory previously recorded as research and development (R&D) expense Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $11.5 million, compared to $10.5 million in the prior year period, driven by higher personnel and customer evaluation-related costs across the U.S. and Europe R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of $6.1 million, compared to $5.6 million in the same quarter of 2016 due to clinical trial and pre-launch inventory costs incurred in the prior year period which did not repeat Net loss of $15.1 million, or $0.27 per share on weighted average basic shares of 55.4 million shares outstanding, which contained $2.9 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense Net cash used in the quarter was $12.1 million\nFull Year 2017\nNet sales of $4.2 million, a 17 times increase compared to the prior 2016 year Gross margin realized was 76% including inventory previously recorded as research and development (R&D) expense Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $45.1 million, compared to $37.2 million in the prior year period, driven by higher personnel and customer evaluation-related costs across the U.S. and Europe R&D expenses for the year of $22.3 million, compared to $29.5 million in 2016 due to clinical trial and pre-launch inventory costs incurred in the prior year period which did not repeat Net loss of $62.9 million, or $1.16 per share on weighted average basic shares of 54 million shares outstanding, which contained $13.9 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense Net cash used in the year was $51.8 million, ending the quarter with total cash, and cash-equivalents from all activities of $109.1 million\n2018 Outlook\nThe following reflect estimates based on information as of February 15, 2018 and are subject to uncertainty.

(Nasdaq:AXDX), is an in vitro diagnostics company dedicated to providing solutions for the global challenge of antibiotic resistance and healthcare-associated infections. The company recently obtained FDA marketing authorization for antimicrobial susceptibility testing direct from positive blood culture samples using its Accelerate Pheno™ system and Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC kit. The system and kit leverage proprietary molecular identification methods and morphokinetic cellular analysis (MCA) to provide minimum inhibitory concentrations for a range of applicable antibiotics. The fully-automated system is designed to eliminate the lengthy culture and sample preparation steps required prior to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Recent market studies suggest the solution offers results 1-2 days faster than conventional methods, enabling clinicians to optimize antibiotic selection, dosage, and infusion strategy specific to the individual patient and their infection.\nThe “ACCELERATE DIAGNOSTICS” and “ACCELERATE PHENO” and “ACCELERATE PHENOTEST” and diamond shaped logos and marks are trademarks or registered trademarks of Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc.\nFor more information about the company, its products or technology, visit http://axdx.com .\nCertain of the statements made in this press release are forward looking, such as those, among others, about our projections as to when certain key business milestones may be achieved, such as the ongoing commercial launch, demand, and potential of our products or technology, the growth of the market, our estimates as to the size of our market opportunity and potential pricing, our competitive position and estimates of time reduction to results, and our future development plans and growth strategy.
