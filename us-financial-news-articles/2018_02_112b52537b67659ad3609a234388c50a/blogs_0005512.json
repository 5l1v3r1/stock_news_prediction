That $7,700 low is ironic because it is the same level that it broke above and began a parabolic ascent in mid-November. \nI am watching a key level at $8,650 and a continued close above that could signal immediate upside potential. The next level of resistance is $10,000, and a break back above that should bring further buying to the table, suggesting near-term upside to $14,500, a 70 percent jump from its current price. \nOn the other side of the coin, I believe we are witnessing a market-cap rebalancing. Many disregard bitcoin but most do not disregard blockchain technology. While I expect bitcoin to recover from this low, I believe that there are cheaper and better technologies within the complex that are positioned for stronger gains. The five that I am focused on are ethereum, NEO, ripple, stellar and last but surely not least, VeChain. The crytpocurrency market cap reached a height above $800 billion, a number that is now cut in half. Bitcoin's piece of the this market cap has slowly shrunk and is now only one third. As buyers step back in I believe this trend will continue and I'm watching for these five to gain further ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T00:03:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
