It is also in the western Corn Belt and feedlots are located throughout the state, Robb added.\nWith respect to hog farms, USDA’s most recent quarterly hog report listed Nebraska as the fifth largest hog producing state, well behind industry leader Iowa where the hog population is highest.\nRobb said these data underscore how crucial the ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement discussions are for the major agricultural states.\nReporting By Theopolis Waters; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:34:05.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
