Three crew members were rescued and the other 29 members are presumed dead.\nThe condensate cargo was to be delivered to South Korea’s petrochemical company Hanwha Total Petrochemical.\nSouth Korea, the world’s fifth-biggest crude oil importer, mainly buys condensate - an ultra-light oil - from Iran and increased purchases of the oil after sanctions against the Islamic republic were lifted in 2016.\nBut South Korea’s oil imports from Iran have declined since November 2017 as Iran’s condensate exports had been dented by a “technical problem” at South Pars field.\nThe Middle East country cut the official selling price for its crude in February and widened discounts for heavy grades against Saudi Arabia to retain its major Asian buyers.\nOverall, South Korea’s January crude oil imports totalled 13.25 million tonnes, or 3.13 million bpd, up 7.1 percent from 12.37 million tonnes in the same month last year, according to the data.\nCrude oil imports from Saudi Arabia, South Korea’s top crude oil supplier, rose 11.2 percent from a year ago to 3.69 million tonnes in January, or 872,840 bpd, but were down 7.8 percent on December as the kingdom continues to curb its oil output to comply with a global oil supply cut deal.\nFinal data for South Korea’s January crude imports data will be released by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) later this month.\nReporting by Jane Chung; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:35:15.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
