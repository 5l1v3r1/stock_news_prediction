Late last year the market watchdog overhauled its examination committee and stepped up scrutiny of applicants’ financial strength and disclosures.\nReporting by Josephine Mason; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T16:42:30.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
