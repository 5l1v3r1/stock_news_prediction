As a result, we anticipate that fourth quarter revenues will exceed $5.5 million,” said Louis Hoch, President and CEO.\nCommenting further on the significant achievement, Vaden Landers, EVP & Chief Revenue Officer for Payment Data said, “the value of companies who are meeting and solving for all varieties of payment acceptance needs through deep integrations is at a level never before seen in our industry. Payment Data Systems, through its recent combination with Singular Payments, and combined with its leadership position in the ACH, pre-paid and other strategic sectors, is quickly gaining traction with software developers. These developers are embracing the reality that while they must deliver a robust payment offering to their downstream clients, becoming an ISO or Payment Facilitator represents more of a distraction than an opportunity.” Landers concluded, “Our PayFac-in-a-Box solution allows these tech innovators entre into the payments world through a suite of API’s, through which they can access as much or as little feature sets and functionality as is necessary to execute on their unique and very individual business models. We are excited about the future, and anticipate adding substantially to our growing roster of software providers over the remainder of 2018 and beyond.”\nForward-Looking Statements Disclaimer\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this release include which are covered by safe harbors.
