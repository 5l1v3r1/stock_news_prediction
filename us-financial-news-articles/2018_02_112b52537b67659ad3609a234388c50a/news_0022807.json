That followed a 1.7 percent rise in 2016 and a 1.1 percent increase in 2015. \nThe government of Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni forecasts that GDP grew 1.5 last year, which would be Italy’s strongest rate since 2010, but would still leave it in its customary position among the most sluggish economies in the euro zone. \nIn December, there were firm monthly increases in industrial output of consumer goods, intermediate goods and particularly investment goods, while output of energy products declined. \nOn a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, output in December was up 4.9 percent, following a 2.3 percent rise in November which was marginally revised up from an originally reported 2.2 percent.
