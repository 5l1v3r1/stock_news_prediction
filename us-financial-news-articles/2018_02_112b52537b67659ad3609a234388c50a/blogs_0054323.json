This limited the impact on overall price levels.\nA weak real estate market in Dubai may also have kept down inflation. Housing and utility costs fell 0.7 percent from a year earlier in January.\nAbu Dhabi, the other big emirate in the UAE, is expected to announce its January inflation rate in coming days, followed by the UAE as a whole.\nSaudi Arabia introduced 5 percent VAT at the same time as the UAE, but its version of the tax contained fewer exemptions, so the boost to inflation is expected to be larger.\nThe other four wealthy oil exporting countries of the Gulf originally planned to impose VAT simultaneously with Saudi Arabia and the UAE but have not done so, partly because of concern about the effect on inflation and living standards. They may introduce VAT as soon as in 2019.
