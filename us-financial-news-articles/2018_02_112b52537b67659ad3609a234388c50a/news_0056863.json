Items like rolled ice cream and inky black charcoal-infused foods are a visual spectacle and quickly gain attention and notoriety on the social media app. \nRose has the added benefit of coming in a shade that has become known as \"millennial pink.\" The soft hue burst onto the scene sometime in the last three years and has been prominent in clothing, housewares and food ever since. It is a trendy, aesthetically pleasing tone that is associated with luxury and youth. \nWhile rose only represents about 1.5 percent of the total table wine category, it's growing at a massive rate, according to Nielson. Rose sales climbed nearly 40 percent in the year ended Dec. 2, 2017, according to the market researcher. \nMeanwhile, hard apple cider sales recently cooled their robust growth. The category saw massive growth since 2011. According to the United States Association of Cider Makers, cider sales in 2016 grew to $1.3 billion, a 473 percent increase over the five-year period. \nHowever, like many products that see rapid sales growth, those sales eventually stagnate. Combining trends like rose and millennial pink with cider is one way that liquor companies hope to reignite sales. \n\"It's common refrain in the wine sector right now that drinkers are looking for a lower alcohol, more refreshing, food friendly product,\" Michelle McGrath, executive director of USACM, told CNBC via email. \"Cider meets that criteria, so rose cider is a strategy to woo wine drinkers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T23:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T23:57:43.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
