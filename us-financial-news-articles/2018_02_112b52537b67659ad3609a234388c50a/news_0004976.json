Respect to the guy, but we’re just going in a different way.” \nThorn, who replaced former Wallabies prop Nick Stiles at the helm of the 2011 Super Rugby champions, said he felt Cooper, who has also been discarded by the Wallabies, had struggled last year after he returned after just one season in Europe. \n“I thought Quade last year ... the team struggled, his game management, his attack, his defence (struggled),” Thorn added. \n“I‘m in this role - sometimes you’ve got to make tough decisions.” \nWhile Cooper was still contracted to the Reds he would play club rugby in Brisbane and Thorn said there was a slim chance he could still be called into the Reds if there was an injury crisis. \n“We’re doing what we’re doing now. But he’s part of the squad,” Thorn said as he prepared the team for their season opener against the Melbourne Rebels on Feb. 23. \n”He’ll be trying his best with his club rugby and it’s a tough old season, isn’t it? \n”At the moment, we’ve got some depth around that position - Hamish Stewart coming through, Jono Lance, Ben Lucas can play there. \n“It’s competitive, which is what I‘m getting a little bit excited about - I‘m liking the competition in most positions and I feel like maybe that hasn’t been here.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T08:59:22.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
