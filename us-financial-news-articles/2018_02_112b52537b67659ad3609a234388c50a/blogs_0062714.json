A transition of the deal is needed but not yet visible, with both an over-tightening and an orderly unwinding being potential scenarios,” said Norbert Rucker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer.\nAnalysts said that without a smooth exit from the pact, global inventories may drop sharply and trigger a potentially damaging price rise.\nOil output in Venezuela, one of OPEC’s larger producers, has dropped to its lowest in more than 20 years as the country grapples with an economic crisis, in turn helping curtail OPEC’s supply beyond the group’s agreed 1.2-million bpd commitment.\nGrowing demand from Asian economies, led by China, was expected to absorb part of the increase in U.S. supply.\n“Rising global oil demand will be driven mainly by emerging markets, with non-OECD consumption rising by an average of 2.8 percent per year in 2018-19, which would be the fastest rate since 2013,” the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Birch said.\nU.S. light crude CLc1 is forecast to average $58.88 a barrel in 2018, up from $58.11 in the January poll.\nReporting by Vijaykumar Vedala in Bengaluru; Editing by Amanda Cooper and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T14:05:11.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
