Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.2 percent monthly and a 4.2 percent annual rise.\nThe statistics office confirmed its earlier preliminary estimate of gross domestic product growth in the euro zone in the last three months of 2017 at 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and 2.7 percent against the same period of 2016.\nOverall in 2017, euro zone GDP rose 2.5 percent, Eurostat said, the fastest growth rate since a 3.0 percent rise in 2007.\nThe GDP of Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, grew 0.6 percent on the quarter and 2.9 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter with France at 0.6 percent and 2.4 percent respectively and Spain at 0.7 and 3.1 percent respectively.\n“For the year 2018 as a whole, a strong increase of 2.5 percent is still likely, even if the statisticians have slightly revised previous data downwards,” Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said in a note on Germany.\n“We continue to believe that the upswing could continue for another two or three years despite the roll-back of labour market reforms because cyclical tensions on the labour market are not yet in sight,” he said.\nEurostat also revised upwards November production figures to 1.3 percent month-on-month from 1.0 percent and to 3.7 percent year-on-year form 3.2 percent.\nProduction of durable consumer goods, like refrigerators or TV sets jumped 2.7 percent on the month in December and was 7.4 percent higher than a year earlier. The output of intermediate goods -- like parts for their production -- jumped 1.4 percent for a 6.6 percent annual gain.\nThe production of capital gods rose 7.6 percent year-on-year in December, accelerating from 6.7 percent in the previous month indicating investment was picking up too.
