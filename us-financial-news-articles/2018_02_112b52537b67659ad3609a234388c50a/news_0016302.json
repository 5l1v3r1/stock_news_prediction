That beat the consensus estimates of $960 million, according to brokerage Guggenheim.\nDupixent, a potential blockbuster that won U.S. approval last March, raked in sales of about $139 million, also topping consensus estimates of $122 million, according to Guggenheim.\nRegeneron shares rose about 5 percent to $352.50 in early trading on Thursday, before giving up most of their gains by late morning.\nWith the uncertainty on Eylea’s future, Dupixent is viewed as Regeneron’s next driver and core to its strategy of investing in medicines with the potential to treat more than one disease.\nRegeneron’s total revenue rose nearly 30 percent to $1.58 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31.\nA $381 million charge related to U.S. tax law reform led to a 31 percent drop in Regeneron’s net profit to $173.5 million. Excluding items, it earned $5.23 per share.\nAnalysts on average were expecting earnings of $4.53 per share on revenue of $1.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company said “unfair paperwork” for patients and doctors was weighing on insurer reimbursements for the eczema drug, Dupixent.\nWith Eli Lilly & Co ( LLY.N ), Incyte Corp ( INCY.O ), Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) and AbbVie Inc ( ABBV.N ) targeting the market, Regeneron is aiming for Dupixent to be approved to treat asthma this year.\nIt is also hoping to mark its foray into the field of immuno-oncology this year with the approval of cemiplimab as a skin cancer treatment.\nRegeneron and French partner Sanofi SA ( SASY.PA ) said they would speed up development of the two drugs and invest about $1 billion more than planned on cemiplimab.\nReporting by Anuron Kumar Mitra and Tamara Mathias; Editing by Savio D'Souza\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:12:24.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
