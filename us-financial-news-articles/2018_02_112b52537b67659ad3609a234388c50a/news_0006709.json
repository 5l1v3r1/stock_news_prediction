In 2017, earnings are reported on a fully taxed basis while in 2016 earnings were not taxed as a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset was in place. Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.03 per share on 16,230,000 shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compares to EPS of $0.05 per share on 9,302,000 shares for the same time period in 2016. The year-over-year shares outstanding reflects the addition of the $21 million capital raise completed in the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $6.7 million or $0.41 per share compared to $2.6 million or $0.28 per share for the same period in 2016. Included in the twelve months’ 2017 income is the net of the tax benefit from reversing a $4.1 million valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset and the adjustment of $1.1 million in the deferred tax asset for the change in the Federal tax rate. The deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2017 is $3.0 million.\nThe Bank reported total assets of $325.3 million as of December 31, 2017, representing a 67.2% increase compared to the reporting period ending December 31, 2016 and a 16.2% increase over the third quarter 2017. In 2017, the Bank opened a branch office on April 3, 2017 on Wilshire Boulevard in Koreatown, Los Angeles, and a Loan Production Office (LPO) on June 15, 2017 in Seattle, Washington. A new branch in downtown Los Angeles’ Fashion District opened on November 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the new Wilshire branch recorded a total deposit base of $71.9 million, including $9.6 million in non-interest bearing deposits, $54.4 million in money market deposits and $7.6 million in certificates of deposits. The new Fashion District Branch had $15.9 million in total deposits at December 31, 2017, consisting of $8.9 million in money market accounts, $3.5 million in DDA and $3.5 million in certificates of deposits. The Seattle LPO booked $19.3 million in SBA loans by December 31, 2017. Total Bank loans totaled $218.5 million compared to $142.1 million a year earlier at December 31, 2016, a 53.7% increase and increased from $207.3 million at September 30, 2017, a 5.4% increase. Total Bank deposits ended the quarter at $269.1 million, a 59.3% increase from $168.9 million at December 31, 2016 and compares to $231.0 million at September 30, 2017, a 16.5% increase.\nSBA loan originations for the twelve months ending December 31, 2017 were $110.4 million compared to $46.0 million for the same period in 2016. For the quarter ending December 31, 2017, SBA loan originations were $25.6 million compared to $7.4 million for the fourth quarter in 2016. The Bank sold $20.4 million in SBA loans for a net gain of $1.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.5 million in SBA loan sales and a net gain of $0.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2017, the Bank sold $77.8 million in SBA loans for a net gain of $5.8 million compared to sales of $46.0 million and a net gain of $2.8 million for the same period in 2016.\nLoan quality remains good with non-performing assets as a percent of total assets of 0.06% compared to 0.0% as of December 31, 2016. Non-performing assets are Other Real Estate Owned (foreclosed properties) and nonaccrual loans. Allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) to gross loans has decreased from 2.26% as of December 31, 2016 to 1.49% as of December 31, 2017. The reason for the decrease is a combination of reversing $425,000 in excess reserves at year-end 2016 and a 53.7% annual growth in loans from December 31, 2016.\n“The Board of Directors is pleased with the continued growth and profitability of the Bank while absorbing the new Wilshire Branch, Seattle LPO and the Fashion District Branch in Downtown Los Angeles,” said CEO Kim. “We are excited about continuing the growth of the Bank in 2018 and look forward to the future profitable deployment our new capital.”\nUS Metro Bank is a California chartered, full service commercial nonmember bank headquartered in Garden Grove, California, with four branch offices in California – Garden Grove, Anaheim, Koreatown/Los Angeles, Fashion District/Los Angeles – and loan production offices in Dallas, Texas and Seattle, Washington.
