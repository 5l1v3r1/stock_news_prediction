Both indexes also lost their gains for the year. On Tuesday morning, major stock indexes fluctuated between positive and negative.\nThe pullback in stocks comes after a strong start to the year. The Dow and S&P 500 notched all-time highs as well as sharp gains for January. But worries of rising inflation have recently pushed interest rates to multiyear highs, sending jitters down Wall Street. Investors worried that higher inflation would lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than the market expects.\nThe 10-year U.S. note yield traded at 2.73 percent on Tuesday and hit a four-year high on Monday. The yield started 2018 trading around 2.4 percent.\n\"For now, we are buyers on the dip,\" Calvasina said. \"Even taking into account some new signs of stress on the Sentiment indicators that we track, and acknowledging that economic surprises have softened, we see more positives than negatives for US equities.\"\nShe also noted that dealmaking and \"cash deployment\" are still likely to ramp up this year, while earnings continue to be strong and economic recession risk remains low.\nCalvasina is not the only strategist recommending investors to buy this dip. Late Monday, J.P. Morgan's Marko Kolanovic said he saw this pullback as a \" buying opportunity .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T16:10:59.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
