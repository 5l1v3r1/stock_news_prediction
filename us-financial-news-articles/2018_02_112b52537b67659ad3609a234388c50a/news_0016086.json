Picture taken February 8, 2018. REUTERS/Dewey Sim The CNB declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\nGanesh said he wasn’t happy to be changing the bar’s logo with the picture of Escobar, which had cost him $20,000 in additional expenses.\nSome curious patrons thought nothing of the association with the infamous drug dealer.\n“I mean if the owner of Escobar actually wanted to open a ‘drug place’, it would not be right smack in the middle of town,” customer Katie Kang said.\nGanesh said he was baffled by the reaction by the Colombian embassy, which had sent a three-page letter to Singapore’s foreign ministry expressing its “serious concern” that the bar “pays tribute to the worst criminal in the history of Colombia”.\nGanesh said he had no plans to change the name of the pub.\nAdditional reporting by Fathin Ungku; Writing by Jack Kim; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:53:30.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
