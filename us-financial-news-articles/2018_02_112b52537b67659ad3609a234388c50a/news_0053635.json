The returns are not guaranteed.\n“Everyday investors in the UK have gone almost a decade without real interest rates,” Stelios said. “With the easyMoney Innovative Finance ISA, we’re offering something new and taking on the big boys.”\nCash invested in the easyMoney ISA will be put into loans secured against British property, easyMoney said. That could make the ISA riskier than some bank offerings, where cash is typically put into stock and bond portfolios.\n“The inflation-busting interest rates we target are streets ahead of anything the banks could contemplate,” easyMonday CEO Andrew de Candole said.\nStelios, 51, the son of a shipping magnate, also owns the easyHotel, easyBus, easyCar, easyProperty, easyOffice, easyFoodstore, easyCoffee and easyGym brands through his private investment vehicle, easyGroup, based in Monaco and London.
