And some allege it is yielding rich profits for ultrafast firms at the expense of ordinary investors. \nThe problem arises from the two ways that CME distributes information about a trade. One is the private confirmation messages that the exchange sends to the buyer and seller in each transaction. The other is the public data feed that reports trades to everyone active at CME, a Chicago exchange where an average of 19 million contracts changed hands daily in January. \nSometimes, a firm will receive the private confirmation of its trade just before it is reported over CME’s data feed. During that delay—called a “latency”—an ultrafast firm can deduce that the market is about to move up or down, and quickly buy or sell to profit from that information, traders say. \nA CME CME, +2.38% spokeswoman said the firm had “dramatically decreased the latency between public market data and private trade confirmations” since 2013, when the issue was exposed in the Wall Street Journal. But she acknowledged that private confirmations were still arriving first in some cases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T00:15:20.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
