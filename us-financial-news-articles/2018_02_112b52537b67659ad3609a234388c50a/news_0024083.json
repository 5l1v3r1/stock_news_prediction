The UK's FTSE .FTSE and Germany's DAX .GDAXI rose 1.3 and 1.8 percent respectively. \nThe euro zone volatility index .V2TX fell back from peaks hit last week when a spike in inflation expectations boosted bond yields and fueled worries over central bank tightening. \n“We see this as a short-term correction rather than an end of cycle event,” UBS strategists led by Nick Nelson said. \n“What could change that would be a significant move up in bond yields, well above current levels, combined with major inflation fears,” they wrote, noting however that fundamentals for European equities remained supportive. \nThe STOXX is down 3.9 percent in the year to date. \nThe cyclicals sectors which had led the sell-off drove the bounce on Monday, with materials stocks .SXPP and banks .SX7P among the best-performing sectors, up 3 and 1.5 percent respectively. \nMiners Glencore ( GLEN.L ), Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) and BHP ( BLT.L ) all rose between 2.9 and 3.6 percent as copper prices rose from its lowest in nearly two months as the dollar dropped. \nElsewhere, upbeat broker notes pushed shares in Victrex ( VCTX.L ) and Delivery Hero ( DHER.DE ) to the top of the STOXX, sending their shares up 4 and 5.2 percent respectively. \nAkzo Nobel ( AKZO.AS ) rose 1.7 percent after a source-based Financial Times report said that U.S. private equity giant Apollo had teamed up with the biggest Dutch pension fund to buy the group’s 10 billion-euro specialty chemicals unit. \nHowever, Heineken ( HEIO.AS ) fell 3.7 percent after the world’s second largest brewer lowered its margin growth target, blaming a volatile market environment and an acquisition in Brazil. \nAlso in M&A news, TDC ( TDC.CO ) surged 5.9 percent after the Danish telecom company said it had been approached by a potential bidder. \nIn the same sector, SES ( SESFd.PA ) fell 5.5 percent after it announced management changes. \n($1 = 0.8155 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T12:07:46.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
