Officials said they are eyeing a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 14 to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Israel’s declaring independence. \n“We are excited about taking this historic step, and look forward with anticipation to the May opening,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. \nAt first, David Friedman, U.S. ambassador to Israel, and a small group of aides will begin working from the facility. Next, the State Department will begin retrofitting that complex to accommodate more officials, and the department has begun efforts to plan and locate a site for a new embassy facility in Jerusalem. Adelson has offered to contribute to the effort to build a new embassy, but the discussions are informal so far. \nState Department officials are examining whether the U.S. could accept such a gift. Adelson’s offer was earlier reported by the Associated Press. A representative to Adelson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T00:21:37.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
