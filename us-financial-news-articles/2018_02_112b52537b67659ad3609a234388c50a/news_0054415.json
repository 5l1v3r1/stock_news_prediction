Mass shootings that took place during Obama’s eight years in office from 2009 bolstered that expectation even more, often sending shares of gunmakers surging in the immediate aftermath of such events.\nSales and stock prices of firearms makers slumped after Trump’s unexpected election victory was seen as reducing prospects for curbs on gun ownership. Sturm Ruger’s stock has fallen 22 percent since the 2016 election and American Outdoor Brands has lost 63 percent of its value.\nBut tweets and comments by Trump on Wednesday and Thursday that he supported raising the age limit for purchases of some kinds of guns, as well as other measures, turned up the heat on the gun control debate, and boosted gunmakers’ shares. Sturm Ruger was up 5 percent at mid-day, while American Outdoor Brands rose 2.8 percent.\nNevertheless, Trump took a pro-gun stance in advocating arming some school teachers to prevent school shootings. Also fueling the gun control debate, National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre in a speech on Thursday described control advocates as elites aiming to “eradicate all personal freedoms.”\nReflecting the gun industry slump under Trump, Sturm Ruger reported a 27 percent fall in revenue for the December quarter on Wednesday.\nRuger laid off 50 workers in January, and in its quarterly report it said it was slashing its capital expenditures plan for 2018 by more than half, suggesting the Southport, Connecticut company expects its business to remain difficult.\nSeventeen students and staff members were killed in the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, a massacre that has fueled unprecedented youth-led protests in cities across the country. Many of the teens and their parents are calling for greater gun control.\nReporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:04:14.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
