The iShares MSCI Qatar Capped ETF tracks Qatari stocks but it is listed in the United States. \nQatar’s second largest bank by market value, Masraf Al Rayan , is in the process of raising funds for an ETF. It aims to raise 400 million riyals ($110 million) from investors and list in Doha before the end of this quarter, an investor and an industry executive familiar with the matter said. \nMeanwhile, Qatari investment firm Amwal, with assets under management of 1.6 billion riyals, has raised funds for an ETF from investors and is also looking to list in Doha this quarter, according to the industry executive and another source familiar with the matter. \nMasraf Al Rayan and Amwal declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday. \nMost regulatory approvals for the ETFS have been obtained, and remaining issues to resolve are essentially operational matters such as the allocation of units and the listing process, the industry source said. \nMasraf Al Rayan’s ETF will track the QE Al Rayan Islamic Index of sharia-compliant stocks in Qatar. Amwal’s ETF will track the QE Index of the 20 largest and most liquid stocks in the Qatari market.
