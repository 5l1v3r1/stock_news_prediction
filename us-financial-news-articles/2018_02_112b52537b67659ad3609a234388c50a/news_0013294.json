Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are down around 1 percent.\nBrazilian and South African equities were the worst hit, down 6.4 percent and 5.9 percent respectively - comparable to the S&P 500 which has lost just over 6 percent after suffering its worst one-day drop on Monday since August 2011.\n(To view a graphic on EM assets and the global sell off, click reut.rs/2BejUSj )\nReporting by Claire Milhench and Marc Jones; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://reut.rs/2BHkKYS", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://reut.rs/2BejUSj"], "published": "2018-02-07T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:19:37.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
