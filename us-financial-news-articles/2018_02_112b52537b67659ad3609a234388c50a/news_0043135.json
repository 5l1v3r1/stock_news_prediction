The FBI has acknowledged it failed to act on a tip flagging concerns about the suspect, Nikolas Cruz.\nMany Republicans generally oppose measures to tighten gun restrictions, citing the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protection of the right to bear arms.\nFormer President Barack Obama and many of his fellow Democrats unsuccessfully pushed to pass gun control legislation after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012.\nCornyn and Murphy introduced their bill to improve federal background checks last November, days after a gunman killed more than two dozen people in a church in Texas.\nThe bill, called the Fix NICS Act, would ensure that states and federal agencies comply with existing law on reporting criminal history records to the national background check system.\nCornyn, of Texas, had complained when introducing the legislation that compliance by agencies was lousy.\nStudents are planning a \"March For Our Lives\" in Washington on March 24 to call attention to school safety and ask lawmakers to enact gun control.\nSome students reacted with caution to Trump's support on background checks.\nWe want to prevent mass shootings from happening and while this could have happened with other types of weapons, NeverAgain believes school safety should be priority right now, not just background checks,\" said Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Kali Clougherty, 18, referring to a campaign for gun control. \"This is about the victims. Dont forget that; we never will.\"\nTrump is scheduled to host a \"listening session\" with high school students and teachers on Wednesday.\nDozens of high school students protested in front of the White House on Monday, chanting We want safe schools! and Hey! Hey! NRA how many kids did you kill today?\nCrystal Jordan, a 15-year old from Spotsylvania, Virginia, said it was scary to go to school now.\nIts OK to obtain a gun, like a handgun, but not an assault rifle, she said, adding that she hoped Trump and Congress would issue laws to strengthen background checks, ban assault rifles and prevent people with mental problems from accessing guns.\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Timothy Gardner; Additional reporting by Katanga Johnson in Florida; Editing by Alistair Bell and Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T03:58:15.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
