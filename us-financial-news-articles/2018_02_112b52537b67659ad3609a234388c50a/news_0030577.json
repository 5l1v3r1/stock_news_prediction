That marked a drop of 3.8 percent from its early February peak near 110.50 yen.\n“If you are a logical investor, you’d buy when you think stocks will rise and you’d sell when you think stocks will fall. But today’s trade is not based on logic,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n“Short-term investors like overseas hedge funds were shorting Japanese stocks and futures since late January. They have their trades programmed to sell Japanese stocks when U.S. stocks fell. But since U.S. stocks rose overnight, they had to close such positions as there was a risk of losing.”\nJapanese stocks have seen volatile trade in recent weeks after hitting 26-year highs last month.\nSome traders say that repercussions from Wall Street’s recent tumble have not undermined Japanese stocks’ attractive valuations.\n“Share price movements have become more volatile in recent weeks amid the repricing of inflation risk and rising U.S. Treasury yields,” said Jeremy Osborne, investment director at FIL Investments (Japan) Limited.\n“While volatility may persist for some time, the recent selloff is more of a reaction to the rapid rise since last autumn rather than any deterioration in fundamentals,” he said.\nInsurance stocks soared on Thursday with Dai-ichi Life Holdings jumping 5.0 percent and T&D Holdings surging 2.6 percent.\nBanks also rallied, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group rising 1.8 percent and Mitsui Sumitomo Financial Group gaining 1.7 percent.\nExporters gained ground, with Tokyo Electron surging 4.6 percent and Honda Motor Co gaining 1.3 percent.\nThe broader Topix advanced 1.0 percent to 1,719.27.
