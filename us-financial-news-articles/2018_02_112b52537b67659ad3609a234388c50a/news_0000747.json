Sales were driven by more expensive brands, including Grey Goose and Ketel One.\nAmong other liquors, American Whiskey saw its sales rise 8.1 percent, while Tequila rose 9.9 percent and Irish Whiskey was up 12.8 percent. Rye Whiskey saw the strongest growth, with demand for those spirits rising 16.2 percent to 900,000 cases.\nSpirits also took market share away from beers for the eighth straight year, rising 0.7 percent to 36.6 percent share of the total U.S. beverage alcohol market. Each percentage point of market share is worth $720 million in supplier sales revenue, the council said.\nThe recent U.S. overhaul in the tax code that reduced excise tax on spirits producers for the first time since the Civil War will put more than half-a-billion dollars in distiller pockets over two years, the council said.\n“This historic tax cut will enable distillers to invest back in their businesses and communities, generate jobs and support agriculture and growing whiskey tourism,” Distilled Spirits Council’s Chief Executive Kraig Naasz said in a statement.\nReporting by Siddharth Cavale and Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:11:27.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
