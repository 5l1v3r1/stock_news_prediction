We will definitely see her winning more this year.”\nIt was an evening to forget for the 20-year-old Kasatkina, who committed 34 unforced errors, but her victories over world number three Garbine Muguruza and Johanna Konta this week reflected her remarkable progress on the WTA Tour this season.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T19:27:53.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
