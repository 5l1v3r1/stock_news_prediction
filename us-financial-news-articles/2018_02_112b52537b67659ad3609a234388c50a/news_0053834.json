Loftis is recognized for his ability to transform supply chain metrics into meaningful business intelligence that supports development of holistic strategies to improve asset utilization, eliminate waste and accelerate performance.\n\"As an expert in strategic network design and flow strategies, horizontal and collaborative distribution solutions and transportation network modelling, Bill advances solutions that help shippers lower reliance on unnecessary resources, and ultimately, reduce their carbon footprint as their business grows,\" says Transportation Insight President and CEO Chris Baltz. \"His academic approach to supply chain design provides value to many of our 1,500 Transportation Insight clients. We are delighted with his recognition for supply chain excellence.\"\nLoftis' supply chain perspectives have appeared in numerous industry publications, including Supply Chain Brain which published \"Horizontal Collaboration and Its Impact on Transportation, Sustainability, Service and Profits\" and \"Transportation Technology Advanced in BI and Cross-Functional Integration.\" He has also presented industry research at the Grocery Manufacturers Association Supply Chain Conference and the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals annual conference.\nLoftis' work with hundreds of Global 1000 and Fortune 500 Consumer Packaged Goods companies has applied analytics-supported solutions to improve carrier sourcing, optimize private fleets, consolidate vendors, outsource execution, and control and manage inbound and outbound freight spending. His perspective on managing strategic carrier relationships and leveraging their strengths helps shippers mitigate challenges arising as capacity tightens and demand accelerates.\n\"Capacity concerns intensified by driver shortages and regulations accelerate the need to study strategies that facilitate the use of shared resources,\" Loftis says. \"Those resources will be better utilized with fuller trucks and warehouses, and there can also be a reduction in vehicle miles, fuel consumption and air pollution emission.\"\n\"Service requirements are on top of everyone's mind. Inventory solutions are compounded for businesses that are still highly siloed,\" Loftis continues. \"As a result, many companies are making deliberate efforts to integrate their supply chain. Transportation Insight helps shippers better leverage inventory supply, demand and placement, order fulfillment and network design strategies to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce total landed cost and understand product profitability. By focusing on inventory, we help our clients address aspects of the process that make a difference to the end customer.\"\nLoftis authored Transportation Insight's grocery retail supply chain point of view, which solves key challenges in food, beverage and fresh logistics networks.
