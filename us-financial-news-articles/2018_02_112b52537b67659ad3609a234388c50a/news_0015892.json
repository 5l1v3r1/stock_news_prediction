I am happy to have them.” \nStones returned to first-team training after a bout of illness and a subsequent knee injury over the last couple of weeks. Soccer Football - Premier League - Burnley vs Manchester City - Turf Moor, Burnley, Britain - February 3, 2018 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola at the end of the match Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff \nSane, who suffered ankle ligament damage during last month’s FA Cup win at Cardiff City, returned to light training this week but Guardiola said the German forward is unlikely to recover for Tuesday’s Champions League last-16 clash against Basel. \nJesus’ return from a knee ligament injury is still at least two weeks away but Guardiola praised striker Sergio Aguero’s work-rate for leading the line on his own in recent matches. \n“We have tomorrow and three days later the Champions League, five days for the next one, then five days for the League (Cup) final (against Arsenal). We’ll see day by day how the players feel,” Guardiola said. \n“I would like to rest Sergio Aguero but he’s the only striker we have. He is making a huge effort and doing really well. But Gabriel is also coming back soon - maybe seven days or two weeks.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T19:17:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
