THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION / John Okot Okello later trained as a community psychologist and set up the Comfort Dog Project in 2015, which has helped heal more than 300 people who have been traumatized by the rebellion, marked by the kidnapping of children for use as fighters and sex slaves.\nUganda’s health ministry estimates that seven out of 10 people in northern Uganda are traumatized by the war in which tens of thousands were killed and 2 million were uprooted from their homes. The LRA was ejected from the area in 2005.\nFilda Akumu, 35, whose family was massacred by LRA rebels, battled with trauma after escaping rebel captivity.\nFrancis Okello (holding a white cane) instructs his patients during therapy in Gulu, Uganda on February 5, 2018. THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION / John Okot “When I witnessed my father and my two brothers being hacked to death, I never thought I would heal again - until now,” said Akumu, who also volunteers at the project.\nThousands of former abductees - like Akumu - suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and suicidal thoughts, making it hard to rebuild their lives, experts say.\nThe presence of dogs can provide comfort to people with mental health problems and distract them from upsetting thoughts, research shows.\nOkello gets many of his dogs from The Big Fix, northern Uganda’s only veterinary hospital.\n“I mainly use stray dogs because they face tough conditions,” Okello said.\n“When these dogs bond with our patients, they form a companionship that heals both parties.”\nReporting by John Okot.
