In Norway no one would watch short track (speed skating), for example. The people watching short track would fly in from Asia probably,” he said.\n“And here it’s packed at the short-track. The Olympics is bigger than just Alpine skiing. If Alpine skiing is not big deal here, that’s too bad for us, but hopefully there are other sports that are a big deal and they get good crowds there.”\nThe bad news for Alpine skiing is that the next Winter Games are also in Asia, in China in 2022, and the 2026 Games could yet go to Japan.\nSome critics might also point at the huge crowds that have packed out the Phoenix Snow Park for the snowboard finals over the last few days as evidence that Alpine organizers need to refresh their model if they are to remain a central plank of the Games.\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T15:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:42:06.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
