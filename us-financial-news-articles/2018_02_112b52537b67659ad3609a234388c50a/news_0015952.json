It was taken over by France’s Lactalis in 2011. \nWhen Lactalis last year launched a bid for the Parmalat shares it did not own, minority shareholders said the price offered was too low, in part because of the potential cash-in from the lawsuit. \nCitigroup was advised by law firm Clifford & Chance.
