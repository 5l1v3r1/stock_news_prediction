The increase was primarily due to the increased number of stores, more choices of commodity at lower prices through frequent price negotiation with suppliers, brand-name health product sales campaign in cooperation with brand name suppliers, and value-added customer services such as chronic disease monitoring.\nRevenue from the online pharmacy segment decreased by $0.04 million, or 1.2%, to $3.40 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $3.44 million for the same period of last year. The decrease was mainly caused by a decline in our sales via e-commerce platforms. The decline in sales was due to the suspension of OTC drug sales on e-commerce platforms in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 by the CFDA. The Company is adding more non-medical health products such as nutritional supplements into our sales menu to counteract the decline in sales of OTC drug category via e-commerce platforms.\nRevenue from the wholesale segment increased by $2.08 million, or 68.1%, to $5.13 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $3.05 million for the same period of last year.
