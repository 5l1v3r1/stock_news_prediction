This marks the third year in a row that Kraft has been recognized on the annual list.\n“It is an honor to be recognized by CRN as a 2018 Channel Chief,” said Kraft. “As the number of large data breaches rise despite an increase in security spending, a new approach must be established other than the traditional siloed approach that attackers continue to exploit – the old way simply doesn’t work. By bringing together network, endpoint, vulnerability, and identity capabilities, SecureAuth and Core Security are the industry’s first Identity Security Automation provider to deliver an integrated approach to identity and security for the market. This recognition from CRN highlights our continued commitment to ensuring our partners are at the heart of our go-to-market strategy and that, without these key relationships, our customers would find it much more difficult to solve their real problems.”\nThe CRN Channel Chiefs list represents top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue for their organization through the leveraging of channel partners. Honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth, and innovation.\n“The executives on CRN’s 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,” said Robert Faletra, Executive Chairman of The Channel Company. “These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy, and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief’s impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.”\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list is featured in the February 2018 issue of CRN and online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs .\nAbout SecureAuth and Core Security\nSecureAuth and Core Security bring together network, endpoint, vulnerability, and identity security, creating the industry’s first Identity Security Automation platform.
