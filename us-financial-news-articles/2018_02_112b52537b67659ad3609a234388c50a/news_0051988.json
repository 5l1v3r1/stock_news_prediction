A group of astronomers spotted the red coupe with a high-powered telescope in Arizona. \nThe Roadster was launched into orbit aboard SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket on February 6 and is currently in orbit around the Sun, 3 million miles from Earth. SpaceX initially intended for the car to crash into Mars, but it looks like it will pass the red planet. \nGood news for collectors: scientists out of the University of Toronto crunched the numbers and found out there is a 6% chance it will crash back into Earth within the next one million years.
