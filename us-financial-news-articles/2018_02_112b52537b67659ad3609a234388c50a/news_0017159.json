I wanted to do it last year as well, wanted to play a heavy schedule, but the (rib) injury didn’t allow me to do that.”\nIf McIlroy needed a shot of confidence, Day was happy to provide it.\n“I think the biggest thing for Rory is how, like the desire part, how much do you really want it because he has the tools to be kind of Tiger-esque,” said Day, who won his last start at Torrey Pines two weeks ago.\nAged 30, the Australian said he may need to capitalise on that good form as he seeks to add to his lone major title, the 2015 PGA Championship.\n”I‘m not saying my time is running out but I need to step up here and start playing some good golf.\n”It’s not like I need to urgently get out and play well this week and everything’s riding on this week.\n“I’ve just got to do the right things, prepare well, go through the right steps on the golf course to get myself into contention.”\nDespite the venue’s fame, the event had been mostly ignored by the world’s elite in recent years but it has regained its attraction with the top players embracing the pro-am format.\nThe field play one round each at three different courses, before the cut is made after 54 holes for the final round at Pebble Beach.\nReporting by Andrew Both in Adelaide, South Australia; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T03:33:00.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
