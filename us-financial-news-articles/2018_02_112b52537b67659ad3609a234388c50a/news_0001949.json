Baird.\n“In general, people are a lot more concerned about a hawkish tone from the Fed. While the market has priced in three rate hikes for 2018, if the economy continues to firm up and earnings remain solid, the possibility of a fourth rate hike definitely becomes more firm.”\nIn another sign of a strong labor market, an ADP report showed the U.S. private sector added more jobs than expected in January. The report comes ahead of the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data on Friday.\nAt 12:36 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 155.81 points, or 0.6 percent, at 26,232.7, the S&P 500 was up 6.83 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,829.26 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 23.81 points, or 0.32 percent, at 7,426.29.\nThe Dow had tumbled nearly 540 points over Monday on Tuesday amid a broad market sell-off as U.S. Treasury yields surged.\nBut, the blue-chip index clawed back as much as 200 points earlier on Wednesday. That came as Boeing surged 6.9 percent to record high after the planemaker’s full-year profit forecast easily topped estimates.\nThe jump in Boeing’s shares, the biggest weight in the price-weighted Dow and the S&P, helped the industrials sector rise 0.75 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors.\nElectronic Arts jumped 10.4 pct to record high after it gave a upbeat forecast, which also sent shares of fellow videogame makers Activision Blizzard and Take-Two to all-time highs.\nAnthem’s strong results and forecast sent its shares up 1.5 percent and also boosted other health insurers, a day after the group and other health stocks were hit by news of Amazon.com’s healthcare plans.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,567 to 1,298. On the Nasdaq, 1,510 issues fell and 1,349 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 32 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 35 new lows.
