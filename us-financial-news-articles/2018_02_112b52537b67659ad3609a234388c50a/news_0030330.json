As a president, it’s all I can ask for,” Howard told Reuters, shortly after plain-clothed officials from South Korea’s National Counter-terrorism Centre moved him away from the cheerleaders, who he said had been doing a very good job.\n“I mean I trained them by myself so, of course, they’re the best in the world,” Howard said.\nHoward had caused a commotion during last Friday’s opening ceremony when he and a person dressed as U.S. President Donald Trump were swiftly shown out of the stadium by security staff.\nThe same impersonator had caused a commotion during last Friday's opening ceremony when he and a person dressed as U.S. President Donald Trump were swiftly shown out of the stadium by security staff.
