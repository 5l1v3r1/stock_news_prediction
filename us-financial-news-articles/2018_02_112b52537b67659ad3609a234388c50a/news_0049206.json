So yeah, they just missed three or four shots in a row to get the rocks in the right places.\n”Benoit is cool in the very tough moments, the very key moments, and he’s always calm, he always tries to stay positive in every situation.\n“We really struggled at the beginning, they read the ice really well, and think that we were just patient enough and we knew that we had a chance at some point.”\nCurling - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men’s Tie-Breaker - Switzerland v Britain - Gangneung Curling Center - Gangneung, South Korea - February 22, 2018 - Thomas Muirhead of Britain shouts as Benoit Schwarz and Peter de Cruz of Switzerland watch. REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton British coach Viktor Kjell was left shell-shocked.\n“I just don’t know what happened in that ninth end, I thought we were the better team the whole game but they stepped it up,” he said.\nSlideshow (5 Images) ”We missed four or five shots in a row and you cannot afford to do that at this level.\n“I thought we’d almost got away with it and then he plays a pistol shot and walks away with a five.”\nBritain, runners-up to Canada in Sochi four years ago, were forced into the playoff after being thrashed 10-4 in eight ends by the United States on Wednesday.\nThe Swiss, despite losing to Britain in the preliminaries, had looked well placed to advance but suffered a shock defeat to South Korea and then also lost to the U.S. in their last game to also miss their chance of direct progress.\nSwitzerland took gold in 1998 and have won two bronze medals since then, while their mixed team took a silver medal in the event’s Olympic debut last week.\nCanada, seeking a fourth successive gold, meet the United States in the other semi-final later on Thursday.\nReporting by Mitch Phillips, additional reporting by Elaine Lies.; Editing by John O'Brien/Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T05:13:09.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
