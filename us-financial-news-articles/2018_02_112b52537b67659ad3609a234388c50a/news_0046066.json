REUTERS/Jaime Saldarriaga FARC leaders on Wednesday denied any connection to the Supercundi chain and called the accusations “fake news.”\nThe FARC, once known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, accumulated a considerable fortune from drug trafficking, kidnapping and extortion during a long war. It has always denied hiding money and says it has spent almost everything on maintaining its troops and on weapons.\nSlideshow (7 Images) The 7,000-strong group, now the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, promised to hand over all assets to compensate victims of the five-decade war.\nHeavily armed police and soldiers with tanks guarded the looted supermarkets and others that remain closed on Wednesday. Stores in Tolima, Quindio, Cundinamarca and Boyaca provinces were looted and 28 people were arrested, according to the police.\n“We are adopting measures, because we have information that there are groups of people who are organizing themselves through social networks to attack other commercial establishments,” Javier Beltran, a high-level official in Cundinamarca province, where Bogota is located, said on Caracol TV.\nThe attacks were initially focused on supermarkets but spread to other establishments. Most appear to be acts of vandalism and theft rather than political activism.\nReporting by Helen Murphy, Luis Jaime Acosta and Nelson Bocanegra; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T07:49:39.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
