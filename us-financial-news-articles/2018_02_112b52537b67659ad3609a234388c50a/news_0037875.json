Fabian Boesch and Elias Ambuehl were the first athletes at the Games confirmed to have been hit by the highly contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhoea. Swiss team media official Erika Herzig told Reuters that both athletes were feeling better and would train ahead of Sunday’s slopestyle qualification. “Elias did not have too bad of a case. Fabian was a little worse, but they are both okay now and will train,” said Herzig. “We are very relieved.” The men’s slopestyle qualification begins on Sunday at 1000 local time (0100 GMT).
