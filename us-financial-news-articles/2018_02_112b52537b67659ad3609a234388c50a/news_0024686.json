(NYSE:BIF) announced today that its Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.034 per common share for each of the months of February, March and April 2018. These dividends are being paid as part of BIF’s monthly managed distribution program under which BIF will make per share distributions of $0.034 per month, or approximately $0.408 per year. As of market close on February 8, 2018, the distribution amounts to approximately 3.8% of market price and 3.3% of net asset value (“NAV”) on an annualized basis.\nDue to the current discount of BIF’s market price to its per share NAV, and the fact that distributions are made in cash (i.e., at NAV), the next distribution will be accretive to BIF’s market-price-based return. If shares in BIF continue to trade at a discount at the time of future distributions, then these distributions will also be accretive to BIF’s market-price-based return.\nFor the months of February, March and April the dividend will be payable in cash to stockholders of record per the following critical dates:\nPay Date Record Date Ex-Dividend Date Amount Per Share February 28, 2018 February 21, 2018 February 20, 2018 $0.034 March 29, 2018 March 22, 2018 March 21, 2018 $0.034 April 30, 2018 April 23, 2018 April 20, 2018 $0.034 The timing and character of distributions for federal income tax purposes are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP. As such, all or a portion of these distributions may be reportable as taxable income on your 2018 federal income tax returns. The final tax character of any distribution declared in 2018 will be determined in January 2019 and reported to you on IRS Form 1099-DIV.\nAs previously announced, the Board instituted a monthly managed distribution program in accordance with its Section 19(b) exemptive order in November 2015. In adopting the program, the Fund seeks to provide a regular monthly distribution to its common stockholders which is not dependent on the amount of income earned or capital gains realized by the Fund.\nFor more information on the Fund, please visit us on the web at www.boulderfunds.net .\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180209005662/en/\nFund Administrative Services, LLC\nBrandon Krinhop, 303-449-0426\nSource: Boulder Growth & Income Fund, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180209005662/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boulderfunds.net&esheet=51756591&newsitemid=20180209005662&lan=en-US&anchor=www.boulderfunds.net&index=1&md5=5b0399b9156e18c6a0789abedde5ff37"], "published": "2018-02-10T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T03:04:25.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
