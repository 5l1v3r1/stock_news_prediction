(NYSE: SPB), a global consumer products company offering a portfolio of leading brands providing superior value to consumers and customers every day, today reported results from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ended December 31, 2017.\nSpectrum Brands announced on January 3, 2018 that it was exploring strategic options for its Global Batteries & Appliances (GBA) businesses with the intention to sell the units during 2018. As a result, effective with the Company’s fiscal 2018 first quarter financial results, the GBA segment has been reclassified as held for sale and is now reported as discontinued operations for the first quarter and the prior-year period.\nThis press release includes non-GAAP metrics such as organic net sales, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, organic adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. See Other Supplemental Information for reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics.\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Highlights from Continuing Operations:\nNet sales of $646.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 7.3 percent compared to $602.3 million last year. Excluding the impact of $7.5 million of favorable foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $24.8 million, organic net sales improved 2.0 percent versus the prior year. Net income from continuing operations of $120.1 million and diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.07 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased compared to net income of $12.8 million and diluted EPS of $0.21 in fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower interest expense and a net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 attributable to recently enacted U.S. tax reform. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.38 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 8.6 percent versus $0.35 last year predominantly due to a change in the normalized effective tax rate to a blended annual rate of 24.5 percent from 35.0 percent due to changes in the U.S. corporate tax rate. Operating income of $34.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 fell 44.7 percent versus $61.5 million last year as a result of incremental restructuring costs and higher operating expenses. Operating income margin of 5.3 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 490 basis points versus 10.2 percent last year. Adjusted EBITDA of $105.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 0.5% compared to $105.2 million in fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange of $1.6 million and acquisition EBITDA of $8.7 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $98.6 million decreased 6.3 percent versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.3 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 120 basis points compared to 17.5 percent in fiscal 2017 primarily due to unfavorable product mix, operating inefficiencies and input cost inflation.\n“In our first quarter, as Spectrum Brands begins reporting continuing operations, we delivered solid reported and organic sales growth of 7% and 2%, respectively,” said Andreas Rouvé, Chief Executive Officer of Spectrum Brands Holdings. “Hardware & Home Improvement led the way with double-digit growth and a first quarter record. Regionally, growth was driven by our core U.S. business. As expected, our organic sales growth was reduced by about $8.4 million, or 1.4%, from the planned exit of a European dog and cat food customer tolling agreement.\n“We’re pleased our e-commerce business from continuing operations remained a bright spot in the first quarter, with growth of more than 54% in our core U.S. market,” he said. “We continue to increase our digital and social media marketing investments and add more resources to ensure we are capturing the growing shift of consumer spending to online channels and influencing their purchase decisions wherever they want to buy.\n“Our reported adjusted EBITDA improved 0.5% with solid contributions from our Pet acquisitions and a strong level of cost improvements,” Mr. Rouvé said. “Rising commodity costs and negative currency impacts on our input costs were offsets as well as some unfavorable price mix. However, it is important to remember that Q1 for our continuing businesses is by far our smallest quarter of the year.\n“We’ve made major progress in our key strategic initiatives,” he said. “Our GAC U.S. footprint consolidation is now complete, which is important as we head into the peak spring and summer period. Also, our HHI distribution consolidation in Kansas is moving toward completion in February, and our European project to consolidate Pet distribution centers will be completed in early April. These projects will bring cost savings, lower working capital and improved service levels later this year and beyond.\n“Our focus remains on accelerating organic growth, and the Project Alpha initiative we have announced is supporting this objective with higher investments into new product development and digital marketing to launch more innovative products and expand into adjacent categories,” Mr. Rouvé said. “At the same time, our complementary initiative known as Project Ignite aims to redirect our resources and spending to our best growth opportunities and will help fund higher investments through Project Alpha.\n“Accordingly, we expect stronger performances in our continuing operations in the out quarters and reaffirm our fiscal 2018 adjusted free cash flow guidance of a record $620-$640 million which includes our discontinued operations,” Mr. Rouvé said.\n“January was a month of transformational developments for Spectrum Brands as we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Global Battery and Lighting business to Energizer Holdings for $2 billion in cash in a transaction expected to close by the end of calendar 2018,” he said. “This is a significant step in our announced strategy to reshape Spectrum Brands into a faster-growing, higher-margin and more focused consumer brands company. We are actively marketing our Personal Care and Small Appliances businesses as the other key component of our intention to divest our Global Batteries & Appliances segment.\n“We plan to use the net proceeds from these divestitures to reduce debt and repurchase shares, but also to increase our investment in organic growth initiatives as well as bolt-on acquisitions in our remaining businesses,” Mr. Rouvé said. “This reallocation of capital will result in an increased focus on our 4 core businesses of Hardware & Home Improvement, Global Auto Care, Pet and Home & Garden. By refocusing in this way, we will strengthen our business and drive long-term growth and shareholder value.”\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Consolidated Financial Results from Continuing Operations\nNet sales of $646.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 7.3 percent compared to $602.3 million in fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of $7.5 million of favorable foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $24.8 million, organic net sales grew 2.0 percent.\nGross profit and gross profit margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $240.9 million and 37.3 percent, respectively, compared to $239.1 million and 39.7 percent, respectively, last year. The gross profit margin percentage decrease was primarily due to unfavorable mix, the negative impact of the Pet U.S. rawhide safety recall and operating start-up inefficiencies in Hardware & Home Improvement and Global Auto Care from U.S. facility consolidations.\nOperating expenses of $206.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 16.5 percent compared to $177.6 million in the prior year primarily due to increased restructuring and related charges and the impact of acquisitions.\nOperating income of $34.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 fell 44.7 percent versus $61.5 million last year as a result of incremental restructuring costs and higher operating expenses. Operating income margin of 5.3 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 490 basis points versus 10.2 percent last year.\nNet income from continuing operations was $120.1 million, or $2.07 diluted EPS, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on average diluted shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 57.7 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, net income from continuing operations was $12.8 million, or $0.21 diluted EPS, on average diluted shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 59.5 million. The increase in net income and diluted EPS was primarily due to lower interest expense and a net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 attributable to recently enacted U.S. tax reform. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.38 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 improved 8.6 percent versus $0.35 last year. As a result of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate due to recently enacted tax reform, fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS reflects a 24.5 percent blended tax rate versus 35.0 percent used in previous years.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $105.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased slightly compared to $105.2 million in fiscal 2017. Hardware & Home Improvement delivered record first quarter adjusted EBITDA. Excluding the impact of $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign exchange and acquisition EBITDA of $8.7 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $98.6 million decreased 6.3 percent versus the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Reported adjusted EBITDA margin declined 120 basis points to 16.3 percent compared to 17.5 percent last year.\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Segment Level Data\nHardware & Home Improvement (HHI)\nThree Month Period Ended (in millions, except %) December 31. 2017 January 1, 2017 Variance Net Sales $ 325.9 $ 288.8 $ 37.1 12.8 % Operating Income 31.6 46.8 (15.2 ) (32.5 %) Operating Income Margin 9.7 % 16.2 % (650 ) bps Adjusted EBITDA 60.0 59.2 0.8 1.4 % Adjusted EBITDA Margin 18.4 % 20.5 % (210 ) bps A double-digit increase in first quarter net sales was driven by strong growth in residential security and plumbing in the U.S. and Canada. Excluding favorable foreign exchange impacts of $2.1 million, organic net sales grew 12.1 percent.\nDecreases in first quarter operating income and margins were primarily a result of operating start-up issues and restructuring costs connected with the U.S. distribution center consolidation project. Slightly higher adjusted EBITDA was due to increased volumes, partially offset by lower product mix and operational inefficiencies.\nGlobal Pet Supplies (PET)\nThree Month Period Ended (in millions, except %) December 31. 2017 January 1, 2017 Variance Net Sales $ 202.4 $ 194.2 $ 8.2 4.2 % Operating Income 13.0 19.5 (6.5 ) (33.3 %) Operating Income Margin 6.4 % 10.0 % (360 ) bps Adjusted EBITDA 34.1 30.7 3.4 11.1 % Adjusted EBITDA Margin 16.8 % 15.8 % 100 bps First quarter net sales increased as a result of $24.8 million of revenues from the PetMatrix and GloFish acquisitions completed in June and May 2017, respectively. Partially offsetting the increase was a decline in European dog and cat food sales largely from the planned exit of a pet food customer tolling agreement of $8.4 million, which negatively impacted segment sales by approximately 4.3 percent. Further, U.S. companion animal sales were adversely impacted by the rawhide dog chew product safety recall initiated in June 2017, retailer shelf adjustments and sluggish store traffic in certain channels. Lower U.S. aquatics revenues were due to category softness, partially offset by international aquatics growth. Excluding the impact of favorable foreign exchange of $4.8 million and acquisition sales of $24.8 million, organic net sales decreased 11.0 percent in the first quarter.\nDecreased operating income and margin were primarily driven by incremental production costs and operating inefficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA and margin increased as a result of the PetMatrix and GloFish acquisitions. Excluding favorable foreign exchange impacts of $0.4 million and acquisition EBITDA of $8.7 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $25.0 million fell 18.6 percent.\nHome and Garden (H&G)\nThree Month Period Ended (in millions, except %) December 31. 2017 January 1, 2017 Variance Net Sales $ 49.3 $ 49.8 $ (0.5 ) (1.0 %) Operating Income 0.8 1.7 (0.9 ) (52.9 %) Operating Income Margin 1.6 % 3.4 % (180 ) bps Adjusted EBITDA 5.4 5.7 (0.3 ) (5.3 %) Adjusted EBITDA Margin 11.0 % 11.4 % (40 ) bps Slightly lower first quarter net sales were driven by reduced outdoor control revenues due to seasonal order and promotional delays, partially offset by increases in the repellents and household controls categories, as well as growth in Latin America.\nLower operating income, adjusted EBITDA and margins decreased predominantly due to reduced volumes.\nGlobal Auto Care (GAC)\nThree Month Period Ended (in millions, except %) December 31. 2017 January 1, 2017 Variance Net Sales $ 68.9 $ 69.5 $ (0.6 ) (0.9 %) Operating Income 6.7 13.1 (6.4 ) (48.9 %) Operating Income Margin 9.7 % 18.8 % (910 ) bps Adjusted EBITDA 14.8 19.8 (5.0 ) (25.3 %) Adjusted EBITDA Margin 21.5 % 28.5 % (700 ) bps First quarter net sales fell slightly. International growth, especially in Europe, was more than offset by lower U.S. revenues driven primarily by the timing of refrigerant shipments. Excluding favorable foreign exchange impacts of $0.6 million, organic net sales decreased 1.7 percent.\nLower operating income, adjusted EBITDA and margins were predominantly the result of reduced volumes, unfavorable product mix, operating inefficiencies and higher expenses in support of new product launches.\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Consolidated Results from Discontinued Operations\nSpectrum Brands announced on January 3, 2018 that it was exploring strategic options for its Global Batteries & Appliances (GBA) businesses with the intention to sell the units during 2018. As a result, effective with the Company’s fiscal 2018 first quarter financial results, the GBA segment has been reclassified as held for sale and is now reported as discontinued operations for the first quarter and the prior-year period.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $40.9 million and diluted EPS of $0.70 from discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased compared to $52.4 million and $0.89, respectively, in fiscal 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS from discontinued operations of $0.76 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 fell 11.6 percent compared to $0.86 last year.\nLiquidity and Debt\nSpectrum Brands completed the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on December 31, 2017 with a solid liquidity position, including a cash balance of approximately $138 million and more than $454 million available on its $700 million Cash Flow Revolver.\nAs of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had approximately $4,034 million of debt outstanding, consisting of $226 million on its Cash Flow Revolver and a series of secured Term Loans in the aggregate amount of $1,275 million, $2,328 million of senior unsecured notes, and approximately $205 million of capital leases and other obligations.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nSpectrum Brands expects fiscal 2018 reported net sales from continuing operations to grow above category rates for most categories, along with an anticipated modest positive impact from foreign exchange based upon current rates.\nFiscal 2018 adjusted free cash flow is projected to be approximately $620-$640 million compared to $587 million in fiscal 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $110 million to $120 million.\nConference Call/Webcast Scheduled for 9:00 A.M.

For more information, visit www.spectrumbrands.com .\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nManagement believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that organic net sales provide for a more complete understanding of underlying business trends of regional and segment performance by excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of acquisitions. In addition, within this release, including the supplemental information attached hereto, reference is made to adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management to evaluate segment performance and frequently used by the financial community which provides insight into an organization’s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA also is one of the measures used for determining the Company’s debt covenant. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales of the Company. Organic adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The Company’s management uses adjusted diluted EPS as one means of analyzing the Company’s current and future financial performance and identifying trends in its financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that adjusted diluted EPS is a useful measure for providing further insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. An income tax adjustment is included in adjusted diluted EPS to exclude the impact of the valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other tax-related items in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate of 35%. The Company’s management believes that adjusted free cash flow is useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company’s ability to service and repay its debt and meet its working capital requirements. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for pretax income, net income, net cash from operating activities or other statement of income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. In addition, the calculation of adjusted free cash flow does not reflect cash used to service debt and therefore, does not reflect funds available for investment or discretionary uses. The Company provides this information to investors to assist in comparisons of past, present and future operating results and to assist in highlighting the results of on-going operations. While the Company’s management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace the Company’s GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results. Other Supplemental Information has been provided to demonstrate reconciliation of non-GAAP measurements discussed above to most relevant GAAP financial measurements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this news release and other oral and written statements by representatives of the Company regarding matters such as the Company’s ability to meet its expectations for its fiscal 2018 (including expectations regarding capital expenditures and its ability to increase its net sales, free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA) may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The Company believes that adjusted diluted EPS provides further insight and comparability in operating performance as it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Adjustments to diluted EPS include (1) acquisition and integration costs that consist of transaction costs from nonrecurring acquisition transactions during the period or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with the acquired business further summarized below; (2) restructuring and related costs, which consist of project costs associated with restructuring initiatives across the segments further summarized below; (3) one time purchase accounting inventory adjustments recognized in earnings subsequent to an acquisition; (4) non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized; (5) and other adjustments. During the three month period ended December 31, 2017, other adjustments consist of estimated costs for a non-recurring voluntary recall of rawhide product by the PET segment and professional fees associated with non-acquisition based strategic initiatives of the Company. Income tax adjustment to diluted EPS is to exclude the impact of adjusting the valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other tax related items in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate, net of adjustments made to diluted EPS. For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, the normalized ongoing effective tax rate was updated to 24.5% to reflect a lower effective tax rate from 35% in the three month period ended January 1, 2017 due to changes in the enacted corporate tax rate in the United States.

We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate and/or acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to reported net sales in the prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the period’s net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior period. Net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period.

Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management and we believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects ongoing operating performance and trends of our segments excluding certain non-cash based expenses and/or non-recurring items during each of the comparable periods and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Further, adjusted EBITDA is a measure used for determining the Company’s debt covenant. EBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company’s income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes: (1) stock based compensation expense as it is a non-cash based compensation cost; (2) acquisition and integration costs that consist of transaction costs from acquisition transactions during the period, or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with the acquired business as previously summarized; (3) restructuring and related costs, which consist of project costs associated with restructuring initiatives as previously summarized; (4) non-cash purchase accounting inventory adjustments recognized in earnings subsequent to an acquisition; (5) non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized; (6) and other adjustments. During the three month period ended December 31, 2017, other adjustments consist of estimated costs for a non-recurring voluntary recall of rawhide product by the PET segment and professional fees associated with non-acquisition based strategic initiatives of the Company.
