REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/Files In January it put forward three broad possible solutions: insulating Sky News from Fox’s influence, spinning off or divesting Sky News, or blocking the deal outright.\nSky, however, warned the regulator that if it blocked the deal, it could close the loss-making channel completely, killing the main British competitor to the BBC in 24-hour TV news.\nFox said the regulator’s assessment was based on a number of legal and factual errors, but nonetheless promised to fund Sky News for at least five years and said it would put a “firewall” around the channel as remedies.\nRupert Murdoch, Chairman of Fox News Channel attends Rafael Nadal of Spain's match against Kevin Anderson of South Africa at the U.S. Open in New York, September 10, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files “The combined effect of the Proposed Firewall Remedies is that there could be no circumstances in which, post-transaction, the MFT (Murdoch family trust) or members of the Murdoch family could influence, whether directly or indirectly, the editorial line or policy of Sky News,” the company said.\nIt said it would establish a fully independent board to oversee Sky News, including the appointment of the head of the channel, who will have sole responsibility for editorial strategy and staffing.\nThe proposal builds on a previous Fox pledge to create a Sky News board with a majority of independent directors.\nBut the CMA noted opponents of the deal had said previous offers by Murdoch to guarantee the editorial independence of the Times newspapers in Britain and the Dow Jones company had proved ineffective.\nFormer opposition Labour leader Ed Milliband and ex-Conservative finance minister Kenneth Clarke were among four lawmakers who said the deal should be blocked, arguing if the independence of Sky News was lost, it would be difficult or impossible to restore, and that the CMA could reconsider the deal if Disney buys Fox.\nFox’s proposals were released by the CMA on Monday. It is due to present media secretary Matt Hancock with a final report by May 1 and he has said he will rule on the deal by June 14.\nShares in Sky were trading up 0.36 percent at 10.53 pounds at 1216 GMT. Fox has offered 10.75 pounds a share.\nEditing by David Evans and David Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T14:22:55.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
