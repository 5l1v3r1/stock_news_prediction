The market is dropping again Thursday. \nTraders are concerned the Federal Reserve may reduce its monetary stimulus and increase interest rates more aggressively as the economy continues to strengthen. \nMajor periods of rising interest rates \nSource: FactSet \nUsing Kensho, a hedge fund analytics tool, CNBC looked at what happens during periods of major increases in interest rates using the 10-year Treasury yield over the last 30 years. \nThe findings show there were six periods with major rises in interest rates in the last three decades. The market rose big during five of those instances and only fell slightly during the one lagging period. \nThe S&P 500 rallied 23 percent on average in the time periods. \nCNBC also looked at the sectors, which rose the most during the rising interest rate time frames. \nThe screen showed technology stocks did well, followed by consumer and financial stocks. \nInvestors are freaking out this month, but higher rates have been good for stocks in the past. Or at the very least, stocks were able to rise alongside higher rates. \nLikely because accelerating economic growth was pushing earnings higher at the same time. \nPast performance does not always equal future returns and of course it could be different this time. \nBut in the past, higher rates didn't equal lower stock returns. \nDisclosure: NBCUniversal, parent of CNBC, is a minority investor in Kensho.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T22:15:49.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
