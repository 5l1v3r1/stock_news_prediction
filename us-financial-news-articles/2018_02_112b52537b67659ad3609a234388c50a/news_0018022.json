Right now my main goal is just to stay in the moment,” said Williams, who will team up with world number 62 Lauren Davis in a potentially decisive fifth rubber. “It goes unsaid 25 (grand slams) is obviously something that I would love, but I’d hate to limit myself.” NEW PERSPECTIVE \nWilliams, who has already established herself as one of the greatest women’s players ever, has not played since losing an exhibition in Abu Dhabi last December to French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko. \nWilliams said she had dealt with a lot of ups and downs while preparing for her comeback but added that the challenges to regain her fitness have given her a new perspective. \n“I think that’s normal for everything that I’ve gone through,” Williams said when asked about the hurdles she has had to overcome in getting back in shape. \n“But it also gives me another view. It’s almost relaxing for me because I have nothing to prove. Again, just fighting against all odds to be out there, to be competing again.” \nWilliams also credited her older sister Venus, who will contest the opening singles rubber for the U.S. on Saturday, for helping her to not lose sight of her goals. \n”I have a great partner and relationship with Venus. She’s been really, really positive,“ said Williams. ”There’s moments that have just been hard, getting back out there doing it every day. You have to get used to that, get in the rhythm of that. \n“I’ve been able to really rely on her for that.” Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T23:42:56.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
