The dollar later pared its gains and was last trading at 108.79 yen, steady on the day.\nThe BOJ’s move came after the 10-year JGB yield had risen to a 6-1/2-month high of 0.095 percent on Tuesday. The central bank’s policy guidance is to control the 10-year yield “around zero percent.”\nBOJ officials have said that any changes to bond-buying operations are fine-tuning and are not meant to telegraph hints on policy.\nStill, some market participants probably interpreted the increase in JGB buying as a signal that the central bank will stick with its monetary stimulus, said Teppei Ino, an analyst for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Singapore.\n“The 10-year JGB yield had almost touched 0.1 percent yesterday, so there was a focus on how they would try to rein in that move,” Ino said.\nA reduction in the BOJ’s buying of long-dated government bonds earlier this month had sparked speculation that the central bank was moving toward an eventual exit from its large stimulus, giving a lift to the yen.\nSpeaking in parliament on Wednesday, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stressed the need to proceed with strong monetary easing, and added that he doesn’t see a problem with financial intermediation now.\nThe focus now shifts to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy statement due later on Wednesday, and a U.S. jobs report on Friday that will include data on nonfarm payrolls and average hourly earnings.\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged this week, and investors will be looking to its policy statement for fresh hints on the outlook for interest rates this year.\nThe Fed probably won’t make major changes to its assessment of the economic and inflation outlook at this stage, said Roy Teo, investment strategist for LGT Bank in Singapore, adding that any material changes are likely to be “further down the road”.\nSince market participants already seem to be bracing for the possibility of three U.S. interest rate hikes this year, the chances of the dollar getting a lift from the Fed’s forthcoming policy statement appear low, Teo added.
