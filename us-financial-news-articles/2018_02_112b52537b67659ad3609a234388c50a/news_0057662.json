For years the document contained language indicating that iCloud services were relying on remote data storage systems from Amazon Web Services, as well as Microsoft's Azure.\nBut in the latest version, the Microsoft Azure reference is gone, and in its place is Google Cloud Platform. Before the January update, Apple most recently updated the iOS Security Guide in March.\nThe latest update doesn't indicate whether Apple is using any Google cloud services other than core storage of \"objects\" like photos and videos. The document also doesn't make it clear when Apple started storing data in Google's cloud. Microsoft declined to comment. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.\nEarlier this month Google said its public cloud and its G Suite line of cloud-based productivity apps contribute $1 billion in revenue per quarter. In the fourth quarter, market leader Amazon Web Services brought in $5.11 billion in revenue .\nIn addition to Apple, other Google public cloud customers include Kroger , PayPal , Snap and Spotify.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:07:50.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
