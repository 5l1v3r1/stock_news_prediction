The Serb progressed to the last eight by beating Uzbek Denis Istomin 7-6(4) 1-6 7-6(5). \n“I knew it will be tough match against a tough opponent. It was my just third match after last year at Wimbledon,” Wawrinka told a news conference. \n“So I need matches, I need tournaments, I need confidence. My level fitness-wise is not yet at my top, but I was surprised I was playing good. I am really proud with the way I was fighting.” \nMarcos Baghdatis upset second seed Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 6-7(4) 6-3 6-1. \nThe feisty Cypriot, who will meet Slovakian qualifier Jozef Kovalik for a place in the semis, broke twice in the decisive set, leaving his 29-year-old opponent to hurl his racket to the court. \nThird seed Gilles Muller needed all his experience to dig himself out of trouble and beat Italian Andreas Seppi 4-6 7-6(5) 7-6(2) in the longest match of the tournament to reach the quarter-finals in Sofia for a third consecutive year. \nThe 34-year-old left-hander from Luxembourg clawed his way back into a match lasting two hours and 35 minutes after powering down 23 aces to set up an intriguing clash with big-serving Romanian Marius Copil, who breezed past Slovenia’s Blaz Kavcic 6-2 6-2.
