Ottawa forward Mike Hoffman also had a two-point game with a pair of assists.\nIt was an entertaining finish to a clash that took until the third period to finally see some scoring. Bobby Ryan put the hosts on the board with a power-play tally. Ryan was parked in front of Miller and deflected Hoffman’s rocket of a one-timer just inside the post to crack the goose egg.\nCuriously, Ryan left for the dressing room soon after scoring just his seventh goal of the season. He gloved down a puck before leaving the ice and didn’t return.\nThe Ducks finally solved Condon with 54.1 seconds remaining in regulation and their goalie pulled for the extra attacker. Ryan Kesler deflected Rickard Rakell’s shot-pass into the top shelf for the fifth goal of his injury shortened season.\nThe Ducks were without number-one goalie John Gibson, who is on the shelf due to a lower body injury that forced him to leave the previous two games. Miller stopped 30 shots on a night his team saw its three-game winning streak snapped, although the Ducks are riding a 5-1-1 run to get back into the thick of the Western Conference playoff picture.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:45:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
