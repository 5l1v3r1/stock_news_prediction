(NASDAQ:TYME), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cancer therapeutics, today announced the appointment of former Wisconsin governor Tommy G. Thompson to the company’s board of directors .\nMr. Thompson, who served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services under former President George W. Bush, brings decades of public and private sector experience, as well as a strong, personal commitment to identifying effective treatments to combat pancreatic cancer.\n“Tyme has proven itself as a true leader in the research and development of breakthrough treatments that are changing the outlook for end-stage cancer patients,” said Thompson. “These therapies are showing real promise in significantly increasing the lifespan of those with Stage IV pancreatic cancer, while dramatically improving their quality of life during treatment. After losing two brothers to this terrible disease, I’m honored to join Tyme as it initiates this Phase II clinical trial. It’s time that we find a cure.”\n“We are honored Governor Thompson will be joining our board of directors,” said Steve Hoffman, Chief Executive Officer of Tyme. “His lifetime of public service, combined with his personal and professional experience navigating the healthcare system, will be an invaluable asset to Tyme’s leadership team. We look forward to working with him as we plan to advance SM-88 into a Phase II trial in pancreatic cancer and continue to explore SM-88 in other metastatic and end-stage cancers.”\nAbout SM-88\nSM-88 is a novel combination therapy that utilizes a proprietary dysfunctional tyrosine derivative to interrupt the metabolic processes of cancer cells, breaking down the cells’ key defenses and making them vulnerable to oxidative stress and death. SM-88 has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of multiple oncology indications, including breast and prostate cancer, without reports of significant toxicity or serious adverse events. SM-88 is being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial for prostate cancer ( NCT02796898 ). A Phase II clinical trial in pancreatic cancer is planned to initiate in 2018.\nAbout Tyme\nTyme Inc., is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cancer therapeutics that are intended to be broadly effective across tumor types and have low toxicity profiles. Unlike targeted therapies that attempt to regulate specific mutations within cancer, the Company’s therapeutic approach is designed to take advantage of a cancer cell’s innate metabolic weaknesses to compromise its defenses, leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system.\nFor more information, visit www.tymeinc.com .\nForward-Looking Statements/Disclosure Notice\nIn addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
