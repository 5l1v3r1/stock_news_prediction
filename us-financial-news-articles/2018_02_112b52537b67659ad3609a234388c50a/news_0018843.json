Close to 50 percent of easyJet’s shares are already held by non-British, EU investors.\nReporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T03:08:01.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
