Analysts are divided over whether the Canadian housing market will crash or re-inflate in the months to come.\nThe CMHC report on mortgage issuance by Canada’s five largest banks showed 3.9 percent of mortgages issued in Vancouver were held by non-permanent residents in 2016, up from 3.3 percent in 2014. In Toronto, 2.7 percent of mortgages issued in 2016 were held by foreigners, up from 2.1 percent in 2015 and 2.0 percent in 2014.\nWhile the number is a tiny fraction of overall mortgage issuance, the rapid growth of foreigners aged 18 to 44 is shifting the home-buying demographic in Canada, the CMHC said.\n“Among the small group of mortgage holders under the age of 25, non-permanent residents represented an even larger share in Vancouver and Toronto at nearly 10 percent of total mortgages issued in 2016,” the report noted.\nForeigners tended to buy more expensive properties, according to the report, with the average single detached home purchased by a non-permanent resident valued at C$1.09 million in Toronto and C$1.65 million in Vancouver.\nThat was above the average C$902,000 and C$1.42 million bought by permanent residents in those cities, respectively, the report showed.\nData released in December showed foreign buyers in Canada’s two largest housing markets are focused on larger and more expensive homes.
