Of course, the intention and desire is to win but I am not obsessed to win, win, win, win. We need a strong team and a winning mentality. \n”For that you need time. You never know, in one, two, three or five years. We are in a good place, waiting for the new stadium, which will be an amazing thing or us, the fans and the club. \n“With the facilities we have to work with, if everything continues in this way then Tottenham will be one of the contenders to win trophies. We want to win a trophy because I did it as a player and I know how you feel afterwards.” \nPochettino named first-team regulars Harry Kane, Jan Vertonghen and Mousa Dembele for the 1-1 draw against Newport County last month but is expected to field a weakened side at Wembley with one eye on Saturday’s derby against Arsenal in the league. \nBut the manager has defended his rotation policy, denying that Tottenham would underestimate the threat posed by their League Two (fourth-tier) opponents. \n”We are a team that respects everyone,“ he said. ”For us, all the competitions are important. I‘m tired of explaining, but football is about 24-25 players, it is about quality of effort. \n“For me, it is the same whether it is Newport or another Premier League team. We take the competition very seriously, and of course we are going to put our best starting 11 to try to win the game.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T18:11:18.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
