The update allowed Google to get into the more sophisticated training phase of deep learning. \nUsage is billed by the second and costs $6.50 per Cloud TPU per hour. \nThe TPUs are designed specifically for AI and machine learning workloads and provide two main benefits to Google. \nFirst, by using its own silicon, Google has a cheaper, more efficient alternative to relying on chipmakers like Nvidia and Intel for its core computing infrastructure. Owning its own hardware enables Google to experiment faster. \nThe new TPUs also allow parent company Alphabet to add a revenue stream to the Google Cloud Platform. GCP and Google's collection of business apps called GSuite now generate more than $1 billion a quarter. \nGoogle is currently allowing companies to rent individual TPU boards but later this year will let them connect multiple boards into supercomputer networks called TPU pods.
