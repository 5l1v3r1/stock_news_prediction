When she really disagrees, she gets the ultimate veto power. \n“So 90 percent of the time I feel like I am the alpha, but I think deep down she knows she’s ...” \n“Reverse psychology,” Becca piped in, speaking over the end of his sentence. “I let him think he’s the alpha.” \nWhatever their chemistry, it appears to be working.

Scott-USA TODAY Sports \nThe Wisconsin natives are the U.S. national champions in mixed doubles curling, one of four new events being introduced at the Feb. 9-25 Games in South Korea. \nThey finished 10th at the 2017 curling world championships and earned the United States a berth in Pyeongchang. \nIn addition to their bid in the mixed event, Becca, 27, and Matt, 28, will be curling for the U.S. women’s and men’s teams.

The United States is ranked eighth and opens up competition on Thursday against fourth-ranked Russia. \nThat first match could be billed as a ‘family feud’ of sorts as the Russian pair - Anastasia Bryzgalova and Alexander Krushelnitskiy - are married. \nAsked which of the family ties was stronger - the bond of brother and sister or husband and wife - Matt had no hesitation: “Definitely the sibling bond: I can’t divorce my sister.” Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T10:24:54.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
