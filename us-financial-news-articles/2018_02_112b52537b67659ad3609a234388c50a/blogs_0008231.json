Earnings per share: $9.70 vs $9.98 expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Revenue: $32.32 billion vs $31.86 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate \nAlphabet's overall revenues increased 24% year-over-year, driven by Google's swelling ads business, which posted $27.27 billion in revenue in Q4. \nAlphabet also announced that John Hennessy will be the company's new chairman. He's been a board member since 2004. \nGoogle's ads were getting clicked more than Wall Street expected year-over-year, and its cost per click, or how much advertisers pay, decreased just about in line with what was expected. Aggregate paid clicks : 43 percent increase year-over-year vs increase of 42.1 percent expected by StreetAccount estimates CPC : 14 percent year-over-year decline vs decline of 14.6 percent expected by StreetAccount estimates \nAlphabet breaks out the revenues and income for both Google and its \"Other Bets,\" like smart-home hardware maker Nest and healthcare company Verily.
