If in the meantime between now and September, there’s a regulatory solution found, then those tickets will be sold as normal.”\nAirlines have said they need a new bilateral deal between Britain and Europe by September or October to replace the EU’s “Open Skies” regime, which allows EU airlines to fly wherever they wish within the bloc, to be able to provide scheduled flights in the months after Britain leaves the EU.\nFILE PHOTO - People disembark a Ryanair flight as some wait to board at Stansted airport in London, Britain September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Britain could also be excluded from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) after it quits the EU. British government ministers have said they expect to remain included in both Open Skies and EASA.\nAirlines are beginning to draw up contigency plans for Brexit, with leading industry body IATA saying that a clear view of Brexit is needed by October at the latest.\nRyanair has applied for a British operating licence to protect its small domestic UK service, and last October, Thomas Cook inserted a similar clause to the one proposed by Ryanair into its ticket sales for April 2019.\nJacobs said it was likely that the clauses would not need to be exercised and a worst-case scenario, where flights between Britain and the European Union were grounded, would be avoided, as authorities look to buy more time under current rules.\nThe EU and Britain are both seeking a transition deal to help businesses adapt to Brexit, where Britain will follow EU regulations for at least 21 months after it departs.\n“There’s clearly going to be an extension to Brexit,” he said, adding current rules would likely continue beyond March next year.\n“They are going to find a solution to Open Skies, but it will take a bit longer.”\nReporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:25:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
