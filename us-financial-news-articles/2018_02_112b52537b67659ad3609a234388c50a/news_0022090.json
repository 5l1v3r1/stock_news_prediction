Short game needed some adjustment,” the 33-year-old said after clinching his third victory in 207 starts on the PGA Tour. “We’re just building. I’ve still got some work to do but I‘m excited where we’re at.” \nFowler’s collapse, meanwhile, hardly dispelled his reputation as a player renowned for struggling to close out the deal, having now converted only one of six 54-hole leads on the PGA Tour into a victory. \nThe popular American was still in contention until late in the round, before three consecutive bogeys from the 15th ended his challenge. \nRahm started the final round one stroke off the lead but never quite recovered from a bogey at the first, shooting 72 to sit alongside Fowler at 12-under. \nThe Spanish world number two won the CareerBuilder Challenge two weeks ago but Sunday marked the second straight week that he has failed to deliver in the final round when sitting near the top of the leaderboard. \nMickelson, meanwhile, remains winless since the 2013 British Open. The five-times major winner made a late challenge with three successive birdies from the 15th, but a double-bogey at the last condemned him to a tie for fifth on 14-under.
