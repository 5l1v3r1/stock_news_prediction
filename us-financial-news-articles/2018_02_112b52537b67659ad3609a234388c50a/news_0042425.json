It was no longer tenable, he said, for the SNCF to go on incurring losses of three billion euros a year.\nCGT chief Martinez said protests were scheduled for March 22 and could turn into a strike movement if the government did not change tack. Other smaller unions have been equally critical and could support strike action that day.\nMartinez said the CGT was proposing extra investment in rail lines neglected in favour of high-speed TGV lines which, while admired by many, have sucked money away from the rest of the network which transports most French people day to day.\nAnother challenge looming for the SNCF is the arrival of EU-wide liberalisation, which will open France’s network to rival rail firms gradually, starting in 2019.\nMartinez accused Macron’s government of seeking to “smash” the public service, adding on public radio station France Inter: “If we’re treated like idiots there’ll be no negotiating with those who treat us like imbeciles.” (Additional reporting by Richard Lough and Yann Le Guernigou; Editing by Peter Graff)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:32:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
