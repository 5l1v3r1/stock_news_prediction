What is most troublesome is to see the world heading to protectionism,” he said.\nNippon Steel’s senior executive also said the company is worried that U.S. trade action could flood Asia with steel products as there is nowhere else for them to go.\n“I don’t know if a U.S. move would really make U.S. steelmakers, steel users and consumers happy,” Kiyoshi Imamura, Managing Director at Tokyo Steel Manufacturing ( 5423.T ), Japan’s top electric-arc furnace steelmaker, said on Monday.\nSome U.S. lawmakers and steel and aluminum users have urged caution in taking any trade actions that could cause disruptions or price spikes in raw materials that are found in everything from autos to appliances and aircraft and construction.\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T12:15:46.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
