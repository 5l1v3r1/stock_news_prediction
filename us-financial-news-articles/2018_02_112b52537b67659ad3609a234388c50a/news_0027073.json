REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nThe reigning world champions and three-time Olympic medallists dazzled with an impressive midline step sequence that earned them 80.51 points. \nAmerican brother and sister Maia and Alex Shibutani’s energetic performance that included smooth twizzles and an impressive rotational lift, finished second with 75.46 points. \n“It was our strongest performance that we were looking to put out, I think we made a lot of big steps coming out of Nationals,” Alex told reporters, referring to the U.S. competition last month. \n“The programme felt great. We went out there with a job and we’re very happy that we did it,” he said, although he added they were a little disappointed at their score. \nEkaterina Bobrova and Dmitri Soloviev, part of the Russian team that won gold at the 2014 Sochi Games, were third with 74.76 points. \n“We had trouble with our rumba,” Soloviev told reporters. “Of course we’re disappointed because we worked on this element more than on the others.” \nThe first day of the team competition, which included the men’s and pairs short programmes, were marked by falls by Canada’s Patrick Chan and American jumping ace Nathan Chen, although the overall team scores were lifted by the later pairs results. \nOnly the top five teams, Canada, the OAR, the U.S., Japan and Italy, have advanced to the free section of the competition. \nThe final rounds of the event take place on Monday.
