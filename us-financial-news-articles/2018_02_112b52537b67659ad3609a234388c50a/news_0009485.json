Atlantic Records had no immediate comment. \nCymple Man, whose given name is Dustin Bennett, said he had given Khalifa a demo of his song “Most of Us” in April 2012 at Salt Lake City International Airport, while both were traveling to performances, so Khalifa could decide whether they should collaborate. \nKhalifa never followed up, but he incorporated some lyrics, the refrain and the chorus of the plaintiff’s song into his own song without permission or paying royalties, the complaint said. \n“Moreover, Khalifa utilizes the term ‘most of us’ to introduce the audience to the same theme of sinful behavior with the same expression” in a manner “distinctively original to Bennett’s work,” the complaint said. \nThe plaintiff, who lives in southeastern Georgia, said he had copyrighted his song in March 2010, and that the defendants have refused to enter any licensing or royalty agreement. \nHe is seeking unspecified damages, including profits from the alleged infringement. \nKhalifa, whose given name is Cameron Thomaz, included “Most of Us” on the 2016 album “Khalifa,” which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 list of popular U.S. albums. \nThe song has also received more than 30 million views on Google’s YouTube. \nThe case is Bennett v. Thomaz et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-00922.
