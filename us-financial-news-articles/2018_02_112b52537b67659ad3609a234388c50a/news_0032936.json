Inoges in Germany has been consolidated since 1 st January 2018.\n2017: revenue growth of 10.5%\nIn 2017, 15 years on from its IPO, ORPEA reported revenue above its guidance at €3,138 million. It represents a substantial increase of 10.5%, or close to €300 million in additional revenue. This solid performance, consistent over the past 15 years, was again driven by a combination of:\na healthy organic growth of 5.4%, underpinned by the excellent performance of mature facilities, the ramp-up in facilities opened over the past two years and the opening of 1,900 new beds (through new builds and restructuration) during the year, a dynamic external growth, leading to the acquisitions of Anavita in the Czech Republic, Dr. Dr. Wagner in Austria, Spitex in Switzerland and independent facilities.\nThe international business again strongly contributed to revenue growth. In only three years, revenue generated outside France tripled from €450 million in 2014 to over €1.35 billion in 2017, representing an average annual growth rate of 45%.\nIn 2017, this fast-paced business development and growth went hand in hand with increasing profitability.\n2018: sustained momentum in opening new beds (2,500) and job creation\nIn 2018, ORPEA will open another new 2,500 beds, including 85% outside France, representing approximately 20 facilities and extensions. In line with ORPEA’s longstanding strategy, these facilities located in areas with strong purchasing power, including Europe’s major cities, such as Paris (16 th arrondissement), Prague, Berlin, Milan, Zurich and Veyrier, will meet the highest standards of care and service quality.\nORPEA again expects a year of active recruitment and job creation thanks to the ongoing opening of new facilities and strengthening of organisational management. Close to 2,000 new jobs will be created in Europe, including approximately 400 in France. Most of these jobs are sustainable and cannot be transferred abroad. They offer substantial career opportunities as a result of the Group’s ambitious training policy with the creation, in particular, of many diplomas in partnership with renowned universities.\nOutlook for 2018: revenue target of €3,400 million\nFor 2018, ORPEA securely forecasts revenues of €3,400 million, an increase of 8.3% driven by a consistent solid organic growth and acquisitions. The Group is looking at a number of selective acquisition opportunities in several countries.\nYves Le Masne, Chief Executive Officer of ORPEA, concluded by saying:\n“Building on the commitment of our employees to deliver high-quality services worldwide, our loyal management team and our sound financial flexibility, we will continue to deliver profitable growth in 2018: selective acquisitions, revenue of €3,400 million already secured, and robust profitability, with an EBITDA margin (as a % of revenue) equal to or above its 2017 level.\nOur tremendous potential for creating value comes from:\nthe significant additions to our growing pipeline of beds under construction and redevelopment, which will fuel our organic growth in the future, our numerous attractive acquisition projects, an organisation and information system geared for international expansion.\nWe are now in a remarkably good position and are uniquely placed to accelerate our international expansion and become the world leader in long-term care.\nFinancial reporting schedule for 2018\nThe following dates can be subject to change.

The year-on-year change in the revenues of existing facilities as a result of changes in their occupancy rates and daily rates; 2. The year-on-year change in the revenues of redeveloped facilities or those where the capacity has been increased in the current or year-earlier period; 3. Revenues generated in the current period by facilities created in the current or year-earlier period, and the change in revenues at recently acquired facilities by comparison with the previous equivalent period.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180213006180/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nORPEA\nYves Le Masne\nChief Executive Officer\nSteve Grobet, Tel.: +33 (0)1 47 75 74 66\nInvestor Relations\ns.grobet@orpea.net\nor\nInvestor and Media Relations:\nNewCap\nDusan Oresansky/Nicolas Merigeau, Tel.: +33 (0)1 44 71 94 94\norpea@newcap.eu\nSource: ORPEA", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.orpea-corp.com&esheet=51758079&newsitemid=20180213006180&lan=en-US&anchor=www.orpea-corp.com&index=1&md5=566077d1965491dd80fb2ee8dee06517", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180213006180/en/"], "published": "2018-02-13T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T21:41:49.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
