This is a $0.06 per share increase over the 2017 rate. The dividend is payable on March 10, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 15, 2018.\nThe corporation expects 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $1.80 to $1.95.\n1 This release includes measures of financial performance and presentations of financial information that are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management believes that presenting consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share and net income by segment on a Non-GAAP basis by excluding the impact of the 2017 tax reform tax rate reduction on deferred tax values from consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share and net income by segment will assist investors in making an evaluation of our performance against prior periods on a comparable basis. Management understands that there are material limitations on the use of non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for GAAP measures for the purpose of analyzing financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results, which have been determined and provided in accordance with GAAP.\nCEO Overview\n“Our dedicated employees again proved to be our strongest asset as they delivered 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.81,” said President and CEO Chuck MacFarlane. “These excellent results include a positive $0.09 per diluted share estimated impact from our Plastics segment’s response to hurricane-related market dynamics.\n“Our results also include a reduction of $0.05 per diluted share from a change in value of net deferred tax assets related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. This reduction from the new tax law was not contemplated when we updated our 2017 diluted earnings per share guidance to $1.75 - $1.85. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share before the tax impact was $1.86.\n“Operationally, Otter Tail Power Company continued its strong performance, equaling 2016 for its lowest number of OSHA recordable injuries on record and continuing high customer satisfaction scores as measured by J.D. Power and Associates.\n“Otter Tail Power Company also made excellent progress on two key growth projects in 2017: Big Stone South-Brookings and Big Stone South-Ellendale, two 345 kilovolt transmission projects that the Midcontinent Independent System Operator has designated as Multi-Value Projects. We are a 50 percent owner in both projects. The Big Stone South-Brookings project was completed in September on time and under budget. The Big Stone South-Ellendale project, which Otter Tail Power Company manages, is scheduled for completion in 2019. Otter Tail expects its investment in the two projects to be approximately $200 million.\n“Looking forward, Otter Tail Power Company has a strong rate base growth plan driven by our renewable energy and natural gas generation projects. Both projects made good progress in their development in 2017. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved our resource plan and the North Dakota Public Service Commission granted Advance Determinations of Prudence for the Merricourt wind and Astoria natural gas-fired generation projects. Overall, Otter Tail Power Company plans to spend approximately $901 million on capital projects from 2018 through 2022, including these investments in renewable energy, natural gas-fired generation and regional transmission projects.\n“Tax reform will benefit Otter Tail Power Company’s rate base growth. Prior to tax reform, we were forecasting a 7.2 percent compound annual growth rate between 2016 and 2021. With tax reform we are projecting this will move to 9.0 percent for the timeframe 2017 through 2022.\n“Also important is a positive outcome in the rate case Otter Tail Power Company filed with the North Dakota Public Service Commission in November, seeking permission to increase non-fuel base rates by approximately $13 million, or 8.72 percent. The North Dakota Public Service Commission granted an 8.64 percent interim rate increase beginning January 1, 2018, while it considers the overall request. We expect an adjustment related to tax reform legislation and a final determination by the end of this year.\n“Business conditions are showing signs of improvement for our manufacturing companies.\n“BTD Manufacturing, our custom metal fabricator, achieved year-over-year net earnings improvement. The company’s customer base in agriculture, energy, and recreational utility vehicles has begun to show economic recovery.\n“T. O. Plastics, our plastics thermoforming manufacturer, achieved 8 percent overall revenue growth from increased sales through deeper penetration into its primary market, horticulture containers, and a renewed focus on the life sciences market.\n“Northern Pipe Products and Vinyltech, our PVC pipe manufacturing companies, sold more pounds and earned higher margins, partly due to the previously mentioned hurricane-related market dynamics, which we do not expect to repeat in 2018. But general market conditions for PVC pipe also improved, and our pipe manufacturers are efficient, low cost operators.\n“Our strategic initiatives to grow our businesses, achieve operational and commercial excellence, and develop our talent are strengthening our position in the markets we serve. We remain confident in our ability to grow earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of 4 to 7 percent compounded annually from $1.81 in 2017, the base year.”\nCash Flow from Operations and Liquidity\nThe corporation’s consolidated net cash provided by continuing operations in 2017 was $173.6 million compared with $163.5 million in 2016. The $10.1 million increase in cash provided by continuing operations between the years includes a $10.1 million increase in net income from continuing operations and a $10.0 million reduction in discretionary contributions to our pension plan. Changes in long-term assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, totaling $17.4 million were more than offset by a $27.0 million increase in cash used for working capital items. The increase in cash used for working capital between the periods is primarily due to a $19.1 million increase in cash used for payables and other current liabilities between the years at Otter Tail Power Company related to the timing of payments as cash use decreased $10.3 million in 2016 compared to an increase of $8.8 million in cash used for payables and other current liabilities in 2017. Cash used for inventories increased $6.2 million between the years primarily due to increased levels of inventory in each of our business segments.\nThe following table presents the status of our lines of credit as of December 31, 2017:\n(in thousands) Line Limit In Use On\nDecember 31,\n2017 Restricted due to\nOutstanding\nLetters of Credit Available on\nDecember 31,\n2017 Available on\nDecember 31,\n2016 Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement $ 130,000 $ -- $ -- $ 130,000 $ 130,000 Otter Tail Power Company Credit Agreement 170,000 112,371 300 57,329 127,067 Total $ 300,000 $ 112,371 $ 300 $ 187,329 $ 257,067 On October 31, 2017 both the Otter Tail Corporation and the Otter Tail Power Company Credit Agreements were amended to extend the expiration dates by one year from October 29, 2021 to October 31, 2022.\nOn November 14, 2017 Otter Tail Power Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which it agreed to issue to the purchasers, in a private placement transaction, $100 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.07% Series 2018A Senior Unsecured Notes due February 7, 2048 (the 2018 Notes). The 2018 Notes were issued on February 7, 2018. Proceeds from the 2018 Notes were used to repay $100 million in outstanding borrowings under the Otter Tail Power Company Credit Agreement. The borrowings under the Otter Tail Power Credit Agreement were used to retire its $33.0 million in 5.95% Senior Unsecured Series A Notes at maturity on August 20, 2017 and to finance portions of its investments in the Big Stone South-Brookings and Big Stone South-Ellendale, 345-kilovolt transmission projects.\n2017 Segment Performance Summary\nElectric\n($s in thousands) 2017 2016 Change % Change Retail Electric Revenues $ 374,931 $ 376,610 $ (1,679 ) (0.4 ) Wholesale Electric Revenues 5,173 4,584 589 12.8 Other Electric Revenues 54,433 46,189 8,244 17.8 Total Electric Revenues $ 434,537 $ 427,383 $ 7,154 1.7 Net Income before Impact of Tax Reform 1 $ 49,904 $ 49,829 $ 75 0.2 Impact of Tax Reform (458 ) -- (458 ) -- Net Income $ 49,446 $ 49,829 $ (383 ) (0.8 ) Heating Degree Days 5,931 5,314 617 11.6 Cooling Degree Days 380 451 (71 ) (15.7 ) The following table shows heating and cooling degree days as a percent of normal:\n2017 2016 Heating Degree Days 93.9% 84.1% Cooling Degree Days 82.1% 97.4% The following table summarizes the estimated effect on diluted earnings per share of the difference in retail kilowatt-hour (kwh) sales under actual weather conditions and expected retail kwh sales under normal weather conditions in 2017 and 2016 and between the years:\n2017 vs Normal 2016 vs Normal 2017 vs 2016 Effect on Diluted Earnings Per Share $(0.04) $(0.07) $ 0.03 Retail electric revenues decreased $1.7 million as a result of:\nA $5.3 million increase in retail revenue related to the recovery of increased fuel and purchased power costs due to a 1.4% increase in kwhs sold and a 4.8% increase in fuel and purchased power costs per kwh.\nA $4.2 million increase in Minnesota base rate revenue mainly due to the transfer of recovery of environmental and transmission costs and investments from riders to base rates.\nA $2.0 million increase in revenues due to increased consumption related to colder weather in 2017 reflected in the 11.6% increase in heating degree days between the years.\nA $1.0 million increase in North Dakota Transmission Cost Recovery (TCR) rider revenues as a result of increased investment in transmission assets qualifying for revenue recovery through the TCR rider.\noffset by:\nA $7.1 million reduction in Minnesota Environmental Cost Recovery (ECR) rider and TCR rider revenues due to the transfer of qualifying costs from rider recovery into base rates, and due to declining revenue requirements related to lower asset values due to accumulated depreciation. Additionally, a lower return on equity in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) transmission tariff related to complaints currently under judicial review resulted in lower TCR revenues in Minnesota.\nA $3.7 million decrease in Minnesota Conservation Improvement Program (MNCIP) incentive and cost recovery revenues related to a $2.5 million reduction in incentives earned due to lower incentive rates and a $1.2 million reduction in spending on MNCIP programs. In 2017 Otter Tail Power Company began operating under a new MNCIP program that was authorized by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. This new program lowered the incentive payout by 50% in 2017. The $1.2 million reduction in spending was due to a delay in regulatory approval for the implementation of an LED streetlight project.\nA $1.9 million decrease in revenue due to a change in estimate that reduced unbilled revenues.\nA $1.5 million decrease in North Dakota and South Dakota ECR rider revenues resulting from lower values on qualifying assets due to accumulated depreciation.\nA $0.6 million increase in revenue from wholesale electric sales from company-owned generation was mostly offset by a $0.4 million increase in fuel costs for wholesale generation.\nOther electric revenues increased $8.2 million as a result of:\nA $7.8 million increase in MISO transmission tariff revenues, mainly driven by increased investment in regional transmission lines and revenues earned from the use of those lines by other electric service providers.\nA $0.4 million increase in other revenues, mainly steam sales at Big Stone Plant.\nProduction fuel costs increased $4.9 million as a result of a 4.0% increase in kwhs generated. This was due to increased generation from Coyote Station and Hoot Lake Plant because of Coyote Station’s greater availability, increased demand due to colder weather in 2017 and higher market prices for electricity that resulted in increased dispatch of Hoot Lake Plant.\nThe cost of purchased power to serve retail customers increased $1.6 million despite a 3.4% decrease in kwhs purchased. This was a result of higher market prices for electricity driven by increased demand in 2017 due, in part, to colder weather in 2017 than in 2016.\nElectric operating and maintenance expenses increased $0.1 million as a result of:\nA $3.2 million increase in labor and benefit costs due to increased wages and higher medical benefit payments.\noffset by:\nA $1.2 million decrease in transmission expenditures to independent system operators in 2017.\nA $1.2 million decrease in MNCIP expenditures due to a delay in regulatory approval of an LED streetlight project planned for 2017.\nA $0.7 million net reduction in other operating expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.5 million due to lower depreciation rates.\nProperty tax expense increased $0.8 million mainly due to transmission line additions in South Dakota related to the construction of the Big Stone South-Ellendale and Big Stone South-Brookings 345-kV transmission projects.\nElectric segment income tax expenses increased $0.6 million, mainly due to $0.5 million in tax expense resulting from the effect of tax reform on deferred taxes on a portion of supplemental retirement program costs not subject to rate recovery.\nManufacturing\n(in thousands) 2017 2016 Change % Change Operating Revenues $ 229,738 $ 221,289 $ 8,449 3.8 Net Income before Impact of Tax Reform 1 $ 8,413 $ 5,694 $ 2,719 47.8 Impact of Tax Reform 2,637 -- 2,637 -- Net Income $ 11,050 $ 5,694 $ 5,356 94.1 At BTD Manufacturing, Inc. (BTD), revenues increased $5.9 million. This is due to a $3.3 million increase in product sales to manufacturers of recreational and lawn and garden equipment from BTD’s Minnesota and Georgia manufacturing facilities offset by lower sales in the energy end-use market at the Illinois facility. Scrap revenues increased $2.6 million due to higher volume and higher scrap-metal prices. Cost of products sold increased $2.3 million and operating expenses increased $1.8 million between the years. Collectively, these items resulted in improved operating margins of $1.9 million in 2017 compared with 2016. A $1.4 million decrease in interest expense as a result of the December 2016 refinancing of long-term debt at lower interest rates was mostly offset by a $1.0 million increase in income tax expense. This resulted in a $2.3 million increase in year-over-year income at BTD before recording the effects of $2.6 million in tax savings related to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities as a result of lower tax rates from tax reform.\nAt T.O. Plastics, Inc. (T.O. Plastics), revenues increased $2.5 million, including increases of $1.3 million from sales of life science products, $1.0 million from sales of horticultural products and $0.2 million from sales of industrial products. Costs of products sold increased $2.4 million due to the increase in sales while operating expenses decreased $0.1 million. Depreciation expense was down $0.3 million due to certain assets reaching the ends of their depreciable lives in 2017. A $0.3 million decrease in interest expense as a result of the December 2016 refinancing of long-term debt at lower interest rates was more than offset by a $0.4 million increase in income tax expense related to a $0.8 million increase in income before income taxes, resulting in a $0.4 million increase in year-over-year income at T.O. Plastics.\nPlastics\n(in thousands) 2017 2016 Change % Change Operating Revenues $ 185,132 $ 154,901 $ 30,231 19.5 Net Income before Impact of Tax Reform 1 $ 18,433 $ 10,628 $ 7,805 73.4 Impact of Tax Reform 3,263 -- 3,263 -- Net Income $ 21,696 $ 10,628 $ 11,068 104.1 Plastics segment revenues and net income increased $30.2 million and $11.1 million, respectively, as a result of a 7.2% increase in pounds of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe sold and an 11.5% increase in PVC pipe prices between the years. Cost of products sold increased $16.6 million due to the increase in sales volume and a 5.9% increase in the cost per pound of pipe sold. Year-over-year improvement in our normal business operations provided approximately $4.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, of the segment’s increase in net income. The remaining increase in net income and earnings per diluted share is due to two items. First, increased sales and pricing were affected by hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, where the major U.S. resin production plants are located. Major resin suppliers shut down production facilities which impacted raw material availability. Distributors and contractors became concerned about pipe availability. This accelerated pipe demand and created positive sales price pressure in the market. Even though hurricanes impacted raw material availability, our pipe companies had sufficient raw materials to run their plants and meet the additional demand. The impact of Hurricane Harvey on 2017 net income and diluted earnings per share is estimated to be $3.4 million and $0.09, respectively. Second, the Plastics segment recorded $3.3 million in tax savings, $0.08 in diluted earnings per share, related to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities as a result of lower tax rates from tax reform.\nCorporate\n(in thousands) 2017 2016 Change % Change Net Loss $ (10,073 ) $ (4,114 ) $ (5,959 ) 144.8 Add back: Impact of Tax Reform (7,198 ) -- (7,198 ) -- Net Loss (net-of-tax) before Impact of Tax Reform 1 $ (2,875 ) $ (4,114 ) $ 1,239 (30.1 ) Corporate costs net-of-tax before impact of tax reform 1 decreased $1.2 million between the years mainly due to a $0.7 million excess tax benefit related to the accounting treatment of stock-based performance awards, a $0.3 million net-of-tax increase in the level of corporate costs allocated to the corporation’s operating companies and a $0.3 million reduction in labor costs due to a reduction in the number of corporate employees.

Plastics segment net income before the impact of tax reform 1 increased $2.6 million due to a 26.2% increase in revenue per pound of PVC pipe sold, offset by a 4.3% decrease in pounds of pipe sold. The increase in PVC pipe prices was partially offset by an 11.1% increase in the cost per pound of pipe sold. Pipe prices were up at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017 due to increased demand resulting from third quarter 2017 hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Cost of goods sold increased $1.5 million as a result of higher resin prices. Operating expenses increased $1.3 million, mainly due to increased incentives earned related to 2017 financial performance.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing segment net income increased $4.7 million, which includes a $2.6 million reduction in income tax expense at BTD due to tax reform. Manufacturing segment net income before the impact of tax reform 1 increased $2.1 million between the quarters due to improved quarter over quarter performance at BTD. Revenues at BTD increased $6.4 million due to increased product sales in Minnesota and Georgia to manufacturers of recreational and lawn and garden equipment and also due to $0.7 million in increased scrap revenues related to increased volume and higher scrap-metal prices. Net income at BTD before the impact of tax reform 1 increased $2.4 million as a result of increased sales volume, while net income at T.O. Plastics decreased $0.3 million.\nElectric\nElectric segment net income decreased $2.7 million, which includes a $0.5 million increase in income tax expense due to tax reform. Electric segment net income before the impact of tax reform 1 decreased $2.3 million between the quarters. Operating revenues decreased $3.4 million as a result of the following:\nA $3.5 million increase in MISO transmission tariff revenues driven by increased investment in regional transmission lines and revenues earned from the use of those lines by other electric service providers.\nA $1.6 million increase in retail revenues due to colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nA $0.8 million increase in retail revenues due to increases in residential and industrial kwh sales.\nA $0.5 million increase in other electric revenues, mainly steam sales at Big Stone Plant.\nA $0.4 million increase in revenue from a 27.4% increase in wholesale kwh sales.\noffset by\nA $6.3 million decrease in retail revenues due to a change in estimate that reduced unbilled revenues by $1.9 million and a reduction in revenue related to the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs of $4.4 million.\nA $2.7 million decrease in MNCIP incentive and cost recovery revenues related to a $1.7 million reduction in incentives earned due to lower incentive rates and a $1.0 million reduction in spending on MNCIP programs.\nA $1.3 million decrease in net revenue due to receiving higher interim rates in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with revenue under final rates that went into effect in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFuel and purchased power costs to serve retail customers decreased $3.8 million, mainly as a result of a reduction in kwhs purchased, while fuel costs for wholesale sales increased $0.4 million as a result of the increase in wholesale kwh sales.\nElectric segment operating expenses increased $2.8 million, including:\nA $1.1 million increase in medical insurance costs.\nA $0.7 million increase in material and supply costs.\nA $0.5 million increase in transmission service expenses.\nA $0.3 million increase in property tax expense mainly due to transmission asset additions in South Dakota related to the construction of the Big Stone South-Ellendale and Big Stone South-Brookings 345 kV transmission projects.\nA $1.0 million decrease in MNCIP costs offset by $1.0 million increase in various other expenses, including rate-case-related expenses.\nCorporate\nCorporate net losses increased by $7.2 million. The entire increase in net losses resulted from a $7.2 million increase in income tax expense due to tax reform.\nTax Reform\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities were reduced in value as a result of the tax rate reduction included in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

This guidance reflects the current mix of businesses we own, strategies for improving future operating results, the cyclical nature of some of our businesses, and current regulatory factors and economic challenges facing our Electric, Manufacturing and Plastics segments. Due to the tax rate reduction in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we expect 2018 earnings for our Manufacturing and Plastics segments to be positively impacted by $0.09 per share offset by $0.04 per share in our corporate cost center. We expect capital expenditures for 2018 to be $110 million compared with actual cash used for capital expenditures of $133 million in 2017. Our planned expenditures for 2018 include $33 million for the Big Stone South-Ellendale transmission line project, which positively impacts earnings by providing an immediate return on invested funds through rider recovery mechanisms.\nSegment components of our 2018 earnings per share guidance range compared with 2017 actual earnings are as follows:\n2017 EPS by Segment 2018 EPS Guidance GAAP-\nBasis Impact of\nTax Reform Before Impact\nof Tax Reform 1 Low High Electric $1.24 $0.02 $1.26 $1.34 $1.37 Manufacturing $0.28 ($0.07) $0.21 $0.26 $0.30 Plastics $0.54 ($0.08) $0.46 $0.36 $0.40 Corporate ($0.25) $0.18 ($0.07) ($0.16) ($0.12) Total – Continuing Operations $1.81 $0.05 $1.86 $1.80 $1.95 Return on Equity 10.6% 10.8% 10.1% 10.9% Contributing to our earnings guidance for 2018 are the following items:\n• We expect 2018 Electric segment net income to be higher than 2017 segment net income based on:\nNormal weather for 2018. Milder than normal weather in 2017 negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by an estimated $0.04 compared to normal.\nConstructive outcome of a rate case filed in North Dakota on November 2, 2017 with a full year of increased interim rates in 2018. Our ability to obtain final rates similar to interim rates and reasonable rates of return depends on regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations. We expect the effects of any reduction in interim or final rates as a result of lower tax rates in the new tax law to be offset by lower tax expenses. We cannot provide assurance our interim rates will become final.\nIncrease in transmission investments and other revenues.\noffset by:\nIncreased operating and maintenance expenses due to a planned maintenance outage at our Big Stone Plant of $0.05 per share and $0.09 for increasing costs of pension, medical, workers compensation and retiree medical benefits. The increase in pension costs is a result of a decrease in the discount rate from 4.60% to 3.90%.\nHigher depreciation and property tax expense due to large capital projects being put into service.\nIncreased interest expense related to replacing short-term debt at an average annual rate of 2.4% with long-term debt at rate of 4.07% along with an increase in combined short-term and long-term borrowings to finance a portion of 2018 planned capital expenditures.\n• We expect 2018 net income from our Manufacturing segment to increase over 2017 based on the following:\nSales at BTD Manufacturing are expected to be flat year over year, however, earnings are expected to improve based on stronger year-over-year operating margins achieved through cost reductions and improved productivity.\nAn increase in earnings from T.O. Plastics mainly driven by year-over-year sales growth in our horticulture, life science and industrial markets.\nLower income taxes of approximately $0.04 per share as a result of the lower federal tax rates implemented as part of the new tax law.\nBacklog for the manufacturing companies of approximately $166 million for 2018 compared with $118 million one year ago.\n• We expect 2018 net income from the Plastics segment to be lower than 2017 because 2017 results included sales driven by customer reaction to the hurricanes that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. This had an estimated impact on earnings of $0.09 per diluted share in 2017. We also expect lower operating margins in 2018 due to lower expected sales prices and increasing resin prices on similar sales volumes in 2018 compared to 2017 excluding the effect of the hurricanes on 2017 sales. Plastics net income for 2018 will be positively affected by lower effective tax rates in 2018 as a result of the new tax law.\n• Corporate costs, net of tax, are expected to be higher in 2018 than in 2017 when excluding the effect of tax reform on 2017 net losses in the corporate cost center. The higher net-of-tax costs expected in 2018 are due, in part, to the lower tax rate that will be in effect in 2018.\nThe impact of 2017 tax reform legislation on future results is based on reasonable estimates reflecting the anticipated impact of tax reform, and is subject to adjustment upon obtaining additional information or to reflect future changes resulting from future legislation, rules, regulations or interpretations impacting tax reform. We will continue to analyze the impact of the 2017 tax reform legislation to assess the full effects on our future business and results.\nThe following table shows our 2017 capital expenditures and 2018 through 2022 anticipated capital expenditures and electric utility average rate base:\n(in millions) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Total Capital Expenditures: Electric Segment: Renewables and Natural Gas Generation $ 1 $ 308 $ 102 $ 50 $ 1 $ 462 Transformative Technology and Infrastructure -- 22 32 43 39 136 Transmission 45 12 9 7 7 80 Other 49 40 42 45 47 223 Total Electric Segment $ 119 $ 95 $ 382 $ 185 $ 145 $ 94 $ 901 Manufacturing and Plastics Segments 14 15 14 15 14 14 72 Total Capital Expenditures $ 133 $ 110 $ 396 $ 200 $ 159 $ 108 $ 973 Total Electric Utility Average Rate Base $ 1,055 $ 1,091 $ 1,297 $ 1,480 $ 1,568 $ 1,625 The consolidated capital expenditure plan for the 2018-2022 time period calls for $973 million based on the need for additional wind and solar in rate base and capital spending for Astoria Station, a natural gas-fired plant that is expected to replace Hoot Lake Plant when it is retired in 2021. Given the increased capital expenditure plan, our compounded annual growth rate in rate base is projected to be 9.0% over the 2017 to 2022 timeframe.\nExecution on the currently anticipated electric utility capital expenditure plan is expected to grow rate base and be a key driver in increasing utility earnings over the 2018 through 2022 timeframe.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nThe corporation will host a live webcast on Tuesday, February 13, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. CT to discuss its financial and operating performance.\nThe presentation will be posted on our website before the webcast.

Although we believe our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ materially from those expectations. The following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements:\nFederal and state environmental regulation could require us to incur substantial capital expenditures and increased operating costs.\nVolatile financial markets and changes in our debt ratings could restrict our ability to access capital and increase borrowing costs and pension plan and postretirement health care expenses.\nWe rely on access to both short- and long-term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations. If we are unable to access capital at competitive rates, our ability to implement our business plans may be adversely affected.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets can also adversely impact our results of operations, the ability of customers to finance purchases of goods and services, and our financial condition, as well as exert downward pressure on stock prices and/or limit our ability to sustain our current common stock dividend level.\nWe could be required to contribute additional capital to the pension plan in the future if the market value of pension plan assets significantly declines, plan assets do not earn in line with our long-term rate of return assumptions or relief under the Pension Protection Act is no longer granted.\nAny significant impairment of our goodwill would cause a decrease in our asset values and a reduction in our net operating income.\nDeclines in projected operating cash flows at BTD or the Plastics segment may result in goodwill impairments that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position, as well as financing agreement covenants.\nThe inability of our subsidiaries to provide sufficient earnings and cash flows to allow us to meet our financial obligations and debt covenants and pay dividends to our shareholders could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe rely on our information systems to conduct our business and failure to protect these systems against security breaches or cyber-attacks could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nEconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.\nIf we are unable to achieve the organic growth we expect, our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nOur plans to grow and realign our business mix through capital projects, acquisitions and dispositions may not be successful, which could result in poor financial performance.\nWe may, from time to time, sell assets to provide capital to fund investments in our electric utility business or for other corporate purposes, which could result in the recognition of a loss on the sale of any assets sold and other potential liabilities. The sale of any of our businesses could expose us to additional risks associated with indemnification obligations under the applicable sales agreements and any related disputes.\nSignificant warranty claims and remediation costs in excess of amounts normally reserved for such items could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with energy markets.\nChanges in tax laws, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFour of our operating companies have single customers that provide a significant portion of the individual operating company’s and the business segment’s revenue. The loss of, or significant reduction in revenue from, any one of these customers would have a significant negative financial impact on the operating company and its business segment, and could have a significant negative financial impact on us.\nWe may experience fluctuations in revenues and expenses related to our electric operations, which may cause our financial results to fluctuate and could impair our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or scheduled payments on our debt obligations, or to meet covenants under our borrowing agreements.\nActions by the regulators of our electric operations could result in rate reductions, lower revenues and earnings or delays in recovering capital expenditures.\nOtter Tail Power Company’s operations are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework under federal and state laws as well as regulations imposed by other organizations that may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nOtter Tail Power Company’s electric transmission and generation facilities could be vulnerable to cyber and physical attack that could impair its ability to provide electrical service to its customers or disrupt the U.S. bulk power system.\nOtter Tail Power Company’s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.\nChanges to regulation of generating plant emissions, including but not limited to carbon dioxide emissions, could affect our operating costs and the costs of supplying electricity to our customers.\nCompetition from foreign and domestic manufacturers, the price and availability of raw materials, prices and supply of scrap or recyclable material and general economic conditions could affect the revenues and earnings of our manufacturing businesses.\nOur plastics operations are highly dependent on a limited number of vendors for PVC resin and a limited supply of resin. The loss of a key vendor, or any interruption or delay in the supply of PVC resin, could result in reduced sales or increased costs for this segment.\nWe compete against a large number of other manufacturers of PVC pipe and manufacturers of alternative products. Customers may not distinguish the pipe companies’ products from those of our competitors.\nChanges in PVC resin prices can negatively affect our plastics business.\nFor a further discussion of other risk factors and cautionary statements, refer to reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout The Corporation: Otter Tail Corporation has interests in diversified operations that include an electric utility and manufacturing businesses.
