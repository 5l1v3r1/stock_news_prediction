There had been some cases were when some foreign companies have purchased properties that hadn’t even been on the market,” said a source familiar with the thinking of Treasurer Scott Morrison.\nAustralia introduced a register of foreign ownership of agricultural land in 2015. Its latest report showed agricultural land held by Chinese interests grew tenfold in 2017, making China the second-biggest foreign owner of farmland behind the United Kingdom. Total foreign-owned farmland shrunk to 13.6 percent of total farmland, from 14.1 percent a year earlier.\nThe government also cut the threshold at which foreign buyers of farmland must seek regulatory approval to A$15 million from A$252 million.\nMatt Dalgleish, analyst at agricultural research company Mecardo, said locals still owned the vast amount of agricultural land in Australia.\n“This announcement will appeal to voters that have moved their support to parties such as Pauline Hanson’s One Nation,” said Dalgleish.\nENERGY GRID CHANGES The government said on Thursday that all future applications to sell electricity transmission and distribution assets will attract ownership restrictions or conditions for foreign buyers.\n“Electricity distribution and transmission infrastructure are critical national assets and a key national security safeguard is the diversity of ownership of these assets,” Morrison and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said in a joint statement.\nNo major Australian electricity grids are currently for sale. The grids of the country’s two biggest states are already privatised, and planned sales of the next two biggest states’ grids were cancelled amid vocal public opposition.\n$1 = 1.2415 Australian dollars Reporting by Byron Kaye and Colin Packham; Editing by Richard Chang and Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T01:48:47.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
