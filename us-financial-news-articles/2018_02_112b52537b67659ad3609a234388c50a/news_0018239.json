REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nSouth Korea earlier this year said the agreement failed to meet victims’ needs and called for more steps, but Japan insists the agreement should not be changed. \n“The Japan-South Korea agreement is one that finally and irreversibly resolves (the issue). It is a promise between the two countries and the foundation of our bilateral ties,” Abe told reporters after meeting Moon in Pyeongchang, where he will attend the opening of the Winter Olympic Games. Slideshow (4 Images) \nAbe, whose decision to attend the Games angered some of his conservative backers, has said the agreement will not be altered “by even one millimetre”. \nMoon, speaking at the start of the talks, also said he wanted to create a firm basis for forward-looking ties in his “frank” talks with the Japanese leader. \nAbe said he had confirmed with Moon the need to maintain strong pressure on North Korea to get it to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes, reiterating Tokyo’s stance that “talk for the sake of talk is pointless”. \nA North-South Olympics detente has raised concerns in Washington and Tokyo that Seoul may ease up on the “maximum pressure” campaign by the United States and its allies to rein in North Korea.
