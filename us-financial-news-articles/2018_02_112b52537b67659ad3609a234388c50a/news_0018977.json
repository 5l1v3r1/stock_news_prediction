It took me until my third Olympics how to figure out how to deal with the pressure,” said Vonn who made her Olympic debut as a 17-year-old, racing in the combined event, at Salt Lake in 2002.

REUTERS/Michael Dalder \nVonn says she has slowly learnt how to handle the pressure and high expectations that arrive with every Olympics. \n“I think in my second Olympics in Turin, I put more pressure on myself than anyone put on me. I am just going to lay it all out there,” she said. \nVonn has had her share of injuries in her career, including the knee operation that kept her out of Sochi but she says she is in good shape now - even if she has to incorporate maintenance work into her regular training.

Then I have to bike, I have to stretch, I have to do all these extra steps that I didn’t have to do before,” she said. \n“In 2010 I was a much healthier athlete but in 2018 I am a much stronger athlete. Not just physically but also mentally. I have overcome a lot. I know what I am capable of and I can handle myself better than I did,” she said. \nThe speed specialist, who will not compete in Giant Slalom, wants to ensure that she takes full advantage of her fourth Games. \n“This is probably my last Olympics, I am soaking in every moment, I am still in awe of being able to represent my country,” she said. \n“I’ve had a lot of ups and downs since Vancouver but I feel like I am coming into these Olympics on a hot streak, I am skiing exceptionally well and I have a lot of confidence”.
