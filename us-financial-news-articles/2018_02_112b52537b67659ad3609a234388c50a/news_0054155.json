It was just perfect,” an ecstatic Serwa told reporters after crossing the line ahead of her best friend. “There are no secrets between us because we want each other to succeed and it worked.”\nA silver medal is Phelan’s reward for switching from Alpine skiing after competing at Sochi and she praised Serwa for teaching her the intricacies of ski cross.\n“She is my best friend and is someone who has taught me everything about this sport when I switched from Alpine,” the former slalom skier said.\n“I love Alpine and I definitely miss it but I was made to be a ski cross racer and I proved that today.”\nFreestyle Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Ski Cross Finals - Phoenix Snow Park - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 23, 2018 - Kelsey Serwa of Canada reacts after winning the event. REUTERS/Issei Kato BATTLE FOR BRONZE As the Canadians raced away, a controversial battle was ensuing between Smith and Naesland for third.\nAfter the race, both accused the other of using elbows to gain an unfair advantage, with Naesland distraught at having missed out on a medal.\n“It was an unfair fight I think,” said the Swede, who added that she would be seeking a conversation with Smith once she had cooled down.\nSlideshow (4 Images) “I did the same back also so I wasn’t any better but she started it when I was on the way to passing her.”\n“She put her elbow out and stopped me.”\nSmith argued that it was just part of the sport.\n“It is ski cross. We are not doing Alpine. For sure we pushed but she pushed, I pushed,” the 25-year-old said.\n“We are equal in this fight. We were both there and both did the same. It is what ski cross is.”\nThompson, who qualified in first position coming into the heats, said she was pleased just to be competing at another Olympics after rupturing knee ligaments back in October.\n“I am disappointed with how the race run but I am really proud that I was able to race here and compete for Canada,” the Sochi gold medalist told reporters.\n“That was an accomplishment in itself.”\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T05:09:38.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
