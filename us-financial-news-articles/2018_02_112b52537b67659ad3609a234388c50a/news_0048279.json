Dimon, Costa and Linebarger are members of its board of directors. Last year, the lobbying group brought former George W. Bush White House chief of staff Josh Bolten on board to be president and CEO.\nThe group was outspoken in favor of the GOP tax cuts enacted last year and plans for infrastructure spending but it has pushed back at some other Trump agenda items, including a threat to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nThe executives at the dinner also discussed economic issues important to American business including tax reform, smart regulation across industries, infrastructure and international trade, Jessica Boulanger, the Business Roundtable spokeswoman, told CNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:48:53.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
