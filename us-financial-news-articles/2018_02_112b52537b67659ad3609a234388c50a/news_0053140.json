(the government) had not influenced that deal in any way,” he said.\nBorisov said the country’s energy, financial and anti-trust regulators, as well as the intelligence services, would look closely into the deal, including the origin of the funds for the transaction.\nInercom, part of a group that has activities in construction and solar energy, said it was aware of the social importance of the business it will acquire and pledged to work transparently and responsibly.\n“We have proved that we have the experience and capacity to acquire and manage companies in Bulgaria,” it said.\nInercom also said it planned to make a tender offer to the minority shareholders in CEZ Electro 1CZ.BB and CEZ Razpredelenie 3CZ.BB, once it gets a green light from the Bulgarian anti-trust regulator.\nThe head of the parliament energy commission Delyan Dobrev however questioned the ability of Inercom to manage an energy business with an annual revenue of about 1.8 billion levs ($1.13 billion).\n“Initially it sounded like fake news to me,” Dobrev told NOVA television. “How a company that I have not heard of until yesterday will take over one third of the power distribution network in Bulgaria?” he said.\nThe opposition Socialists criticized the deal, urging the government and the president to take a stand.\nVolen Siderov, one of the leaders of the government’s junior coalition partner, urged the prosecutors and anti-corruption authorities to scrutinize the deal.\nReporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova, editing by David Evans and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:36:10.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
