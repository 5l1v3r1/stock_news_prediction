Nacho Fernandez or Achraf Hakimi will take his place. \n“I don’t know which of the two will play, they are both capable,” Carvajal told reporters. \n”When you play against Neymar there is no recipe to stop him, I just hope that he’s not on his game. \n“There are no favourites in a duel like this. The game is very close. They are clashes that are decided by tiny details. We will try not to make mistakes.” Reporting by Rik Sharma; editing by Clare Lovell", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T17:24:27.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
