Other thorny issues include health reform, labor law and European policy.\nSeehofer insisted that a new coalition must stick to plans limiting additional government spending to 46 billion euros ($57 billion) through to 2021, the basis of a blueprint agreed in exploratory talks last month.\nMembers of parliament vote during a session of German lower house of Parliament, Bundestag, in Berlin, Germany, February 1, 2018.

The existing suspension, introduced in 2016, had been due to expire.\nMerkel’s Bavarian allies have dug in their heels against more generous migrant policies demanded by the SPD.\nAlexander Gauland and Alice Weidel of the Anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany (AfD) during a session of the German lower house of Parliament, Bundestag, in Berlin, Germany, February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt A row erupted between the two sides after Tuesday’s compromise on reunions, with both trying to paint it as a victory.\nBut leading Social Democrat Manuela Schwesig struck a cautious note on migrant policy.\n“I would not speak of a success on family reunions, that would be totally exaggerated,” she told ZDF television, adding, however, that a resumption in reunions represented progress.\nThe party’s roughly 440,000 members could yet sink any deal as they have the final say in a ballot.\nThe JUSOS youth wing of the SPD, along with other leftist members, are deeply opposed to rejoining a coalition under Merkel, fearing it will decimate their support.\nWriting by Madeline Chambers; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:37:38.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
