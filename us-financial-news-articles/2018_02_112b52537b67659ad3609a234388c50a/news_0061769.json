The roadshow was held last week in Dubai and arranged by Emirates NBD.\nDar Al Arkan has $450 million of sukuk due in June this year, $400 million of sukuk due in 2019 and a further $500 million of sukuk – those issued last year – maturing in 2022.\nThe company, rated B1 by Moody’s, issued its last sukuk with Alkhair Capital, Deutsche Bank, DIB, Emirates NBD, Goldman Sachs, Noor Bank and QInvest as joint bookrunners. The sukuk offered a profit rate of 6.875 percent per annum.
