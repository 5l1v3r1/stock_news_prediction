During his nearly 60-year career, he sold more than 100 million records, building up a valuable but dispersed estate. He is buried on the Caribbean island of Saint Barthelemy. \nIn a statement issued by her lawyers, Laura said she was “stunned and pained” to discover she had been excluded from the inheritance. \n“If this were to be, her father will have left her nothing: no material goods, no stake in his artistic legacy, no souvenir, no guitar, no motorbike - not even a signed cover from the song he dedicated to her,” the statement said. \nThe document, Laura Smet’s lawyers said, seemingly runs counter to French law, which specifically protects children from being disenfranchised in a will.

They adopted two girls born in Vietnam, the first in 2004 and the second in 2008, who in theory will be in line to inherit via their mother. \n($1 = 0.8170 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T17:47:10.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
