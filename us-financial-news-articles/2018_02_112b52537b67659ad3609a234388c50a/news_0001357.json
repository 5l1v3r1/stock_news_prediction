Cost of sales fell about 10 percent to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. \nNet income rose to $181.1 million, or 85 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $116.9 million, 55 cents per share, a year earlier. \n“While we continue to expect falling cocoa prices to benefit gross margin, the positive margin impact may not materialize until the second-half of 2018 given the near-term headwinds,” Stifel analyst Alexia Howard wrote in a pre-earnings note. \nAdjusted net income was $1.03 per share, missing analysts’ estimate of $1.07, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nNorth America sales, which account for most of Hershey’s revenue, fell nearly 1 percent to $1.7 billion in the quarter. International sales declined 5.4 percent to $265 million. \nHershey said the recent changes in U.S. tax laws would favorably impact net income, earnings per share-diluted and cash flow in 2018, adding that it is currently evaluating the cash benefits of the tax rate changes. \nFor 2018, the company expects sales to rise 5-7 percent and margins to remain flat. \nOrganic net sales for 2018 are expected to increase up to around 2 percent, lower than its previous target. \nDue to lower tax rate and reinvestment, Hershey said it expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $5.33-$5.43, or an increase of 12-14 percent.
