People were given a licence to remain at their property as long as they paid the monthly fees, the regulator said. \n“Unauthorised money-lending is a criminal offence and causes serious harm, often to vulnerable communities,” Mark Steward, the FCA’s head of enforcement and market oversight, said. \n“Mr Gopee’s actions showed utter contempt for the law. The FCA will continue to take whatever action is necessary to stop this misconduct.” \nThe FCA is expected to introduce new rules to protect consumers in Britain from high-cost credit companies such as doorstep lenders and household appliance rental firms after a review of the consumer credit market. \nThe watchdog, which said in January that its review had demonstrated an “emerging picture of the case for intervention”, expects to publish its conclusions and proposals this quarter. \nGopee was disqualified as a director for 15 years in May 2016 and last year, winding up orders were made against 14 companies operated by him in separate proceedings. \nHe will be sentenced on February 9. Carrying out unauthorised business is a criminal offence in Britain that carries a jail term of up to two years, a fine or both. $1 = 0.7135 pounds Editing by Jane Merriman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T18:34:09.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
