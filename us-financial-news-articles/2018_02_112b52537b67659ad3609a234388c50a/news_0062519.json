The site has a mix of user-generated and original content, including several successful local web-series as well as licensing deals for foreign content.\nLast year the firm became the first Chinese site to ink a licensing deal with Netflix Inc, which has struggled to enter the Chinese market due to strict censorship standards.\niQiyi said it plans to use half of the net proceeds from the offering to expand and enhance it content offerings.\nGoldman Sachs (Asia) LLC, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are the lead underwriters to the IPO.
