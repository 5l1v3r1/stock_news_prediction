Kim Il Sung founded North Korea in 1948 and his family has ruled it ever since.\n”We’re following the example of our neighbour,’ wrote another user.\nThe comments were removed late on Sunday evening after Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter, began blocking the search term “two term limit”.\nWidely read state-run newspaper the Global Times, in an editorial carried online late Sunday and published on Monday, said the change did not mean the president will stay in office for ever, though it did not offer much explanation.\n“Since reform and opening up, China, led by the Communist Party, has successfully resolved and will continue to effectively resolve the issue of party and national leadership replacement in a law-abiding and orderly manner,” it said, referring to landmark economic reforms that begun four decades ago.\nThe party’s official People’s Daily reprinted a long article by Xinhua news agency saying most people supported the constitutional amendments, quoting a variety of people proffering support.\n“The broad part of officials and the masses say that they hoped this constitutional reform is passed,” it wrote.\nThe WeChat account of the People’s Daily, after initially posting a flurry of positive comments under its article, then disabled the comments section completely late on Sunday. It was back again by Monday, complete with remarks lauding the party.\nThe overseas edition of the same paper’s WeChat account removed entirely an article focusing on the term limits, replacing it with the lengthy Xinhua report summing up all the amendment proposals.\nIn one confusing moment for many Chinese, Xinhua initially only reported the news in English.\nThe decision has also unsettled some in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, where authorities have been trying to rein in a pro-democracy movement.\n“This move, which would allow for a single individual to amass and accumulate political power, means that China would again have a dictator as her head of state - Xi Jinping,” said Joshua Wong, one of the movement’s leaders.\n“The law may exist in China in form, but this just proves that the Chinese law exists to serve the individual and the party’s purposes.”\nChina is likely though to see any such criticism as a plot against the party.\n“Every time China deliberates on reforms and key decisions, effect on public opinion is worth pondering,” the Global Times wrote. “Misinformation and external forces’ meddling will affect public opinion in China.” (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Venus Wu in HONG KONG; Editing by Michael Perry)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:54:17.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
