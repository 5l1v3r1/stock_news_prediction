REUTERS/Albert Gea “If your market share is less than 10 percent you cannot be profitable. Over at 10 percent, at least, you can break even (and) over 15 percent you can make money,” he said.\nHe said Huawei’s smartphone business grew by around 30 percent in the last year, and would grow even faster this year, with strong growth in both January and so far this month.\nRichard Yu, CEO of the Huawei Consumer Business Group, shows their 5G chip \"Balong 5G01\" before the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 25, 2018. REUTERS/Albert Gea Huawei could become the second biggest smartphone maker this year or next, and sooner or later could be No.1, he said, speaking after his company unveiled a new notebook PC and two Android tablets.\nIt declined to launch a new flagship smartphone as it has done in the past at the Mobile World conference in Barcelona. Instead, it is set to launch its new flagship P20 smartphone at a standalone event in Paris next month, where Yu said Huawei would showcase “big and bold” innovation in camera technology.\nThe device will compete head-to-head with Samsung’s new Galaxy S9 - launched here on Sunday - and Apple’s iPhone X.\nLooking ahead to next generation mobile networks set to roll out starting later this year in several major markets, Huawei also unveiled 5G versions of a consumer network router, its own chipset for phones.\nYu said Huawei will launch its first 5G-ready smartphone either in the third- or fourth-quarter, most likely in its Mate line of devices.\nReporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Eric Auchard and Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T03:22:30.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
