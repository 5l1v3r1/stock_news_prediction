As a result, Apple shares tanked.\n\"I think you're going to hear this comparison a lot going forward, but, and this is a gigantic but, I think the analogy is totally bogus,\" Cramer argued. \"The Apple of today is in much better shape than the Apple of early 2016.\"\nIn fact, besides the analysts' narrative that Apple's worst days are behind it, very little of Apple's current situation mirrors 2016, Cramer said.\nIn 2016, analysts were slashing their estimates and Apple's quarterly results followed suit, with revenue and earnings shrinking by double-digits.\nNow, even Wall Street's skeptics are projecting that Apple will have 17 percent revenue growth and 30 percent earnings growth in its next quarter, Cramer said, adding that even if the company misses the estimates, it will still be in \"positive territory.\"\nBetter yet, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty — \"the single best analyst who covers Apple,\" by Cramer's account — pointed out that Apple's China business is taking market share, unlike in 2016, when it was slowing.\nHuberty also told investors that its service revenue stream from products like Apple music is growing by 18 percent and the company's plans to repatriate its overseas cash could bring good tidings for shareholders.\n\"Look, I hate to chase, but the next time the negative analysts manage to knock Apple down — and they'll do it, it's in their DNA — I think it's a terrific buy,\" Cramer said. \"Let's not allow the bear attacks to scare us away from the greatest consumer products story on earth, the one with the best technology that just keeps improving.\"\nWATCH: Cramer on Apple's rebound show chapters Cramer tracks Apple's rebound after lackluster quarter and several-day sell-off 15 Hours Ago | 06:39 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T01:46:00.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
