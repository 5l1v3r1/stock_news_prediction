The order to negotiate would expire in three weeks if an accord is not reached.\n“For now, the strike is off,” Sergio Diaz of the SOEAR oilseed crushers union told Reuters by telephone. The work stoppage affected Cargill operations in grains hub Rosario.\nRosario, along the Parana River, is the main departure port for Argentine soyoil and soymeal. The South American grains powerhouse is the world’s biggest exporter of both products.
