Some of the lawmakers urged him to act decisively to save steel and aluminum producers in their states, but others urged caution because higher prices would hurt manufacturers.\nTrump is weighing a list of options presented a month ago by the U.S. Commerce Department in a “Section 232” trade case looking at whether restrictions on steel and aluminum are needed to protect national security.\n“What we’re talking about it tariffs and/or quotas,” Trump said to the group.\n“Part of the options would be tariffs coming in. As they dump steel, they pay tariffs, substantial tariffs, which means the United States would actually make a lot of money.”\nTrump now has until around April 11 to decide whether to impose steel restrictions, and April 20 to decide on aluminum restrictions.\nThe Commerce Department has not revealed its recommendations.\nBut Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told the lawmakers that Section 232 powers “can be applied in a much more surgical way” that could lead to tariffs on imports from certain countries and quotas from other nations suspected of transshipping products.\nSteelmakers recently urged Trump to take broad action to reduce steel imports to curb global excess steel production capacity, largely in China..\nSteel and aluminum users, meanwhile, have urged caution in any restrictions to avoid disruptions or price spikes in the raw materials used in everything from autos to appliances and aircraft and construction.
