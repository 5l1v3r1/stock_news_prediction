Factory output was well below the 4 percent annual rise forecast in a Reuters poll, and down from the 5 percent pace set in November. Manufacturing sector output expanded 5.3 percent from a year earlier in December, slowing from 6.7 percent in the previous month, according to data from the Statistics Department. The electricity generation sector rose 3.9 percent year-on-year in December, while mining output contracted by 4.1 percent, the data showed. Industrial output reached a two-and-a-half year-high of 6.8 percent in August. On a monthly basis, factory output rose 2.2 percent from November. Malaysia's exports in December rose 4.7 percent from a year ago, sharply down from November's 14.4 percent growth as commodity prices and shipment volumes fell.
