Borghi said Forza Italia wanted to use the less radical negotiating tool of reducing payments to the bloc’s budget or even halting them altogether.\nThe two parties have agreed that whichever wins most votes will name the prime minister and have more control over policy.\nA new electoral law makes the outcome of the vote highly uncertain, but poll ratings for Forza Italia of between one and six percentage points ahead of the League suggest the 81 year-old media mogul’s more Europe-friendly agenda will prevail.\nLeague leader Matteo Salvini blames the euro for Italy’s prolonged economic malaise and expects it to collapse, putting him at odds with Berlusconi, who wants to keep the currency and has promised some of the budget rigour EU rules demand.\nForza Italia nevertheless shares its allies’ anger at the spending cuts imposed on high-debt countries like Italy.\nBoth parties want to impose border controls and oppose the system whereby migrants from outside the EU are the responsibility of the country where they first arrive.\nFILE PHOTO:Northern League leader Matteo Salvini looks on before the rally in Bologna, central Italy, November 8, 2015. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini “The EU in its current state is a bankrupt project, it has brought no good to any of its members,” Borghi said.\n“Our base position is no to the euro, we might like the European Union without the euro.”\nThe coalition agreed that two years would be long enough to see how the EU responded, but they could start reducing budget payments earlier, Borghi said.\n“We all agreed that the first thing to do is to stop paying them. Why should we pay if they don’t listen to us?”\nBorghi said the League also wanted changes to the rules on dealing with failing banks and the internal market for services.\nINTERNAL COMPETITION Verbal jousting has become commonplace between Berlusconi and League chief Salvini.\n“There is definitely internal competition,” said Borghi, adding that he thought the League would surpass Forza Italia. No polls are published in the two weeks before the elections, when compilers say many undecided voters make up their minds.\nThe League was born as a group campaigning for independence for the wealthy north from the rest of Italy, but under Salvini its focus has shifted to fighting immigration and the euro.\nAllied with France’s National Front in the European Parliament, they advocate a return to the EU’s status before the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, which laid the foundations for the single currency and free movement between member states.\nOnly 17 percent of Italians are satisfied with the direction the EU is taking, well behind the average of 34 percent among their neighbors, but 56 percent would vote to remain in the bloc if a Brexit-style referendum were held, according to a study by the Bertelsmann Foundation last October.\nBorghi said the League would promote its ideas within the coalition, but respect the choice of the voters.\n“If the election shows that Forza Italia gets a flood of votes and we don’t get many, I can’t ignore that,” he said.\nEditing by Gavin Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T18:38:16.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
