A Reuters report published last summer named nearly 50 firms that employ a high number of brokers who have customer complaints or other red marks on their records. \nFINRA oversees the roughly 3,700 securities brokerages in the United States. The complaints it receives from customers are heard by arbitration panels, often comprised of industry people and securities lawyers. \nIn 2016, FINRA arbitration panels heard 2,457 cases. Most years, two-thirds are settled outside of arbitration, and the parties agree not to disclose any details including the settlement amount. \nOf the nearly 2,500 cases, FINRA arbitration panels awarded clients money in 389 cases. In 44 of those cases the investors said they never received the full payment from the firm, according to FINRA. \nFINRA published the information as part of a broad effort to evaluate and improve its legacy systems. The group, which was formally established in 2007, is an outgrowth of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which formed in 1939.
