It raised the dividend 5.3 percent.\nAnalysts were on average expecting flat operating income of 2.403 billion euros on revenues of 16.272 billion euros, according to an Inquiry Financial poll conducted for Reuters.\nSafran said its widely watched civil aftermarket services revenue grew 11.2 percent in dollar terms in 2017 and predicted 2018 growth in the high single digits. GE said last month that its own aviation services revenue had grown 13 percent in 2017.\n$1 = 0.8112 euros Reporting by Tim Hepher, Jean-Michel Belot; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T14:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:03:41.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
