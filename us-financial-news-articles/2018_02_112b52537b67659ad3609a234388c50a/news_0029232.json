Parliament is currently in recess.\n“Today the Metropolitan Police investigated a small package containing white powder on the parliamentary estate. The powder was found to be non-harmful,” the House of Commons, Britain’s lower house of parliament, said in a statement.\nPolice increased security at the site after an Islamic State-inspired attacker drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge a year ago, killing four of them, and then stabbed a police officer to death nearby.\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper and Alistair Smout; Writing by William Schomberg; Editing by Stephen Addison and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T16:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T16:43:24.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
