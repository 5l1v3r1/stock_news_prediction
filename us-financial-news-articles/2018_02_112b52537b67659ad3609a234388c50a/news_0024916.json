Against the euro sterling was up 0.1 percent at 87.94 pence.\nAfter Thursday’s policy meeting, financial markets now price in a nearly 70 percent chance of a BoE rate hike in May.\nBut the BoE’s rate-setters on Thursday gave themselves time to assess how Britain is coping with the approach of its exit from the European Union.\n“The Bank of England’s Brexit-contingent hawkish signal today means meaningful sterling upside may be slightly tempered in the near-term,” wrote ING currency strategist Viraj Patel in a note to clients.\n“We expect full upside potential to be unleashed once we get greater clarity on a Brexit transition deal.”\nNot all market players agree, however. A Reuters poll of strategists found on Thursday that this year’s sterling surge is over, and concerns over Brexit will start weighing the currency down again.
