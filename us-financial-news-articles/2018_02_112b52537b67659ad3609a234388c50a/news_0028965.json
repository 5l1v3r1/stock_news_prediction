( bit.ly/2skuvYM )\nThe top shareholders termed the deal structure as “tortured (and) convoluted”.\nIn an emailed statement, Xerox told Reuters it considered several other options in detail and concluded that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the “best path to create value” for the company.\nThe two investors said there is still great opportunity for Xerox to create “enormous value for shareholders, and it does not involve selling control to Fuji without a premium”.\nOn Jan. 31, Fujifilm said it was set to take over Xerox in a $6.1 billion deal and combine it into their existing joint venture, Fuji Xerox.\n“To put it simply, the current board of directors has overseen the systematic destruction of Xerox, and, unless we do something, this latest Fuji scheme will be the company’s final death knell,” Icahn and Deason said in the letter.\nDeason and Icahn said in regulatory filings they together own a 15.2 percent stake in Xerox - 6 percent and 9.2 percent respectively - as of Feb 12. bit.ly/2ssI9cF\nThe two investors in their letter highlighted their concerns about becoming passive minority owners of a Fuji subsidiary if the deal with Xerox proceeds.\nFujifilm was not immediately available for comment.
