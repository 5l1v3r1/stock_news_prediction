A life sentence in Egypt is 25 years in jail.\nFifteen other people were acquitted in the same case.\nThe charges included joining a terrorist organization, arms possession, first degree murder and attempted murder, the sources said.\nEgypt banned the Brotherhood in 2013 after the army led by general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted Mursi. Sisi took office a year later and thousands of the removed president’s supporters have been rounded up since then.\nReporting by Haitham Ahmed and Mohamed Abdellah Writing by Arwa Gaballa; Editing by Sami Aboudi\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T16:20:36.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
