Batory has been serving as a consultant to FRA.\nThere have been a number of high-profile rail crashes in recent months, most recently the Feb. 4 crash of an Amtrak passenger train with a freight train that killed two people and injured more than 100 in South Carolina.\nA deadly Amtrak crash in December near Seattle killed three after an engineer misread a signal and was speeding, investigators have said.\nOn Jan. 31, an Amtrak train carrying lawmakers slammed into a garbage truck on Wednesday in Virginia, killing one person.\nThe Senate also Tuesday confirmed two other Transportation Department nominees - Raymond Martinez to head the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and Adam Sullivan to be assistant secretary of governmental affairs.\nIn December, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urged the nation’s railroads and transit agencies to take all possible measures to meet deadlines to install a safety system called positive train control to prevent crashes.\nA U.S. House of Representatives committee plans to hold a hearing Thursday on the status of efforts to install the technology, including Amtrak’s chief executive, the National Transportation Safety Board and FRA.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T02:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T03:03:13.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
