Shares of the company rose 2.2 percent to $53.11 in after-market trading on Wednesday. Sales from its semiconductor business, its largest, jumped 32 percent to $2.84 billion. Sales from its display business — which makes flat panel screens for televisions, PCs and smartphones — rose 7.8 percent to $455 million. Net income fell to $135 million, or 13 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 28, from $703 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. The company took a charge of $1 billion due to the recent changes in the U.S. tax law. Excluding items, the company earned $1.06 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total net sales rose 28 percent to $4.20 billion in the quarter, above the Wall Street estimate of $4.12 billion. The company said it also approved a $6 billion share repurchase plan.
