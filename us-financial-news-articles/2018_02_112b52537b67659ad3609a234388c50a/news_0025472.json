It was obviously such a negative thing that overshadowed a lot of the Olympics,” Canadian Tristan Walker, who competed in the men’s doubles event with Justin Snith in Vancouver, told Reuters on Sunday. \nKumaritashvili came off his sled, flew off the track and slammed into an exposed steel pillar during his final training run at the Whistler Sliding Centre, renowned as one of the world’s fastest tracks. \nThe International Luge Federation (FIL) deemed it an “unforeseeable fatal accident” and ruled out any fault with the track or the Georgian’s sled. \nA coroner’s report said it was the result of a number of converging factors, including driver error and “exacting physical forces”. \nBut FIL president Josef Fendt had expressed concerns about the speed of the track a year before the Games after a record time was set there. \nLuge tracks are now designed to limit speeds to 140 kph for a sport in which sledders wear helmets but little other protection. \nNo deaths have been recorded in high-level competitions since Vancouver. \nThe FIL remains in contact with relatives of Kumaritashvili, whose grandfather is credited with introducing the sport to Georgia. The country is being represented by a sole athlete in the current tournament, Giorgi Sogoiani, in the men’s singles. \nThe Pyeongchang track has had mostly rave reviews from the lugers but turn nine has caused problems for even the most experienced competitors. \nHearts were in mouths on Saturday when Ukraine’s Andriy Mandziy came off his sled at high speed during the men’s singles preliminaries but he kept hold of it as he slid down the ice before re-boarding to finish the run. \nLugers have welcomed having extra training runs to get accustomed to the track and feel the federation is doing what it can to prevent serious accidents. \nThere is, though, no way the sport can be made one hundred percent safe, they say, nor would they necessarily want it that way. \n“Like I said, it’s a dangerous sport. Honestly, you look at the personalities around the track, that’s why we do it,” said Canadian Walker, who is teaming up with Snith for a third Olympics. \n“If you want something safe, play chess.” Editing by Clare Fallon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T17:36:16.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
