Boeing says it supports some 17,000 jobs in Canada.\nThe dispute also has weighed on the crucial NAFTA modernization talks, which have dragged on for months.\nAlthough government officials say the competition will be open, they have privately made it clear that Boeing needs to drop the Bombardier challenge and talk of an appeal to stand a better chance of winning the jet contract, say sources familiar with the matter.\n“A lot of things would be better if they did that,” said one source who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation.\nFROSTY RELATIONSHIP There are signs the relationship between Boeing and Ottawa remain frosty. Boeing did not send its own staff to a meeting between the Canadian government and industry held in January to discuss the jets contract, the sources said.\nBoeing said its F-18 Super Hornet was represented by the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the Pentagon unit that implements foreign arms sales. U.S. foreign military sales are often negotiated between the U.S. government and each customer nation.\nLockheed Martin Corp, Dassault Aviation SA and Airbus SE also are expected to compete.\nCanada is part of the consortium that helped develop Lockheed’s F-35 stealth fighter, although Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during his successful 2015 election campaign that he would not buy the plane because it was too expensive.\nCanadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, who has said Boeing has not behaved like a trusted partner, did not answer directly last Tuesday when repeatedly pressed as to how the aerospace giant could get back into Ottawa’s good books.\nOttawa says the bids will be evaluated in part on the basis of “past and recent economic behavior of potential bidders leading up to the procurement.”\nThat test is months away from being finalised, meaning Boeing has no idea whether Ottawa would be satisfied if it did drop the challenge, sources said.\nA company’s submission will be evaluated not just on the economic test but on a number of factors including, price and military capability, one of the sources said.\nWhile Boeing has repeatedly said it will not take reprisals against its Canadian supply chain and workforce, the dispute between Boeing and Canada worries aerospace suppliers who fear they could lose future contracts, an industry source familiar with the matter said.\nCanada’s aerospace industry is a major employer in Quebec, a politically valuable province for Trudeau, who is facing elections in 2019.\n$1 = 1.2378 Canadian dollars Writing by Leah Schnurr; Additional reporting by Mike Stone in Washington and Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Denny Thomas and Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:13:17.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
