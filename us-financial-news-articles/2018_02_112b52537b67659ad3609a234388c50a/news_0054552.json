Traders said the underlying result missed expectations, while the lack of an update on a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice for mis-selling toxic mortgage-backed securities also weighed.\nFrench auto parts maker Valeo ( VLOF.PA ) slumped 11 percent to a six-month low, making it the biggest faller on the STOXX 600 . Its second-half profit fell on adverse exchange rates and raw materials prices, prompting UBS to cut its price target on the stock.\nElsewhere among financials, Standard Life Aberdeen ( SLA.L ) fell 2.5 percent after agreeing to sell the bulk of its insurance business to Phoenix Group ( PHNX.L ) for 3.24 billion pounds, while Swiss RE rose 2.5 percent after reporting better than expected 2017 net income.\nOil services firm Subsea 7 ( SUBC.OL ) jumped 7.35 percent after news of joint venture talks with larger rival Schlumberger ( SLB.N ), which also supported shares in rival Saipem ( SPMI.MI ), up 2.5 percent.\nIn the energy sector, Neste ( NESTE.HE ) hit a record high following an upgrade from Barclays, which said demand for renewable fuels should continue to increase.
