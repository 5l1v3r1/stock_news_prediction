The app had a similar traffic rush four years earlier, during the Olympics in Sochi, Russia .\n\"It's a global phenomenon, and it keeps growing,\" Ginsberg said on \" Squawk on the Street .\" Ten years ago only 3 percent of relationships began online, she said. Today it's closer to 30 percent. Match Group has risen 30 percent so far this year.\nThe company also said Wednesday that Tinder is launching a new feature that allows female users the option of initiating all conversations. The setting is similar to a feature of dating-app rival Bumble. There is no target date for when this feature will be installed.\nToday, Match Group has 38 brands — including Match.com, PlentyOfFish, OkCupid, the Japanese brand Pairs, and OurTime, for people over 50 — in 190 countries. Tens of millions of people use the products in 40 languages, said Ginsberg, who took over as CEO of Match Group in January. \n\"One size does not fit all in this category,\" Ginsberg said. \"The portfolio approach globally really does make sense.\"\nTinder, though, is by far the most profitable, Ginsberg said. Last September, the company introduced Tinder Gold, which allows users — for $14.99 a month — to see their \"likers\" before they match.\n\"Gold is very simple,\" Ginsberg said. \"You get to see who's liked you, which is probably the most human, driven, curious thing: I want to know who's interested in me. It's been a real win for the business.\"\nAnd the app is not just for casual daters. Ginsberg said many relationships and even marriages began on Tinder.\n\"Open up the New York Times marriage section and you'll see Tinder weddings,\" she said. \"People use our products for a variety of reasons.\"\nGinsberg, who is married with two children, celebrates her 12-year anniversary with the company on Valentine's Day. \nIn 2015, InterActiveCorp (IAC) spun off a portion of Match Group in an initial public offering. IAC remains the largest shareholder of Match Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:56:51.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
