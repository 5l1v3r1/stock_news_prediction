The South Koreans want to use the Olympics to ease tensions spurred by North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons.\nThe spectacle was greeted with apparent joy by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his guest, Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. They stood from their seats and, smiling, shook each other by the hand.\nNot everybody was so taken by the show of Korean unity, with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence remaining seated as the North and South Koreans entered the stadium.\n“I didn’t see it there. I was standing and I think the whole team felt very much welcome and this welcome does not depend on who stands and who does not stand,” Bach said.\nA high-ranking North Korean delegation of Kim, and North Korea’s nominal head of state, Kim Yong Nam, had arrived in South Korea earlier in the day aboard Kim Jong Un’s private jet.\nEditing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:08:00.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
