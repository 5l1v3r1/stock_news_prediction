The next round of talks is scheduled for Feb. 26 and 27.\n“Deutsche Post is swimming in money but they expect employees to go empty-handed. Staff and Verdi will not accept that,” Anton Hirtreiter of Verdi in Bavaria said in a statement.\nStrong economic growth and low unemployment in Germany is bolstering unions in their wage demands, with industrial union IG Metall having agreed a 4.3 percent raise and the right to shorter working hours.\nDeutsche Post DHL Group is targeting earnings before interest and tax of around 3.75 billion euros ($4.6 billion) for 2017, which would be a 7 percent increase from last year’s 3.49 billion.\nVerdi held a series of strikes at Deutsche Post in 2015 in a dispute over pay and plans for a new parcel division. Those walkouts, one of which lasted four weeks, cost the firm 100 million euros at the time.
