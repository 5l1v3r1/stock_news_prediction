REUTERS/Thomas Hodel/File Photo Dassault Aviation SA has expressed interest in the navy tender with its twin-engine Rafale M fighter and Russian Aircraft Corporation has reportedly proposed the Indian Navy buy more MiG-29Ks. The firms did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nAIR FORCE FIGHTERS The separate air force contract, expected to be for 100 single-engine fighters, has attracted Saab’s Gripen E and Lockheed Martin Corp with its F-16, but the contest has yet to reach the RFI stage.\n“Hopefully we get an RFI this year,” Saab Head of Asia Pacific Dean Rosenfield said. “More than likely, 2019. But it really is dependent on the customer and what they do with the election there as well.”\nSaab has partnered with Adani to build Gripens in India if it wins either or both of the fighter jet contests, while Lockheed has selected Tata Advanced Systems as its local production partner for the F-16.\nLockheed Martin International Executive Vice President Rick Edwards said his company was hopeful an RFI on the air force contract would be released “soon” but it remained up to the government.\nAn Indian Air Force spokesman declined to comment on when the RFI would be issued.\nReporting by Jamie Freed in Singapore; additional reporting by Sanjeev Miglani in New Delhi\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T10:47:35.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
