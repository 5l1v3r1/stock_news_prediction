The clothing is impossible for attackers to pull down, she said.\n“We can’t have 100 percent protection, but we need a product where we can feel a little bit more safe so no-one can rape us,” the inventor of the Safe Shorts told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from the city of Bottrop in northwest Germany.\nThe shorts went on sale in 2017 - a pivotal year for women’s rights after allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein sparked the #MeToo campaign, with women taking to social media to share their experiences of abuse.\nOne in three women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual violence, mostly by someone they know, UN Women says.\nSeilz said her tights minimize the risk of assault in a country where she believes fears are heightened since a series of sex attacks on women in Cologne on New Year’s Eve in 2015.\nCosting 149 euros ($183) for running tights or 89 euros ($109) for underwear, Safe Shorts are also fitted with a deafening 140-decibel alarm, according to Seilz.\n“I wish it was not necessary that we would need a product like Safe Shorts. But if there’s a possibility to give this sort of protection, why not?” said Seilz, who has customers in more than 35 countries including Japan, Canada, Australia and Libya.\nHowever rape crisis centers say such devices unfairly put the responsibility on women and give a false sense of security, since most women are raped by someone they know, not strangers.\n“I‘m sure it’s a well-meaning initiative, but I‘m always wary about these sorts of products as it is making money out of women’s fears,” Katie Russell, a spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nOther products on the market that attempt to curb sex attacks include color-changing coasters or straws that women can use to determine if their alcoholic drinks have been spiked.\nReporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Kieran Guilbert; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters that covers humanitarian issues, conflicts, land and property rights, modern slavery and human trafficking, gender equality, climate change and resilience.
