Most other euro zone bond yields were up 0-1 bps. \nThis came after 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to a high of 2.86 percent overnight. \nGreece launched a new seven-year bond sale on Thursday, announced earlier this week and which should cement Athens’ bond market credentials, particularly coming so soon after Tuesday’s severe stock market crash. \nItalian, Spanish and Portuguese government bonds slightly underperformed, their yields rising around 1 basis point, but only after having fallen sharply the day before. \nAll three are still trading close to their tightest levels over Germany in months, and in some cases, years. Having a pro-European, pro-spending party at the heart of German government is seen as positive for these southern European countries. \nThe European Central Bank’s chief economist Peter Praet said on Thursday that a benchmark salary increase secured by Germany’s largest trade union this week was “fully in line” with the ECB’s inflation forecasts. \nAcross the Atlantic, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Robert S. Kaplan said three rate increases this year remain the central bank’s base case scenario regardless of the recent stock market rout. Earlier in the day, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said the euro’s strength and the recent stock market rout do not justify any substantial extension of the European Central Bank’s bond purchase scheme. \nThe ECB’s Francois Villeroy de Galhau and the Fed’s Patrick Harker were also due to speak later on Thursday. \nMarkets were also awaiting the Bank of England’s rate decision at 1200 GMT. Analysts expect the BoE to keep rates on hold given the economic uncertainty that hangs over the UK, but it could telegraph a hike as early as May.
