Peeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by shipment of our MOCVD and Laser Anneal systems, and we announced a large multi tool order for our EPIK ® 868 from Focus Lightings for the production of high-volume light emitting diodes (LEDs).”\n\"Entering 2018, we expect to grow in all of our target markets, and we are seeing particularly healthy demand in Advanced Packaging, MEMS and RF Filter and Front-End Semiconductor markets,” continued Mr. Peeler.\n“Lastly, as we announced on February 8, 2018, I am pleased to report that we have reached a mutually agreed settlement of the pending patent disputes with AMEC and SGL Carbon, and all legal actions related to this matter will be dismissed or withdrawn. We are back to normal operations in our MOCVD business,” concluded Mr. Peeler.\nGuidance and Outlook\nThe following guidance is provided for Veeco’s first quarter 2018:\nRevenue is expected in the range of $140 million to $165 million Non-GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $2 million to $10 million GAAP earnings (loss) per share are expected in the range of ($0.50) to ($0.32) Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are expected in the range of ($0.04) to $0.14\nPlease refer to the tables at the end of this press release for further details.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call reviewing these results has been scheduled for today, February 12, 2018 starting at 5:00pm ET.

Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. By excluding these items, Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to facilitate meaningful comparisons to historical operating results, competitors' operating results, and estimates made by securities analysts. Management is evaluated on key performance metrics including Non-GAAP Operating Income (loss), which is used to determine management incentive compensation as well as to forecast future periods. These Non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, similar Non-GAAP financial measures have historically been reported to investors; the inclusion of comparable numbers provides consistency in financial reporting. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the Non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nSource:Veeco Instruments Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/6d97d29a-eba2-4e03-bc56-958da751530d"], "published": "2018-02-13T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:44:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
