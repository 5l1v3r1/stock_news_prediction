For 30-year JGBs, it was the first time since April 2016.\nThe price of 10-year JGB futures dipped 0.03 point to 150.72, with only 12,799 lots traded. Again, except for the Christmas day last year, it was the lowest trading volume in more than six months.\nInvestors were reluctant to chase JGBs higher for now after their slow rally since early June, market players said.
