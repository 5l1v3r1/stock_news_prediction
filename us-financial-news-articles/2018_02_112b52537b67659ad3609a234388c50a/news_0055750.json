(Nasdaq:HMSY) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $25.7 million or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.4 million or $0.07 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017 and $9.2 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the prior year fourth quarter. Net income for the quarter included a non-cash tax benefit of $15.1 million or $0.18 per diluted share, due to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax balances pursuant to the tax rate reduction included in the federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.49 per diluted share, compared to adjusted EPS of $0.19 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017 and adjusted EPS of $0.18 per diluted share in the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter included a non-cash tax benefit of $0.25 per diluted share, due to the impact of the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax balances pursuant to the tax rate reduction included in the federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.24 per diluted share.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $40.1 million or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $37.6 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the full year 2017 was $1.11 per diluted share, including a non-cash tax benefit of $0.40 per diluted share due to the new tax legislation, compared to $0.75 per diluted share in full year 2016. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS for the full year was $0.71 per diluted share. Net income and adjusted EPS in the prior year included a benefit of $6.2 million or $0.07 per diluted share for certain prior open years’ Research and Development tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions recognized in the third quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $40.2 million, compared to $34.1 million in the third quarter of 2017 (+17.9%) and $32.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $124.6 million, compared to $117.4 million in the prior year.\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was a record $148.5 million, compared to total revenue of $125.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 (+18.2%) and $125.6 million in the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, total revenue increased 6.4% to a record $521.2 million, compared to total revenue for the full year 2016 of $489.7 million. 2017 full year revenue included $30.4 million in revenue from the Company’s Eliza subsidiary, which was acquired in April 2017, partially offset by a $14.7 million decline in Medicare RAC revenue.\n\"We had a strong fourth quarter to finish out 2017 – setting quarterly records for total company, commercial, state government and coordination of benefits (COB) revenue. COB and Payment Integrity (PI) revenues rebounded strongly from the third quarter, as expected, with both up double digits sequentially. We also made incremental progress in the quarter with completed implementations of new business and significantly higher levels of medical record requests and record reviews, which we expect will translate into further PI revenue growth in the early part of 2018,\" said Bill Lucia, Chairman and CEO. “The entire healthcare industry is increasingly focused on enhancing the consumer experience and improving clinical outcomes by better engaging individuals in managing their own health. As a result, our care management and consumer engagement solutions are really resonating with customers and we are increasingly encouraged about the growth profile of this new vertical.”\n\"We have several strategic priorities as we enter 2018: boosting organic revenue growth across all of our products, but particularly payment integrity; expanding our care management and consumer engagement platform and customer base; taking full advantage of technology, innovation and the scalability of our business model to maximize the value of our data and expand margins; maintaining our focus on customer satisfaction and employee engagement; and maximizing total shareholder return, which benefits all of the Company's stakeholders,” added Lucia.\nCommercial revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was a record $77.2 million, compared to $62.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter and $67.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 (+14.3%). Commercial revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 included $12.9 million from Eliza, compared to $9.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 (+30.3%). State government revenue was a record $64.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $57.7 million in the prior year fourth quarter and $51.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 (+24.3%). Medicare RAC revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.0 million, compared to ($0.4) million in the prior year fourth quarter and $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2017. Federal (excluding Medicare RAC) and Other revenue was $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a $0.2 million decrease compared to the prior year fourth quarter and a $0.5 million decrease compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nOn a full year basis, commercial revenue was $269.2 million, a 17.0% increase compared to $230.2 million in 2016; state government revenue was $227.0 million, a 3.6% increase compared to $219.1 million in 2016; Federal (excluding Medicare RAC) and Other revenue was $22.6 million, a decrease of $0.7 million compared to 2016; and Medicare RAC revenue was $2.4 million, a $14.7 million decrease compared to 2016.\nCOB revenue, across both the state government and commercial businesses, was a record $105.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $95.0 million in the prior year fourth quarter and $90.1 million in the third quarter of 2017 (+17.4%). COB revenue accounted for 71.2% of total company revenue in the fourth quarter, compared to 75.6% in the prior year fourth quarter and 71.7% in the third quarter of 2017. For the full year, COB revenue was $382.7 million, an 8.2% increase compared to $353.8 million in 2016.\nRevenue from Analytical Services, which includes PI, Medicare RAC and Care Management and Consumer Engagement Solutions, was $42.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $30.6 million in the prior year fourth quarter and $35.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 (+20.2%). PI revenue, excluding Medicare RAC, was $26.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $30.2 million in the prior year fourth quarter and $23.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 (+12.2%). For the full year, Analytical Services revenue was $138.5 million.\nCapital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $10.7 million. For the full year 2017, capital expenditures were $33.0 million.\n\"We ended the year with enhanced liquidity and a strong balance sheet. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $31.4 million, which resulted in a full year total of $86.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $40.2 million in the fourth quarter was up 17.9% compared to the third quarter and operating margin in the quarter was 13.0%, compared to 10.2% in the third quarter. We repurchased $14.1 million of our shares in the fourth quarter, and closed on a new amended credit facility in December which increases our financial flexibility and complements our strong operating cash flow. At December 31st, our debt (net of cash) was under $160 million – less than 1.3 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA,\" said Jeff Sherman, CFO. “We take a bottom up approach to our annual budgeting process and have carefully evaluated all aspects of our expected 2018 financial performance for which we believe we have substantial visibility. On that basis, we have developed our annual outlook for the full year as follows:\nTotal company revenue of $560-570 million Net income of $29-33 million Adjusted EBITDA of $128-133 million Margin expansion of approximately 50 bps Capital expenditures of approximately $33 million An effective annual tax rate of 28-30%\nWe believe these are achievable objectives for the year,” concluded Sherman.\nFor additional information about the Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, see the Q4 and Full Year 2017 Investor Presentation available on the Company’s website at http://investor.hms.com/events.cfm .\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nHMS will report its preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial and operating results via webcast at 7:30 AM CT / 8:30 AM ET on Friday, February 23, 2018.
