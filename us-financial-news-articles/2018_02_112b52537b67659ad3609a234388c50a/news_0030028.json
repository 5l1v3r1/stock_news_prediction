So many different things have to come together to win a race. We had no expectations for this combined. This already was a high-risk decision,” Hirscher said.\n“Last time I put on downhill skis before the training here was exactly one year ago,” added the 28-year-old, who came 12th in the morning downhill but leapfrogged his rivals in the slalom to win by 0.23 seconds from Alexis Pinturault of France.\nHirscher leads the World Cup slalom, giant slalom and overall standings this season and appeared notably relaxed on arriving in Pyeongchang last week, telling reporters a gold medal would be great but not life-changing.\nHe looks even more dangerous in his favourite events now he has got the monkey off his back.\n“I‘m not travelling home tomorrow but if I wished, I could, because I have my big goal, I reached it, especially in Austria where everyone’s expecting that I‘m going to win a gold medal, at least one,” he said.
