SMA is caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene that codes SMN, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons. The incidence of SMA is approximately one in 10,000 live births. SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality.\nThe most severe form of SMA is Type 1, a lethal genetic disorder characterized by motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration, which results in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support before the age of two for greater than 90 percent of patients. SMA Type 2 typically presents between six and 18 months of age, and those affected will never walk without support and most will never stand without support. SMA Type 2 results in mortality in more than 30 percent of patients by the age of 25.\nAbout AVXS-101\nAveXis’ initial product candidate, AVXS-101, is its proprietary gene therapy currently in development for the one-time treatment of SMA Types 1 and 2, designed to address the monogenic root cause of SMA and prevent further muscle degeneration by addressing the defective and/or loss of the primary SMN gene. AVXS-101 also targets motor neurons, providing rapid onset of effect and crossing the blood brain barrier to allow effective targeting of both central and systemic features.\nAbout AveXis, Inc.\nAveXis is a clinical-stage gene therapy company developing treatments for patients suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases. The company’s initial product candidate, AVXS-101, is its proprietary gene therapy currently in the pivotal phase of study for the treatment of SMA Type 1, and in a Phase 1 trial for SMA Type 2. The company also intends to expand the study of gene therapy into two additional rare neurological monogenic disorders: Rett syndrome (RTT) and a genetic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene.\nFor additional information, please visit www.avexis.com .\nMedia Inquiries:\nLauren Barbiero\nW2O Group\n646-564-2156\nlbarbiero@w2ogroup.com\nInvestor Inquiries:\nJim Goff\nAveXis, Inc.\n650-862-4134\njgoff@avexis.com\nSource:AveXis, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e4a9d2a6-4c35-48a8-8442-a48dbc2dea16", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Staw3DAcSRcPE1oKSty46pnvc_qB9uOrmFEd3l-h2EsAqOl_K0VfcJxo1ORQEYsmly9XViXFOTVI1MXhJz8TsQ=="], "published": "2018-02-20T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:32:11.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
