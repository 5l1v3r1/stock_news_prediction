Munger also says it's time for regulators to 'let up' on Wells Fargo, which has struggled to overcome criticism of several product sales scandals and its attempts to repay customers. Charles Munger \nCharlie Munger has no patience for bitcoin. \nDuring a two-hour question and answer session Wednesday at the Daily Journal shareholder meeting, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and long-time sidekick to Warren Buffett said he considers the current bitcoin craze to be \"totally asinine.' \n\" Bitcoin is noxious poison,\" Munger said in response to a question. Munger, 93, is chairman and a director at Daily Journal , a Los Angeles-area publishing company, and his appearance at its annual meeting is a chance to hear his views on a wide range of subjects. \nOn bitcoin, the technology might be interesting but the investing frenzy around it over the last year should have prompted a government crackdown like the one in China, he said. \"Our government's more lax approach to it is wrong. The right answer to something like that is to step on it hard.\" \nMunger also tried to preempt questions about Berkshire's biggest stock holding, Wells Fargo . The bank has been struggling with intense regulatory and media scrutiny since 2016, when a massive fake account scandal came to light. Since then, Wells has admitted it also sold car insurance to customers who didn't need it and improperly charged fees on some mortgage rate lock extensions. \nBerkshire owns $27 billion of Wells shares, about 9 percent. On Wednesday Munger said it was time for regulators to \"let up\" on it. \nThe bank had employee sales incentive systems that were too strong in the wrong direction and that it was too slow in reacting, he said. But it is working to fix the problems. \"I think Wells Fargo will be better off for having made those mistakes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T22:49:46.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
