The coalition holds a one-seat majority in parliament.\nTurnbull has called Joyce’s affair a “shocking error of judgment”.\nBroad said he would take up the issue of Joyce’s leadership at a party meeting in the capital, Canberra, on Monday.\nHis call is the latest sign that support for Joyce from within his rural-based party is eroding, amid concern disapproval of the affair could undermine support in state elections.\nA state branch of the party withdrew its support for Joyce this week because of the affair.\nTwo-thirds of voters want Joyce to resign over the affair, according to the Australian newspaper’s Newspoll.\nReporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T11:12:38.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
