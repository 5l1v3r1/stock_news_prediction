Its financial year ends in April.\nPurplebricks said that Thursday’s 7.5 percent share price decline was attributable to the research note published by Jefferies International, with which it took issue.\nThe company said it did not agree with the findings of the Jefferies report and contested its estimation of Purplebricks’ completion rate.\nReporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:18:59.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
