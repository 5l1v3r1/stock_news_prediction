In nominal terms, revenue increased by 1% year-over-year. In constant currencies, revenue decreased by 2% year-over-year. Net income was $675,000, with earnings per share (EPS) of $0.05.\nTravelzoo's Global CEO, Dr. Holger Bartel, commented: \"We will continue leveraging Travelzoo's trusted brand and worldwide relationships with top suppliers to negotiate more exclusive offers for Travelzoo members. High quality of every offer remains our top priority. We only present to our members offers which have passed a rigorous review and test booking.\"\nAsia Pacific\nAsia Pacific business segment revenue decreased 19% year-over-year to $2.0 million. Operating loss for the fourth quarter was $1.6 million, compared to an operating loss of $810,000 in the prior-year period. The fourth quarter 2017 operating loss was impacted by the cost of a severance payment to an executive in Asia Pacific.\nEurope\nEurope business segment revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $8.8 million. In constant currencies, revenue decreased 4% year-over-year. Operating profit for the fourth quarter was $764,000, or 9% of revenue, compared to operating income of $582,000, or 7% of revenue in the prior-year period.\nNorth America\nNorth America business segment revenue increased 2% year-over-year to $16.2 million. In constant currencies, revenue increased 1% year-over-year.

In Asia Pacific, unduplicated number of members was 3.6 million as of December 31, 2017, up 1% from December 31, 2016.

The fourth quarter 2017 income tax expense includes a $505,000 one-time net tax benefit as a result of a tax reserve release related to the completion of an IRS tax audit offset by the estimated impact of the new U.S. tax law. Beginning with the first quarter of 2018, Travelzoo's earnings are expected to benefit from the new reduced U.S. federal tax rate because the largest portion of the company's taxable income is in the U.S.\nAsset Management\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Travelzoo generated $4.0 million of cash from operating activities. Accounts receivable decreased by $2.6 million over the prior-year period to $11.8 million. Accounts payable decreased by $609,000 over the prior-year period to $19.1 million.
