McMaster, who are expected to visit Turkey next week. \nTurkish-U.S. ties have neared a breaking point recently over a number issues, including U.S. support for the YPG, the extradition of Gulen, accused by Ankara of masterminding a 2016 abortive putsch, and last month’s U.S. conviction of an executive from Turkey’s Halkbank for helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
