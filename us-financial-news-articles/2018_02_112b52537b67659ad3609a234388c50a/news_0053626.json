Researchers said that meant well-enforced policies could combat over-exploitation.\nAnd while most countries fish inside their own exclusive economic zones, it found just five countries - China, Spain, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea - account for 85 percent of fishing on the high seas.\nShips with AIS ping their identity and position every few seconds. But because only large vessels must have AIS, and as parts of the ocean are not covered by satellites, researchers said the true extent was likely higher than 55 percent.\nHeavily fished areas include the northeast Atlantic, northwest Pacific and areas off South America and West Africa.\nThe Southern Ocean, parts of the northeast Pacific and central Atlantic oceans, and the exclusive economic zones of many island states, showed much less activity - which could offer the chance to conserve marine life cheaply.\n“The world’s oceans are the ultimate common resource,” David Kroodsma, the study’s lead author and a director at Global Fishing Watch, a project focused on fishing resources, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\n“They cover 70 percent of the planet, produce half of the oxygen that we breathe and they’re a major protein source for hundreds of millions of people.”\nReporting by Thin Lei Win, Editing by Robert Carmichael; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, resilliance and climate change.
