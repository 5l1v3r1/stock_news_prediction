Davidson & Co wrote in a note.\nSome analysts said they were surprised by eBay’s estimate of the benefits from taking payments intermediary service in-house. The company said it would add $500 million to operating profit after the PayPal deal expires in mid-2020.\nTransactions through eBay account for roughly 13 percent of total payments processed by PayPal, whose shares sank more than 7 percent in response on Thursday.\nOther analysts, however, said PayPal, which has been eBay’s preferred provider for the past 15 years and will remain a payment page option on the platform for the foreseeable future, had the scale to ride out the blow.\n“Over time, given the recent agreements with Visa and MasterCard, PayPal will be able to scale and expand margins,” Wedbush Securities analyst said.
