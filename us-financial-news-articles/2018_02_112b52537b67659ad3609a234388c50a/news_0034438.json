We are present physically and digitally...speed of our digital acceleration is very strong,” said Credit Agricole chief executive Philippe Brassac.\nBrassac added that there is no profitable online-only bank and that he did not believe in a purely digital business model.\n$1 = 0.8080 euros Reporting by Maya Nikolaeva and Matthieu Protard Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:34:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
