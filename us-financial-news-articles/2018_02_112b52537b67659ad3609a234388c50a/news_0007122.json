C&DR will own 70% of the new company, while Atrium shareholders (which include funds managed by Golden Gate Capital) will control the remaining 30%.\nAccording to Freedonia Group Analyst Carolyn Zulandt , \"Ply Gem and Atrium are complementary businesses with broad window and door product offerings. The two companies attempted to merge over 20 years ago, but Ply Gem eventually terminated the agreement and accepted an offer from building products firm Nortek.\"\nZulandt further explains: \"This new combined company will benefit from improved production and distribution efficiencies, as well as advantages like shared technological expertise in a very competitive industry. Together, Ply Gem and Atrium should capture a share of the US window market that comes closer to that of industry giant Andersen than any other supplier.\"\nShe continues, \"The greater economies of scale and scope of the larger combined company should also make it a stronger competitor in the other building product markets served, which include doors, fencing, roofing, and siding.\"\nAdditional competitive analysis of key players in the US building products industry can be found in the following Freedonia reports: Windows Market in the US , Doors Market in the US ., Siding Market in the US , Fencing , and Low-Slope Roofing Market in the US .\nAbout The Freedonia Group – The Freedonia Group, a division of MarketResearch.com , is a leading international industrial research company publishing more than 100 studies annually.
