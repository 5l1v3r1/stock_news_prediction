The holiday, which falls on Monday, Feb. 19 this year, was initially established to honor George Washington, and the federal government still refers to the day as it was originally designated by law, calling it Washington’s Birthday . \nBut for those of you with an extra day off, Fortune broke down everything that is open and closed for Presidents’ Day 2018 —and also included some of the best holiday sales. Is the post office open on Presidents’ Day? \nMost non-essential government offices and schools are closed for the day. The post office is closed on Presidents’ Day and will not deliver the mail on Monday. Is the stock market open on Presidents’ Day? \nFinancial markets and bond markets are closed on Monday as well, so there will be no trading on exchanges like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. Are banks open on Monday? \nMost consumer banks are closed for President’s Day, too, though a few are still open including some branches of TD Bank. \nAnd while you won’t be able to take care of your banking needs with a teller, you will still be able to access ATMs, which are open at most banks 24/7. What is open? \nEven though most banks are closed for President’s Day, it’s a good day for consumers to open their wallets. Presidents’ Day is known a big shopping day as many retailers offer deep discounts on pricey items including appliances, electronics, furniture , and of course, cars . So you can thank George for saving you some Benjamins. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T15:31:58.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
