For the week, it has dropped 1.9 percent.\nThe broader Topix shed 0.9 percent to 1,853.89, with 32 of its 33 sectors falling.\nThe Bank of Japan on Friday conducted a special bond purchase operation to stem the rise in Japanese bond yields, offering to buy an unlimited amount of JGBs with more than five to ten years left to maturity.\nBank shares, which rose the previous day after some banks posted brisk earnings results, lost ground. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shed 1.8 percent, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group fell 1.4 percent and Mizuho Financial Group declined 1.2 percent.\nBucking the weakness, Kobe Steel jumped more than 9 percent after it reinstated its annual profit forecast.
