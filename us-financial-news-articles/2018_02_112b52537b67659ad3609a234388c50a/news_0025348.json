The World Health Organization recommends no more than 10 micrograms.\nXian, home of China’s Terracotta Army in the country’s northwest, was the worst-performing city in January.\nThe Pearl River delta region around Hong Kong also saw PM2.5 rise 3.9 percent year on year, data from the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) showed.\nChina saw unusually high levels of PM2.5 in the first two months of last year, where near-record pollution throughout northern China prompted dozens of cities in the region to declare a “red alert” to impose emergency traffic restrictions and close factories and schools.\nIn a bid to meet their 2017 targets after the early year pollution spike, 28 northern Chinese cities pledged to cut PM2.5 by 10-25 percent from October 2017 to March 2018, forcing them to curb industrial output, reduce vehicle traffic and slash coal consumption.\nThe measures saw PM2.5 emissions fall by an average of 33 percent to 77 micrograms from October last year to the end of January, the environment ministry said in a separate notice on Monday.\nIt said Beijing cut pollutants 58.3 percent over the period, while Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province, registered a 52.4 percent decline over the four months.\nChina’s anti-smog campaign has not been without controversy, with businesses complaining that Beijing’s “one size fits all” approach has harmed their interests.\nAn over-ambitious attempt to convert millions of households from coal- to natural gas-fired heating has also proved a major challenge, with many villages left without gas supplies during parts of the freezing winter.\nReporting by David Stanway; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T10:25:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
