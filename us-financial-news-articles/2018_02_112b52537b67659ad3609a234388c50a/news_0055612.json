(Nasdaq:AVHI), a developer and builder of residential communities in Florida, the Carolinas, Arizona and Texas, today announced results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7% to $280.8 million from $261.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net loss of $23.5 million, or $1.05 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a one-time charge of $32.5 million, or $1.44 per share related to the re-measurement of the net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding this one-time charge, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $8.9 million, or $0.40 per share. Net income and diluted income per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $17.1 million and $0.68 per share, respectively, and included only a nominal income tax provision due to the reversal of the valuation allowance of the deferred tax assets in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $27.1 million from $26.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“We are pleased with our strong fourth quarter results and the completion of another solid year of operating performance,” said Roger A. Cregg, President and Chief Executive Officer. “With net new orders up 25%, homes delivered up 2%, homebuilding revenue up 7%, and improved operating leverage, we generated over $15 million of pre-tax income for the fourth quarter.” Cregg continued, “The full year of 2017 was highlighted with increased market exposure to Raleigh, North Carolina, positioning AV Homes as one of the largest homebuilders in the Raleigh market, and entering the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas market, further expanding our geographic footprint.”\nThe increase in total revenue was driven by volume increases due to a greater number of communities with deliveries and higher average selling prices due to price increases and improvements in the mix of homes sold. During the Company delivered 826 homes, a 2% increase from the 808 homes delivered during the fourth quarter of 2016, and the average unit price per closing improved 5% to approximately $332,000 from approximately $317,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nHomebuilding gross margin was 16.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 17.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016 with margin improvements in Arizona being more than offset by margin reductions in Florida and the Carolinas. Homebuilding gross margin is inclusive of the impact associated with the expensing of previously capitalized interest of 2.6% in both 2017 and 2016.\nTotal SG&A expense as a percent of homebuilding revenue improved to 10.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 11.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenue was 9.5% in comparable to the fourth quarter of 2016. Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 1.7% in the same period a year ago and includes a favorable $1.2 million reversal of an earn out accrual related to performance targets of a prior acquisition not being achieved.\nThe number of new housing contracts signed, net of cancellations, during the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased 24.9% to 537, compared to 430 units during the same period in 2016. The increase in housing contracts was primarily attributable to the increase in selling communities to 61 from 58 and better absorption rates in Florida and Arizona. The average sales price on contracts signed in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 2.1% to approximately $331,000 from approximately $338,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016 driven by the 2017 acquisition of Savvy Homes in the Carolinas, which targets the first time buyer segment in Raleigh. The aggregate dollar value of the contracts signed during the fourth quarter increased 22.4% to $177.8 million, compared to $145.3 million during the same period one year ago. The backlog value of homes under contract but not yet closed as of December 31, 2017 increased to $236.8 million on 724 units, compared to $236.2 million on 703 units as of December 31, 2016.\nResults for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 8.2% to $843.3 million from $779.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss of $21.9 million, or $0.98 per share, in 2017 includes (i) a one-time charge of $32.5 million, or $1.44 per share related to the re-measurement of the net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and (ii) a $9.8 million, or $0.27 per share, charge from the extinguishment of debt related to the 2017 refinancing transaction. Excluding the one-time charges, adjusted net income was $16.6 million, or $0.74 per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $147.1 million and $5.66 per share, respectively, and includes the favorable impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset in the amount of $124.5 million, or $4.70 per share. Excluding that one-time charge, adjusted net income was $25.6 million, or $0.96 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 increased to $68.2 million from $67.9 million in 2016.\nThe increase in total revenue was driven by volume increases due to a greater number of communities with deliveries due to organic and acquisition-related growth, and higher average selling prices due to price increases and improvements in the mix of homes sold. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company delivered 2,491 homes, a 1.1% increase from the 2,465 homes delivered during the year ended December 31, 2016, and the average unit price per closing improved 6.5% to approximately $330,000 from approximately $310,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nHomebuilding gross margin was 16.9% in 2017 compared to 18.1% in 2016. Homebuilding gross margin is inclusive of the impact associated with the expensing of previously capitalized interest of 2.7% in both 2017 and 2016.\nTotal SG&A expense as a percent of homebuilding revenue improved to 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 13.1% in 2016. Homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 11.0% in 2016. The improvement was primarily due to the increased scale of the business in each of our divisions, which allows us to leverage the cost base. Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue was 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017, comparable to 2.1% in the same period a year ago.\nThe number of new housing contracts signed, net of cancellations, during the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 3.1% to 2,443, compared to 2,369 units during the same period in 2016. The increase in housing contracts was across all geographic segments, but the largest increase was attributable to the Carolinas. The average sales price on contracts signed during the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 2.8% to approximately $327,000 from approximately $318,000 in 2016. The aggregate dollar value of the contracts signed during 2017 increased 5.9% to $798.3 million, compared to $753.9 million during the same period one year ago.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company issued the following expectations for its financial performance in 2018:\nCommunities with closings are expected to be approximately 75; Closings are expected to increase 20% to approximately 3,000 units; Average Selling Price (ASP) on homes closed is expected to increase 3% to approximately $340,000; Homebuilding gross margin is expected to increase 100 bps to approximately 18%, inclusive of approximately 2.8% of previously capitalized interest cost; SG&A is expected to improve 10 bps to approximately 12.8% of homebuilding revenue; Interest expense is expected to be approximately $8 million; Income from mortgage company joint venture is expected to be approximately $1 million; Pre-tax income of approximately $48 million; Effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%, with minimal cash taxes paid due to the NOL position; Net income is expected to improve to approximately $36 million; Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 30% to approximately $90 million.\n“We begin 2018 with significant liquidity, positioning the company to take advantage of new community investments and potential acquisition opportunities to continue our long-term profitable growth strategy,” said Cregg.\nThe Company will hold a conference call and webcast on Friday, February 23, 2018 to discuss its fourth quarter and full year financial results.

The following table represents a reconciliation of the outlook for adjusted EBITDA for the full year ending December 31, 2018, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (in millions):\nFull Year Outlook 2018 Net income $ 36 Interest expense 8 Amortization of capitalized interest 28 Income tax expense 12 Depreciation and amortization 3 Amortization of share-based compensation 3 Adjusted EBITDA $ 90 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments including non-cash share-based compensation and loss on extinguishment of debt. This financial measure has been presented because the Company finds it important and useful in evaluating its performance and believes that it helps readers of the Company’s financial statements compare its operations with those of its competitors. Although management finds adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure in conducting and evaluating the Company’s operations, this measure has limitations as an analytical tool as it is not reflective of the actual profitability generated by the Company during the period. Management compensates for the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA by using this non-GAAP measure only to supplement the Company’s GAAP results and outlook. Due to the limitations discussed, adjusted EBITDA should not be viewed in isolation, as it is not a substitute for GAAP measures.\nAdjusted Earnings\nReported diluted earnings (loss) per share were $(1.05) and $0.68 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were $(0.98) and $5.66 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During each period presented, we recorded certain adjustments that impacted our net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share. These items primarily consist of the following (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net income\n(loss) Diluted Earnings (Loss)\nPer Share Net income Diluted Earnings\nPer Share As reported $ (23,545 ) $ 17,058 Effect of dilutive securities — 742 Diluted net income (loss) (23,545 ) $ (1.05 ) 17,800 $ 0.68 Remeasurement of deferred tax assets (lower federal tax rate) 32,484 1.44 — — Change in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets — — (6,475 ) (0.25 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt, net of tax (15 ) — — — As adjusted $ 8,924 $ 0.40 $ 11,325 $ 0.43\nTwelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net income\n(loss) Diluted Earnings (Loss)\nPer Share Net income Diluted Earnings\nPer Share As reported $ (21,936 ) $ 147,107 Effect of dilutive securities — 2,969 Diluted net income (loss) (21,936 ) $ (0.98 ) 150,076 $ 5.66 Remeasurement of deferred tax assets (lower federal tax rate) 32,484 1.44 — — Change in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets — — (124,525 ) (4.70 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt, net of tax 6,037 0.27 — — As adjusted $ 16,585 $ 0.74 $ 25,551 $ 0.96 Note: Amounts in tables above may not foot due to rounding.\nWe believe that presenting adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Our definition of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nSource:AV Homes, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5ce6b98b-9669-4ba6-8c0f-1eb6ef43ee12"], "published": "2018-02-23T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T00:54:14.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
