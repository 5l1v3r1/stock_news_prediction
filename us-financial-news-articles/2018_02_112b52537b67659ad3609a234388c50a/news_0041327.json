The overheating occurs when a driver keeps a foot on the brake while the car is idling in park. The company said it is unaware of any injuries or accidents related to this recall, which is limited to vehicles equipped with gear-shifters on their steering columns. In December, the unit said it would recall about 1.8 million trucks in the United States, Canada, Mexico and some other markets to fix a part if not operating could allow the driver to shift out of park without depressing the brake pedal.
