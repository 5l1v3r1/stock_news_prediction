The municipal bond market is roughly $3.8 trillion in size.\nThe termination of the tax break for interest earned on the debt is expected to generate $17.3 billion for the U.S. government between 2018 and 2027.\nCurrent debt refundings, which are done within the 90-day call date window, remain tax exempt.\nReporting By Karen Pierog; Editing by Daniel Bases and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T20:10:55.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
