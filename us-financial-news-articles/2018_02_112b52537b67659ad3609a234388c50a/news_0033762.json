There has been a lot of pressure from the athletes to take those competitions from them (the Russians), and they haven’t done that,” he added.\n“I think it’s a shame that they don’t listen to us athletes.”\nRussia’s Olympic Committee was banned from sending a team to Pyeongchang, but athletes who passed strict checks were invited to attend as Olympic Athletes from Russia under a neutral flag.\nSamuelsson, who narrowly missed out on a medal when he came fourth in Thursday’s 20km individual race, said that there was plenty of talk amongst athletes about the situation.\n“When we’re here at the Olympics we try to focus on these competitions,” he said.\n“But obviously we talk about it.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:46:07.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
