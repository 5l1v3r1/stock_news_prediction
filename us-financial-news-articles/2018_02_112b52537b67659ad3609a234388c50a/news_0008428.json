It was becoming an avalanche of regulations in every direction,” he said. “From a business community stand point this is quite transformational, there will be a lot of capital attracted to the U.S. because of that.” \nBP took a one-off charge of $900 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to adjust to new U.S. tax rules, though it expects a long-term boost from the corporate-friendly rates.
