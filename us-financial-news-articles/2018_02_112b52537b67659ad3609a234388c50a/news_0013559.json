Revenue came in well above Street forecasts. Monthly active users were up four percent over a year ago, though flat compared to the prior quarter. Daily active users were up 12 percent from a year before. \nRegeneron – Higher sales of the company's flagship eye drug Eylea helped Regeneron beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Regeneron earned an adjusted $5.23 per share, compared to estimates of $4.53 a share. Revenue beat expectations, as well. \nYum Brands – The restaurant operator posted adjusted quarterly profit that was 16 cents a share above estimates at 96 cents per share.

Separately, Yum announced it would buy a $200 million stake in food-delivery service GrubHub . \nCVS Health – CVS beat forecasts by 3 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.92 per share . Revenue topped estimates, as well. Comparable-store sales dropped by seven-tenths of a percent, however. CVS also announced pay raises for workers, crediting the positive financial impact of tax reform. \nViacom – Viacom posted a mixed quarter, beating bottom-line estimates by 9 cents a share at an adjusted $1.03 per share. Revenue fell short of forecasts, hurt by a drop in fees that the company collects from cable operators. \nT-Mobile US – T-Mobile reported adjusted quarterly profit of 48 cents per share, 9 cents a share above estimates. Revenue missed Street projections, however. The wireless service provider also said thanks to the new tax law, it doesn't expect to be a material cash tax payer until 2024, four years later than earlier forecasts. \n21st Century Fox – Fox beat estimates by 4 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly earnings of 42 cents per share.

The maker of robotic vacuum cleaners did say it expects to surpass the $1 billion revenue mark this year for the first time. \nYelp – Yelp said it would operate at a loss for 2018, due to expenses related to marketing and increased investments in its restaurant reservations system. \nAthenahealth – Athenahealth named former General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt as its chairman.
