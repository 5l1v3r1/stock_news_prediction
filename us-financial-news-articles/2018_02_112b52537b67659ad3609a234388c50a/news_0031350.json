He has loosened social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious police and permitting public concerts. The government announced plans to allow women to drive this year.\nValentine’s Day has in the past been usually preceded by a clampdown from the religious police, ordering florists and other shopkeepers to remove items associated with the festival.\nBut last year, the force was barred from pursuing suspects or making arrests.\nFlorists said they easily sold red roses and bouquets on Wednesday and Thursday without getting into trouble.\n“I didn’t expect this,” one flower seller laughed. “It’s not like past years, people are comfortable buying (red flowers).”\n“That’s it, it’s over,” he added.\nSheikh al-Ghamdi is known for his liberal stances. He published a paper in 2009 questioning the legality of gender segregation in Islam, as enforced by the Commission.\nHe was sacked from his position but the decision was quickly reversed. In 2010, he said he did not consider it wrong for women to drive.\nAl-Ghamdi resigned soon afterwards, going on to create uproar in 2014 when he said that while women should dress modestly, the full face veil was not necessary.\nHe appeared on television with his wife, she wearing the traditional black long robe and headscarf, but with her face uncovered.\nReporting by Sarah Dadouch; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:31:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
