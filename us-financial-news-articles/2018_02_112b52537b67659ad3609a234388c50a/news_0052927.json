It already has a 5 million ton strategic reserved stored at three locations.\n“The way we have done an arrangement with ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) for storage facility, the same way we are discussing with Aramco (Saudi Aramco),” Pradhan said.\nIndia and Saudi Arabia also discussed investment opportunities in a proposed oil refinery on the west coast of India with a capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day and a petrochemicals project in the southern city of Kakinada, Pradhan said.\n“They are more than interested, we are discussing the nitty gritty of the projects ” he said.\nSaudi Aramco, world’s biggest oil producer, is investing in refineries abroad to help lock in demand for its crude and expand its market share ahead of its planned initial public offering.\nLast year Saudi Arabia pledged billions of dollars of investment in projects in Indonesia and Malaysia as part of long-term oil supply deals.\nReporting by Nidhi Verma; editing by Christian Schmollinger and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:34:13.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
