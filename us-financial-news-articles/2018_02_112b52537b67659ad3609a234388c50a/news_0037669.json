But after the U.S. inflation data, which showed a measure of underlying inflation posting its biggest gain in a year, sterling skidded again, falling more than half a percent on the day to $1.3801.\nSterling had strengthened on Tuesday after data showed British inflation unexpectedly stayed near its six-year high in January, firming up investors’ bets that the Bank of England will raise interest rates again in May.\nThe BoE surprised financial markets last week by indicating that rates could move up faster than previously expected, as the Bank wanted to bring inflation back to its target of two percent within two years rather than three.\nIn a Reuters poll taken after the BoE’s policy meeting last week, 32 of 57 economists said the Bank would raise its key rate to 0.75 percent in May, when it publishes its next quarterly Inflation Report.\nIn a January poll, only 13 of 71 economists had a rate hike in their forecasts for next quarter.\nWages numbers due next Wednesday will be closely eyed.\nGraphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\nGraphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv\nReporting by Jemima Kelly, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T14:40:14.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
