It’s centered in the U.S., but it’s a global phenomenon,” said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group.\n“This data coming in at a slightly faster tick than we were expecting just supports that narrative that actually global inflation is on the rise and that interest rates are probably going to have to follow suit,” Lawler added.\nTrading was apprehensive as concerns around higher inflation and rising bond yields have been a driver of the recent sell-off across global equity markets.\nLast week the FTSE posted its biggest weekly loss since the beginning of 2016, ending the week at a 13-month low.\nA firmer pound kept a lid on gains for heavyweight, international earners such as Unilever, Imperial Brands and AstraZeneca, which all fell.\nGains for mining firms helped limit losses, however, with firmer metals prices driving gains in Glencore, Anglo American and Antofagasta.\nTravel group TUI was a notable riser, its shares up more than 5 percent and at a record high after the company said that summer trading was very good.\n“What’s really driving the shares to fresh record highs ... is likely lower debt and improved underlying profitability,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.\nA positive broker note boosted shares in engineering group Smiths Group, up around 1 percent.\nAnalysts at Barclays began their coverage of the stock with an “overweight” rating, saying that they have seen a positive change in cash flow at the business.\nReporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:44:31.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
