The local government said they already represent 10 percent of the population, or around 40,000 people, stressing public services. \nPresident Michel Temer flew to Boa Vista on Monday with some ministers and government officials for meetings with local authorities to better assess the situation. \nHe promised to provide financial assistance for Roraima and to organize the flow of Venezuelans inside Brazil, including the possibility of transporting some of the refugees to other states. \nMany of the people coming from crisis-hit Venezuela have walked hundreds of kilometers to reach Boa Vista and have been sleeping in squares and other precarious areas in the city. \nLocal authorities said they have no financial resources to deal with the influx alone. Temporary shelters are full. \nLast week, a house where dozens of Venezuelans were living in Boa Vista was set on fire by a Brazilian man, who was later arrested. \nTemer said after the meeting that the government will not forbid the entrance, but will try to organize the flow. \nReporting by Marcelo TeixeiraEditing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T21:49:13.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
