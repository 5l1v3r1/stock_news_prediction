It says a string of senior Justice Department officials signed off on this. \nThe memo has become a flashpoint in a battle between Republicans and Democrats over Mueller’s criminal probe, which is also believed to be looking into any attempts to impede the investigation. \nDemocrats say Trump’s allies hope to use the memo to \nprotect the president and possibly to give him a reason to fire Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who hired Mueller and so would be the person to dismiss him, or even Mueller himself. \nAsked by reporters on Friday if he had confidence in Rosenstein, Trump replied, “You figure that one out.” \n“A lot of people should be ashamed,” Trump said of the findings in the document. \nTrump has repeatedly complained about Mueller’s investigation, denying any collusion or obstruction of justice. Moscow has denied any election meddling. \nIn a Twitter message on Friday, Trump accused top U.S. law enforcement officers - some of whom he appointed himself - of politicizing investigations. \nIt was his latest attack on top justice officials. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May last year. Comey later told a congressional hearing that he believed his removal was an effort by Trump to undermine the Russia probe. \nSenator John McCain, who is regarded as a heavyweight in Congress on foreign affairs, strongly criticized his fellow Republicans and Trump for attacking the FBI and the Justice Department. \n“Our nation’s elected officials, including the president, must stop looking at this investigation through the warped lens of politics and manufacturing partisan sideshows. If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin’s job for him,” McCain said in a statement, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas \nThe document, commissioned by the Republican chairman of the House intelligence panel, Devin Nunes, uses the case of investigations into Trump campaign aide Carter Page, saying the FBI used a biased source to justify surveillance on him. \nIt alleges that a dossier of Trump-Russia contacts compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, and funded in part by U.S. Democrats, formed an “essential part” of requests to a special court to be allowed to conduct electronic surveillance on Page that began in October, 2016. \nIt says the initial application and subsequent renewal applications, signed off on by various senior Justice Department officials including Rosenstein, did not mention the link between Steele and the Democrats. \nIt also portrays Steele as biased, saying he “was passionate about him (Trump) not being president.” \nThe memo largely repeated allegations that Nunes and others had made publicly previously and did not appear to include major surprises. \nTwo days ago, in a rare public rebuke of the president and Republicans in Congress who were pushing to release the memo, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had “grave concerns about material omissions of fact” in the document and it should not be made public.

His office said he backed making the Democrats’ rebuttal public if it does not reveal intelligence gathering sources or methods. \nDemocrats say their counter-memo restores context and information left out of the Republican version. Republicans have resisted releasing that document. Reporting by Steve Holland, Susan Heavey, Warren Strobel, Doina Chiacu, Sarah N.
