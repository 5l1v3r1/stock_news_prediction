(NASDAQ:DOVA), a pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug candidates for rare diseases where there is a high unmet need, today reported its operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Recent Highlights\nNew Drug Application (NDA) for avatrombopag accepted for filing and granted Priority Review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for an FDA decision is May 21, 2018.\nAnnounced plans to submit an sNDA in the second half of 2018 for the treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2018 for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT).\nContinued build-out of sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities in preparation of the anticipated U.S. launch of avatrombopag in the third quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals.\nAppointed Mark W. Hahn as Chief Financial Officer and hired Bill L. Nichols as Head of U.S. Sales.\nAlex Sapir, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dova, commented, “The highlight of the fourth quarter was acceptance of avatrombopag with Priority Review by the FDA. This designation represents a validation of the need for a novel therapy for the more than 70,000 CLD patients with severe thrombocytopenia in the United States. Dova remains focused on gaining FDA approval for avatrombopag and developing the commercial infrastructure to support the potential launch of the product.”\nMr. Sapir continued, “In addition, Dova continues to make progress towards expanding the use of avatrombopag in several follow-on indications, including a broader population of patients scheduled to undergo surgery as well as CIT. We expect to begin enrollment in these additional clinical trials in the first half of 2018.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results\nDova reported a net loss of $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $7.6 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, Dova reported net loss of $30.0 million.\nResearch and development expenses were $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $6.9 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 Phase 3 clinical trials in January 2017. For full year 2017, research and development expenses were $15.7 million, including $1.0 million of licenses acquired.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to building Dova’s commercial infrastructure to support the potential launch for avatrombopag as well as additional costs necessary for operating as a public entity. For full year 2017, general and administrative expenses were $13.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Dova had $94.8 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $28.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the receipt of $78.7 million of net proceeds from Dova’s initial public offering, which closed in July 2017, partially offset by operating expenses.\nCompany to Host Conference Call\nDova will host a conference call today, February 15, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. EST to discuss fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as recent operational highlights.
