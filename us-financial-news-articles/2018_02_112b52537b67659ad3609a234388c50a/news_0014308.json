REUTERS/Eric Gaillard \nThe Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA) may just have provided a ray of sunshine for organisers on Wednesday, however. \n“According to our forecast the temperature will not be problematic to have the opening ceremony,” KMA Deputy Director Choi Heung-jin told reporters. \nTemperatures would range from minus 2 to minus 5 Celsius (28.4-23 F) which would not be overly concerning, he added. \nYoon Hee-dong, director of the KMA’s forecast bureau, said spectators coming to Gangwon province should realise that it was colder than other parts of Korea and that they should “bundle up” and take other precautions to keep the cold at bay.
