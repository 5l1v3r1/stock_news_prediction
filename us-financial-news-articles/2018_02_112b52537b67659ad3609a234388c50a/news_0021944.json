The results will be announced on March 4. \nMerkel’s decision to relinquish the finance ministry has irritated some members of her conservative bloc, where Schaeuble enjoys almost cult status for his championing of strict budget rules. \nSome conservatives are also unhappy with her decision to allow the SPD to spend a record budget surplus and to embrace their demands for European reform. \nThe SPD have criticized the “forced austerity” on southern European countries like Greece and had vowed in the election campaign to boost investments. \nSeeking to allay conservative concerns that the next government would spend beyond its means, Scholz said the SPD were also for sound finances and would preserve Schaeuble’s balanced budget policy. \nThe SPD had said before the election they would sit in opposition but reversed the decision not to renew the alliance with the conservatives that had ruled Germany since 2013 after Merkel failed to form a coalition with two smaller parties. \nThe four-year government programme agreed by the two parties was welcomed by senior EU officials. \nIt stresses Germany’s commitment to the EU’s strict budget rules, calls for the euro zone’s ESM bailout fund to be turned into a full-blown European Monetary Fund, and for funding to shield the euro zone from crises.
