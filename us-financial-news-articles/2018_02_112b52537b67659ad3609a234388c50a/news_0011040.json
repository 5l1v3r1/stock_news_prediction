The Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service said stone-throwers had clashed with the soldiers.

The military said the suspect was not apprehended in the operation and seven people were detained for questioning. \nEarlier on Tuesday, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian gunman in the West Bank village of Yamoun and said he was the head of a militant cell responsible for an ambush in which a Jewish settler was shot dead on Jan. 9. \nIsrael had been looking for the final member of the cell which it said killed Rabbi Raziel Shevah in a drive-by shooting. Commandos had already killed one of the gunmen involved and captured another.
