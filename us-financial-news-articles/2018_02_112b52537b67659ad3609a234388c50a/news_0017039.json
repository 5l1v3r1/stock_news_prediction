However some of them held onto their (gold) positions in case there was a deeper stock market correction,” said Miguel Perez-Santalla vice president of Heraeus Precious Metals.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow industrials confirmed they were in correction territory later on Thursday, both falling more than 10 percent from their Jan. 26 record highs.\nGold prices are expected to remain pressured short-term, according to Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered bank.\n“We continue to expect prices to remain under pressure in Q1-2018 and forecast prices to average $1,300 per ounce during the quarter, if equity markets endure further downside risk, gold is likely to be called upon as a liquid asset before it benefits from a flight to safety,” Cooper said.
