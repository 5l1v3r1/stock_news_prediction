More than half said their houses were damaged or totally destroyed and only 1 percent said they knew for sure their houses were available for return.\nOne in five people who left a third camp came back later after facing retribution and threats in their areas of origin.\n“It’s tragic to think that people feel safer in camps than in their homes when this conflict has supposedly ended,” said Petr Kostohryz, Iraq country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the aid groups that compiled the report.\n“There can be no hope for peace in Iraq if the authorities cannot guarantee that people can go back home safely.”\nThe government’s spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment on the report, which the International Rescue Committee and the Danish Refugee Council also helped to compile.\nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi said this month that some forced returns may have taken place but that they were “individual cases” and the result of decisions by specific provincial governors as opposed to federal government policy.\nReuters reported last month that Iraqi security forces were forcibly returning civilians from refugee camps to unsafe areas in Anbar province.\nIn one case a woman was killed when an explosive went off in the home she was forced to return to. Her daughter was badly burned and her husband lost one eye and sustained severe injuries in another.\nReporting by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T18:38:09.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
