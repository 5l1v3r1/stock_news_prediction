( bit.ly/2FrrgSn )\nHDFC Bank, the biggest of the Indian private sector lenders and second-biggest overall by assets, has been ordered to investigate the issue and take action against those responsible within three months and report back to SEBI.\nAn HDFC Bank spokesman said he had yet to read the order, but added the bank would comply with it.\n“We’re a conscientious, law-abiding company with the highest standards of corporate governance,” he said.\nSEBI had sent a direction to Axis Bank on the issue in December asking it to conduct a similar inquiry. The bank said it would work with SEBI to investigate the matter and take action as needed.\nThe Reuters report has sparked a broad SEBI investigation since December, including raids on brokers’ homes that resulted in the confiscation of laptops and mobile phones.\nReporting by Abhirup Roy; Editing by Euan Rocha and Alison Williams\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T00:17:39.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
