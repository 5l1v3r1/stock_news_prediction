Obviously I’m quite fair skinned. But just because I’m not dark skinned, it doesn’t mean I’m not Aboriginal and don’t embrace my heritage.\n”I know who I am, I know how I’ve grown up, I’ve always been a part of it, I can’t let anyone else tell me otherwise.\n“I think some people, they know who they are, I guess, but they can sort of see me now and think ‘Oh wow, he proved us wrong’.”\nThere are some 700,000 Aborigines in a population of 23 million in Australia and their ancestors date back about 50,000 years before British colonisers arrived.\nThey suffer disproportionately high rates of suicide, alcohol abuse, domestic violence and imprisonment.\nTens of thousands took to the streets in cities on Australia Day on Jan. 26, the country’s national holiday, to protest against the celebration of the start of white colonisation and persecution of Aboriginals 230 years ago.\nWindsor said he was well aware of Aboriginal discontent but also very much focused on his Olympic preparations with Alexandrovskaya, with whom he shared a junior world title in Taiwan last year.\n“I think both of us are just taking it one step at a time,” he said.\n“We’re trying not to think about the big picture too much because then it could make us lose focus.”\nEditing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:08:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
