Euro zone finance ministers will vote on Feb. 19 for the ECB candidate, ahead of a European Parliament hearing and final appointment by EU leaders. \nDe Guindos, 58, may face some opposition due to his close alignment with hardline German positions throughout the European economic crisis. \nMeanwhile, euro zone sources contacted by Reuters have expressed concerns that his election as a southern European from a so-called periphery economy could mean, in the name of balance, Draghi would be replaced by a northern European from a core economy in 2019. \nLane’s selection would be first time Ireland was represented on the ECB board since the euro zone’s inception in 1999. Spain was represented in Frankfurt by Jose Manuel Gonzalez Paramo until he left in 2012. POLITICIAN VS ECONOMIST \nDe Guindos has been Spain’s economy minister since the conservative People’s Party (PP), headed by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, won the 2011 election and has helped steer the country though its worst economic crisis in decades. \nBefore taking the helm at the Economy Ministry, de Guindos worked as a head of the financial sector in PricewaterhouseCoopers in Madrid and as head of Nomura Securities and Lehman Brothers in the Iberian peninsular before that. \nUnder him as economy minister, European authorities orchestrated a rescue of Spain’s then sixth-biggest lender, Banco Popular, in early June 2017, the first time a bank in the euro zone was wound down according to the new resolution framework. The ECB became the single supervisor for around 120 banks in the euro zone in November of 2014. \nAt a time when the ECB is working on a draft of new measures targeting soured loans on bank balance sheets, de Guindos can be credited for helping Spain’s financial sector reduce its non-performing loans to around 8 percent. \nLane, meanwhile, has acted as an academic consultant for the European Commission, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and a number of central banks, including the ECB. \nThe European Parliament is also calling for governments to propose a female candidate and Spain’s Socialists called on Tuesday for Rajoy to propose a female technocrat. There is one woman on the six-member board and two on the ECB’s 25-member governing council.
