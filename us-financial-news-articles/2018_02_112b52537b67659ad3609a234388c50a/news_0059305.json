Performance Measures\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA as performance measures.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is our key performance measure and provides the CODM with the information necessary to assess operational performance, as well as make resource and allocation decisions. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income attributable to shareholders, adjusted (a) to exclude the impact of provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition and transaction expenses, losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations, changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments, asset impairment charges, incentive allocations, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, (b) to include the impact of cash income tax payments, and our pro-rata share of the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) from unconsolidated entities, and (c) to exclude the impact of the non-controlling share of Adjusted Net Income (Loss). We evaluate investment performance for each reportable segment primarily based on Adjusted Net Income (Loss). We believe that net income attributable to shareholders, as defined by GAAP, is the most comparable earnings measurement with which to reconcile Adjusted Net Income.\nThe following table presents our consolidated reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to shareholders to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the three months ended and year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders $ 3,010 $ (1,813 ) $ 134 $ (20,064 ) Add: Provision for income taxes 369 73 1,954 268 Add: Equity-based compensation expense (income) 648 146 1,343 (3,672 ) Add: Acquisition and transaction expenses 2,242 1,694 7,306 6,316 Add: Losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations — — 2,456 1,579 Add: Changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments 14 — (1,022 ) 3 Add: Asset impairment charges — — — 7,450 Add: Pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Loss from unconsolidated entities (1) (2 ) (1,461 ) (1,601 ) (2,905 ) Add: Incentive allocations 514 — 514 — Less: Cash payments for income taxes (693 ) (60 ) (1,726 ) (654 ) Less: Equity in losses of unconsolidated entities 140 4,657 1,601 5,992 Less: Non-controlling share of Adjusted Net Income (2) (55 ) (54 ) (558 ) (2,945 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) $ 6,187 $ 3,182 $ 10,041 $ (8,632 )\n(1) Pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Loss from unconsolidated entities includes the Company’s proportionate share of the unconsolidated entities’ net income adjusted for the excluded and included items detailed in the table above.\n(2) Non-controlling share of Adjusted Net Income is comprised of the following for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) equity-based compensation of $51 and $47 and (ii) provision for income tax of $4 and $7, respectively.\nNon-controlling share of Adjusted Net Income is comprised of the following for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) equity-based compensation of $169 and $(1,561), (ii) provision for income tax of $16 and $29, (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt of $0 and $616, (iv) asset impairment charges of $0 and $3,725, (v) transaction and acquisition expense of $0 and $156, and (vi) changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments of $404 and $0, less (vii) cash tax payments of $31 and $20, respectively.\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA as a secondary measurement to Adjusted Net Income (Loss), which we believe serves as a useful supplement to investors, analysts and management to measure economic performance of deployed revenue generating assets between periods on a consistent basis, and which we believe measures our financial performance and helps identify operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely our cost structure and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other entities may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to shareholders, adjusted (a) to exclude the impact of provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition and transaction expenses, losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations, changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments, asset impairment charges, incentive allocations, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense, (b) to include the impact of our pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, and (c) to exclude the impact of equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and the non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended and year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders $ 3,010 $ (1,813 ) $ 134 $ (20,064 ) Add: Provision for income taxes 369 73 1,954 268 Add: Equity-based compensation expense (income) 648 146 1,343 (3,672 ) Add: Acquisition and transaction expenses 2,242 1,694 7,306 6,316 Add: Losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations — — 2,456 1,579 Add: Changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments 14 — (1,022 ) 3 Add: Asset impairment charges — — — 7,450 Add: Incentive allocations 514 — 514 — Add: Depreciation and amortization expense (3) 28,842 17,580 96,417 65,657 Add: Interest expense 17,535 3,118 38,827 18,957 Add: Pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities (4) (34 ) (677 ) (243 ) 1,196 Less: Equity in losses of unconsolidated entities 140 �� 4,657 1,601 5,992 Less: Non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA (5) (5,491 ) (2,339 ) (12,763 ) (14,653 ) Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 47,789 $ 22,439 $ 136,524 $ 69,029\n(3) Depreciation and amortization expense includes $25,728 and $16,916 of depreciation and amortization expense, $1,221 and $422 of lease intangible amortization, and $1,893 and $242 of amortization for lease incentives in the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes $88,110 and $60,210 of depreciation and amortization expense, $4,716 and $4,979 of lease intangible amortization, and $3,591 and $467 of amortization for lease incentives in the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n(4) Pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities includes the following items for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) net loss of $187 and $4,686, (ii) interest expense of $135 and $391, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense of $18 and $550, and (iv) asset impairment charges of $0 and $3,068, respectively.\nPro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities includes the following items for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) net loss of $1,786 and $6,161, (ii) interest expense of $785 and $1,323, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense of $758 and $2,966, and (iv) asset impairment charges of $0 and $3,068, respectively.\n(5) Non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of the following items for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) equity based compensation of $51 and $47, (ii) provision for income taxes of $4 and $7, (iii) interest expense of $3,542 and $630, and (iv) depreciation and amortization expense of $1,894 and $1,655, respectively.\nNon-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of the following items for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) equity based compensation of $169 and $(1,561), (ii) provision for income taxes of $16 and $29, (iii) interest expense of $5,030 and $5,124, (iv) depreciation and amortization expense of $7,144 and $6,564, (v) changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments of $404 and $0, (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt of $0 and $616, (vii) asset impairment charge of $0 and $3,725, and (vii) transaction and acquisition expense of $0 and $156, respectively.\nWe use Funds Available for Distribution (“FAD”) in evaluating its ability to meet its stated dividend policy. FAD is not a financial measure in accordance with GAAP. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FAD is net cash provided by operating activities. We believe FAD is a useful metric for investors and analysts for similar purposes.\nWe define FAD as: Net Cash Provided by operating activities plus principal collections on finance leases, proceeds from sale of assets, and return of capital distributions from unconsolidated entities, less required payments on debt obligations and capital distributions to non-controlling interest, and excluding changes in working capital.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Cash from Operating Activities to FAD for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nYear Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 68,497 $ 30,903 Add: Principal Collections on Finance Leases 473 2,513 Add: Proceeds from Sale of Assets (1) 121,419 94,875 Add: Return of Capital Distributions from Unconsolidated Entities — 432 Less: Required Payments on Debt Obligations (2) (8,368 ) (53,668 ) Less: Capital Distributions to Non-Controlling Interest (254 ) — Exclude: Changes in Working Capital (4,515 ) 1,730 Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) $ 177,252 $ 76,785\n(1) Proceeds from sale of assets includes $500 received in December 2015 for a deposit on the sale of a commercial jet engine, which was completed in the year ended December 31, 2016.\n(2) Required payments on debt obligations for the year ended December 31, 2017 excludes $100,000 repayment of the Term Loan, $95,000 repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and $21,855 repayment of the CMQR Credit Agreement, and for the year ended December 31, 2016 excludes $98,750 repayment upon the termination of the Jefferson Terminal Credit Agreement and $7,748 repayment under the CMQR Credit Agreement which were voluntary refinancing as repayment of these amounts were not required at this time.\nThe following tables set forth a reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to FAD for the three months ended and year ended December 31, 2017:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands) Equipment\nLeasing Infrastructure Corporate Total Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) $ 79,077 $ (16,301 ) $ (15,527 ) $ 47,249 Less: Principal Collections on Finance Leases (126 ) Less: Proceeds from Sale of Assets (34,275 ) Less: Return of Capital Distributions from Unconsolidated Entities — Add: Required Payments on Debt Obligations — Add: Capital Distributions to Non-Controlling Interest 254.0 Include: Changes in Working Capital 2,952 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 16,054", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_DhDcirfjVxjSn3kIgsAFFh3pEneQNtFBPX3Rnnd3EL5Lwr85Avk-4eZbZ5Zsjo7GAV2EsHiuXgaPprPwPMxG1hPK6bqRR9s7DMor49LCIQ="], "published": "2018-02-28T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:17:52.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
