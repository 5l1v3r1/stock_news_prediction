January is traditionally a strong month for house prices and December relatively weak on a seasonal basis, Valueguard said in a commentary.\nCompared to a year ago, prices were down 2.2 percent.\nApartment prices fell 6.1 percent year-on year, while single-family home prices were up 0.3 percent.\nProperty prices in the Nordic country have boomed over the past two decades and Swedish households are among the most indebted in Europe.\nSwedish authorities as well as the European Commission and the International Monetary fund, have warned the high debt levels are a serious threat to the economy.\nThe HOX index is based on a statistical model that compensates for different types of homes sold during various periods to give a better picture of underlying price trends.
