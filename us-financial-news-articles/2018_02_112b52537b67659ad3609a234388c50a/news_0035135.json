It did not elaborate further.\nThe industry and trade ministry declined to comment on defense spending, saying only that the decline in industrial output was caused by a number of factors, including a global deal to reduce oil output and unseasonably warm weather.\n“It would not be right or correct to talk now about some kind of long-term tendencies in industrial production,” the ministry said, reiterating a forecast for 1.5-2 percent growth this year.\nAndrei Klepach, a former official at the economy ministry and now chief economist at state development bank VEB, said investment in the categories of ‘state management and military security’ fell 38 percent in the third quarter after growing 52 percent in the second quarter, in year-on-year terms.\nThat was reflected in a fall in production of military equipment, among other areas, he said. Klepach declined to elaborate further on the breakdown as the information is classified.\nAn analyst at a major state bank in Moscow said state spending on the defense sector totaled 3.1 percent of GDP in 2017, down from 4.4 percent in the previous year.\n“Industrial output did not accelerate in late 2017 as there was no support from state defense procurement,” he said.\nThe defense ministry did not reply to a request for comment.\n($1 = 57.9655 roubles)\nAdditional reporting by Gleb Stolyarov and Polina Nikolskaya; Writing by Jack Stubbs; Editing by Katya Golubkova and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:45:47.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
