DiFucci added that his bullish call is likely supported by better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales performance.\nShares of Salesforce rallied 3.76 percent Thursday; the stock is up 38.5 percent in the past 12 months.\nThe analyst anticipates new subscription annualized contractual value — a key metric for the company — was likely robust across all regions and should result in 23 percent billings growth. DiFucci was also quick to point out that relaxed competitive pressure is a positive.\n\"Heightened competitive pressures from Microsoft , which we started observing in the August quarter of 2016 for five survey rounds, may have waned for a couple of quarters,\" DiFucci wrote. \"In five consecutive survey rounds starting in the August-ended 2016 quarter, we had observed a significant uptick in the percentage of surveyed partners that indicated Microsoft is Salesforce.com's biggest competitive threat, to about 70 percent or higher, versus 60 percent or lower in historical survey rounds. Since last quarter, however, that percentage dipped has below 60 percent again.\"\nSalesforce will report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 28.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T15:21:45.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
