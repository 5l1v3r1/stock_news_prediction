His arrival at the post will further enhance Boao’s international influence and its role as a multilateral international arena,” a government policy adviser said.\nThe Boao Forum for Asia, a non-governmental and non-profit organization, is modeled after the World Economic Forum held annually in Davos.\nThe forum has been held annually since 2002, bringing together government and business leaders and academia to discuss issues ranging from economics to the environment, society, integration and cooperation.\nPresident Xi Jinping may grace the forum this year which is expected to attract more foreign heads of state, two of the sources said.\nFILE PHOTO: Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of the People's Bank of China, attends a news conference during the ongoing National People's Congress (NPC), China's parliament, in Beijing China March 10, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo Boao, the PBOC, the State Council Information Office - the cabinet spokesman’s office - did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment.\nZHOU‘S SUCCESSOR\nZhou took the helm of the People’s Bank of China when China’s economy - then the world’s sixth largest - began to take off following its entry into the World Trade Organization.\nChina became the world’s second-biggest economy in 2010.\nUnder Zhou, the PBOC has emerged as a powerful player in the policy-making process, even though the central bank still lacks the independence of institutions like the U.S. Federal Reserve and needs cabinet approval to change interest rates or the value of yuan.\nIn October, Zhou sounded alarm bells on risks that could lead to a “Minsky moment”, referring to a sudden collapse in asset prices after long periods of growth, sparked by debt or currency pressures.\nZhou’s Western-style hobbies -- he is an connoisseur of high-end whisky and an opera buff known to sneak out to performances while on official visits overseas -- and the belief that China has much to learn about market reforms from the United States have made him vulnerable to ideological attacks.\nSpeculation has been rife for months over the choice of the next central bank governor.\nReuters reported on Feb. 23 that Liu He, a Harvard trained economist who is a trusted confidant of President Xi, has emerged the front runner to be the next central bank governor.\nBefore the Communist Party’s 19th congress last October, sources told Reuters that banking regulator Guo Shuqing and veteran banker Jiang Chaoliang were leading contenders for the PBOC job.\nReporting by Kevin Yao and Benjamin Kang Lim; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:08:58.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
