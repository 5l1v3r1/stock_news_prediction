The Airports Authority said the service would begin in early March. \nAir India was awaiting clearance from the Indian aviation regulator to fly over Saudi Arabia, the spokesman said. \nIsraeli media, in unsourced reports, said Riyadh had granted the necessary flyover rights, which would shorten the flight time from New Delhi by more than two hours. \nA spokesman for Saudi’s General Authority of Civil Aviation said the agency had not granted any permission to Air India.

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files \nIndia and Israel have built close ties over the years, largely centred on arms purchases, away from the public eye. \nBut under Narendra Modi, whose nationalist party has long admired Israel for its tough approach to terrorism, ties have flowered across the economy and last year he made a first-ever visit to Israel by an Indian prime minister. \nAnd Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited India last month, the first such trip in 15 years. \nEl Al Israel Airlines, the country’s flag carrier, flies four weekly flights to Mumbai but these take seven hours rather than five as they take a route south towards Ethiopia and then east to India, avoiding Saudi airspace. \nIsrael’s Tourism Ministry said it will grant Air India 750,000 euros for flying the new route, as part of its policy of increasing the number of airlines flying to Israel. \nAir India had made a similar request for slots to Israeli authorities last year but never followed through, as circumventing Saudi airspace was not economically viable.
