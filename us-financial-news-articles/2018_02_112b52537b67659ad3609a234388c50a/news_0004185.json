Companies including candy sellers, pharmaceutical distributors and agriculture suppliers have been pointing to higher shipping costs that shaved profits in the most recent quarter, and the WSJ’s Austen Hufford writes that several businesses say they are girding for still higher costs this year. Tight trucking capacity is only part of the story: Shippers including Prestige Brand Holdings Inc. and Hershey Co. HSY 0.29% also point to pressures from higher warehousing costs and rising diesel fuel prices that are trimming margins. Cardboard maker Packaging Corp. of America PKG -0.69% says higher shipping costs sliced 4 cents a share from its adjusted fourth-quarter profit. The companies are moving faster to tap into growing U.S. and global economies but the transportation costs probably haven’t peaked yet. While truckers are adding capacity, they’re also setting plans to embed the higher rates in the spot market into new shipping contracts this year.\nUnited Parcel Service Inc. is trying to ensure it isn’t caught short-handed again by unexpected surges in volume. The parcel giant is scaling up its capital spending to $7 billion this year, the WSJ’s Paul Ziobro reports. The company is moving to bolster its operations in the air and on the ground after a tough fourth quarter that saw the company whip-sawed between fast-rising demand and the soaring costs of handling a flood of packages. UPS says it spent an extra $125 million as it scrambled to lease trucks and planes while clearing away backlogs early in the peak season. The company’s overall operating profit rose 3.2% in the fourth quarter, well behind the 11% gain in revenue. New upgrades include expanded automation at sorting centers and 18 jumbo jets, including 14 Boeing Co. 747-8 freighters. That will give UPS more capacity to handle any growth in the near future, and it will speed up an digital commerce-driven overhaul of U.S. distribution networks.\nAmazon.com Inc. is starting to focus on reining back costs now that it’s built an online juggernaut. The Seattle company’s quarterly profit during the all-important holiday quarter topped $1 billion for the first time, as Amazon demonstrated a stronger fiscal discipline that it plans to extend this year. The WSJ’s Laura Stevens reports the strong performance came with better efficiency at the company’s burgeoning network of fulfillment centers , and that Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky expects more cost cutting and productivity moves, “specifically in our warehouses.” The company is still expanding at a rapid rate, but revenue growth in the fourth quarter still outpaced costs, while the 31% increase in shipping expenses was slower than the growth in recent quarters—a notable achievement during the busy holiday period. Shipping costs have more than doubled in three years but Amazon now wants to keep its sales expanding at a fast pace while pulling back the cost of getting goods to customers.\nE-COMMERCE Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images China’s biggest digital commerce business wants to use its online payment operation to open doors to the physical retail world. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is taking a 33% stake in its financial services affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, a move that could set up the payments operation for a public offering and signals broader changes as Alibaba expands and redraws its digital commerce platform. The WSJ’s Liza Lin reports that the tighter tie-up with Ant may allow Alibaba to build up services such as mobile payments and linking them to traditional brick-and-mortar businesses. It would also give Alibaba more firepower to expand in overseas markets such as India, Japan and South Korea, where payment methods are a critical piece of online retail sales. Its expansion into physical retail business is expensive, as well. Alibaba put $2.9 billion in Chinese big-box retailer Sun Art Retail last year, and more investments likely are on the way.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ The retail industry is facing cost pressures on rising freight rates due to a shortage of drivers and higher diesel fuel prices. ’\n—Kurt Barton, finance chief at farm-equipment retailer Tractor Supply Co.\nNumber of the Day 8.8% Decline in U.S. coal production in the first four weeks of January from the same period a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration.\nIN OTHER NEWS U.S. worker productivity grew below its long-run average for the seventh straight year in 2017.
