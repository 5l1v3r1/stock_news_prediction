Pemex won one block, and three blocks were not awarded because they received no bids. \nCompetition for the basin was expected to be fierce, but a consortium of Shell and Qatar Petroleum was the sole bidder on three blocks. \n\"Mexico is the winner here,\" said Alberto de la Fuente, president of Shell Mexico. Shell would spend more than the minimum investment it pledged in the bids, he said, but declined to give further details. \nShell won a block in an earlier auction in Mexico's shallow waters in 2017. The company also has a chain of 30 gas stations in Mexico, he said. \nThe world's top energy firms have lobbied for decades for access to Mexico's oil and gas reserves. State oil giant Pemex , whose 75-year monopoly over the energy sector ended under Mexico's 2013 reform, lacked the cash and the expertise to extract oil and gas from the rock below the country's deepest waters. \n(Reporting by Marianna Parraga, Adriana Barrera and Ana Isabel Martinez in Mexico City, Alexandra Alper in Rio de Janeiro, Nidhi Verma in New Delhi and Osamu Tsukimori in Tokyo; Writing by Simon Webb; Editing by Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T00:21:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
