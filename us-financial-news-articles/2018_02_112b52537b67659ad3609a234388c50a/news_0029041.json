It’s nice for me to beat her for once because she has been beating me so many times.”\nHansdotter’s combined time from the two legs was one minute, 38.63, leaving her just 0.05 seconds ahead of Swiss silver medalist Wendy Holdener. Austria’s Katharina Gallhuber took the bronze.\nScreaming with joy after crossing the line, Hansdotter was weeping later after receiving congratulations from Paerson.\nNow a media pundit, Paerson showed Hansdotter a picture in a social media post of her boyfriend cheering her win at home, bringing tears to the Olympic champion’s eyes.\n“The first years in my World Cup (circuit), (Paerson) was winning so much, she was a huge inspiration for me and then we’ve become friends. And now she’s here and for sure it’s a support,” said Hansdotter.\nPaerson had told her before her first run to “just have fun, ski fast and do what you can.”\nIt was timely advice for Hansdotter, who has been accused of playing too safe at the major events.\nBut on Friday, she was full of self-belief before her second run and duly threw caution to the wind.\n“I don’t go all out so often but ... I had good self-confidence and just to take a little bit more risk than I used to,” said the Swede, a distant relation to Sweden’s royal family.\n“I had a smile on my face from the start and just knew I wanted to ski fast.”\nDefending champion Shiffrin, meanwhile, was gloomy about skiing too “conservatively”, but paid full credit to the woman who took her crown.\n“She deserves it, of course she does,” said the American.\n“Since the beginning of my career, since my first World Cup win, she’s been right there. And I found so much motivation from competing with her that it’s amazing.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:38:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
