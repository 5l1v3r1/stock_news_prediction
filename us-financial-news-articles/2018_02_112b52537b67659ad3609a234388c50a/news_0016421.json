He set Feb. 27 as the date for sentence.\nMusila earlier told the court he was innocent and was dedicated to fighting crime in Githurai, a poor neighborhood outside Nairobi, where he said a tough approach to theft is merited.\nKenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.\nPolice spokesman Charles Owino did not respond to phone calls requesting comment.\nThe Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA), which is run by civilians, investigated the death after Mwangiâ€™s relatives filed a complaint against the policeman.\nThe authority was established by the government in 2011, after police drew criticism for killing many protesters after disputed elections of 2007. It is only the second conviction of a policeman that has resulted from an IPOA investigation.\nIn 2016, two officers were sentenced to seven years after a 14-year-old girl was shot dead during a house raid in coastal Kwale County in 2014.\nReporting By Maggie Fick; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:50:28.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
