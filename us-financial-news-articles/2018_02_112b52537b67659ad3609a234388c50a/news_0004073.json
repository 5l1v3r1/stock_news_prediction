Chevron recorded a $2 billion noncash benefit in the period related to the recent U.S. tax overhaul. \nExcluding the tax change and other one-time items, Chevron earned 72 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nProduction rose 3 percent to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Its international refining division recorded a 77 percent drop in profit due to lower margins on gasoline and other products. \nMike Wirth became Chevronâ€™s chairman and chief executive officer on Thursday, replacing the retiring John Watson. \nThe company is slated to hold a conference call with investors on Friday morning. \nChevron boosted its quarterly dividend this week by 4 percent. \nShares fell 1.8 percent to $123.25 in early trading.
