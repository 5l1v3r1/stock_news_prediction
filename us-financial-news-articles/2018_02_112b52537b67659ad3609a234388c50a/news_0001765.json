The PD is seen on around 23 percent, paying the price for internal schisms and the slow pace of economic recovery. \nThe centre-right is promising to introduce a flat-tax of just 23 percent for individuals and companies if it wins, while the 5-Star says it will introduce a “universal wage” of up to 780 euros ($973) a month to alleviate growing poverty. \nRenzi said such measures were unsustainable. “It seems that the political debate is not focused on real issues. We, instead, have put pragmatism at centre stage,” he said.

REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi \nAmongst the PD’s flagship proposals was a pledge to give families 400 euros a month per infant for three years to help with childcare costs and allow tax deductions of 240 euros per child until they turned 18. \nIt also vowed to cut the corporate tax rate to 22 percent from 24 percent and drop social security contributions on wages to 29 percent from 33 percent. A minimum wage would be introduced, it said, without giving details. \nThe PD additionally promised to set the minimum pension at 750 euros after at least 20 years of contributions, from around 500 euros at present. Forza Italia is promising to hike the minimum pension to 1,000 euros.
