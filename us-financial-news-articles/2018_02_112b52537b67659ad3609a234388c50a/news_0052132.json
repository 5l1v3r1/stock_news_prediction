About 106 have been found or freed, but at least 100 are still believed to be in captivity in the northeast.\nBoko Haram, which aims to create an Islamic caliphate, has killed more than 20,000 people and forced more than two million others to flee their homes during its nine-year insurgency.\nThe militant group has gained global infamy for its use of children, including girls, as “human bombs” in suicide attacks.\nReporting by Ana Ionova, Editing by Kieran Guilbert\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T10:08:01.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
