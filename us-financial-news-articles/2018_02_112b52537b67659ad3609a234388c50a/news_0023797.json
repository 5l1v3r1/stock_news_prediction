Pakistan denies the allegations. \nThe South Asian neighbours have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. \nIndia’s army chief, Bipin Rawat, reached Jammu on Sunday morning to review the operation as the gunfire stretched into its second day.
