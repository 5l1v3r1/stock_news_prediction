She did not elaborate.\nLand ownership is a highly sensitive topic in Zimbabwe. Colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980, while many blacks were landless.\nThe government has said it will issue 99-year leases to white farmers, according to a government circular.\nEarlier this month a government document showed that Zimbabwe was considering establishing a special tribunal to determine the value of compensation and how to pay it to white farmers who have lost land since 2000.\nReporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-03T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:34:08.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
