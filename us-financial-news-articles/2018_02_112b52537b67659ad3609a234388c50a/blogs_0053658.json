CBOT March corn was up 1/4 cent at $3.66 per bushel and CBOT March wheat up 2-1/4 cents at $4.49-1/2. \nWheat steadied after a two-week low linked to beneficial moisture in the U.S. Plains and a backdrop of ample global supplies. \nArgentina remained the focus for soybean markets, with traders assessing production downgrades by forecasters along with prospects for light rain next week and a bumper harvest in Brazil. \n\"Argentina's output can go down further if the weather does not improve,\" said one India-based agricultural commodities analyst at an international bank. \"But the country has 14 million tonnes of inventory, it is enough to restrict further gains in prices. Brazil has another huge crop on the way.\" \nIntermittent showers were expected over the next week in some parts of Argentina, the Commodity Weather Group said in a note. \n\"Wetter risk (is showing) on some models in 6-10 days, but our outlook would keep up to 60 percent of Argentine corn/soy under moisture stress,\" it said. \n(Additional reporting by Naveen Thukral in Singapore and Gus Trompiz in Paris Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T01:09:43.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
