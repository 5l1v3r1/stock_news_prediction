(NYSE: VSTO) today reported operating results for the third quarter of its Fiscal Year 2018 (FY18), which ended on December 31, 2017.\n\"The company delivered solid third quarter results in a continuously challenging marketplace,\" said Vista Outdoor Chief Executive Officer Chris Metz. \"We generated strong free cash flow, which enabled us to repay $108 million of debt. As I've said before, we must make significant changes, act decisively, and move quickly. During the quarter, we made great progress on key initiatives that will reposition the business. We also launched innovative new products across the portfolio that are resonating with our customers and end users. In line with our focus to improve profitability, we have begun to implement organizational changes, including streamlining corporate-level functions and improving business operations to maximize efficiency, drive brand-level decision making and improve accountability. We have also received strong interest on the sale of our eyewear business and are currently fielding inquiries.\"\nFor the third quarter ended December 31, 2017:\nSales were $581 million, down 11 percent from the prior-year quarter. Gross profit was $126 million, down 25 percent from the prior-year quarter. Operating expenses were $107 million, compared to $553 million in the prior-year quarter. The difference was primarily due to a $449 million goodwill and intangibles impairment in the prior-year period. Fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.94, compared to $(6.44) in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.13, compared to $0.62 in the prior-year quarter. Cash flow provided by operating activities year to date was $243 million, compared to $58 million in the prior-year period. Year-to-date free cash flow generation was $205 million, compared to free cash flow use of $18 million in the prior-year period. Tax rate was (725.3) percent compared to 4.4 percent in the prior-year quarter, driven by the revaluation of the deferred tax liabilities from the recently enacted tax law. The adjusted tax rate was 25.9 percent, compared to 33.6 percent in the prior-year quarter.\nPlease see the tables in the press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted gross profit, operating profit, tax rate, fully diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow to the comparable GAAP measures.\nOutlook for Fiscal Year 2018\n\"Looking at the fiscal year, we are raising our free cash flow expectations and lowering our adjusted tax rate,\" said Metz. \"Higher-than-anticipated rebate redemptions, aggressive discounts in certain products to maintain market share, the normal seasonality of our business, and the timing of expenditures will pressure earnings in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are reiterating our FY18 adjusted EPS guidance. The company is focused on cost reduction, margin expansion and cash generation to position us for future success. We are also committed to maintaining our leadership position in the marketplace. In response to significant commodities pressures, we implemented an ammunition price increase in early January and will take another price increase in April.\"\nVista Outdoor FY18 financial guidance:\nSales in a range of $2.24 billion to $2.26 billion. Tax rate of approximately 55 percent, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22 percent. EPS in a range of $(1.00) to $(0.90), with adjusted EPS in a range of $0.50 to $0.60. Capital expenditures of approximately $65 million. Free cash flow in a range of $175 million to $185 million. Interest expense of approximately $50 million.\nThe guidance above does not include the impact of any future strategic acquisitions, divestitures, investments, business combinations or other significant transactions.\nEarnings Conference Call Webcast Information\nVista Outdoor will hold an investor conference call to discuss its third quarter FY18 financial results on February 8, at 9 a.m. ET. The conference call will be accessible through live webcast. Interested investors and other individuals can access the webcast and view and/or download the earnings press release, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, and the related earnings release presentation slides, which will also include detailed segment information, via Vista Outdoor's website ( www.vistaoutdoor.com ).

The telephone number for the recorded call is 719-457-0820, and the confirmation code is 6255727.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nGross Profit, Operating Profit, and Earnings Per Share\nThe adjusted gross profit, operating expenses, operating profit (adjusted EBIT), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) presented below are non-GAAP financial measures. Vista Outdoor defines these measures as gross profit, operating profit (EBIT), tax rate, and EPS excluding, where applicable, the impact of costs incurred for contingent consideration, transaction costs, CEO/CFO transition costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment, transition costs, tax reform, and reorganization. Vista Outdoor management is presenting these measures so a reader may compare gross profit, EBIT, tax rate, and EPS excluding these items, as the measures provide investors with an important perspective on the operating results of the company. Vista Outdoor management uses this measurement internally to assess business performance, and Vista Outdoor's definition may differ from those used by other companies.\nQuarter ended December\n31, 2017:\n(in thousands)\nGross\nProfit\nOperating\nExpenses\nOperating\nProfit\nIncome\nTax\nIncome\nTax Rate\nNet\nIncome\nEPS\nAs reported\n$\n126,105\n$\n107,099\n$\n19,006\n$\n(47,231)\n(725.3)\n%\n$\n53,743\n$\n0.94\nContingent consideration\n—\n(843)\n843\n285\n558\n0.01\nTransaction costs\n—\n(597)\n597\n202\n395\n0.01\nCEO/CFO transition costs\n—\n(763)\n763\n71\n692\n0.01\nTax reform\n—\n—\n—\n48,800\n(48,800)\n(0.85)\nReorganization\n—\n(1,651)\n1,651\n558\n1,093\n0.02\nAs adjusted\n$\n126,105\n$\n103,245\n$\n22,860\n$\n2,685\n25.9\n%\n$\n7,681\n$\n0.13\nQuarter ended January 1,\n2017:\n(in thousands)\nGross\nProfit\nOperating\nExpenses\nOperating\nProfit\nIncome\nTax\nIncome\nTax Rate\nNet\nIncome\nEPS\nAs reported\n$\n168,606\n$\n553,262\n$\n(384,656)\n$\n(17,548)\n4.4\n%\n$\n(377,659)\n$\n(6.44)\nGoodwill and intangibles\nimpairment\n—\n(449,199)\n449,199\n35,670\n413,529\n7.05\nContingent consideration\n—\n(843)\n843\n320\n523\n0.01\nTransaction and transition\ncosts\n—\n(16)\n16\n6\n10\n—\nAs adjusted\n$\n168,606\n$\n103,204\n$\n65,402\n$\n18,448\n33.6\n%\n$\n36,403\n$\n0.62\n*NOTE: Adjustments to \"as reported\" results are items that are excluded to arrive at the \"as adjusted\" results for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017. EPS amounts may not foot due to rounding.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a portion of the $10 million of compensation for the Camp Chef earn-out, which is paid over the three years after acquisition, subject to continued Camp Chef leadership employment and the achievement of certain incremental growth milestones. The tax effect of the contingent consideration adjustment was calculated based on a blended statutory rate of approximately 34 percent. Given this contingent consideration amount relates to the purchase price of a company and is not normal ongoing compensation of the employees, we do not believe these costs are indicative of operations.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Vista Outdoor incurred transaction costs associated with possible transactions, including advisory, legal, and accounting service fees. Given the nature of transaction costs, and differences in these amounts from one acquisition to another, we feel these costs are not indicative of operations of the company. The tax effect of the transaction costs was calculated based on a blended statutory rate of approximately 34 percent.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we completed our search for a permanent CEO and announced the departure of the CFO. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we incurred costs related to severance and executive search fees related to the CEO and CFO transitions. We believe these costs are not indicative of the ongoing operations of the company. The tax effect of the costs was calculated based on a blended statutory rate of approximately 34 percent partially offset by a tax deduction shortfall.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a tax benefit related to the revaluation of the balance sheet as a result of tax legislation which has been enacted in the United States and France. We believe the tax benefit related to the revaluation of the balance sheet is not indicative of the ongoing operations of the company.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Vista Outdoor incurred costs related to reorganization. These costs relate to severance costs associated with positions that have been eliminated as well as consulting costs related to the review of our organizational structure and portfolio of brands. Given the infrequent and unique nature of the reorganization, we believe these costs are not indicative of ongoing operations of the company. The tax effect of the transaction costs was calculated based on a blended statutory rate of approximately 34 percent.\nA challenging retail environment and other market pressures resulted in deeper discounting of Vista Outdoor's accessories products during the quarter ended January 1, 2017. The deeper discounting caused a reduction in the projected cash flows of the Hunting and Shooting Accessories reporting unit. Given this drop in projected cash flows and a continued challenging retail environment, we determined a triggering event had occurred requiring an evaluation of goodwill. Upon completion of the analysis an impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was determined to be necessary. Given the non-cash and infrequent nature of this intangible asset impairment, we do not believe these costs are indicative of operations of the company. The tax effect of the goodwill and intangible impairment charge was determined based on the fact that the goodwill impairment charge of $354 million is non-deductible for tax purposes and the remaining intangible asset impairment of $95 million was deductible at a rate of approximately 38 percent.\nDuring the quarter ended January 1, 2017, Vista Outdoor recorded a portion of the $10 million of compensation for Camp Chef earn-out, which is paid over the three years after acquisition, subject to continued Camp Chef leadership employment and the achievement of certain incremental profitability growth milestones. Given this balance is related to the purchase price of the company and is not normal compensation of the employees and will not be a continuing cost, we do not believe these costs are indicative of operations of the company. The tax effect of the transaction and transition costs was calculated based on a blended statutory rate of 38 percent.\nDuring the quarter ended January 1, 2017, Vista Outdoor incurred transaction and transition costs (advisory, legal and accounting service fees) associated with various transactions, including the completed acquisitions of Action Sports and Camp Chef. Transition costs for the Action Sports business include one-time costs related to the integration of the business into the company including vendor change fees, insurance-related expenses, and severance costs. Given the nature of transaction and transition costs, and differences in these amounts from one acquisition to another, we feel these costs are not indicative of operations of the company. The tax effect of the transaction and transition costs was calculated based on a blended statutory rate of 38 percent.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is defined as cash provided by (used for) operating activities less capital expenditures and excluding transaction, transition, contingent consideration, CEO/CFO transition, reorganization, and acquisition claim settlement costs net of taxes incurred to date. Vista Outdoor management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment, share repurchases and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Vista Outdoor management uses free cash flow internally to assess both business performance and overall liquidity.\n(in thousands)\nNine months\nended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nNine months\nended January\n1, 2017\nProjected year ending\nMarch 31, 2018\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n243,107\n$\n57,891\n$235,017–$245,017\nCapital expenditures\n(43,561)\n(49,302)\n~(65,000)\nContingent consideration\n3,371\n—\n3,371\nAcquisition claim settlement gain\n—\n(30,027)\n—\nCEO/CFO transition costs paid to date\n(119)\n—\n(119)\nReorganization\n1,084\n—\n1,084\nTransaction costs paid to date\n647\n3,670\n647\nFree cash flow\n$\n204,529\n$\n(17,768)\n$175,000–$185,000\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share - Guidance Reconciliation Table\nThe projected adjusted earnings per share (EPS), excluding the impact of costs incurred to date for current and possible transactions, changes in value of future payments of goodwill and intangibles impairment, CEO/CFO transition costs, reorganization, contingent consideration, pension curtailment, and tax reform costs is a non-GAAP financial measure that Vista Outdoor defines as EPS excluding the impact of these items. Vista Outdoor management is presenting this measure so a reader may compare EPS, excluding these items, as this measure provides investors with an important perspective on the operating results of the company. Vista Outdoor management uses this measurement internally to assess business performance, and Vista Outdoor's definition may differ from those used by other companies.\nCurrent FY18 Full-Year Adjusted EPS Guidance\nLow\nHigh\nEPS guidance including goodwill and intangibles impairment, CEO/CFO transition costs,\nreorganization, contingent consideration, transaction costs, pension curtailment, and tax reform\ncosts incurred to date.\n$\n(1.00)\n$\n(0.90)\nGoodwill and intangibles impairment\n2.26\n2.26\nCEO/CFO transition costs and reorganization\n0.13\n0.13\nContingent consideration and transaction costs\n0.02\n0.02\nPension curtailment\n(0.06)\n(0.06)\nTax reform\n(0.85)\n(0.85)\nAdjusted EPS guidance\n$\n0.50\n$\n0.60\nVista Outdoor is a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of consumer products in the growing outdoor sports and recreation markets.
