One bcfd of gas is enough for about 5 million U.S. homes. \nWhile drilling that first pipe, the company spilled about 2 million gallons of drilling fluid into a wetland in April. That spill led FERC in May to ban Rover from horizontal drilling temporarily. \nEnergy companies use horizontal drilling to cross under obstacles like highways and rivers. \nETP said on Monday it was still on track to complete the project by the end of the first quarter. Some analysts, however, have said completion of the project would probably be delayed into the second quarter, at least. \nMajor producers that signed up to use Rover include units of privately held Ascent Resources, Antero Resources Corp, Range Resources Corp, Southwestern Energy Co, Eclipse Resources Corp and EQT Corp.
