Iiro Pakarinen’s first goal of the season pushed the lead to 4-1.\nMcDavid completed the hat trick on a third-period breakaway and scored his fourth during a scramble, giving him six goals and nine points in the past two games. He scored only four goals in 23 games during December and January.\nGoing into the night’s action, McDavid was tied for 13th in the league’s scoring race. His performance moved him into a tie for third, five points back of Tampa Bay’s Nikita Kucherov.\nDraisaitl also collected two assists in a three-point game. Strome added two helpers to give him five assists in a three-game stretch.\nTampa Bay rookie Yanni Gourde collected his 19th goal of the season in a two-point outing.\nVasilevskiy, who stopped 22 of 26 shots in two periods, gave way to Louis Domingue for the third period. Domingue made seven saves for the Lightning, who completed a 5-3-0 road trip.\nKucherov, he was held off the scoresheet and now has gone 11 games without a goal.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:07:45.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
