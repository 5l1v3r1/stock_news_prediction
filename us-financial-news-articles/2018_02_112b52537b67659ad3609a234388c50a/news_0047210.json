The Amendment modifies the existing loan agreement to allow the Company to reinstate its past practice of paying dividends, subject to certain limiting restrictions.\nPer Mr. White, “During the past twenty-four months we have executed several amendments to our Loan Agreement with our bank to provide the needed working capital borrowings to fund our rapid growth. Certain restrictions were made with each increased borrowing amount; such as the agreement to discontinue paying dividends, which was made with the Fourth Amendment a year ago. Since that time, we have made several operational and working capital improvements that have culminated in our lender’s willingness to release the dividend suspension. We are very pleased with the continuing improvements in operations, our ability to ship out our incoming orders without delays and our increased bottom line profitability.\"\nMr. White continued, “We will continue to evaluate our working capital needs based on our sales growth projections and monitor the timing of reinstating dividend payments to our shareholders.\"\nAbout Educational Development Corporation\nEDC is a publishing company specializing in books for children.
