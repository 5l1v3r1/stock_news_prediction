Hottovy said in a note.\nAt Taco Bell, Niccol has largely been credited for mastering mobile ordering and introducing food options such as Doritos tacos and Nacho Fries, which were a big hit among customers.\nBTIG analyst Peter Saleh said he expected the new CEO would lean on his past success driving sales at Taco Bell by introducing breakfast, limited-time-offers and compelling marketing to help improve trends at the company.\nBut Saleh stuck to his neutral rating for the company.\n“Niccol was critical to Taco Bell’s turnaround, but we note CMG is starting in a position of far greater weakness,” Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said.\n“Further, we note Mr. Niccol has less experience with cost management, given Taco Bell is a primarily franchised brand compared to Chipotle’s 100 percent company-operated model,” Charles said.
