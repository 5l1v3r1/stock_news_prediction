The arrests are part of Turkey’s far-reaching crackdown against the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara holds responsible for the failed putsch.\nGulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied involvement and condemned the coup.\nIn the 19 months since the coup attempt - when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and warplanes to attack parliament, killing more than 240 people - Turkey has jailed more than 50,000 under a state of emergency. It has also sacked or suspended 150,000 people from their jobs in the military, public and private sectors.\nThe government dismisses rights groups’ concerns about the crackdown, saying only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by Gulen’s network, which it says infiltrated institutions such as the judiciary, army and schools.\nReporting by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by David Dolan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:22:56.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
