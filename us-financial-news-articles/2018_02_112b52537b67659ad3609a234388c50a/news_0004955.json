Despite improving in January, the British PMI’s gauge of factory export orders lagged behind all other major European economies.\nOverall new orders expanded at the weakest pace since June 2017. Consumer goods makers in particular have suffered from weak domestic demand due to higher inflation.\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that business investment was lower than it should be due to uncertainty about Britain’s future trade relations with the European Union, which it is due to leave in March 2019.\nOil prices rose to their highest in more than three years last month, and Thursday’s data showed manufacturers reported their third-biggest monthly increase in costs since the survey started in 1992.\nOil, chemicals, foodstuffs, metals and plastics all became dearer, and factories passed some of the extra cost on to customers.\nThis may concern the BoE, which is reassessing how fast inflation will fall this year. Inflation peaked at its highest in more than five years in November, when the central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.\n“The move in the price balances of the manufacturing PMI highlights the risk that consumer price inflation may not slow that quickly, even as the influence of past FX depreciation wanes,” Nomura economist George Buckley wrote.\nMost economists expect the BoE will not raise rates again until November, though a minority think an increase will come in May. The central bank will set out its latest thoughts on Feb. 8.\nAdditional reporting and graphics by Andy Bruce; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:07:37.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
