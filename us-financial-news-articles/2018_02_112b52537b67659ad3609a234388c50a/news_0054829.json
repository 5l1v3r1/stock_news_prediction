The British company is restructuring after issuing a string of profit warnings sparked by the cost of moving to digital from paper textbooks, repeatedly knocking investor confidence and forcing it to cut thousands of jobs. It said on Friday its profit was 576 million pounds, down 9 percent but above its recently upgraded range of 570 million to 575 million pounds, due to a lower tax rate. It also reiterated its forecasts for 2018.
