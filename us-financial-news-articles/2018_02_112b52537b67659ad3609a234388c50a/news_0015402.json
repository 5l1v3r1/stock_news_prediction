It is possible that some could ask for more time. \nThe Commission, which is scheduled to decide by April 5, can either accept the concessions, demand more or veto the deal.($1 = 0.8157 euros) Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Additional reporting by Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt and Oliver Hirt in Zurich; Editing by Philip Blenkinsop and David Goodman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T18:44:41.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
