(NASDAQ:EXLS), a leading operations management and analytics company, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and the full year 2017.\nRohit Kapoor, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “EXL ended the year with a strong fourth quarter generating revenue growth of 11.6% to $197.9 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67, up 9.8%. For the year 2017, EXL grew revenues by 11.1% led by our Analytics segment which grew 26.7%. Our Operations Management businesses revenues grew 6.2% for the full year.\n“Our 2017 performance was strong with our top and bottom lines exhibiting double-digit growth. In addition, we increased our digital technology investments in the areas of machine learning, advanced automation and robotics. As we create more digitally architected solutions, we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of market opportunities to be the strategic digital transformation partner of choice for our clients.”\nVishal Chhibbar, Chief Financial Officer, said, “In 2017, we generated $113.1 million of cash flow from operations and ended the year with $265.3 million in cash and short term investments. For 2018, we are providing revenue guidance of $830 million to $855 million, representing annual revenue growth of 9% to 12% on constant currency basis. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance is $2.70 to $2.80. There are several factors contributing to our adjusted EPS growth which include improved operating profit margins on higher revenues which is partially offset by dilution from our acquisition of Health Integrated of $0.05 to $0.07 and an increase in our estimated effective tax rate to between 29% and 31% for 2018.”\n1 Includes impact of one-time provisional income tax expense of $29.2 million related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”) which reduced our GAAP diluted EPS by $0.83 during the three months ended and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights: Fourth Quarter 2017\nWe have six reportable segments: Insurance, Healthcare, Travel, Transportation & Logistics, Finance & Accounting, All Other (Banking & Financial Services, Utilities and Consulting) and Analytics.

EXL believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures may help investors better understand EXL’s underlying financial performance. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with EXL’s reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the Company’s results and comparisons of the Company’s results with the results of other companies. Additionally, management considers some of these non-GAAP financial measures to determine variable compensation of its employees. EXL believes that it is unreasonably difficult to provide its earnings per share financial guidance in accordance with GAAP for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, EXL’s inability to predict its future stock-based compensation expense under ASC Topic 718, the amortization of intangibles associated with further acquisitions and the currency fluctuations and associated tax impacts: as such EXL presents guidance with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share. EXL also incurs significant non-cash charges for depreciation that may not be indicative of the Company’s ability to generate cash flow.\nThe information provided on a constant currency basis reflects a comparison of current period results translated at the prior period currency rates. EXL’s primary exchange rate exposure is with the Indian Rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine Peso. The average exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against the Indian Rupee decreased from 67.70 during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 to 64.36 during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, representing appreciation of 4.9%. The average exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against the Philippine Peso increased from 49.29 during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 to 50.60 during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, representing a depreciation of 2.7%. The average exchange rate of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar increased from 1.23 during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 to 1.34 during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, representing appreciation of 8.9%. This information is provided because EXL believes that it provides useful comparative incremental information to investors regarding EXL’s operating performance.\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2017:\nReconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA\n(Amounts in thousands)\nYear ended Three months ended December 31, December 31, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 Net Income (GAAP) $ 48,888 $ 61,733 $ (9,355 ) $ 15,488 $ 21,077 add: Income tax expense 36,146 22,151 28,944 3,602 2,819 subtract: Interest expense, foreign exchange gain, net and other income, net (12,809 ) (19,662 ) (3,413 ) (4,915 ) (3,077 ) Income from operations (GAAP) $ 72,225 $ 64,222 $ 16,176 $ 14,175 $ 20,819 add: Stock-based compensation expense (a) 23,041 19,770 6,270 5,027 5,708 add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles (b) 13,975 11,873 3,483 3,592 3,487 Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP) $ 109,241 $ 95,865 $ 25,929 $ 22,794 $ 30,014 Adjusted operating income margin as a % of revenues (Non-GAAP) 14.3 % 14.0 % 13.1 % 12.9 % 15.6 % add: Depreciation 24,574 22,707 6,577 5,988 6,095 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) $ 133,815 $ 118,572 $ 32,506 $ 28,782 $ 36,109 Adjusted EBITDA margin as a % of revenues (Non-GAAP) 17.6 % 17.3 % 16.4 % 16.2 % 18.8 %\n(a) To exclude stock-based compensation expense under ASC Topic 718.\n(b) To exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.

The one-time incremental income tax expense reflects certain assumptions based upon the Company’s interpretation of the Tax Reform Act and may change as the Company receive additional clarification and guidance and as the interpretation of the Tax Reform Act evolves over time. Any additional changes would be reflected as a non-GAAP adjustment in the period in which they are recorded.\n(d) Tax impact include $9,796 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $2,627 and $3,488 during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 respectively, related to discrete benefit recognized in income tax expense on adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\n(e) To exclude change in fair value of earn-out consideration related to the Company’s 2015 acquisition of RPM Direct LLC and RPM Data Solutions LLC.\nContact: Steven N.
