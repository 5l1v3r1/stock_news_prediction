Sixteen projects carry a price tag of $500 million or more, according to the list.\nRebuilding homes, hospitals, schools, roads, businesses and telecommunications is key to providing jobs to the young, to end the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and put an end to several decades of political and sectarian violence.\nIraq declared victory over Islamic State in December, having taken back all the territory captured by the militants in 2014 and 2015. A U.S.-led coalition supported the Iraqi forces, especially in the battle to dislodge them from Mosul, their de facto capital in northern Iraq, in July.\nThe United States government will not contribute funds at the conference but will instead encourage investment from the private sector and Gulf Arab allies, U.S. and Western officials said.\nA U.S. official in Baghdad said 100 U.S. companies were participating in the conference.\nThree rail projects top the list: a 500-kilometer (311 mile) line from Baghdad to Basra in the south estimated to cost $13.7 billion, a line from Baghdad to Mosul in the north estimated at $8.65 billion and an $8 billion metro for the capital.\nIraq reopened to foreign investment in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, but the vast majority of the billions invested went to increasing its oil and gas production.\nIt has become the second-largest crude exporter of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, after Saudi Arabia, with a daily output of 4.4 million barrels.\nAt the conference, Iraq will seek investment in the downstream oil industry including in storage tanks, refineries and petrochemical plants to process its crude into plastics and fertilizers.\nSaleh said investments in the oil industry and agriculture will probably be easier to attract than other sectors given the country’s vast crude reserves, available land and water wealth.\nTotal land offered for investments to grow “strategic crops” is nearly 1,500 square kilometers (580 square miles). Iraq, one of the world’s largest wheat importers, aims to achieve self-sufficiency and possibly become a net exporter of the grain.\n“We feel there will be support for Iraq, from the Americans, the Europeans, the Arab countries, the United Nations, and humanitarian organizations,” said Saleh.\nWriting by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T12:21:03.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
