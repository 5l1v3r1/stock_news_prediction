Management uses these non-IFRS financial measures for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of ongoing operations and in analyzing the Company's business performance and trends. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company's financial information reported under IFRS.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, we provide the following additional information\non the adjustments:\nUNAUDITED Reconciliation of adjusted net profit for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(RMB and US$ amounts expressed in thousands, except per share data)\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nRMB '000\nUS$ '000\nRMB '000\nUS$ '000\nNet profit\n665,882\n101,907\n318,812\n48,791\nAdjustments to net profit:\nCompletion of the engineering design services\nof YC6K\n(115,235)\n(17,636)\n–\n–\nSales of hotel assets\n(324,092)\n(49,599)\n–\n–\nStaff Severance cost\n31,485\n4,818\n1,755\n269\nImpairment charge on intellectual property\n40,000\n6,122\n���\n–\nRelated income tax effects\n21,271\n3,255\n(263)\n(40)\nAdjusted net profit\n319,311\n48,867\n320,304\n49,020\nAdjusted net profit attributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n228,081\n34,905\n227,169\n34,766\nNon-controlling interests\n91,230\n13,962\n93,135\n14,254\n319,311\n48,867\n320,304\n49,020\nNet earnings per common share\n- Basic\n9.99\n1.53\n5.55\n0.85\n- Diluted\n9.97\n1.53\n5.55\n0.85\nNet earnings per common share adjustment\ndue to one-time and extraordinary events\n- Basic\n(4.40)\n(0.68)\n0.03\n0.00\n- Diluted\n(4.39)\n(0.68)\n0.03\n0.00\nAdjusted net earnings per common share\nexcluding one-time and extraordinary events\n- Basic\n5.59\n0.85\n5.58\n0.85\n- Diluted\n5.58\n0.85\n5.58\n0.85\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, we provide the following additional information\non the adjustments:\nUNAUDITED Reconciliation of adjusted net profit for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(RMB and US$ amounts expressed in thousands, except per share data)\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nRMB '000\nUS$ '000\nRMB '000\nUS$ '000\nNet profit\n1,405,070\n215,033\n723,608\n110,741\nAdjustments to net profit:\nCompletion of the engineering design services\nof YC6K\n(115,235)\n(17,636)\n–\n–\nSales of hotel assets\n(324,092)\n(49,599)\n–\n–\nStaff severance cost\n107,732\n16,487\n12,864\n1,969\nImpairment charge on intellectual property\n40,000\n6,122\n–\n–\nRelated income tax effects\n9,834\n1,505\n(1,930)\n(295)\nAdjusted net profit\n1,123,309\n171,912\n734,542\n112,415\nAdjusted net profit attributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n823,670\n126,055\n524,092\n80,208\nNon-controlling interests\n299,639\n45,857\n210,450\n32,207\n1,123,309\n171,912\n734,542\n112,415\nNet earnings per common share\n- Basic\n23.40\n3.58\n12.89\n1.97\n- Diluted\n23.40\n3.58\n12.89\n1.97\nNet earnings per common share adjustment\ndue to one-time and extraordinary events\n- Basic\n(3.19)\n(0.49)\n0.21\n0.03\n- Diluted\n(3.19)\n(0.49)\n0.21\n0.03\nAdjusted net earnings per common share\nexcluding one-time and extraordinary events\n- Basic\n20.21\n3.09\n13.10\n2.00\n- Diluted\n20.21\n3.09\n13.10\n2.00\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-yuchai-international-announces-unaudited-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-results-300604663.html\nSOURCE China Yuchai International Limited", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-yuchai-international-announces-unaudited-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-results-300604663.html", "http://www.cyilimited.com/"], "published": "2018-02-27T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T13:47:43.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
