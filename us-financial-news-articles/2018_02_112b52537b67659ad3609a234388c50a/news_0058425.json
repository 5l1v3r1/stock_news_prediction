Achieved Amazon Web Services (AWS) Machine Learning (ML) Competency status, recognizing Veritone’s proven track record of making AI accessible and actionable to leading institutions and organizations.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 40% to $3.5 million from $2.5 million in the same period in 2016. Media agency revenues in the quarter totaled $3.0 million, an increase of 37% compared with the prior year period, and SaaS licensing revenues from the Company’s aiWARE platform in the quarter totaled $0.5 million, an increase of 61% compared with the prior year period.\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 63% to $3.3 million (93.0% of net revenues) from $2.0 million (79.6% of net revenues) in the same period in 2016. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to the operating leverage provided by the Company’s higher net revenues level.\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 72% to $16.1 million from $9.3 million in the same period in 2016. The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to the Company’s higher headcount, particularly in software development, data science, and sales and marketing, as the Company continued to expand its business and enhance its AI platform, including developing new products and functionality.\nLoss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $12.8 million, an increase of $5.4 million compared with a loss from operations of $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $12.8 million, or $(0.83) per share (based on 15.3 million weighted average shares outstanding). The Company’s net loss attributable to common stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $9.9 million, or $(4.12) per share (based on 2.4 million weighted average shares outstanding).\nEarnings before interest expense, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (EBITDAS), a non-GAAP financial measure, was a loss of $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. See “About the Presentation of EBITDAS,” below for an explanation of the items excluded from the calculation of EBITDAS and the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDAS following the financial statements at the end of this news release. The higher EBITDAS loss was due primarily to the addition of research and development and sales and marketing resources, which management expects will lead to enhancements in the Company’s aiWARE platform and increased net revenues in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $69.1 million and no long-term debt.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenues in 2017 increased 62% to a record $14.4 million from $8.9 million in 2016. Media agency revenues totaled $12.9 million in 2017, an increase of 54% compared with 2016, and SaaS licensing revenues from the Company’s aiWARE platform totaled $1.5 million in 2017, an increase of 189% compared with the prior year.\nGross profit in 2017 increased 82% to $13.3 million (92.6% of net revenues) from $7.3 million (82.3% of net revenues) in 2016. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to the operating leverage provided by the Company’s higher net revenues level.\nTotal operating expenses in 2017 increased 93% to $60.1 million from $31.1 million in 2016. The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to a $14.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, and to the Company’s higher headcount, particularly in software development, data science, and sales and marketing, as the Company continued to expand its business and enhance its platform, including developing new products and functionality.\nLoss from operations in 2017 was $46.8 million, compared with a loss from operations of $23.8 million in 2016.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders in 2017 totaled $64.1 million, or $(6.20) per share (based on 10.3 million weighted average shares outstanding), which included the higher stock-based compensation expenses discussed above, as well as other expenses of $12.9 million related primarily to the write-off of debt discounts and issuance costs upon the conversion of the Company’s outstanding convertible notes and the issuance of stock warrants upon the Company’s initial public offering, and non-cash expenses of $4.5 million relating to the accretion of redeemable preferred stock. The Company’s net loss attributable to common stockholders in 2016 was $30.2 million, or $(14.59) per share (based on 2.1 million weighted average shares outstanding).\nFor the full year of 2017, EBITDAS was a loss of $30.2 million in 2017, compared with an EBITDAS loss of $21.5 million in 2016. The higher EBITDAS loss was due primarily to the Company’s higher headcount as discussed above.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Outlook\nFor the first quarter ending March 31, 2018, Veritone expects to achieve the following KPIs for its aiWARE platform:\nAdd eight customers; Add 110 accounts; Add 20 active third-party cognitive engines and one cognitive category; and Process 1.9 million total hours of video and audio content during the quarter.\nManagement Commentary\n“We were very pleased with our execution in the fourth quarter, which saw us achieve strong increases in both the total number of accounts and the number of third-party engines on our aiWARE platform, while continuing to grow net revenues in our media agency business,” said Veritone’s Chairman and CEO Chad Steelberg. “During 2017, we added significant depth and expertise to our software engineering and data science teams and greatly expanded our sales and marketing team and channels.

The items excluded from EBITDAS are detailed in the reconciliation attached to this news release. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define EBITDAS differently. The Company presents EBITDAS because management believes it to be an important supplemental measure of performance that is commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. This non-GAAP measure may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider EBITDAS in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding the expected impact of the acquired Atigeo technology on the performance of the Company’s aiWARE platform, the ability of the Company’s Veritone Developer application to empower developers to bring new AI ideas to life, the expected numbers of new customers, accounts and active third-party cognitive engines on the platform as of the end of the first quarter of 2018, the total hours of video and audio files expected to be ingested and processed on the platform in the first quarter of 2018, and the Company’s expectation of being able to continue to enhance the capabilities of its aiWARE platform and generate significant increases in net revenues in 2018. In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “should,” “could,” “estimate” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors.

Certain of these judgments and risks are discussed in more detail in Veritone’s Registration Statements on Form S-1 and in its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by Veritone or any other person that Veritone’s objectives or plans will be achieved.
