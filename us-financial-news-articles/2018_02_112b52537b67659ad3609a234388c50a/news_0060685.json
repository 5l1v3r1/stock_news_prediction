The 76ers have lost two in a row following a seven-game win streak.\nMiami point guard Goran Dragic had 21 points, and teammate Hassan Whiteside had 15 points and a game-high 11 rebounds.\nHeat reserve guard Wayne Ellington, one of the best three-point shooters in the NBA, suffered a left-leg injury in the first half and did not return. He finished with two points in 11 minutes.\nIn the third quarter, Heat starting guard Tyler Johnson suffered a bruised left knee, and he left the game with 16 points.\nThose injuries were somewhat negated by the return of two injured Heat players. Forward Rodney McGruder, who suffered a stress fracture in his left leg in a preseason game, made his 2017-2018 debut and scored three points.\nHeat power forward Kelly Olynyk, who missed the past six games due to a sprained left shoulder, returned and scored nine points.\nPhiladelphia led 24-17 after the first quarter, closing the period on a 9-0 run.\nThe Heat appeared frustrated, shooting just 31.8 percent in the quarter. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was hit with a technical foul when he argued that a blocked shot by Embiid on a Wade layup should’ve been ruled goaltending.\nNeither team shot that well - Philadelphia’s percentage stood at 37 percent. The teams combined to make just 1 of 15 three-pointers attempts, and Embiid was the only player to hit one from deep. He made three jumpers and had a quarter-high seven points.\nIn the second quarter, Philadelphia extended its lead to 13 points. But Miami used a 15-0 run to get back in the game. A four-point play JJ Redick swung the momentum back to Philadelphia, and the 76ers went into halftime with a 48-45 lead.\nBoth teams shot under 40 percent for the first half, and the high scorers were Embiid and Dragic, each with 13 points.\nIn the third quarter, Philadelphia put together a 9-2 run during which Saric scored all nine points. But Miami clawed back with a Wade three-pointer at the buzzer, cutting its deficit to 75-73 entering the fourth quarter.\nFor the game, Miami shot 44.4 percent from the floor. The 76ers shot 41.7 percent.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T11:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:45:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
