His move shows growing integration between the two companies. \nDuring Amazon's earnings call last week , Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said Prime is expected to be rolled out in Whole Foods stores possibly by the end of this year. \n\"We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we expect to have more on that later in the year,\" Olsavsky said. \nLaunched in 2005, Prime is Amazon's paid-membership program that gives access to a number of benefits, including free two-day shipping, unlimited video streaming and online storage space. Amazon hasn't disclosed the number of Prime members, but market research firm CIRP estimates it to be over 90 million in the U.S. alone. \nA 19-year veteran at Amazon, Greeley has spent the last four years running Prime. Under his leadership, Prime thrived to become one of the most successful customer loyalty programs anywhere, and added new services like Prime Now, a one-hour delivery option, and Prime Day, Amazon's one-day annual shopping event. He has also held positions in Amazon's international and finance departments. \nSince the acquisition, Amazon has dropped prices of certain items at Whole Foods and added some Whole Foods products online. But a recent report by Business Insider said some Whole Foods employees are complaining about a new inventory management system designed to cut down on food waste. show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T15:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T15:16:15.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
