This was up from 76 percent from late on Tuesday, CME Group’s FedWatch program showed.\nFed funds futures FFZ8 FFF9 implied traders saw a 25 percent chance that the Fed would raise key overnight borrowing costs four times in 2018, compared with 17 percent late Tuesday, according to FedWatch.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:51:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
