He hit 7 of 10 from the field and made six of his nine 3-pointers.\nBarry Brown led the Wildcats with 28 points.\nDuring the Sooners’ losing streak, Young was less than 20 percent from behind the 3-point line (11 of 56).\nBut he got off to a hot start Saturday, hitting a 3-pointer from well beyond the top of the key on Oklahoma’s first possession.\nTwo minutes later, he hit another on his next shot from long distance, and all of a sudden, Young looked like the player who took college basketball by storm during the season’s first two and a half months.\nYoung hit six 3-pointers in the game, his most since Jan. 30 against Baylor -- which was also the Sooners’ last win.\nSooners coach Lon Kruger stuck with a made-over starting lineup that he first used in a 30-point loss to Kansas on Monday.\nWhile the change didn’t work against the Jayhawks, it paid dividends against Kansas State.\nNot only did the Sooners get off to a solid start, but freshman Brady Manek seemed to find his footing coming off the bench for just the second time this season.\nManek, the Sooners’ second-leading scorer for much of the season, was 4-of-7 with 10 points. Christian James finished with 15 points for the Sooners (17-11, 7-9 Big 12), and Jamuni McNeace added 10.\nDean Wade added 15 points for Kansas State (20-9, 9-7), while Xavier Sneed had 12.\nOklahoma shot 52.7 percent from the field and 61.5 percent after halftime. The Sooners are 9-1 when shooting better than 50 percent.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:04:27.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
