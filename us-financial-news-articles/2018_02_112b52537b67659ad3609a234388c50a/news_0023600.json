Mandatory Credit: Matt Kryger-USA TODAY Sports “There have been a lot of misconceptions but now we have Africans in skeleton, bobsleigh, snowboard and skiing, I just think it’s going to be great for the continent of Africa,” said the Utah-based Frimpong.\n”When you talk about west African countries when you talk about black people let’s be real, then yes I think it is a breakthrough moment.\n“I hope this is not just going to be a one time thing though, that we can continue with this journey. That is certainly my plan.”\nHaving grown up in the Netherlands after his family moved from Ghana, Frimpong won a scholarship to Utah Valley University in the United States.\nThe sprinter was unable to make the Dutch 2012 Olympic team, and switched to bobsleigh but missed out on a place in their squad for Sochi in 2014.\nHe then took a break from sport but was persuaded to try skeleton by British coach Nicola Minichiello who had worked with him on the Dutch bobsleigh team.\n“I gave it a try and I just loved it,” he said.\n”It’s different from bobsleigh where are you at the back you just don’t see anything. I’ve got my own life in my hands and I decide whether to go left or right or straight.\n“The very first time it is definitely scary you’re very close to the ice. But I realized the competitiveness in me wasn’t gone.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T06:33:22.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
