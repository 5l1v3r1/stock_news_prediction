The S&P 500 volatility index .VIX briefly turned positive, then moved back down and was last trading at 24.67.\nEuropean stocks fell briefly after the data before moving back into positive territory. The pan-European index was last up 0.5 percent. Bank stocks .SX7P reduced their gains to trade up just 0.1 percent on the day.\nElsewhere, Greece’s five-year bond yield GR5YT=55 rose 10 bps to 3.879 percent, its highest since early December. Ten-year yields GR10YT=RR rose to a two-month high of 4.49 percent.\nPortugal’s bond market outperformed, with 10-year yields trading at 1.94 percent, down 3.5 bps on the day after dipping as low as 1.911 pct.
