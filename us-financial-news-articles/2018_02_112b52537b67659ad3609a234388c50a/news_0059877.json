It would be a complete sell-out of Britain’s national interests,” Fox will say, according to excerpts from his office.\n“A customs union would remove the bulk of incentives for other countries to enter into comprehensive free trade agreements with the UK if we were unable to alter the rules in whole sectors of our economy, as Turkey has now discovered.”\nBut the former most senior government official in Fox’s department compared leaving the EU’s single market and customs union to being like swapping a three-course meal for a packet of crisps.\nMartin Donnelly, the former permanent secretary at the Department for International Trade, said Britain risked being shut out entirely from its biggest market.\n“You’re giving up a three-course meal, the depth and intensity of our trade relationship across the European Union and partners now, for the promise of a packet of crisps in the future, if we manage to do trade deals in the future outside the EU,” he told BBC radio.\n“OPPORTUNITIES OF THE FUTURE”\nFox will also say that Britain should focus on opportunities outside the EU. He will say that 57 percent of Britain’s exports of goods and services now go outside of the EU, compared with 44 percent in 2005.\n“We cannot allow the practices and patterns of the past to constrain the opportunities of the future,” Fox will say. “Our approach should not be premised on simply identifying how much of our current relationship we want to keep, but what we need to prosper in a rapidly changing global environment.”\nLabour’s announcement on Monday places May’s government on a collision course with a number of her own members of parliament, who are planning to back an amendment to a trade bill calling for the government to pursue a customs union, and will now have the backing of the opposition party.\nEight Conservative rebels are backing an amendment and, if they win more support from colleagues, the government could be defeated in parliament on one of its key Brexit policies.\nForeign minister Boris Johnson was also criticized by opposition politicians after he dismissed concerns that leaving the customs union after Brexit could lead to a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nHe compared the problems of moving goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if Britain leaves the customs union to crossing London boroughs.\n“There is nothing funny about his glib comparison,” Owen Smith, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary said on Twitter.\n”Preserving an open border, without infrastructure, is a matter of the utmost importance - for peace and prosperity in Ireland.\nEditing by Stephen Addison\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:04:06.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
