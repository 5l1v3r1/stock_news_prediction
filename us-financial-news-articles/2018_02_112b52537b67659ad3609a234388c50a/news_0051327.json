Most derivative contracts are also dollar-based, removing currency risks.\nYet whether the center can become a top-notch financial hub remains uncertain.\nFor one, daily trading volumes are currently only at $300-$400 million across its equities, currency, debt, and commodity derivatives, a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars at India’s main exchanges.\nCurrently seven domestic banks operate in GIFT City, but no overseas lenders have set up.\nThe sources who talked to Reuters acknowledged the trading was largely from the banks’ trading desks rather than from foreign investors.\nRegulatory uncertainty is also a concern. Although the government has sought a unified regulator for GIFT City, India has yet to decide on who, while a history of unpredictable regulations worries foreign investors.\nFurthermore, the Singapore Exchange (SGX), having emerged as the biggest trading center for offshore Indian derivatives and a top threat to India, is not standing still.\nIt is exploring a tie-up with NSE in GIFT City, but is also working on “successor products” to its Indian equity index derivatives.\nTejas Desai, a partner at Ernst & Young, says foreign interest has increased after India exempted taxes on capital gains and after the action by Indian exchanges, giving GIFT City an opportunity to take advantage.\n“From a tax perspective, trading futures in GIFT city as compared to exchanges in mainland India is a no-brainer. Understandably, the level of interest amongst prospective investors is quite high at the moment,” he said.\n“However, the areas that investors will want to assess in greater detail are ease of access, on-boarding, product sophistication and presence of acclaimed brokers.”\nAdditional reporting by Manoj Kumar in NEW DELHI; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T11:46:35.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
