He saw a clear decline in demand for industrial goods and said conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition deal with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) was no cause for “jubilation” as big tax reforms were not on the agenda. “Companies are barely mentioned (in the deal). Businesses are rather sober about it,” said Wohlrabe.
