It was one of the performances of the season,” manager Wagner said. \n“It was our idea to press the opponent high up the pitch and win the ball. It was a fantastic afternoon for us.” \nWhile Bournemouth look relatively safe after recent wins against Arsenal and Chelsea in a seven-match unbeaten streak, manager Eddie Howe knows they cannot afford any loss of form. \n“We should look as hungry if not hungrier than them, that’s no excuse for us. Every game should be treated as a cup final,” Howe, whose side are four points ahead of Huddersfield, said. \nPritchard swept in Mounie’s pass after seven minutes for his first goal since joining the club but the home jitters returned when Stanislas took a touch before slotting an equaliser. \nMounie raised the mood and could have iced a fine individual display with a hat-trick had he been given the ball for the late penalty, but watched as Van la Parra took responsibility. \n“The most important was the win, even if I wanted to take the penalty. I leave it for Rajiv (van la Parra),” he said.
