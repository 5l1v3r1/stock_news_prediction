The game was scheduled to be launched in spring 2018.\nTake-Two’s basketball franchise “NBA 2K18”, launched in September, grabbed the No.2 spot on the 2017 best-selling games list, according to market research firm NPD Group.\nThe company’s “Grand Theft Auto V” was the No.3 selling title last year in terms of units sold, according NPD, four years after the game’s first release.\n“We are expecting another record year for ‘Grand Theft Auto Online’,” Chief Executive Strauss Zelnick said on a call with analysts. “Everything is going better-than-expected and we do have pretty high expectations.”\nThe game’s online version has also helped in its longevity. The company launched “Doomsday Heist” for “GTA Online” during the holiday quarter.\nHowever, Take-Two forecast current-quarter revenue largely below Wall Street’s expectations. The company said it expected adjusted revenue of $410 million to $460 million, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $442.1 million.\nThere is a bit of seasonality in our business. You can’t really compare quarter-to-quarter or same quarter over the prior-year quarter, Zelnick said.\nShares of the company, which more than doubled in value in 2017, fell 2.4 percent in extended trading on Wednesday.\nU.S. videogame producers typically guide below market expectations but almost always beat them. [nL3N1O73L5]\nFor the year ending March 31, Take-Two said it expected adjusted revenue forecast of $1.99 billion to $2.04 billion, up from $1.93 billion to $2.03 billion. [nBw6kjY54a]\nAnalysts on average were expecting $2.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTake-Two said it expects to deliver record adjusted revenue in excess of $2.5 billion for fiscal 2019.\nThe company reported net income of $25.1 million, or 21 cents per share, in third quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $29.8 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.\nTake-Two said it had a net benefit of $11.9 million in the latest quarter from the overhaul of the U.S. tax code.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company reported revenue of $653.9 million, while analysts’ on average had expected $663.8 million.\nReporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T03:33:52.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
