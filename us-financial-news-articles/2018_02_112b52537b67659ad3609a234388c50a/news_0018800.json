Hydro power covered 10 percent of French electricity demand in 2017.\nThe CGT, which has argued against the privatization saying it could jeopardize French energy security, said in the statement that it would organize a riposte against the plan.\nThe union had called for strikes in the past to protest the privatization plan.\nReporting by Simon Carraud, Benjamin Mallet and Jean-Baptiste Vey Writing by Bate Felix\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:46:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
