FEMSA Comercio’s Retail Division continued to open new OXXO stores at a rapid pace, while same-store sales grew in the mid-single digits reflecting a resilient but gradually moderating consumer environment in Mexico. The Health Division grew its revenues at a low-single digit rate but managed to expand its margins, driven by our operations in South America, while the Fuel Division continued its gradual improvement in profitability. For its part, Coca-Cola FEMSA realized healthy pricing in Mexico and Argentina, as well as encouraging volume growth in Brazil, Central America and the Philippines.\nAs for the full year, 2017 turned out to be a complex one on a number of fronts, and we were not fully able to convert our robust top-line growth into higher operating margins. However, we made significant progress in the development of our various business platforms and we are well prepared to take on the challenges and opportunities of the new year, which we approach –as always—with enthusiasm and cautious optimism.”\nTo obtain the full text of this earnings release, please visit our Investor Relations website at\nwww.femsa.com/investor under the Financial Reports section\nFEMSA is a leading company that participates in the beverage industry through Coca-Cola FEMSA, the largest franchise bottler of Coca-Cola products in the world by volume; and in the beer industry, through its ownership of the second largest equity stake in Heineken, one of the world's leading brewers with operations in over 70 countries.
