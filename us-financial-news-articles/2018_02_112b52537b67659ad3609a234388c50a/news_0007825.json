For the week, the euro has gained around 0.6 percent. \nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar was broadly flat as the market awaits non-farm payroll data due later on Friday. \nMany strategists say the dollar’s sensitivity to domestic news looks weak - ING analysts called it “limited and short-lived” - as investors focus on monetary policy re-pricing opportunities elsewhere. \n“Today’s US labour market report poses only temporary downside risk to the cross,” ING said in a note. \nElsewhere, the dollar added to recent gains against the Japanese yen, helping it move away from a four-month nadir of 108.28 hit a week ago. The dollar rose 0.4 percent on the day to 109.82 \nOn Friday, the Bank of Japan offered to buy an unlimited amount of JGBs with more than five to 10 years left to maturity at 2 basis points above the previous close. It also increased the amount of its planned buying in five- to 10-year JGBs to 450 billion yen from the previous 410 billion, an amount it had kept since late August. \nForeign exchange markets showed little reaction to the Japanese central bank’s move. \nThe Chinese yuan continued its recent rise against the dollar, notching up a high of 6.2773, a 2 1/2-year high. The yuan is up 0.8 percent for the week and was last trading at these levels in August 2015.
