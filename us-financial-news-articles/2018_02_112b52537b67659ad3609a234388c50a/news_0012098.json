There he will meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and visit troops at Yokota Air Base before departing for Seoul on Thursday, where he will meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nTrump has been critical of a trade imbalance between the United States and South Korea, but the official said trade was not the focus of Pence’s trip.\nAfter the memorial visit, Pence heads to Pyeongchang for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games and remains at the Games until Saturday.
