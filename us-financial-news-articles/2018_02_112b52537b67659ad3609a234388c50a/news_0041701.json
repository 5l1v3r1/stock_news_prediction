The dividend is payable on March 15, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2018.\nThe Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of an additional 4 million shares, bringing the total number of shares currently available for repurchase to 4.4 million shares. As previously noted, ITG intends to continue share repurchases in an amount sufficient to offset all the dilution from share issuances on the vesting of employee stock awards during 2018. The timing and number of shares repurchased will be dependent on a variety of factors, including market and business conditions and competing needs for the use of capital.\nAbout ITG\nInvestment Technology Group (NYSE:ITG) is a global financial technology company that helps leading brokers and asset managers improve returns for investors around the world.
