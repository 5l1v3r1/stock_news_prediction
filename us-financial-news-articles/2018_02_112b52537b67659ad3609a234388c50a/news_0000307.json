Millstone is vital for Connecticut to meet its cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy goals and aggressive carbon goals,” Paul Koonce, chief executive officer of Dominion Energy Power Generation Group, said in a statement. \nThe Connecticut General Assembly will review the report for possible action by March 1. If the legislature does nothing, Dominion said the state will proceed to a procurement that will need to begin by May 1. \nThe U.S. nuclear industry has been suffering for years as cheap and abundant natural gas from shale formations has depressed power prices, making it uneconomic for many reactors to continue operating. \nConnecticut is one of several states exploring rules to keep reactors in service to preserve carbon-free energy, jobs, taxes and a diverse resource mix. Other states looking at similar rules are Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. \nNew York and Illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors in 2016. \nOpponents of state support for Millstone said the plant does not need any help. \n“Giving an extremely profitable nuclear plant the same status as true renewables makes Dominion a winner and everyone else, especially ratepayers, losers,” said Dave Gaier, a spokesman at NRG Energy Inc, which owns gas-fired and other plants that could earn less revenue if the state subsidizes the reactors.
