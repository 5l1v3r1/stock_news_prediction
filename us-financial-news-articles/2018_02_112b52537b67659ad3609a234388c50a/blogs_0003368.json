There has been speculation that Wray might resign if Trump allows the release of the memo. An association representing FBI agents has backed Wray's stance.\nA White House official said on Thursday Trump was likely to give Congress approval on Friday to release the document that has gripped Washington and further inflamed tensions between the Republican president and the nation's top domestic law enforcement agency.\nThe four-page document has become a flashpoint in a wider battle between Republicans and Democrats over special counsel Robert Mueller's criminal probe into potential collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. The probe grew out of the FBI's Russia investigation after Trump fired Comey.\nRussia has denied collusion and Trump has called the probe a \"witch hunt.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T14:48:32.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
