Israel disputes this. Slideshow (2 Images) \nThe decision was approved unanimously by Israel’s cabinet. \nPalestinian officials condemned the move. \n“Netanyahu is trying to make facts on ground. All settlements in the West Bank, including in Jerusalem, are illegal,” said Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee. \nOn Jan. 9, Havat Gilad resident Rabbi Raziel Shevah was shot dead from a passing vehicle as he drove near his home.
