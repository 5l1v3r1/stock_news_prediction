His office was not immediately available for comment.\nThe Giffords Law Center study looked at firearms regulations and shooting death rates in all states.\nIt found of the 10 states with the lowest gun rate deaths, eight have some of the strongest gun laws: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Hawaii, Connecticut, New Jersey, California and Washington.\nReporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:40:28.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
