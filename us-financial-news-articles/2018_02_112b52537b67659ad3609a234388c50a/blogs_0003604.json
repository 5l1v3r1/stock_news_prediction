But UPS' affinity for them is helping keep the planes alive, even if they are a tiny portion of Boeing's order book of more than 5,800 planes. \nUPS said it ordered 14 additional 747-8s — worth about $5.65 billion at list prices — bringing its total to 28, counting the jumbos it ordered in 2016. The company also ordered four new Boeing 767s, worth $848.8 million at list prices.\nConsumer impatience and a seemingly insatiable appetite for promptly delivered goods are boosting air freight rates and in some cases making space aboard planes scarce. It's a boon for both traditional cargo and package delivery companies as they rush to get packages from Amazon and other retailers, carrying products from salmon to pharmaceuticals to smartphones, to consumers as fast as possible .\nAir freight demand rose by 9 percent in 2017 from a year earlier, the fastest clip since 2010, the International Air Transport Association said this week. \n\"Our intra-U.S. next-day and deferred air shipments are expanding to record levels, and UPS's International segment has produced four consecutive quarters of double-digit export shipment growth,\" said David Abney, the chairman and CEO of UPS. \"To support this strong customer demand, we continue to invest in additional air capacity, providing the critical link our customers need to markets around the world.\"\nThe air freight market isn't without risks. Overcapacity in recent years and a preference for rock-bottom costs of sending goods by sea had led to a slump in air freight rates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T02:36:24.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
