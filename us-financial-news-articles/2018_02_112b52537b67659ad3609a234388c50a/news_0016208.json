The security and media madness could give you the contrary impression,” Mary told presiding judge Marie France Keutgen. \nHe also took issue with prosecutors’ charge of attempted murder “in a terrorist context”. Witnesses, for example had not heard anyone inside the apartment shout “Allahu Akbar” (God is greatest) when shots were fired. \n“In the file there is no element which would allow Abdeslam to be convicted of a terrorist offence,” Mary said. \nAbdeslam refused to answer the judge’s questions on the opening day of the Brussels trial on Monday and declined to appear in court on Thursday. \nMary described his client as a stoic who placed his fate in God’s hands. \nBy the time of the shootout in March 2016, Abdeslam had been hiding out in Brussels for four months after fleeing Paris on the night of the November 2015 attacks. His elder brother was one of the attackers. \nAbdeslam was arrested three days after the shootout. Four days later, suicide bombers killed 32 people at Brussels Airport and on the city’s metro.
