Boeing has agreed to a Brazilian government demand that the U.S. company have no more than a 51 percent controlling share, Jardim said, without citing sources. Embraer said it would not comment on the matter. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. Boeing has sought Brazilian government approval of the partnership with Embraer that would create a new company focused on commercial aviation, excluding Embraer’s defense unit, Reuters reported three weeks ago. The logo of Brazilian aviation company Embraer is seen on a factory in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker The Valor Economico newspaper later reported that Boeing’s proposal would give it an 80 percent to 90 percent stake in a new commercial jet business with Embraer. Embraer is the world’s third largest planemaker and the leader in the 70-seat to 130-seat regional jet market. With the proposed tie-up Boeing would be the market leader in the smaller passenger jet market, creating stiffer competition for the CSeries aircraft program designed by Canada’s Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ) and backed by European rival Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ). Boeing’s initial plan to buy Embraer was rejected by the Brazilian government because it did not want a foreign company to control its defense unit for strategic security reasons. The government maintains a so-called golden share in Embraer, a former state enterprise, that gives it veto power over strategic decisions, including Boeing’s push for a tie-up. On Thursday Brazilian Defense Minister Raul Jungmann told reporters that Boeing had understood Brazil’s refusal to give up control of Embraer. He said negotiations on the creation of a third company were advancing well.
