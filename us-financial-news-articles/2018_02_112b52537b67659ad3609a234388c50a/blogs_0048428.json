He still has a super-thin Republican Party majority to work with in Congress. He still has arguably the fiercest opposition from the news media any president has ever faced in U.S. history.\nBut after the Florida High School shooting left 17 dead last week, Trump has more power than any president before him to take definitive action against gun violence.\nThat's most likely why a White House official now tells CNBC that the president is \"open\" to new rules, including banning all guns for certain individuals.\nThere are several reasons for this, but most of them are very specific to Trump in an \"only Nixon could go to China\" kind of way.\nTrump's constant support for the Second Amendment throughout the 2016 election and beyond won him the strong backing of gun owners nationwide. Overall, exit polls showed 62 percent of gun owners voted for Trump. That's four percentage points better than Mitt Romney did with that demographic in 2012 and a whopping 10 percentage points better than John McCain in 2008.\nThe National Rifle Association made Trump the biggest beneficiary of its donations and ad dollars. The NRA's political power and financial clout can be debated , but it's fair to say that the pro-gun rights demographic in America trusts Trump.\nThat trust seems to be holding up. If there was any fear of betrayal, we would have heard it by now in response to his call Tuesday to ban ammunition bump stocks that make semi-automatic weapons act more like machine guns and his repeated call over the last few days to improve background checks for gun buyers:\nTrump tweet\nOf course, neither one of those positions is really in stark opposition to what even the NRA has stated in recent years. But rest assured that there would be gun lobby push back if President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton had made the same statements.\nBut Trump can go further than this because he has the unique luxury of being the only real game in town for gun rights activists.\nThe Democratic Party was not always in lockstep with the most aggressive gun control advocates in this country.\nIn the 1970s , gun ownership was mostly a bipartisan reality in America . Only a slightly larger percentage of Republicans owned guns than Democrats. Appearing to have at least something in common with gun owners was important for all politicians. We saw that as recently as the 1990s when Bill Clinton made sure to invite the news media along when he went hunting a few times as president and a presidential candidate.\nToday,", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T19:27:09.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
