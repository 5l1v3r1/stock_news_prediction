The company sold its generic drug business in 2016, leaving its operations about split between aesthetic products and various drugs.\nAllergan forecast earnings for 2018 in the range of $15.25 to $16.00 per share, excluding items. Analysts, on average, expect $15.50 after the company previously projected earnings of at least $15.25 per share.\nThe company said its tax rate would rise to about 14 percent in 2018, reflecting a new U.S. corporate tax law that has set a fresh minimum for companies. Because the company is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, it has traditionally paid a lower tax rate than its U.S-based counterparts.\nChief Executive Officer Brent Saunders said on a conference call the company expects to maintain a step-back approach to mergers and acquisitions this year.\n“2018 will most likely be a relatively boring year for Allergan on the M&A front,” Saunders said.\nMIGRAINE DRUG Data on the drug Ubrogepant - a pill used to treat migraine episodes - came a bit earlier than analysts expected and was positive. The company expects two more studies before it submits the drug for regulatory approval next year.\nThe treatment belongs to a class of migraine drugs being developed by rivals such as Eli Lilly, Amgen and Alder Biopharmaceuticals that target a protein associated with pain signaling called CGRP.\nBotox sales jumped nearly 17 percent to $864.3 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, above consensus estimates of $778.20 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of dry-eye drug Restasis rose nearly 1 percent to $414.9 million, ahead of estimates of $388.6 million.\nAllergan recorded a gain of about $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, related to recent changes in U.S. tax law. Net profit was $3.05 billion, or $8.88 per share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $70.2 million, or $0.20 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned $4.86 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $4.74.\nReporting by Caroline Humer in New York and Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T14:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T14:32:37.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
