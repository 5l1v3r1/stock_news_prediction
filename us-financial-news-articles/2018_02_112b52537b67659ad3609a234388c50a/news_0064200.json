Our disposition pipeline is strong, and we are encouraged by our progress and ability to pay down debt with the proceeds. We remain focused on executing on our key strategic priorities of realizing synergies, selling non-core assets, optimizing the balance sheet, and opportunistically reinvesting in our hotels.”\nFinancial and Operating Results\nThe prefix “Pro forma” as defined by the Company, denotes operating results which include results for periods prior to its ownership and excludes sold hotels. Pro forma RevPAR and Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin are reported on a comparable basis and therefore exclude any hotels sold during the period and non-comparable hotels that were not open for operation or were closed for renovation for comparable periods.

The Company also amended its $150.0 million unsecured term loan due January 2022 with more favorable pricing.\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company closed on the sale of the Embassy Suites Marlborough for $23.7 million.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company’s outlook includes only hotels owned as of February 27, 2018. Potential future acquisitions or dispositions could result in a material change to the Company’s outlook. The outlook includes capital expenditures related to renovations and ROI projects in the range of $130 million to $140 million, which the Company anticipates will result in approximately 100 basis points of RevPAR disruption. The outlook also assumes 50 basis points of RevPAR headwinds related to tough comps from last year's hurricane efforts. On the margin front, the outlook assumes 60 to 70 basis points of headwinds from property taxes and insurance increases, partially driven by the impact from Proposition 13 on FelCor's California hotels.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company anticipates:\nCurrent Outlook Pro forma RevPAR growth -1.0% to +1.0% Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin 31.25% to 32.5%\nPro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA $565.0M to $600.0M\nAdjusted EBITDA $527.0M to $562.0M\nCorporate Cash General & Administrative $37.0M to $39.0M\nEarnings Call\nThe Company will conduct its quarterly analyst and investor conference call on February 28, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time).

These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the use of the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “will continue,” “intend,” “should,” or similar expressions. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, beliefs, and expectations, such forward-looking statements are not predictions of future events or guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that might cause such a difference include the following: the current global economic uncertainty, increased direct competition, changes in government regulations or accounting rules, changes in local, national, and global real estate conditions, declines in the lodging industry, seasonality of the lodging industry, risks related to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, hostilities, including future terrorist attacks or fear of hostilities that affect travel, the Company’s ability to obtain lines of credit or permanent financing on satisfactory terms, changes in interest rates, access to capital through offerings of the Company’s common and preferred shares of beneficial interest, or debt, the Company’s ability to identify suitable acquisitions, the Company’s ability to close on identified acquisitions and integrate those businesses, and inaccuracies of the Company’s accounting estimates. Given these uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The Company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and urges investors to carefully review the disclosures the Company makes concerning risks and uncertainties in the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking Statements,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report, as well as risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFor additional information or to receive press releases via email, please visit our website:\nhttp://rljlodgingtrust.com\nRLJ Lodging Trust\nNon-GAAP and Accounting Commentary\nNon-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) Financial Measures\nThe Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (4) Adjusted EBITDA, (5) Hotel EBITDA, and (6) Hotel EBITDA Margin. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of its operating performance. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA Margin as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company.\nFunds From Operations (“FFO”)\nThe Company calculates FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company’s operations. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.\nThe Company’s calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. Additionally, FFO may not be helpful when comparing the Company to non-REITs. The Company presents FFO attributable to common shareholders, which includes unitholders of limited partnership interest (“OP units”) in RLJ Lodging Trust, L.P., the Company’s operating partnership, because the OP units are redeemable for common shares of the Company. The Company believes it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO attributable to all common shares and OP units.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”)\nEBITDA is defined as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sales of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization. The Company considers EBITDA useful to an investor in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of its operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from its operating results.\nIn addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions. The Company presents EBITDA attributable to common shareholders, which includes OP units, because the OP units are redeemable for common shares of the Company. The Company believes it is meaningful for the investor to understand EBITDA attributable to all common shares and OP units.\nAdjustments to FFO and EBITDA\nThe Company adjusts FFO and EBITDA for certain items that the Company considers either outside the normal course of operations or extraordinary. The Company believes that Adjusted FFO and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income, FFO, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of its operating performance. The Company adjusts FFO and EBITDA for the following items:\nTransaction Costs: The Company excludes transaction costs expensed during the period. Non-Cash Expenses: The Company excludes the effect of certain non-cash items. The Company has excluded the amortization of share-based compensation, non-cash gain or loss on the sale of assets, and certain non-cash income taxes. Other Non-Operational Expenses: The Company excludes the effect of certain non-operational expenses. The Company excludes hurricane-related costs not reimbursed by insurance, property-level severance costs, debt modification and extinguishment costs, and other income and expenses outside the normal course of operations.\nHotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA Margin\nWith respect to Consolidated Hotel EBITDA, the Company believes that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses and certain non-cash items provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control. The Company believes property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operational performance of the Company’s hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies.\nPro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA includes unadjusted prior ownership information provided by the sellers of the hotels for periods prior to our acquisition of the hotels, which has not been audited and excludes sold hotels as applicable. Pro forma Hotel EBITDA and Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin exclude the results of non-comparable hotels that were under renovation or not open for the entirety of the comparable periods. The following is a summary of pro forma hotel adjustments:\nPro forma adjustments: Acquired hotels\nNo hotels were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.
