(NYSE:HCC) (“Warrior” or the “Company”) today announced that it has priced its previously announced private offering of $125 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “New Notes”). The New Notes will be sold at a price equal to 103.0% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest from November 2, 2017. The New Notes will be issued as additional notes under an indenture, dated as of November 2, 2017, pursuant to which Warrior previously issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “Existing Notes”).\nThe New Notes offering is expected to close on March 1, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. Warrior expects to use the net proceeds of the offering of the New Notes, together with cash on hand accumulated prior to the declaration of any special cash dividend, to pay one or more special cash dividends of up to $350 million in the aggregate to all of its stockholders on a pro rata basis.\nThe New Notes will be initially guaranteed by each of Warrior’s direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the Existing Notes and that are borrowers or guarantors under Warrior’s Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility, dated as of April 1, 2016, as amended.\nThe New Notes are being offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and to certain non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThe New Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws.\nThis press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the New Notes or any other securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
