So far, about 1,019 have been saved, while 829 redundancies have been made. \nA government spokesman said the jobs saved had been transferred to other contracting companies. \nHe said the Official Receiver did not have an estimated time for when it would finish reviewing the contracts, adding they were being reviewed in the order that most supported the extraction of “business value” for Carillion creditors. \n“These are obviously decisions that the receiver is taking, but we appreciate these are very difficult times for those people working at Carillion, and where the government can provide support we will, of course, do so,” Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said. \nThe government, as well as private partners and lenders to the company, have announced measures to assist its employees and its suppliers, most of whom were not insured against losses. \nMost recently, British Business Bank has agreed to provide up to 100 million pounds ($141 million) of lending to small businesses and workers affected by Carillion’s liquidation. \nBritain’s biggest banks have also announced a range of measures to support firms and contractors hit by Carillion, while some joint venture partners, including Kier ( KIE.L ), have brought on board some of its former staff. \nThe Official Receiver said on Monday that people who had lost their job would be entitled to claim redundancy payments. \nThe organisation is part of Britain’s Insolvency Service, an executive agency of the government’s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.
