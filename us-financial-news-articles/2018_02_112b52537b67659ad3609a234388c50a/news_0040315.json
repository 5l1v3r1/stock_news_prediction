Today’s the day that Google Chrome’s ad blocker goes live and begins flagging annoying ads. Pop-ups, autoplay video with sound and flashing animated advertisements are all forbidden under the new guidelines, and publishers who don’t remove them within 30 days will have all of their ads blocked by the browser. Publishers have had months to prepare and the search giant says less than 1% of the most-visited websites are still in violation of the rules, so don’t expect an ad block-alypse anytime soon.\nOK, Google: Show Me How to Influence an Industry Google describes its ad-blocking policy as the culmination of a monthslong, collective effort among many companies to move the publishing industry away from intrusive advertising. But some people involved in the effort told The Wall Street Journal’s Doug MacMillan that Google dominated the process and steered decision-making to favor its own ad formats. The ad-blocking rules were designed by the Coalition for Better Ads, which includes representatives from major tech, advertising and publishing firms. But several coalition members said Google conceived of the coalition and conducted the bulk of the research it used to determine which ads should be blocked. Google denied having undue influence. Since Chrome is used by more than 59% of internet users, publishers who rely on advertising have no choice but to comply.\n— Double Take for Publishers —\nSeveral publishing executives say that Chrome’s ad blocker will ultimately improve the digital advertising landscape, but they aren’t thrilled that a single company has the clout to transform the industry. As Neil Vogel, CEO of Dotdash, told me this week: “I think getting those bad ads out of the ecosystem is better for the rest of us who are doing these things well, but it’s worth discussing that one company has that much power over the internet and what gets monetized.” It’s hard to imagine that publishers, ad agencies and tech companies would come together to ban annoying ads without the prospect of Chrome’s ad blocker looming.\nSnapchat Snapshot We’re less than a week in, but NBC already has 32 million reasons to believe its digital strategy for coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics is paying off. That’s the number of Snapchat users who watched NBC-partnered coverage of the Olympics so far on the platform, according to data from Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. The network is on pace to demolish viewership of 2016’s Rio Games on Snapchat, which reached 35 million unique viewers over 18 days. NBC says its Olympic content on Snapchat generates revenue in the eight figures and doesn’t eat into television viewership. But cord-cutting and TV ratings declines are increasingly a reality, so Snapchat at least offers a way to build hype for the Olympics among younger viewers and get them to sample the coverage. Snap says “well over” 90% of the audience watching NBC-partnered content is younger than 35, and NBC says that consumption of the Olympics on all platforms is actually up .\nAbove the Line Interpublic Group of Cos. showed signs Wednesday that it may be turning a corner amid the many challenges facing the agency business, reports CMO Today. After lackluster growth through most of 2017, the company set a target for organic revenue growth of 2% to 3% this year. “While the caution we saw through much of last year will not lift overnight, we expect to gradually put the slower revenue growth of 2017 behind us,” said IPG CEO Michael Roth. Fourth-quarter results topped analysts’ expectations and IPG raised its dividend, sending the stock up 10%.\n—Criteo Rising—\nEarnings were similarly encouraging for Criteo. The ad tech firm’s fourth-quarter revenue rose 19%, news that pushed Criteo shares up 29% Wednesday. Criteo had gotten hammered by investors last year as Apple strengthened a privacy-focused feature in its Safari browser that prevents ad tracking, in turn hurting companies like Criteo that use cookies to target and measure ads. Criteo CEO Eric Eichmann told AdExchanger that he’ll be more cautious discussing the poorly understood Apple feature after it spooked investors. On the earnings call, Mr. Eichmann also played down concerns that Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation could negatively affect the company, calling the legislation “business as usual.”\nPublishers Get AMP’d While the publishing industry has been bracing for the impact of Facebook’s decision to display fewer news stories in its feed, another major tech platform has been sending more traffic to publishers. From August to early February, analytics company Chartbeat noticed that traffic to its publishing clients’ content from Google Search increased by more than 25% , according to a blog post Chartbeat CEO John Saroff wrote for Digital Content Next. Researchers at Chartbeat attribute the spike to increasing adoption of Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages, a stripped-down webpage format that loads faster on mobile devices. Mobile referrals from Google Search now outpace all referral traffic from Facebook, both desktop and mobile.\nPhoto: Chartbeat Best of the Rest Snapchat is giving influencers more metrics about the types of people viewing their posts and for how long in an attempt to lure them from Instagram.
