I think this German official has no qualifications or right to demand China release anyone,” she said.\nThe day before his detention, Yu released a strongly worded open letter in which he called for the deletion of a preamble of China’s state constitution, a section that grants the Chinese Communist Party primacy in leadership.\nThe letter was the latest in a series of statements Yu had made critical of the party and its leadership, including calling for Xi to be replaced as party leader.\nYu’s case, alongside the surprise disbarring of a second prominent rights lawyer, Sui Muqing, shortly after, have sparked outcry from China’s rights activists and their supporters both inside China and overseas.\nPetitions calling for reversals of the authorities decisions for both lawyers have been circulated in instant messenger chat groups and online, each garnering hundreds of signatures.\nReporting by Christian Shepherd; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Michael Perry and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:30:46.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
