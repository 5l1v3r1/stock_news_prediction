In the fourth quarter alone, operating profit was 738 million, down from 3.30 billion.\nSkanska, in the first big move under new Chief Executive Anders Danielsson, warned last month that full-year operating profit would be around 5.3 billion crowns and announced a new restructuring programme and an unchanged dividend for the year of 8.25 crowns per share.
