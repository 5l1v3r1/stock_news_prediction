Last year, the companies opened their first plant, located in Lucas do Rio Verde, a top soy- and corn-producing part of Mato Grosso.\nFor the second project, FS Bioenergia followed the same strategy and chose the municipality of Sorriso, in northern Mato Grosso, which is also a large grains-producing region.\n“The Sorriso area and Mato Grosso in general are strategic for us. They will provide the raw material we need to produce ethanol and (corn) meal with the quality we seek,” FS Bioenergia Chief Executive Henrique Ubrig said in a statement.\nThe Sorriso plant will be larger than the first one in Lucas do Rio Verde. The investors project an annual production of 680 million liters of ethanol, 500,000 tonnes of corn meal and 20,000 tonnes of corn oil. The plant is expected to process 1.8 million tonnes of corn per year.\nBrazil’s Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi has encouraged that type of investment in the center-west region, saying it would provide the demand it needs for its growing corn production.\nThe government has subsidized the transportation of corn from center-west states to markets in other parts of the country as a way to support prices and help farmers.\nWhen the second plant is ready, FS Bioenergia projects that it will process 3.1 million tonnes of corn per year in Mato Grosso, which currently produces around 26 million tonnes of the cereal per crop.\n($1 = 3.25 Brazilian reais)\nReporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Tom Brown and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T06:08:14.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
