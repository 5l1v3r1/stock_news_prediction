He worked on Capitol Hill with Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and Representative Adam Smith (D-WA).\n“When Shay and Wally (Burnett) merged their business into ours it couldn’t have been more seamless, and for the most part, managing that integration fell to Shay. No good deed goes unpunished,” said Stewart Hall, Crossroads Strategies co-founder and Chairman.\nThe firm also announced its hiring of Salim Alameddin, formerly of Representative Will Hurd’s (R-TX) office, as a Vice President.\nAdditionally, Katie Dapper, who spent her time on the Hill as a member of Senator Patty Murray’s (D-WA) staff is being promoted to Senior Vice President.\n“To deliver the results and the services we insist on for our clients, we need to find the best, most respected, and hardest working professionals from the Hill and industry — and then convince them our approach and culture provides the optimal environment for their future growth,” added Senior Partner, Todd Weiss.\nGleason spent 17 years on the Hill – primarily with the Sarbanes family – starting in former-Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD) office as a staff assistant, and culminating in Representative Sarbanes office as Chief of Staff. Gleason is expected to work closely with Crossroads Strategies’ technology and telecom clients, and others with issues before the House Energy and Commerce Committee and both the Energy and Commerce Committees of the Senate.\nAlameddin is a Houston native and graduate of the University of Alabama. He served on Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn’s (R-TX) staff before moving to the other side of the Hill for Congressman Hurd.\nAdams is a native of Seattle, graduate of Washington State University and the Seattle University School of Law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180213005543/en/\nfor Crossroads Strategies\nSarah Gilmore, 202-559-0170\nSource: Crossroads Strategies", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180213005543/en/"], "published": "2018-02-13T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T18:56:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
