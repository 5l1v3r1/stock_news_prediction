It pulled back later as the spectre of inflation knocked Wall Street shares lower.\nThe yen tends to benefit during times of risk aversion thanks to its perceived status as a safe haven.\n“Although stock market weakness is weighing on the dollar against the yen, the tide appears to have turned for the currency after the U.S. jobs report,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n“Speculators had gone excessively long on the yen, perhaps on misguided expectations towards Bank of Japan policy. But the U.S.-Japan yield differential is now too wide to be ignored.” Ishizuki said.\nWith benchmark Treasury yields reaching four-year highs after the jobs report, the U.S.-Japan 10-year yield spread rose to its highest since late 2007.\nThe dollar had sunk sharply against the yen when the BOJ trimmed the amount of Japanese government bonds it bought at a regular debt-purchasing operation early in January, which some market participants took as signal that the central bank was readying from an exit from its easy monetary policy.\nThe euro was steady at $1.2450 after losing 0.5 percent on Friday to pull away from a three-year peak of $1.2538 reached on Jan. 26.\nNear-term focus was on the German coalition talks set to continue later on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) failed to conclude negotiations in time to meet a self-imposed Sunday deadline.\nThe Australian dollar was 0.1 percent lower at $0.7912 , its lowest in three weeks, extending its decline after falling 1.5 percent on Friday.\nThe pound was little changed at $1.4111 after shedding 1 percent the previous day.
