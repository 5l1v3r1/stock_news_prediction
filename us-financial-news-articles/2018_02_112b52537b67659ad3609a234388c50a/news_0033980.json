(NYSE: NWHM) today announced results for the 2017 fourth quarter and full year.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nNet income of $10.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share vs. $13.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share Net income included a $3.2 million, or ($0.15) per diluted share, noncash deferred tax asset charge resulting from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Total revenues of $324.1 million vs. $322.4 million Home sales revenue of $279.9 million, up 7%; deliveries up 17% Homebuilding gross margin of 15.8% vs. 14.4%, up 140 basis points; excluding interest in cost of sales and inventory impairments, up 180 basis points to 18.0%* Net new home orders up 55% Backlog units up 94%\nFull Year 2017 Highlights Compared to Full Year 2016\nTotal revenues of $751.2 million vs. $694.5 million, an 8% increase Home sales revenue of $560.8 million, a 10% increase; deliveries up 36% Homebuilding gross margin up 100 basis points to 15.2% vs. 14.2%; excluding interest in cost of sales and impairments, up 190 basis points to 17.6%* Net new home orders up 63%\n“The New Home Company finished the year on a very strong note with our fourth quarter home sales revenue representing half of our full year total. Additionally, our deliveries were up 17% for the quarter and our homebuilding gross margin improved 140 basis points to 15.8%. We plan to build on this momentum in 2018 as we execute on our strategy to increase our community count and expand our product offerings to deliver more homes at lower, more diverse price points,” said The New Home Company’s Chief Executive Officer Larry Webb. “During 2017, we opened seven communities with initial base pricing below $750,000 and plan to open six more communities below this price point in 2018.”\nMr. Webb continued, “The healthy buyer demand we experienced in California during the year, along with the shift to more affordably-priced product, drove increases in our monthly sales absorption rates for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Net new home orders were up 55% for the 2017 fourth quarter and 63% for the full year, and we ended the year with a 94% increase in backlog units.”\nMr. Webb concluded, “We believe the favorable housing market conditions we experienced in 2017 will continue into 2018, which should position us to take advantage of healthy buyer demand, capitalize on growth opportunities, and improve shareholder returns.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nTotal revenues for the 2017 fourth quarter were $324.1 million, compared to $322.4 million in the prior year period. Net income attributable to the Company was $10.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, and included a noncash income tax charge of $3.2 million, or ($0.15) per diluted share, attributable to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax asset related to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. Excluding the deferred tax asset charge, net income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $13.7 million*, or $0.65* per diluted share, compared to $13.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in the prior year period. The 2017 fourth quarter also included a $0.9 million pretax inventory impairment related to housing as compared to $3.5 million of inventory impairments related to housing and land in the prior year period. Excluding the deferred tax asset charge, our 2017 fourth quarter net income was relatively flat with the prior year as a 7% increase in home sales revenue, a 140 basis point improvement in home sales gross margin and a $2.6 million reduction in inventory impairments were primarily offset by a $3 million decrease in joint venture income, a 50 basis point increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues and a $1.7 million decline in fee building gross margin.\nWholly Owned Projects\nHome sales revenue for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 7% to $279.9 million, compared to $261.7 million in the prior year period. The increase in home sales revenue was driven largely by a 17% increase in deliveries, which was partially offset by an 8% decline in the average selling price of homes delivered to $2.0 million due to a product mix shift.\nGross margin from home sales for the 2017 fourth quarter improved 140 basis points to 15.8%, compared to 14.4% in the prior year period. The 2017 fourth quarter included a $0.9 million inventory impairment charge related to one community while the 2016 fourth quarter included $2.4 million in housing impairment charges related to two communities. Excluding the impact of inventory impairments, the gross margin from home sales for the 2017 fourth quarter was 16.2%* vs. 15.3%* for the 2016 period. The 140 basis point improvement in home sales gross margin (90 basis points before impairment charges) was primarily due to a product mix shift, including increased deliveries in the 2017 fourth quarter from two higher-margin, coastal communities located in Newport Coast, CA. Additionally, the 2017 fourth quarter also benefited from a $0.8 million warranty reserve adjustment. Adjusted gross margin from home sales for the 2017 fourth quarter, excluding interest in cost of home sales and inventory impairments, was 18.0%* compared to 16.2%* in the prior year period.\nOur SG&A expense ratio as a percentage of home sales revenue for the 2017 fourth quarter was 8.4% versus 7.9% in the prior year period. The 50 basis point increase in the SG&A rate was primarily attributable to higher selling and marketing costs driven by greater amortization of capitalized selling and marketing costs from our two luxury communities located in Newport Coast, CA, coupled with an increase in marketing and model operating costs related to new community openings.\nNet new home orders for the 2017 fourth quarter were up 55% to 107 homes, compared to 69 homes in the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by a 44% increase in the monthly sales absorption rate and to a lesser extent, a 13% increase in active selling communities, which totaled 17 as of the end of the year. The Company's monthly sales absorption pace for the 2017 fourth quarter was 2.3 sales per average selling community, compared to 1.6 in the prior year period. The improvement in the absorption rate was driven by stronger order activity in both Southern and Northern California resulting from more affordably-priced product offerings, which generally sell at a faster pace than move-up and luxury product. The Company's cancellation rate for the 2017 fourth quarter was 8% as compared to 12% in the prior year period.\nThe dollar value of the Company's wholly owned backlog at the end of the 2017 fourth quarter was $162.3 million and totaled 153 homes, compared to $187.3 million and 79 homes in the prior year period. The decrease in backlog dollar value resulted from a 55% lower average selling price of homes in backlog to $1.1 million as compared to $2.4 million a year ago. The decline in the Company's average home price in backlog was due to the delivery of the final homes from its two higher-priced luxury communities located in Newport Coast, CA, combined with the Company's strategy to expand its product portfolio to include more affordable price points.\nFee Building Projects\nFee building revenue for the 2017 fourth quarter decreased 27% to $44.2 million, compared to $60.8 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in fee building construction activity. Our fee building gross margin was $1.0 million, compared to $2.7 million in the prior year period. Management fees from joint ventures were $1.2 million during the 2017 fourth quarter, compared to $2.0 million in the prior year period.\nUnconsolidated Joint Ventures (JVs)\nThe Company’s share of joint venture income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $0.3 million, compared to $3.3 million in the prior year period. The reduction in joint venture income was due to a 47% decrease in joint venture home sales revenue resulting from a 54% decline in deliveries, lower joint venture home sales gross margin and a reduction in joint venture land sales revenue. The decrease in joint venture home sales gross margin was largely the result of a mix shift to more Sacramento deliveries in 2017 as compared to a heavier mix of Bay Area deliveries from our higher-margin Orchard Park community in 2016.\nThe following sets forth supplemental information about the Company’s joint ventures. Such information is not included in the Company’s financial data for GAAP purposes but is provided for informational purposes.\nJoint venture net income totaled $0.6 million, compared to $9.8 million in the prior year period. Joint venture home sales revenue totaled $38.1 million, compared to $72.0 million in the prior year period, while joint venture land sales revenue totaled $1.7 million for the 2017 fourth quarter, compared to $14.7 million in the prior year period.\nAt the end of the 2017 fourth quarter, our joint ventures had seven actively selling communities compared to nine at the end of the 2016 fourth quarter. Net new home orders from joint ventures for the 2017 fourth quarter decreased 29% to 34 homes as compared to 48 homes in the prior year period. The dollar value of homes in backlog from joint ventures at the end of the 2017 fourth quarter was $66.6 million from 80 homes, compared to $55.4 million from 62 homes in the prior year period.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's provision for income taxes for the 2017 fourth quarter was $11.2 million and included a $3.2 million noncash charge related to the revaluation of its deferred tax asset resulting from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in December 2017 and reduced the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. The effective tax rate for the 2017 fourth quarter was 51.7% as compared to 37.6% for the 2016 fourth quarter, while the full year 2017 effective tax rate was 47.3% vs. 38.4% for the full year 2016. Excluding the deferred tax asset charge, the Company's effective tax rate would have been 37.0%* and 37.5%* for the 2017 fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively. Based on our current operations and geographic footprint coupled with current state income tax laws, our preliminary estimate of the full year 2018 effective income tax rate is approximately 28% to 29%, excluding the impact of any potential discrete items.\nFull Year 2017 Operating Results\nTotal revenues for the 2017 were up 8% to $751.2 million, compared to $694.5 million in the prior year. The increase in total revenues was primarily due to a 36% increase in new home deliveries, which was partially offset by a 19% decrease in the average selling price of homes delivered due to a product mix shift. Net income attributable to the Company for the full year 2017 was $17.2 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, and included a noncash deferred tax asset charge of $3.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, related to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. Excluding the deferred tax asset charge, net income for the full year 2017 was $20.3 million*, or $0.97* per diluted share, compared to $21.0 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for the full year 2016. The slight decrease in net income before the adjustment to our deferred tax asset was due to a $6.8 million reduction in joint venture income and a $3.3 million decrease in joint venture management fees, which was offset by a 10% increase in the Company's wholly owned home sales revenue and a 100 basis point improvement in home sales gross margin.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had real estate inventories totaling $416.1 million, of which $332.5 million represented work-in-process and completed homes (including models), $47.8 million in land and land under development, and $35.8 million in land deposits and pre-acquisition costs. The Company owned or controlled 2,752 lots through its wholly owned operations (excluding fee building and joint venture lots), of which 1,806 lots, or 66%, were controlled through option contracts. The Company ended the 2017 fourth quarter with $123.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and had no borrowings outstanding under its $200.0 million revolving credit facility. The Company ended the 2017 fourth quarter with $318.7 million in debt outstanding (net of unamortized discount, premium and debt issuance costs), a debt-to-capital ratio of 54.7% and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 42.4%*.\nGuidance\nThe Company's current estimate for full year guidance for 2018 is as follows:\nHome sales revenue of $600 - $660 million Fee building revenue of $110 - $140 million Home sales gross margin of 14.5% - 15.0% Income from unconsolidated joint ventures of $2 million Wholly owned active year-end community count of 20 Joint venture active year-end community count of 5\nThe Company's current estimate for the 2018 first quarter is as follows:\nHome sales revenue of $70 - $80 million Fee building revenue of $30 - $40 million Income from unconsolidated joint ventures of $0.5 million Wholly owned active quarter-end community count of 21 Joint venture active quarter-end community count of 7\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast for investors and other interested parties beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, February 14, 2018 to review fourth quarter and full year results, discuss recent events and results, and discuss the Company's initial full year and certain quarterly guidance for 2018.

We present these measures because we believe they, and similar measures, are useful to management and investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and financing structure. We also believe these measures facilitate the comparison of our operating performance and financing structure with other companies in our industry. Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles net income attributable to the Company to the non-GAAP measure of net income attributable to the Company before noncash deferred tax asset charge and earnings per share and earnings per diluted share attributable to the Company to the non-GAAP measures of earnings per share and diluted earnings per share attributable to the Company before noncash deferred tax asset charge. The table also reconciles the Company's effective tax rate to the non-GAAP measure of effective tax rate before noncash deferred tax asset charge. The revaluation of the Company's deferred tax asset was required as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in December 2017. We believe removing the impact of the noncash deferred tax asset charge is relevant to provide investors with an understanding of the impact the charge had to earnings and to allow a more direct comparison of earnings to the prior year period.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Net income attributable to The New Home Company Inc. $ 10,471 $ 13,780 $ 17,152 $ 21,022 Noncash deferred tax asset charge 3,190 — 3,190 — Net income attributable to The New Home Company Inc. before noncash deferred tax asset charge $ 13,661 $ 13,780 $ 20,342 $ 21,022 Earnings per share attributable to The New Home Company Inc.: Basic $ 0.50 $ 0.67 $ 0.82 $ 1.02 Diluted $ 0.50 $ 0.66 $ 0.82 $ 1.01 Earnings per share attributable to The New Home Company Inc. before noncash deferred tax asset charge: Basic $ 0.65 $ 0.67 $ 0.98 $ 1.02 Diluted $ 0.65 $ 0.66 $ 0.97 $ 1.01 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 20,876,766 20,712,095 20,849,736 20,685,386 Diluted 21,145,065 20,960,173 20,995,498 20,791,445 Effective tax rate for The New Home Company Inc.: Pretax income $ 21,692 $ 22,080 $ 32,531 $ 33,950 Provision for income taxes $ 11,222 $ 8,306 $ 15,390 $ 13,024 Effective tax rate (1)\n51.7 % 37.6 % 47.3 % 38.4 % Effective tax rate for The New Home Company Inc. before noncash deferred tax asset charge: Provision for income taxes $ 11,222 $ 8,306 $ 15,390 $ 13,024 Noncash deferred tax asset charge (3,190 ) — (3,190 ) — Provision for income taxes before noncash deferred tax asset charge $ 8,032 $ 8,306 $ 12,200 $ 13,024 Effective tax rate for The New Home Company Inc. before noncash deferred tax asset charge (1)\n37.0 % 37.6 % 37.5 % 38.4 % (1) Effective tax rate is computed by dividing provision for income taxes by pretax income.

Adjusted EBITDA means net income (loss) (plus cash distributions of income from unconsolidated joint ventures) before (a) income taxes, (b) interest expense, (c) amortization of previously capitalized interest included in cost of sales or other expense, (d) noncash impairment charges and abandoned project costs, (e) gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, (f) depreciation and amortization, (g) amortization of equity-based compensation and (h) income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue for a given period. The ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total interest incurred is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total interest incurred for a given period. The ratio of debt to Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing debt at the period end by Adjusted EBITDA for a given period. The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing debt at the period end less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash by Adjusted EBITDA for a given period. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA assists investors in understanding and comparing the operating characteristics of homebuilding activities by eliminating many of the differences in companies' respective capitalization, interest costs, tax position and level of impairments. Due to the significance of the GAAP components excluded, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage, the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total interest incurred, and the ratio of debt to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the following table.\nThree Months Ended LTM (1) Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) (Dollars in thousands) (Dollars in thousands) Net income $ 10,470 $ 13,774 $ 17,141 $ 20,926 $ 17,141 $ 20,926 Add: Interest amortized to cost of sales and other expense 5,333 2,314 11,057 5,331 11,057 5,331 Provision for income taxes 11,222 8,306 15,390 13,024 15,390 13,024 Depreciation and amortization 105 130 449 511 449 511 Amortization of equity-based compensation 717 869 2,803 3,471 2,803 3,471 Cash distributions of income from unconsolidated joint ventures — 1,811 1,588 3,742 1,588 3,742 Noncash impairments and abandonments 1,045 3,582 2,583 4,080 2,583 4,080 Less: Gain from notes payable principal reduction — (250 ) — (250 ) — (250 ) Equity in net income of unconsolidated joint ventures (260 ) (3,263 ) (866 ) (7,691 ) (866 ) (7,691 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 28,632 $ 27,273 $ 50,145 $ 43,144 $ 50,145 $ 43,144 Total Revenue $ 324,102 $ 322,449 $ 751,166 $ 694,456 $ 751,166 $ 694,456 Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage 8.8 % 8.5 % 6.7 % 6.2 % 6.7 % 6.2 % Interest incurred $ 6,761 $ 2,241 $ 21,978 $ 7,484 $ 21,978 $ 7,484 Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total interest incurred 2.3x 5.8x 2.3x 5.8x Total debt at period end $ 318,656 $ 118,000 $ 318,656 $ 118,000 Ratio of debt to Adjusted EBITDA 6.4x 2.7x 6.4x 2.7x Total net debt at period end $ 194,686 $ 86,919 $ 194,686 $ 86,919 Ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 3.9x 2.0x 3.9x 2.0x Total cash, inventory, and joint venture investments $ 595,513 $ 368,281 $ 595,513 $ 368,281 Ratio of cash, inventory, and joint venture investments to debt 1.9x 3.1x 1.9x 3.1x (1) \"LTM\" indicates amounts for the trailing 12 months. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s ratio of debt-to-capital to the non-GAAP ratio of net debt-to-capital. We believe that the ratio of net debt-to-capital is a relevant financial measure for management and investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of the Company’s ability to obtain financing.\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Total debt, net $ 318,656 $ 118,000 Equity, exclusive of noncontrolling interest 263,990 244,523 Total capital $ 582,646 $ 362,523 Ratio of debt-to-capital (1) 54.7 % 32.5 % Total debt, net $ 318,656 $ 118,000 Less: cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 123,970 31,081 Net debt 194,686 86,919 Equity, exclusive of noncontrolling interest 263,990 244,523 Total capital $ 458,676 $ 331,442 Ratio of net debt-to-capital (2) 42.4 % 26.2 % (1) The ratio of debt-to-capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing total debt, net by the sum of total debt, net plus equity, exclusive of noncontrolling interest. (2) The ratio of net debt-to-capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing net debt (which is total debt, net less cash to the extent necessary to reduce the debt balance to zero) by total capital, exclusive of noncontrolling interest. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of debt-to-capital. We believe the ratio of net debt-to-capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing. We believe that by deducting our cash from our debt, we provide a measure of our indebtedness that takes into account our cash liquidity. We believe this provides useful information as the ratio of debt-to-capital does not take into account our liquidity and we believe that the ratio net of cash provides supplemental information by which our financial position may be considered. Investors may also find this to be helpful when comparing our leverage to the leverage of our competitors that present similar information.
