That’s all part of football. In the Barcelona dressing room after the Chelsea game, I saw Leo (Messi) cry. That’s because players demand so much from themselves. People don’t see that,” Manchester United forward Sanchez told Sky Sports. \nBarca and Chelsea renew their rivalry in the Champions League on Feb. 20, with the La Liga leaders visiting Stamford Bridge in the first leg of their last-16 tie.
