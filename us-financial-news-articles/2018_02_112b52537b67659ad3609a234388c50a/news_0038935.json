It’s an unfortunate day to have a bad day.”\nThe Utah native could only tip his hat to Austria’s Marcel Hirscher, who picked up his second gold of the Games with victory in the giant slalom.\n“You see him race after race being on point and that’s pretty phenomenal in a sport like this where not everybody is on point every single day and he always is able to bring out those best performances,” he said.\nU.S. team coach Sasha Rearick said he was “super proud” of the way Ligety had battled back from a two-year hiatus just to get to the Games.\n“We need to go back and evaluate where did we lose that last little edge because he had it a day ago and was skiing fantastically,” he said.\n“We did not bring our best today and we need to evaluate that so we can learn for the future.”\nRearick said he hoped Ligety would continue to compete as he had “plenty of gas left in the tank” but thought whatever decision he made his legacy was assured.\n“Ted has accomplished amazing things, no athlete has won three golds at a championship event, no athlete has won at three world championships in a row,” he said.\n“It is unbelievable that he was able to stay at the top for so long and today-wise it was disappointing because we knew there was a chance that he could get close.”\nAdditional reporting by Nick Mulvenney; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty/John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T14:50:34.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
