It recently brought back Hedi Slimane, a Dior menswear alumni, as artistic director of Celine, to boost that label.\nRevenues at LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division reached 15.5 billion euros last year, up 13 percent year on year on a constant currency basis, as demand from Chinese consumers rebounded.\nBrunschwig, 57, will report to Toni Belloni, LVMH’s group managing director, and move to Rome as Fendi’s chairman and chief executive.($1 = 0.8104 euros) (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Sarah White; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:45:21.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
