As a cyber-intelligence expert and industry leader, Kellermann has strong relationships with fellow CISOs and brings more than 20 years of experience analyzing emerging cybersecurity threats and relevant defensive technologies to Carbon Black. He will play a key strategic role across Carbon Black’s products and go-to-market initiatives, working cross-functionally across the sales, marketing, product, and threat teams.\n“Tom is a highly regarded cybersecurity expert and his experience perfectly matches the balance between innovative technology, security, and evangelism that we’re looking for at Carbon Black,” said Patrick Morley, chief executive officer of Carbon Black.\nPrior to joining Carbon Black, Kellermann founded Strategic Cyber Ventures, a cybersecurity investment fund that specializes in technology transfer of cybersecurity capabilities from the U.S. and Israeli intelligence communities for private deployment. Kellermann also served as chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, where he was responsible for the analysis of emerging cybersecurity threats and relevant defensive technologies. Prior to Trend Micro, Kellermann served as vice president of security at Core Security and was deputy CISO for the World Bank Treasury. He held a seat in the Commission on Cyber Security for President Barack Obama, where he served as an advisor to the International Cyber Security Protection Alliance.

It has become clear that endpoints are the new perimeter, and that traditional endpoint security has failed. By leveraging the cloud and big data analytics to collect and analyze unfiltered endpoint data, the Cb Predictive Security Cloud is the solution the industry has been waiting for. Having worked in the field for more than 20 years, I appreciate how game-changing Carbon Black’s products are, epitomizing the ideal cyber bodyguard by anticipating, preventing, detecting and responding to threats in real-time.”\nAdditional Resources\nCb Predictive Security Cloud\nVisit carbonblack.com\nFollow @CarbonBlack_Inc on Twitter\nRead Carbon Black's blog\nAbout Carbon Black\nCarbon Black is a leading provider of next-generation endpoint security.
