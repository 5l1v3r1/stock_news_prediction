I condemn the killings in the strongest possible terms,” Zitto Kabwe, the leader of the opposition ACT-Wazalendo party said via Twitter.\nIn September opposition lawmaker Tundu Lissu, a fierce critic of President John Magufuli’s government, was shot several times by unknown gunmen in the administrative capital Dodoma. He left the country for treatment and has yet to return.\nMagufuli’s government denies cracking down on the opposition. Authorities have said the cases remain under investigation.\nReporting by Fumbuka Ng'wanakilala; Editing by Aaron Maasho and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:12:45.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
