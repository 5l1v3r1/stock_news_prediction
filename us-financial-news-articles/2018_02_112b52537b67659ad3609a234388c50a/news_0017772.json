Cowen said that was up 1 percent from 2017. \nCowen said the E&Ps it tracks planned to spend about $66.1 billion on drilling and completions in the lower 48 U.S. states in 2017, about 53 percent over what they planned to spend in 2016. \n  \n  \n  [EIA/M] \nThe current all-time U.S. output annual peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data.
