The company has a syndicated loan of about $120 million with South African banks.\nPetra, which was accused of under-declaring the value of the stones, is caught up in an industry-wide crackdown by the Tanzanian government in an effort to reap more mineral revenue. Petra has denied the accusation.\nThe consignment, which was confiscated in September, has not yet been returned but the company resumed exporting other diamond packages after a brief government-mandated stoppage.\nDippenaar said the Tanzanian government had concluded questioning its employees but it was unclear whether the full investigation was over.\n“We are hopeful that a resolution will come out in the six months to June,” he said.\nEditing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:59:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
