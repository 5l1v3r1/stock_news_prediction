Nobody can believe this! Ester Ledecka has the gold!,” they shouted immediately after she crossed the finish line.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Prime Minister Andrej Babis congratulated Ledecka on his official Twitter account: “Ester Ledecka has a GOLD! Fantastic race! Big congratulations!”A grateful Ledecka thanked fans on her Facecbook page, which swelled with more than 30,000 “likes” and 2,700 shares after her win over Austria’s Anna Veith.She thanked her parents, including her rock musician father Janek Ledecky whose musical version of Hamlet was a hit in South Korea in 2007. He supported his daughter’s career at the start with around 12 million crowns ($587,457.78) before sponsors showed up.\nHer win reminded Czechs of another surprise Olympic win in 1998 in Nagano when Jaromir Jagr and Dominik Hasek led the men’s ice hockey team to a gold medal win over Russia.\n“It is a great shock, I still can’t grasp it completely even now,” Ledecka said in an interview for www.idnes.cz news website.\n(This story has been refiled to correct penultimate paragraph to show Czechs beat Russia to win Olympic gold in Nagano.)\nReporting by Robert Muller, Editing by Michael Kahn and Clare Lovell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:09:35.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
