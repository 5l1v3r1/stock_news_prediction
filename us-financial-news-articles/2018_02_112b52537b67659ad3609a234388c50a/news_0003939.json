The bailout included recapitalising Cypriot banks through seizing uninsured deposits, a so-called ‘bail-in’ which was the first time it was implemented in the euro zone.\nPresidential candidate Nicos Anastasiades casts his vote with some help from his grandchildren, during the second round of the presidential election in Limassol, Cyprus February 4, 2018.
