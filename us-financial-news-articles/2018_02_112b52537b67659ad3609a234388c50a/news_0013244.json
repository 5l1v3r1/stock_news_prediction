This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST! [0832 EST]\n- My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @Colts [0837 EST]\n- Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery. If D's oppose this deal, they aren't serious about DACA-they just want open borders. bit.ly/2nNgIVm [1100 EST]\n- We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system. Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security. bit.ly/2nNMfqh [1105 EST]\n- Today, we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS-13, and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it.
