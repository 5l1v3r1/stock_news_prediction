REUTERS/Peter Summers She said the odds of stopping Brexit had changed from just a 1 in 10 chance when she started the job in early 2017.\n“PRETTY BAD SHAPE”\n“The mood is changing - it is probably about even right now. The country is changing...,” she said, adding that the group was holding events across Britain and campaigning on social media. It plans an advertising blitz in coming weeks to convince voters to lobby their members of parliament to vote against Brexit.\nWhile May casts the Brexit referendum result as a vote against immigration, Todd said it had exposed a deeper malaise that has left large swathes of the population cut off from booming economic growth in London and southern England.\nEloise Todd, CEO of Best for Britain, poses for a photo at their offices in London, Britain February 22, 2018.

REUTERS/Peter Summers “Our country is in pretty bad shape,” said Todd, a former international development worker from the northern English city of Hull.\nTodd said Britain’s political and business elite had failed to spread wealth and opportunity more broadly across the nation.\n“Either you just go to London to make your fortune like Dick Whittington or you stay where you are and you’re stuck,” she said, alluding to an old folklore tale of a poor young man from the provinces who becomes wealthy in the capital and eventually becomes Lord Mayor of London.\nTodd urged business leaders opposed to Brexit to speak out.\nWhen the pro-Brexit Daily Telegraph newspaper reported Soros’s donation, some Brexiteers accused him of plotting a “coup” against British democracy.\n“It is really important that people are not intimidated into not speaking up,” Todd said.\n“George Soros has fought for democracy across the world and we are proud to receive money from him and our other donors. We operate within every rule that is ascribed to us. We have never hidden it.”\n‘Best for Britain’ has raised nearly 200,000 pounds in less than two weeks in a crowdfunding campaign. Soros has pledged to match 100,000 pounds of that while another donor, private equity investor Stephen Peel, has pledged to do the same, she said.\n“We have an ambitious plan that is multiple seven figures. We think we need millions to win this fight,” Todd said.\nWriting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T12:13:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
