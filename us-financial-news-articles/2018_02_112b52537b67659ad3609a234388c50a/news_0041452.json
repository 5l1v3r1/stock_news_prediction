He also added that he hoped she would run for office so “she can be exposed and defeated just like all the others.” \nDonald Trump tweet: Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others! \nWinfrey, a talk show host, actress and philanthropist, made her debut on “60 Minutes” as a correspondent in September last year with a story about the political divide in the U.S. \nShe accepted the Golden Globes’ Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement last month, and gave an acceptance speech that explored issues of race, gender and other social and political hot buttons. \nHer speech gave rise to speculation of a potential presidential bid in 2020, but Winfrey has denied any such plans.
