CNBC.com Getty Images Students from around the region gather in front of the White House to protest the lack of gun control in the wake of last weeks shooting in Florida, on February, 19, 2018 in Washington, DC. \nThe world's largest asset manager says it plans to speak with gunmakers following a wave of public outcry sparked by the Florida school shootings last week. \nBlackRock officials said they want to reach out to the companies \"to understand their response\" to the shootings. \nThe firm, which manages $5.7 trillion for clients, indirectly owns shares in the companies through the many exchange-traded funds under BlackRock's iShares umbrella.
