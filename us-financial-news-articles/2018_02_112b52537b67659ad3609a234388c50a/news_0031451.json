On Twitter the next day, he said the document was “very political and long” and must be “heavily redacted” to protect sensitive information. Trump earlier cleared the release of a memo drafted by Intelligence Committee Republicans that alleged partisan bias in the securing of an electronic surveillance warrant on Trump campaign aide Carter Page. The president did so despite opposition from the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Democrats said the Republican document mischaracterized highly classified information and was intended to discredit the probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. “I hope we never go down this memo path again,” Schiff said of the process. “I think my colleagues in the GOP recognize it was a big mistake.” Reporting by Warren Strobel editing by Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T18:13:01.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
