REUTERS/Ammar Awad An Israeli committee led by cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi will negotiate with church representatives to try to resolve the dispute over plans to tax commercial properties owned by the church in Jerusalem, Netanyahu’s statement said.\nChurch leaders, in a joint statement, welcomed the dialogue.\nSlideshow (14 Images) “After the constructive intervention of the prime minister, the churches look forward to engage with Minister Hanegbi, and with all those who love Jerusalem to ensure that our holy city, where our Christian presence continues to face challenges, remains a place where the three monotheistic faiths (Judaism, Islam and Christianity) may live and thrive together.”\nThe Jerusalem Municipality, Netanyahu said, would suspend tax collection actions it had taken in recent weeks.Mayor Nir Barkat has said the churches owed the city more than $180 million in property tax from their commercial holdings, adding that “houses of worship” would remain exempt.\nWhile the review of the tax plan is under way, work on legislation that would allow Israel to expropriate land in Jerusalem that churches have sold to private real estate firms in recent years will also be suspended, Netanyahu said.\nThe bill’s declared aim is to protect homeowners against the possibility private companies will not extend their leases of land on which their residences stand.\nChurches are major landowners in Jerusalem. They say such a law would make it harder for them to find buyers for their land- sales that help to cover operating costs of their religious institutions.\nWriting by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T09:51:48.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
