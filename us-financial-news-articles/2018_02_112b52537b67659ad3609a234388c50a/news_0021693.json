The mine will have a lifespan of about fifteen years,” said Yai, adding that the upgrades would boost output. \nEndeavour also owns mines in Mali, Ghana and Burkina Faso, from which it expects to produce between 670,000 and 720,000 ounces of gold in 2018. \nIvory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, aims to increase gold output to diversify its economy. Last year, the country produced around 25 tonnes of gold.
