Any other activities you choose are up to you. \nThe Airbus A330-200 plane boasting the Love Suite—dubbed the Daydream Believer—will feature two other suites in its first class area, the Solo Freedom suite and the Solo Corner Office. Virgin Atlantic just announced its Love Suite for passengers who like to cuddle. Courtesy of Virgin Atlantic \nDespite the name, the airline suites aren’t exactly what you might envision. They’re lie-flat beds, but they don’t come with walls (or any sort of privacy, likely for security reasons). The three suites sit in a row, and all convert to lie-flat beds. The Love Suite is two middle seats jammed together, while the Solo Freedom suite is the aisle seat and the Solo Corner Office is the window seat (it has a view, get it?). \nWhen paying for a first class seat, including the suites, travelers get free WiFi, a barista-style coffee menu, and something called “Happy Socks.” \nFlights will start this March from Manchester, England to New York City , Boston, San Francisco, and Barbados.
