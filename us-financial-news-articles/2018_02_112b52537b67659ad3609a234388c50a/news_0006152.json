He started chipping away at the powers of the state security service while also getting rid of Karimov-era holdovers in his cabinet.\nIn November, Mirziyoyev sacked Elyor Ganiyev, minister of foreign trade, who was described in a leaked 2006 United States diplomatic cable as “the pawn of senior officials at the National Security Service” run by Inoyatov.\nLast month, Mirziyoyev said he would reform the intelligence service as it had become too powerful.\nOn Wednesday, he named Ikhtiyor Abdullayev, 51, a career lawyer who has until now served as prosecutor general, the new head of state security.\nSince his election in December 2016, Mirziyoyev has implemented a series of reforms aimed at opening up the resource-rich nation and reviving its economy which had stagnated under a Soviet-style centralized command system.\nHe has also eased security policies, striking some 16,000 people off a blacklist of potential extremists and dissidents, and releasing several prominent political prisoners.\nReporting by Olzhas Auyezov; Additional reporting by Mukhammadsharif Mamatkulov in Tashkent; Editing by Maria Kiselyova, Raissa Kasolowsky, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T15:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:22:57.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
