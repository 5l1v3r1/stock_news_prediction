In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Cottarelli said he felt honoured by the proposals, but would decide what to do only after the result of general election on March 4. “Every Italian citizen should be honored to serve his country ... so I thank the parties and movements that contacted me,” Cottarelli said. “In order to be part of a government you have to share the actual programme ... This can happen only after the vote”.
