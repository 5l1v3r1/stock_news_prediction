The pair competed in a number of Winter Olympics before retiring in 1998, and together collected some 16 gold medals .\nTorvill and Dean have since been awarded with an Order of the British Empire (OBE) award for their outstanding contributions to skating and British sport. They have also starred and helped train participants on U.K. television show \"Dancing on Ice,\" which aired from 2006 to 2014. The show has since come back onto air, with the pair acting as judges in the 2018 series.\nArmin Zoeggeler, luger Vladimir Rys Photography | Getty Images Sport | Getty Images Italy's Armin Zoeggeler takes part at the Luge Men's Singles Training session ahead of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.
