We believe there is a space for further market growth in Croatia, but we are also keeping an eye on any potential acquisition in the (Balkan) region,” Tomaskovic said.\nHT, which controls some 60 percent of the local telecom market, will release 2017 results on Feb. 21. It has said it expected revenues of around 7.65 billion kuna.\n$1 = 6.0806 kuna Reporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:46:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
