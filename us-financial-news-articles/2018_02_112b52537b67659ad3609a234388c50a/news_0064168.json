Verizon said on Wednesday it had completed its $3.1 billion acquisition of the company it announced in May 2017. The settlement represents the largest civil penalty paid to resolve an FCC investigation.\nA Verizon spokesman declined to comment. The settlement resolved conduct from before Verizon’s announced acquisition.\nThe sales proceeds does not include a separate $15 million penalty that Straight Path paid to the FCC in January 2017.\nThe licenses are important to emerging 5G technology that will allow for much faster wireless networks and could usher in advances like remote surgical procedures and self-driving vehicles.\nThe FCC said in January 2017 that Straight Path was “squatting on spectrum licenses” and that was “fundamentally inconsistent with the public good.” The FCC probe was prompted by allegations of fraud in November 2015 by an anonymous short seller of the company’s stock, Reuters reported earlier.\nVerizon outbid AT&T Inc ( T.N ), which made a bid to buy Straight Path in April 2017 valued at $1.6 billion. With the completion of Verizon’s acquisition of Straight Path, the company’s shares were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.\nReporting by David Shepardson; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T22:59:04.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
