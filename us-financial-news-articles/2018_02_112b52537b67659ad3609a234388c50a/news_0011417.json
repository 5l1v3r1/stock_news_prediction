Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Martin Schulz makes a statement before the coalition talks at the Social Democratic Party (SPD) headquarters in Berlin, Germany, February 4, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt \nBerlin Mayor Michael Mueller, another SPD negotiator, told German broadcaster ZDF he was heartened by an agreement to protect renters against excessive increases in rental costs. \n“We have a basis that is getting better day by day,” he said. \nSenior conservative Reiner Haseloff told broadcaster ARD he did not expect the talks to fail, adding: “I can’t think of any topic that is insurmountable.” AGREEMENTS ON SEVERAL ISSUES \nThe parties agreed on Sunday to invest more than 2 billion euros in social housing by 2021, to spend up to 12 billion euros on expanding broadband and to channel 33 billion euros to municipalities for various projects including childcare. \nAgreements were also reached on migration, energy and agriculture in recent days.[L8N1PT09T] \nThe SPD sees advances on labour rules and healthcare as crucial to winning over left-wing members and other sceptics. \nConservatives have thus far rejected a push by the SPD to ban short-term employment contracts imposed by employers without justification. But they have offered to prevent the repeated renewal of such short-term employment contracts as a compromise. \nThe two sides are also still at odds over the SPD’s call to replace Germany’s dual public-private healthcare system with a universal insurance system for all. \nMonday’s talks are expected to focus on improving public healthcare, such as by changing billing rules for doctors, who earn more by treating private patients.
