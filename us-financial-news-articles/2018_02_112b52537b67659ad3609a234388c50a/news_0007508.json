Brenton as Vice President of Clinical and International Market Development.\n“JenaValve is completing enrollment of its phase II CE mark trial, including the first procedure with our latest transfemoral delivery system, and the necessary funding to proceed with our strategic objectives. We have also obtained alignment with the FDA on the Company’s design of several U.S. clinical studies involving new generations of our TAVR technology and delivery systems. The timing of Laura joining is critical as we start to expand our clinical program in the U.S.,” said Chief Executive Officer Victoria E. Carr-Brendel, Ph.D. “Her deep relationships with key opinion leaders and worldwide clinical expertise on mitral and aortic valve disease will be invaluable as we accelerate our clinical development. Our strategic intent is that JenaValve technologies become available to treat the full spectrum of aortic valve disease in patients across the world.”\nMs. Brenton has devoted more than 30 years in life sciences, including over two decades in the medical device industry. Most recently, Ms. Brenton was Vice President, Clinical Affairs, at Harpoon Medical, a clinical stage medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of transcatheter beating heart mitral valve repair technology. Prior to that, she held senior leadership positions in medical, clinical and regulatory affairs at Symetis SA, Direct Flow Medical and Boston Scientific Corporation, where she gained extensive experience in TAVR and interventional cardiology. Ms. Brenton will be based at JenaValve’s corporate headquarters in Irvine, California, with oversight of both the U.S. and European clinical and professional education programs.\n“I am excited to join JenaValve at an important stage in the clinical development of its differentiated TAVR system. I believe that there are still unmet clinical needs in TAVR, especially in the lower surgical risk and aortic insufficiency patients, which JenaValve is uniquely positioned to address,” said Ms. Brenton. “I believe the technology can make a real impact in the lives of patients.”\nAbout JenaValve\nJenaValve Technology, Inc., with locations in Irvine, California, Leeds, England, and Munich, Germany, develops, manufactures and markets transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) systems to treat patients suffering from aortic valve disease.
