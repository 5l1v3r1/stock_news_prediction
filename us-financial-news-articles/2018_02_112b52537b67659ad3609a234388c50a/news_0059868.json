The newly announced partnership further expands alliantgroup's affiliation with PMPA and will allow the firm to better serve PMPA members in identifying the government-sponsored tax incentives designed expressly for the benefit of the manufacturing industry. To date, alliantgroup has helped PMPA members identify $8.5 million in federal and state tax incentives.\n\"We are delighted to name alliantgroup an Affinity Partner of PMPA,\" said Bernie Nagle, Executive Director of PMPA. \"Our organization's main mission is to ensure our members are able to adapt and thrive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. By identifying and making companies aware of the various incentives designed for their benefit, alliantgroup can be a valuable resource for our members.\"\nPMPA is the leading association representing the precision machined products industry. The organization supports legislative and regulatory changes that help to keep the manufacturing industry competitive on the world stage and provides training and developmental tools to its members in order to attract and retain a highly trained technical workforce. Due to the technical nature of their work, PMPA members are excellent candidates for specific federal and state tax incentives designed to keep technical jobs here in the United States. As the industry expert on tax incentives, alliantgroup can help PMPA members identify and take full advantage of the opportunities available to them.\nOne of the most valuable credits offered to contract manufacturers is the R&D Tax Credit . The R&D Tax Credit is the largest federal credit available to U.S. businesses and many day-to-day activities of precision job shops qualify for the credit. A wide range of activities such as custom tooling, machinery and product design are eligible and companies that have done such technical work, or introduced new or improved processes for operations, may be eligible for this incentive.\n\"We at alliantgroup are honored to be named an Affinity Partner and to be further expanding our relationship with PMPA,\" said alliantgroup CEO Dhaval Jadav . \"We look forward to further helping PMPA members secure and maximize these valuable government-sponsored incentives.\"\nFor more information on alliantgroup and our tax consulting services, please contact Jennifer Groff at (713) 552-5657 or email jennifer.groff@alliantgroup.com .\nalliantgroup is a leading tax consultancy and the nation's premier provider of specialty tax services.
