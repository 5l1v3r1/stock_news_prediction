Same-store sales at the brand fell in the first two quarters of 2017 and rose 1 percent in the third quarter.\nAnalysts expect same-store sales at the Gap brand to fall 0.17 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nBrent Hyder, head of global talent and sustainability at Gap, will oversee the brand as the retailer looks for a new president, the company said.\nThe company’s stock has risen 38 percent in the past 12 months, well ahead of the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD that has risen 21 percent in the same period.\nReporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Sayantani Ghosh\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:14:30.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
