National Post tweet: The Post's #frontpage for Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2018. \nAccording to many commentators in the media, the Indian government is wary of Trudeau for his alleged ties to advocates for a separate Sikh homeland, called Khalistan, in the Punjab region. \nIn fact, Canada's National Post notes that Trudeau's cabinet has had four Sikhs in it, including one who an Indian official labeled a sympathizer to the separatists. The Canadian leader, the National Post says, once even bragged that his cabinet had more Sikhs in it than Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's . \n\"[The trip] is best described as a slow-moving train wreck ... Very little substance has come out of it and very little actually will emerge from this visit apart from some nice photo ops,\" Dehejia told CNBC on Wednesday. \nDehejia said he believes Trudeau's visit was orchestrated to appease the significant Sikh population in Canada, making the international trip essentially about domestic politics. Trudeau's schedule for his visit to India has been scrutinized for including only half-a-day of official state engagements in New Delhi.

He's made a couple of page-three appearances because of his very nice Indian ethnic wear and his very photogenic family. But apart from that, really he's not playing much here,\" Dehejia explained.
