LeEco had disputed that figure.\nLeshi, which listed the amount of loans and liabilities due at the end of this year in a statement late on Friday, used to be the main listed unit of Jia’s LeEco.\nBut Leshi, controlled now by property developer Sunac China - its second-largest shareholder, is trying to distance itself from the LeEco brand.\nLeEco was once China’s Netflix-to-Tesla contender but ran into a cash crunch since late 2016 after expanding too fast.
