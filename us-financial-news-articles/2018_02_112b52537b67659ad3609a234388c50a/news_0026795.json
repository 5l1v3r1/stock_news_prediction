FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n1. Consolidated Revenue amounted to S/ 1,860.3 million (+2.7% YoY), while Volume reached 491.3 thousand tons (+6.0% YoY). Increase in Revenue was mainly explained by:\ni) a 2.2% YoY increase in the Consumer Goods Peru business due to growth from existing innovations and from redesigning our commercial strategy for the economic segment, mainly in our core categories, and ii) a 14.6% YoY increase in the Aquaculture business mainly as a result of gaining market share in the Ecuador’s shrimp feed market, coupled with an expansion within the market.\n2. Revenue and Volume from the Consumer Goods Peru business reached S/693.5 million (+2.2% YoY) and 137.3 thousand tons (+1.0% YoY) during Q4 17’. This increase was mainly explained by: i) the Canned Tuna category (+S/ 12.5 million), and ii) the growth in our economic segment of our core categories such as Sauces (+10.0% YoY), Cookies & Crackers (+7.9% YoY), Domestic Oil (+2.4% YoY), as well as Softeners (+39.7% YoY). Furthermore, the Company’s commercial strategy resulted in an equal or a higher volume share in 17 out of our 21 categories (including subcategories).\n3. Regarding product innovation, during Q4 17’ the Company launched/revamped 12 products (8 in Consumer Goods Peru, 3 in Consumer Goods International and 1 in B2B) The following launches can be highlighted: i) an orange flavored panettone under the “Blanca Flor” mega brand, seeking to strengthen the brand and widen its portfolio, ii) “Choco ¡bum! pop” & “Mini glacitas” under the “Victoria” brand and “Margarita mini” under the “Sayon” brand; we are aiming to gain market share with these new format presentations within the Cookies & Crackers categories.\n4. Gross Margin increased by 2.4 p.p. YoY (32.5% in Q4 17’ versus 30.1% in Q4 16’), while Gross Profit reached S/ 603.7 million, a 10.8% increase compared to the S/ 544.9 million of Q4 16’.

EBITDA amounted to S/ 225.3 million (+3.0% YoY), and EBITDA Margin reached 12.1%, aligned with the Margin reported in Q4 16’\n6. Consequently, Net Income totaled S/125.9 million during Q4 17’, (+56.9% YoY), while Net Margin reached 6.8%, (+2.3 p.p. YoY).
