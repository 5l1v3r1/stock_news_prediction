It scrapped the study almost exactly one year after ending a different late-stage trial of the same drug in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.\nVerubecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer’s drugs called BACE1 inhibitors that target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaques in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.\nThere have been a number of high-profile failures in Alzheimer’s drug development in recent years. Pfizer Inc said last month that it was abandoning research to find new drugs aimed at treating Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.\nLilly previously endured multiple failures with its solanezumab, which also targets beta amyloid, but in a different way. In the most recent setback, Lilly said that drug failed to slow declines in mental capacity of patients with even mild symptoms.\nReporting by Michael ErmanEditing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T00:22:12.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
