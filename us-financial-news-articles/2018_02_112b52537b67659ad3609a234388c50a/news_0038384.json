You’ve had such a rally for the week, and people have been looking for an excuse to take profits heading into the weekend,” said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.\nAt 2:26 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.08 percent at 25,179.42 points, while the S&P 500 had lost 0.09 percent to 2,728.81.\nThe Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.35 percent to 7,231.05.
