I feel I am making some good passes at the golf ball and I’ve got pretty good pace on the greens, except for that putt at 16.”\nFeb 23, 2018; Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA; Tiger Woods plays his shot from the bunker on the 18th during the second round of The Honda Classic golf tournament at PGA National (Champion).

A bunch of pars and kind of hang on.”\nFeb 23, 2018; Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA; Tiger Woods tees off on the 18th during the second round of The Honda Classic golf tournament at PGA National (Champion).
