Yes, he said we’re going to have to raise rates, but we are going to have to do that gradually,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.\nPowell’s first public outing will be next week, when he will testify separately before the House and Senate committees.\n“There is a potential for volatility next week in Powell’s Q&A, as well as economic data. The chances of the market getting surprises are better than average,” said Tom Essaye, founder of investment research firm Sevens Report.\nAt 12:43 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 0.58 percent to 25,108.06 and the S&P 500 .SPX was up 0.8 percent at 2,725.59. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 0.85 percent to 7,271.46.\nWhile the Dow and the S&P are still on track to post small losses for the week, the Nasdaq is set for its second straight week of gains.\nThe Fed comments helped U.S. Treasury 10-year note yields US10YT=RR ease to 2.8678 percent, from a high of 2.9570 percent it hit on Wednesday when the Fed minutes showed policymakers believed inflation would perk up.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE.N ) and HP Inc ( HPQ.N ) were among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, rising 9.8 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively.\nThe two companies created from the split of Hewlett Packard Co in 2015, reported strong results and HPE also announced a plan to return $7 billion to shareholders.\n“HPE is a stock that you don’t normally consider a leader, but those earnings were really impressive,” said Kinahan.\nThe S&P technology index .SPLRCT rose 1.3 percent, with chipmakers among the major gainers.\nIntel ( INTC.O ) was up 3.5 percent and Micron ( MU.O ) gained nearly 5 percent, helping the Philadelphia semiconductor index .SOX up 1.02 percent.\nBlue Buffalo Pet Products ( BUFF.O ) jumped 17 percent after General Mills ( GIS.N ) said it would buy the natural pet food maker for $8 billion. General Mills was the biggest loser on S&P 500, falling about 3.7 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,965 to 820. On the Nasdaq, 1,638 issues rose and 1,074 fell.\nReporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Savio D'Souza\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:21:42.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
