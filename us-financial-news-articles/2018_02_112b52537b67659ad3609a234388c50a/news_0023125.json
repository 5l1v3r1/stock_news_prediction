Women Preliminary Round Match - Canada v Olympic Athletes from Russia - Gangneung Hockey Centre, Gangneung, South Korea – February 11, 2018 - Melodie Daoust of Canada and goalkeeper Nadezhda Morozova, an Olympic athlete from Russia, in action. REUTERS/Brian Snyder \nThose boiled over in a minor incident last week when a Russian hockey coach said he had been verbally abused in the Olympic Village over the participation of Russian athletes. \nNo one seemed quite certain if that incident involved a Canadian but just to be sure the Canadian Olympic Committee issued an apology anyway. \nThat, however, is where the goodwill appeared to end. \nCanada were relentless right from the opening faceoff but despite badly outplaying and outshooting their opponent 15-5, they could not put a puck past a brilliant netminder Nadezhda Morozova. \nThe assault carried over into the second quarter and the breakthrough came quickly. Brianne Jenner, from behind the OAR net, spotted Rebecca Johnston unmarked powering down the slot. Taking a perfect feed, Johnston hammered it into the open net. \nOnly two minutes later, Haley Irwin made it 2-0 and Melodie Daoust added another late in the frame to send Canada into the second intermission with a comfortable lead. \nJohnston and Daoust each notched their second of the night in the third while Ann-Renee Desbiens completed the shutout.
