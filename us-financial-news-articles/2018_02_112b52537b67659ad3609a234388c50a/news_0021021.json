SICO Bahrain had forecast a profit of 22.3 million riyals. \nBut food retailer Abdullah Al-Othaim Markets, which rose on Tuesday after saying quarterly profit grew 75 percent, climbed a further 5.5 percent. \nDubai’s index gained 0.8 percent as blue chip Emaar Properties added 1.1 percent. In Abu Dhabi, the index rose 1.2 percent as the biggest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank, climbed 1.3 percent. \nRas Al Khaimah Ceramics jumped 3.6 percent in thin trade after reporting it swung into the black last year and hiking its dividend. \nQatar’s index, which suffered more than other Gulf markets during the recent global downturn, surged 2.7 percent in active trade. \nMarket sources told Reuters on Tuesday that Masraf Al Rayan and Amwal planned this quarter to list exchange-traded funds, which could give the market a boost.
