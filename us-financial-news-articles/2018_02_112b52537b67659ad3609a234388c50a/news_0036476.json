The fiscal year 2017 net loss of $30 thousand included $900 thousand other income reported in the third quarter 2017.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter 2017 was $2.1 million, compared to $1.4 million in the fourth quarter 2016.

For the year, the gross profit margin decreased to 59%, compared to 64% in 2016. Gross profit margin decreased in 2017 mainly due to increased levels of material and labor costs included in deliverables during 2017.\nIntrusion’s fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses were $1.0 million, compared to $1.2 million in the fourth quarter 2016. For the year 2017, operating expenses were $4.8 million, compared to $5.3 million in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Intrusion reported cash and cash equivalents of $0.2 million, a working capital deficiency of $0.8 million, and debt of $2.9 million.

This compares to $4.8 million of orders in 2016. This significant build up in bookings of orders during 2017, especially in the fourth quarter, is the result of our increased sales efforts in the Trace Cop business segment.
