(NASDAQ:PXLW), a leading provider of power efficient visual processing solutions, today announced financial results and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nRevenue of $18.4 million increased 15.4% year-over-year Mobile revenue grew over 120% sequentially Cash flow from operations was $1.4 million HDR reference design for Iris mobile display processor approved by leading streaming service provider Increased number of engagements for mobile programs incorporating Iris display processor Finalized multi-million dollar development agreement with OEM in Japan for next-generation video delivery products\nFull Year and 2017 Highlights\nRevenue of $80.6 million, including $15.3 million related to End of Life (EOL) products Revenue excluding EOL grew 34.6% year-over-year GAAP gross profit margin of 51.8%, and non-GAAP gross profit margin of 55.2% Achieved GAAP profitability in first half of 2017, and achieved non-GAAP profitability for the full year Completed acquisition of ViXS Systems in August, followed by a streamlining of the business to drive an estimated $4.0 million in annualized cost savings Recorded adjusted EBITDA of $12.9 million, and ended year with a net cash balance of $27.5 million\nPresident and CEO of Pixelworks, Todd DeBonis, commented, “Fourth quarter revenue was at the high-end of our guidance range and grew 15.4% year-over-year. Excluding over $15 million in revenue contribution from end-of-life products during 2017, which added over $10 million of non-dilutive capital to the balance sheet, we achieved full year revenue growth of 35% – marking a transformational year of growth for Pixelworks. Additionally, gross margin expanded by over 450 basis points year-on-year in 2017, and we generated over $12 million in cash flow from operations and delivered non-GAAP profitability for the full year.\n“Also during the year, we opportunistically acquired ViXS’ highly synergistic group of video-centric engineers and video delivery products, as well as a complementary portfolio of over 450 patents. We’ve now focused this business exclusively on consumer electronics applications, including OTA streaming devices. In the mobile market, we successfully completed and began sampling our fourth generation Iris mobile display processor, and entering 2018 we have customer engagements for both our third and fourth generation Iris chips that are anticipated to ramp later this year. As market trends continue toward the increased adoption of higher-quality image and video-centric solutions, I believe Pixelworks is well positioned to execute on and capture sizable growth opportunities in both our mobile and video delivery end markets.”\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal 2017 Financial Results\nFor the fourth quarter 2017, revenue was $18.4 million, compared to $18.8 million in the prior quarter and $16.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher demand for chips sold into the digital projection market as well as contribution from the video delivery business the Company acquired in August 2017. For the full year 2017, revenue was $80.6 million, which included approximately $15.3 million of end-of-life (EOL) product revenue, compared to full year revenue of $53.4 million in 2016. Excluding the contributions from EOL, full year 2017 revenue grew 34.6% year-over-year.\nOn a GAAP basis, gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 49.7%, compared to 48.0% in the third quarter of 2017 and 53.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016.

For the full year 2017, non-GAAP net income was $7.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $4.1 million, or ($0.14) per share, for the full year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $778,000, compared to $2.3 million in the previous quarter and $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The company is headquartered in San Jose, CA.\nFor more information, please visit the company’s Web site at www.pixelworks.com .\nNote: Pixelworks and the Pixelworks logo are registered trademarks of Pixelworks, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis earnings release makes reference to non-GAAP gross profit margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, which exclude amortization of deferred revenue fair value adjustment, inventory step-up and backlog amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expenses, fair value adjustment on convertible debt conversion option, discount accretion on convertible debt fair value, gain on extinguishment of convertible debt and a tax benefit associated with new tax treatment under the tax reform, which are all required under GAAP as well as the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments. The press release also makes reference to and reconciles GAAP net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA, which Pixelworks defines as GAAP net income (loss) before interest expense and other, net, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization, as well as the specific items listed above.\nPixelworks management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the business and establish its operational goals, review its operations on a period to period basis, for compensation evaluations, to measure performance, and for budgeting and resource allocation. Pixelworks management believes it is useful for the Company and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information and non-GAAP financial measures to help assess the performance of Pixelworks ’ continuing businesses and to evaluate Pixelworks ’ future prospects. These non-GAAP measures, when reviewed together with the GAAP financial information, provide additional transparency and more complete information for comparison and analysis of operating performance and trends. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items to facilitate management ’ s review of the comparability of our core operating results on a period to period basis.\nIn calculating the above non-GAAP results, management specifically adjusted for certain items related to the acquisition of ViXS Systems, Inc., including amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of inventory step up and deferred revenue both related to fair valuing the items, acquisition and integration related costs such as accounting and legal fees and CEO severance, restructuring expenses related to a reduction in workforce, accretion on convertible debt of ViXS fair value adjustments on embedded derivative features of such convertible debt and extinguishment of such convertible debt. Management considers these items as either limited in term or having no impact on Pixelworks ’ cash flows, and therefore has excluded such items to better facilitate a review of current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\nBecause the Company ’ s non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company ’ s consolidated financial results as presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is included in this earnings release which is available in the investor relations section of the Pixelworks' website.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements may be identified by use of terms such as “ begin, ” “ continue, ” “ will, ” “ expect ” , “ believe, ” “ anticipate ” and similar terms or the negative of such terms, and include, without limitation, statements about the Company ’ s digital projection, mobile and OTA businesses, including market movement and demand, customer engagements, and growth in the mobile and video delivery markets, synergies and additional guidance. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements for purposes of this release, including any projections of revenue or other financial items or any statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve numerous risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Actual results could vary materially from those contained in forward looking statements due to many factors, including, without limitation: whether the Company will be able to implement the restructuring program as planned, whether the expected amount of the costs associated with the restructuring program will differ from or exceed the Company's estimates and whether the Company will be able to realize the full amount of estimated savings from the restructuring program or within the timeframe expected; our ability to execute on our strategy, including the integration of ViXS; competitive factors, such as rival chip architectures, introduction or traction by competing designs, or pricing pressures; the success of our products in expanded markets; current global economic challenges; changes in the digital display and projection markets; seasonality in the consumer electronics market; our efforts to achieve profitability from operations; our limited financial resources and our ability to attract and retain key personnel. More information regarding potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements is included from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as subsequent SEC filings.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this release speak as of the date of this release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n- Financial Tables Follow -\nPIXELWORKS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per share
