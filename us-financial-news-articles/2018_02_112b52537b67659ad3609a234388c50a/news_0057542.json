Microsoft recently introduced the Microsoft 365 bundle, which includes Office as well as Windows, along with enterprise security and mobility services.\nNadella also talked up the company's potential in the Azure public cloud infrastructure business, where it competes with Google as well as Amazon Web Services.\n\"We had a good business in our server business, but this business is orders of magnitude bigger than what used to be a successful server business,\" he said.\nAt the same time, Microsoft has also found rising revenue in the sale of cloud-based business intelligence software for charting and analyzing corporate data, with the Power BI product, which competes with Salesforce's Analytics Cloud and Tableau.\n\"We went from nowhere to being the leader in BI in the cloud,\" Nadella said. Microsoft expects Power BI to have a $500 million annualized billings run rate for its 2018 fiscal year, he said.\nPlus, the Dynamics 365 offering, which includes a tool for managing relationships with customers, grew 70 percent in the most recent quarter , Nadella said.\nNadella took over from Steve Ballmer as the head of Microsoft four years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T20:05:07.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
