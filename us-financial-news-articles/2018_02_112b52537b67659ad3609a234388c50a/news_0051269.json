Some of Wall Street's largest exchange-traded funds are currently invested in American Outdoor Brands — formerly Smith & Wesson — and Sturm, Ruger & Co. , designers, makers, and retailers of firearms for domestic buyers. Exchange-traded funds holding American Outdoor Brands and Sturm, Ruger & Co.

To be sure, while each fund in the list contains shares both of American Outdoor Brands and Sturm, Ruger & Co., the gun stocks tend to comprise a very small fraction of the entire fund, less than 1% of the entire portfolio. The funds on the list are largely \"passive.\" That is, they are investors in the stocks because the shares are members in certain indexes tracking the economy. There isn't a manager making a conscious decision to buy the gunmakers for these funds, they are invested in the stocks because these companies are in the appropriate index mimicking a part of the U.S. economy. © CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
