Hargreaves said it expected to maintain a sustainable and progressive dividend going forward.\n$1 = 0.7154 pounds Reporting by Simon Jessop, editing by Maiya Keidan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:47:20.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
