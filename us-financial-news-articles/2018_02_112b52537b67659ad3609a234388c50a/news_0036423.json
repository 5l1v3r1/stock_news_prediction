Ankara wants to prevent Syria’s Kurds from gaining autonomy and fuelling Kurdish insurgents on its soil and last month launched a military incursion into the Afrin region of Syria to sweep the YPG from its southern border zone.\nTillerson also said the United States has had “fruitful meetings” with Europeans on the Iran nuclear deal, but said work on this issue was not yet over.\nReporting by Lisa Barrington; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:51:27.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
