Federer, 36, who guaranteed becoming the oldest ever ATP world number one by reaching the semi-final, had won all six of his previous meetings with Dimitrov and was in command throughout Sunday’s 55-minute final. He broke the Bulgarian opponent early in the contest and cruised to a one-set lead at the Ahoy Rotterdam. Playing flawless tennis, the 20-times major winner carried the momentum forward in the second set to seal a 97th career title and third in Rotterdam having won in 2005 and 2012.

It’s very special.” Federer said he had expected a tougher afternoon against Dimitrov who will rise from five to four in the rankings. “Grigor is a great player and a great athlete and he’s been playing super well in recent months,” he said. “I thought that this wasn’t going to be the result, but he looked to be struggling a bit and I never looked back. I was able to execute my tennis the way I wanted to. I‘m very happy.” Writing by Martyn Herman; Editing by Clare Fallon and Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T19:28:34.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
