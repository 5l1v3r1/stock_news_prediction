The move underscored China’s determination to curb growth in its massive steel sector.\n“The surplus to be shut this year isn’t hard, but the main task is consolidating the results and prevent closed mills from resuming production. Also there is concern that the tough capacity swap rules may not be implemented strictly,” said Kevin Bai, an analyst with CRU in Beijing.\nThe rising steel prices helped to push 2017 profits at medium- and large-sized steel mills up sevenfold from the previous year to 177.3 billion yuan ($28.32 billion), the ministry said.\nSales revenue rose 34.1 percent from a year ago to 3.69 trillion yuan, the ministry said.\nChina’s environmental crackdown, the supply-side reform and the closure of lower-end induction furnaces have pushed steel rebar prices up by about 38 percent in the past year. But, the improving market conditions had lured some closed mills to resume production.\nChina shut down 115 million tonnes of steel capacity between 2016 and 2017, and closed 140 million tonnes of induction furnaces that use scrap metal to make steel.\nIn 2017, China produced a record volume of steel at 832 million tonnes.\nChina will encourage companies to build more electric furnaces to process scrap and urge companies to move production out of sensitive regions, including northern Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, it added.\n($1 = 6.2595 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting by Ruby Lian and Josephine Mason; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T13:31:50.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
