The accident happened as the jet was taking off for a flight display at the airshow. \nChangi Airport said in a tweet that departing and arriving flights would be delayed during the next few hours. \nChangi, the world’s sixth-busiest airport for international traffic, has more than 100 airlines operating from it and handled a record 62.2 million passenger movements in 2017. \nThe T-50 was developed jointly with Lockheed Martin. The T-50A variant is participating in the U.S. Air Force’s multibillion-dollar T-X competiton for the service’s next-generation training aircraft.
