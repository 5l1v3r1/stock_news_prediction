Sharpless . \"Sailors for the Sea will now help us reach them in in ways that will prove truly beneficial for Oceana's conservation campaigns.\"\nThe two entities' boards of directors, following an effort initiated by Oceana, unanimously approved the plan to combine. Sailors for the Sea will file a petition with the Massachusetts Attorney General and the Supreme Judicial Court for approval of the combination under Massachusetts law. In the meantime, David Rockefeller, Jr. has joined Oceana's Board of Directors and Sailors for the Sea board members have been invited to join Oceana's Ocean Council.\nOceana plans to maintain the office of Sailors for the Sea in Newport, RI, where staff will continue running the core Sailors for the Sea programs including Clean Regattas, KELP (Kids Environmental Lesson Plans) and the Green Boating Guide.\nDavid Rockefeller, Jr., chairman of Rockefeller & Co., Inc., is an active participant in the nonprofit arena, especially in the areas of environment, the arts, public education and philanthropy. He founded Sailors for the Sea in 2004 in partnership with Dr. David Treadway. Mr. Rockefeller, a former member of the Pew Oceans Commission, has raced and cruised the ocean waters for over forty years, from Labrador to Miami, San Diego to Alaska, Scotland and Sweden to Turkey, and Italy.\nSailors for the Sea affiliates in Japan and Portugal will also continue their existing efforts as well as their association with the Sailors for the Sea brand while beginning efforts to support Oceana's global campaigns.\nFor more information about Oceana and Sailors for the Sea, please visit www.oceana.org and www.sailorsforthesea.org .\nContact:\nMelia Manter\n202-467-1963\nmmanter@oceana.org\n releases/oceana-and-sailors-for-the-sea-plan-to-join-forces-300598087.html\nSOURCE Oceana", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oceana-and-sailors-for-the-sea-plan-to-join-forces-300598087.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T01:02:01.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
