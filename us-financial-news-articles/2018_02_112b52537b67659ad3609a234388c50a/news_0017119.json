The Tigers converted 44.4 percent from the field but committed 18 turnovers to the Shockers’ eight.\nJeremiah Martin paced Memphis (14-10, 5-6) with 16 points, doing most of his damage at the foul line, where he went 12 of 14. Kareem Brewton hit for 12 points and Raynere Thornton scored 11.\nThe final margin notwithstanding, the Tigers actually were in contention with just under nine minutes remaining. A 3-point play by Brewton drew Memphis within 54-49, but at that point, Wichita State pressed the figurative X button.\nShamet hit a layup, and Shaquille Morris’ subsequent three-point play upped the margin to 59-49. Another Shamet layup made it a 12-point game, and it was never close after that. The advantage bulged as high as 27 in the final 90 seconds before the Tigers made things a bit more respectable at the end.\nIt took Wichita State only 77 seconds to open up a 7-0 lead. Rashard Kelly dunked 11 seconds into the game, followed by a pair of free throws from Brown and a 3-pointer by Shamet. Kelly’s layup made it 12-2 before the first TV timeout.\nThornton canned a 3-pointer with 11:50 remaining in the half to draw the Tigers within 17-15, but the Shockers expanded the lead to 40-29 at the half when Brown made a pair of foul shots 44 seconds before intermission.\nWichita State controlled the boards 39-28 overall. The Shockers drew assists on 18 of their 27 field goals, with six players finishing with multiple helpers.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:16:32.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
