(the “Company” or “MPT”) (NYSE: MPW) today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and recent highlights.\n“MPT’s overriding objective is to create value for our shareholders, and we accomplished this again in the fourth quarter by growing normalized FFO more than 19% to a record $0.37 per share. Annual results also included a record $1.35 per share normalized FFO and we delivered total shareholder returns at the very top of the healthcare REIT sector,” said Edward K. Aldag, Jr., MPT’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “During this outstanding year, we executed extremely well in the capital markets, issuing dollar and euro-denominated debt at the lowest coupons in our history and made strongly accretive investments, winning transactions against large, sophisticated competition. These acquisitions contributed to 33% growth in assets year over year, and an enterprise value that is now approaching $10 billion. Indeed, 2017 was an active year for MPT, and we are well positioned for continued accretive growth in 2018 and beyond,” said Aldag.\nFOURTH QUARTER AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS\nNet income of $0.19 and Normalized Funds from Operations (“NFFO”) of $0.37 in the fourth quarter, both on a per diluted share basis, representing increases of 46% and 19% respectively compared to $0.13 and $0.31 in prior year quarter; Closed approximately $2.2 billion in acquisitions in 2017 compared to approximately $1.8 billion in 2016 and $1.7 billion in 2015 resulting in 34% compound annual growth in assets over the past three years; Transitioned Adeptus leases for all 11 Colorado emergency facilities to investment grade-rated UCHealth and amended the master lease to provide a new 15-year initial term effective January 1, 2018 with three five-year renewal options; Completed the previously announced acquisition of three Median rehabilitation hospitals in late November for an aggregate purchase price of €80 million, or approximately $95 million; Commenced funding the development of an 88-bed general acute care hospital in Idaho Falls, Idaho in December with an expected total investment of $113.5 million; and Entered into At-the-Market agreements under which MPT may issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $750 million from time to time over the next three years.\nIncluded in the financial tables accompanying this press release is information about the Company’s assets and liabilities, net income and reconciliations of net income to FFO, NFFO and Adjusted Funds from Operations (“AFFO”), all on a basis comparable to 2016 results.\nPORTFOLIO UPDATE\nIn the fourth quarter, MPT completed $95.0 million in real estate acquisitions and commenced funding the development of a $113.5 million acute care hospital.

These amounts are included with the activity of all of our equity interests in the \"Other income (expense)\" line on the consolidated statements of income. (B)\nRepresents additional rent received from one tenant in advance of when we can recognize as revenue for accounting purposes. This additional rent is being recorded to revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease life. Investors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations, or FFO, as a supplemental performance measure. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) on sales of real estate and impairment charges on real estate assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose normalized FFO, which adjusts FFO for items that relate to unanticipated or non-core events or activities or accounting changes that, if not noted, would make comparison to prior period results and market expectations less meaningful to investors and analysts. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and the use of normalized FFO makes comparisons of our operating results with prior periods and other companies more meaningful. While FFO and normalized FFO are relevant and widely used supplemental measures of operating and financial performance of REITs, they should not be viewed as a substitute measure of our operating performance since the measures do not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which can be significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations. FFO and normalized FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity. We calculate adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, by subtracting from or adding to normalized FFO (i) unbilled rent revenue, (ii) non-cash share-based compensation expense, and (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs. AFFO is an operating measurement that we use to analyze our results of operations based on the receipt, rather than the accrual, of our rental revenue and on certain other adjustments. We believe that this is an important measurement because our leases generally have significant contractual escalations of base rents and therefore result in recognition of rental income that is not collected until future periods, and costs that are deferred or are non-cash charges. Our calculation of AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO or similarly titled measures reported by other REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (calculated pursuant to GAAP) as an indicator of our results of operations or to cash flow from operating activities (calculated pursuant to GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity.
