New foreign hires at Zhongguancun Science Park will enjoy generous visa terms and more will also get the coveted permanent residence certificate, which confers greater freedom of cross-border travel as well as local economic benefits. Foreigners with permanent residence will also be allowed to head national-level innovation projects, and serve as the legal representative of new scientific research institutions in China, the Beijing municipal government said in a statement at a media briefing on Tuesday. China has laid out a roadmap to become a world leader in AI by 2030, aiming to surpass European and U.S. dominance in cutting-edge technologies and build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion. It has established dozens of new high-tech parks and incubators aimed at promoting technologies such as AI, robotics and big data.

Z-Park has 10 overseas liaison offices designed to attract tech talents in countries like the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Finland. Z-Park has offered permanent residence to 258 foreigners since 2016, according to a report by the official Xinhua News Agency in September last year. In 2017, Beijing processed a total of 662 applications in from foreigners seeking permanent residence under a scheme to attract talent in sectors ranging from culture to tech. The Beijing municipality has said it will even consider allowing foreign professionals to bring in their own foreign maids, currently illegal in Beijing.
