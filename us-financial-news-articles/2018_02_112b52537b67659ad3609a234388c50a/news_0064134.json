Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images Guns sit on display at a Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. store in Paramus, New Jersey. \nShares of gun makers Sturm, Ruger & Co. and American Outdoor Brands — formerly Smith & Wesson — fell Wednesday after Dick's Sporting Goods announced that it will no longer sell assault-style rifles. \nAs one of the country's largest sports retailers, Dick's told customers Wednesday that the company was \"deeply disturbed\" by the Feb. 14 mass shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The gunman used an AR-15 assault rifle that he legally purchased, authorities have said. \n\"Thoughts and prayers are not enough,\" Dick's Chairman and CEO Edward Stack said in a statement. \"We will no longer sell assault-style rifles, also referred to as modern sporting rifles. We had already removed them from all Dick's stores after the Sandy Hook massacre, but we will now remove them from sale at all 35 Field & Stream stores.\" show chapters 6 Hours Ago | 01:17 \nGun maker shares added to their losses Wednesday afternoon after President Donald Trump renewed calls for stronger background checks in a meeting with Washington legislators and said he would \"seriously consider\" raising the minimum age required to purchase an assault-style weapon to 21 years of age. \nThe commander in chief also said he told National Rifle Association leaders, including Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, \"It's time. We've got to stop this nonsense,\" in a meeting over the weekend. \nShares of American Outdoor Brands fell 3.2 percent Wednesday, while Sturm, Ruger & Co. dropped 6.6 percent. Dick's, on the other hand, rose 0.6 percent. Shares of American Outdoor are down more than 11.5 percent since the massacre, while Sturm, Ruger shares are off by more than 11 percent. \nDick's Stack said the company would no longer sell firearms to anyone under 21 years of age and will not sell high-capacity magazines. \nHe also encouraged Washington lawmakers to make similar changes, recommending legislators pass a national ban on assault-style rifles and raise the minimum age for gun ownership. \n\"Some will say these steps can't guarantee tragedies like Parkland will never happen again,\" Stack said. \"They may be correct — but if common sense reform is enacted and even one life is saved, it will have been worth it.\" Watch: Who makes the AR-15 rifle? show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:58:21.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
