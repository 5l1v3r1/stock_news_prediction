And at the moment, there is no ”next“ step,” Qualcomm said.\nThe statement said two customers worth more than $1 billion annually in chip sales had told Qualcomm they were likely to move designs away from the company if the Broadcom deal went ahead.\nFILE PHOTO: A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd, who announced on Monday an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017.
