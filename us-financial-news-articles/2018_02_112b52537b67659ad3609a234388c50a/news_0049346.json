(Nasdaq:SBPH), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of viral infections, inflammatory diseases and certain cancers, today announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results and provided an update on recent developments.\n“In 2017, we significantly advanced the development of both our RIG-I and STING platforms, entered into strategic partnerships and strengthened our balance sheet,” commented Martin Driscoll, president and chief executive officer of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals. “With the positive initial top-line results announced from the ongoing Phase 2 ACHIEVE trial for our lead development candidate, inarigivir, we now have the most advanced clinical candidate for chronic hepatitis B and are excited to continue to lead the way in the development of a potential simple, safe and selective functional cure for this disease. We are also encouraged by the preclinical results for our next-generation STING agonist candidate, SB 11285, which lead us to believe that SB 11285 has the potential to be clinically administered intratumorally and intravenously for a variety of tumors at various anatomic sites. Our execution during 2017 has set the stage for what we believe could be a productive 2018 with numerous potential development catalysts.”\nMr. Driscoll continued, “We have multiple objectives that we are working towards in 2018. Our primary objective is to further advance our inarigivir global clinical development program, particularly our clinical trial collaboration with Gilead involving the co-administration of inarigivir with Gilead’s oral antiviral agents, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (marketed by Gilead as Viread®) and tenofovir alafenamide (marketed by Gilead as Vemlidy®). We will continue to execute our broad inarigivir clinical development program by (1) completing the Part A monotherapy dose-finding segment of the ACHIEVE trial, (2) conducting additional formulation development work for SB 9225, our potential fixed-dose co-formulation product combining inarigivir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and (3) pursuing additional combinatorial or “triplet” therapies combining inarigivir, an oral antiviral agent and/or a potential third product or product candidate with a differing mechanism of action. Depending on the results of the ACHIEVE study and additional co-administration clinical trials that we are conducting, it is our objective to enter into a global Phase 3 program with inarigivir in 2019. Finally, we plan to initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial with our novel, next-generation STING agonist, SB 11285, in hepatocellular carcinoma late in the second half of 2018.”\nPotential 2018 Milestones\nComplete Part A inarigivir monotherapy segment of the ACHIEVE trial by end of 2018 The company remains on track to release top-line results from the third monotherapy cohort (100mg) of the ACHIEVE trial in mid-2018 and top-line results from the fourth monotherapy cohort (200mg) in late 2018. Report data from the co-administration clinical trials of inarigivir with the oral antiviral agents Viread and/or Vemlidy The company entered into a clinical supply and collaboration agreement with Gilead under which Gilead is funding and conducting a Phase 2 trial examining the co-administration of inarigivir (50mg) and Vemlidy in patients infected with chronic HBV. Gilead has initiated this clinical trial in Korea. Spring Bank anticipates interim results from this trial in the second half of 2018. Spring Bank currently intends to initiate Part B of the ACHIEVE trial in mid-2018 to evaluate the co-administration of inarigivir (100mg) with Viread. Continue to advance the development of SB 9225 (inarigivir + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) Spring Bank has conducted development work that indicates inarigivir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are compatible in the same formulation. The company is conducting additional formulation development work for SB 9225 with the objective to potentially include this fixed-dose combination product candidate in Phase 3 clinical trial(s) in 2019. Advance the company’s proprietary, novel next-generation STING agonist candidate, SB 11285, into the clinic The company plans to submit a clinical trial application for SB 11285 in the second half of 2018, and, if approved, initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in hepatocellular carcinoma later in the second half of 2018. Explore additional strategic partnerships The company plans to pursue additional HBV clinical trial collaboration opportunities, including a combinatorial or “triplet” therapy combining inarigivir, an oral antiviral agent and/or a potential third product or product candidate with a differing mechanism of action, such as a capsid inhibitor or siRNA compound.\nDue to the substantial prevalence of chronic HBV and regulatory changes in China, the company plans to further examine strategic opportunities in that region. Expand the Spring Bank STING agonist platform\nThe company is exploring additional delivery methods for its STING agonist platform, including nanoparticle formulations as well as further development of antibody-drug conjugates to be used with the company’s STING agonist product candidates.\n2017 and Other Recent Accomplishments\nContinued progress in the execution of the global Phase 2 ACHIEVE clinical trial for inarigivir in hepatitis B. The first three cohorts of Part A of the ACHIEVE trial have been enrolled on a timely basis and Spring Bank remains on track to report top-line results for the third monotherapy cohort (100mg) in mid-2018. In March 2018, our chief medical officer, Nezam Afdhal, M.D., D.Sc., will be giving an oral presentation highlighting the combined results from the first two cohorts of Part A of the ACHIEVE trial, including the sequential Viread 12-week dosing period, at the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) 2018 Annual Meeting (March 14-18, 2018). In April 2018, Professor Stephen Locarnini, the Principal Investigator of the Virology Core for the ACHIEVE trial and the Head, Research & Molecular Development, Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, will present additional virology results from the combined first two cohorts of Part A of the ACHIEVE trial, including the sequential Viread 12-week dosing period in an oral presentation at The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2018 Annual Meeting (April 11-15, 2018). Also at EASL, Prof. Dr. Man-Fung Yuen, Principal Investigator of the ACHIEVE trial and Chair Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Li Shu Fan Medical Foundation Professor in Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, will deliver a poster presentation describing clinical results from the combined first two cohorts of Part A of the ACHIEVE trial.\nSpring Bank advanced the development of SB 9225, a fixed-dose co-formulation product candidate combining inarigivir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.\nAdvanced SB 11285 for immuno-oncology\nThe company presented data from multiple preclinical studies that demonstrated SB 11285 as a highly potent anti-tumor agent with a durable anti-tumor response when administered by multiple routes in several tumor models.\nSpring Bank initiated the IND-enabling toxicology program for SB 11285.\nSpring Bank consummated an Evaluation Assessment Agreement with a major Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) biopharmaceutical company to examine the potential to conjugate the Spring Bank STING agonist compounds with proprietary antibodies for oncology.\nFour Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications were published in January 2018 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office covering the Spring Bank STING agonist platform program.\nStrengthened the balance sheet and extended the runway for the Company late into 2019 with financing activities that raised a total of $47M in 2017\nStrengthened the board of directors with the addition of Christiana Bardon, M.D., one of the leading investors in the life sciences industry who has extensive expertise in the biopharma sector\nYear-End and Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nCash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $50.6 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $25.5 million as of December 31, 2016.
