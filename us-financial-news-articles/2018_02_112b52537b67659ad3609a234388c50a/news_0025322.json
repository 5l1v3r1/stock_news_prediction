Cherry-picking over things such as we’ll take this freedom or another, that’s not possible,” he said. \n“And I’d like to remind you that if only one country opposes (the final Brexit deal), there will be a rather hard Brexit,” he added. \nFrench officials have repeatedly said that Paris’ main objective in Brexit negotiations was to maintain the unity of the 27 remaining countries and that the only point of contact for British diplomats should be the Commission’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. \n“There can’t be things that get dealt with totally bilaterally, otherwise it won’t work,” Griveaux said. \nGriveaux, who did a brief stint at the finance ministry at the start of Macron’s mandate, said he had been struck by a sense of denial among British bankers during a visit to London last year to attract UK-based bankers to Paris. \n“What was striking when I went there last summer is that many top bankers and large institutions thought Brexit would not happen. That some legal way out would be found, that we could discuss article 50,” he said. \n“There was a very strong sense of denial among the people I saw, it really struck me,” he added.
