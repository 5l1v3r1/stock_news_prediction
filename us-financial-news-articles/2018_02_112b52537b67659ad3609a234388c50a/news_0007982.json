Chris Coons (D-DE) speaks during a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., April 3, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein Republican Senator Rand Paul noted that while some 15,000 U.S. troops are being deployed under Trump’s plan, the Obama administration failed to drive the insurgents into negotiations with a 100,000-strong force.\nDeputy Secretary of State John Sullivan and Randall Schriver, the assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, defended the strategy, noting that it is governed by progress on the ground rather than a fixed timetable set out by the Obama administration.\n“We have a policy that we believe in,” Sullivan said, arguing that a U.S. pullout could lead to a Taliban victory that could give al Qaeda a stronghold from which to attack the United States as it did on Sept. 11, 2001.\nNeither Sullivan nor Schriver could give estimates for the number of insurgents fighting U.S.-backed Afghan forces or how many may be willing to embrace peace talks with the Kabul government.\nThey also could not provide a precise cost for the strategy that Trump unveiled in August, although they estimated that the American involvement will cost more than $45 billion this year.\nSullivan said Pakistan is not heeding Trump’s demand to end the sanctuary it gives to the Taliban and other extremists despite a suspension in January of some $2 billion in U.S. security aid and threats of further measures.\n“We may consider lifting the suspension when we see decisive and sustained actions to address our concerns,” Sullivan said.\nPakistan long has rejected charges that it supports Afghan militants.\nAdditional reporting by Warren Strobel; Editing by Mary Milliken and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:12:08.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
