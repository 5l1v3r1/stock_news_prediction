This is an IOC decision, we can only offer them a technical solution from a sporting position but they have made their decision.”\nThe men’s downhill, the opening race of the 2018 Olympics, is the blue riband event in Alpine skiing and would remain a “priority” within the rescheduling if the weather forecast was born out, Waldner added.\nGiven the unpredictability of the weather in the mountains, races are regularly postponed during World Cup and Olympic competition.\nThe Alpine skiing at the 1998 Games in Nagano was heavily disrupted by heavy snow and rain and the men’s downhill was rescheduled three times.\nThe schedule for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics was similarly impacted by poor course conditions and bad weather at Whistler with the men’s downhill postponed by two days.There was also some rescheduling of the Alpine skiing at the last Winter Olympics in Sochi when rain, fog and rising temperatures disrupted the final part of the competition.\nGiven this experience, Olympic organisers deliberately schedule the Alpine skiing early in the Games to ensure to allow for adjustments.\nAn emergency committee meeting would be held to reschedule the races once the postponement was confirmed, Waldner said, but those calculations could be complicated by continuing high winds throughout the first three days of competition.\nAnybody resting their hopes on an inaccurate weather forecast might also be disappointed, he said.\n“Unfortunately, the weather forecast here is very accurate,” Waldner added.\n“We in Europe, we had a different experience in past years, it was always the opposite. If it said it was bad, it was nice. But here it is very accurate.”\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:32:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
