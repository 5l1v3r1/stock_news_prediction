Without a customs union and outside the single market, barriers to trade are inevitable, Michael Barnier said. \n“UK data showing weaker service sector output yesterday and only modest growth in retail spending have not helped sterling sentiment but the real driver of weakness has been broader market volatility,” Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank, told clients. \n“Soft-ish data and ongoing focus on domestic political risks as PM May tries to steer her Brexit policies through parliament may drag on sterling’s performance near-term,” he added. \nBut sterling traders will also be wary of big bets before the Bank of England’s policy meeting on Thursday. \nWhile the Bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, many analysts are now predicting a rate rise in May, especially after BoE Governor Mark Carney recently sounded a more upbeat tone on the economy. \nThe BOE also releases its inflation report on Thursday. \nCarney has said wage growth is finally picking up and that the focus of the BoE is shifting back to tackling above-target inflation. Analysts reckon any further positive forecasts on the economy might prompt investors to add positions in the undervalued currency. \nING analysts predicted more sterling upside in the medium-term, having revised their end-2018 forecast to $1.45. \nThey cautioned however that “even if this week’s BoE meeting provides a hawkish tilt and global risk sentiment stabilises, we think any material upside will not be realised until markets have clarity on a Brexit transition deal.” \nThat was unlikely until closer to the 22-23 March EU leaders summit, they added.
