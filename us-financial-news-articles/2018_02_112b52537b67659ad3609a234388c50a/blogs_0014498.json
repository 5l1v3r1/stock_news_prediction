JPMorgan enacted the ban Saturday. Bank of America started declining credit-card transactions on Friday. The banks are worried that borrowers may not repay, and that protections they offer shoppers could backfire. About 52 percent of CoinDesk survey respondents said they repaid their debt. \nAnalysts cite the credit tightening as being partly responsible for the downward pressure on prices of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has lost about 40 percent of its value since the beginning of the year.
