(NYSE:PLOW), North America's premier manufacturer and upfitter of work truck attachments and equipment, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nJames L. Janik, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “We were pleased to close out the year on a positive note, producing overall results that were in line with our expectations. We continue to see sequential improvements in chassis availability for both our municipal products and in our Work Truck Solutions segment. We believe the negative impact on our operations from the chassis availability delays during the past year is slowly diminishing and our teams are working diligently to upfit and deliver trucks to our customers.”\nJanik added, “We are proud of the tremendous efforts undertaken across our company to address the external challenges we faced in 2017, and believe we entered 2018 in a stronger position because of that hard work. Our 2017 performance reflects the cumulative negative impact of two consecutive significantly below average snowfall seasons, plus the chassis availability issues that impacted our operations throughout the year. Fortuitously, the fourth quarter of 2017 produced average snowfall across our core markets and the chassis issues began to moderate. We entered 2018 focused on executing our growth and diversification plans including ramping up our newest Work Truck Solutions facility in Kansas City.”\nConsolidated Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNet sales in the fourth quarter were $138.0 million, an increase of 6.0% when compared to the prior year fourth quarter net sales of $130.1 million. The increase relates to stronger demand in Work Truck Attachments and incremental sales related to ramping up new facilities in Work Truck Solutions.\nNet income of $34.5 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, reflects an increase of $24.4 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, when compared to the year ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to a one-time benefit associated with U.S. Tax Reform totaling $22.5 million, or $0.97 per diluted share. Adjusted net income of $12.1 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compares with adjusted net income of $10.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $30.3 million increased $2.9 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $27.4 million recorded in the same period of the prior year on higher volumes and improved margins in both segments.\nWork Truck Attachments Segment Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nWork Truck Attachments recorded revenue of $103.5 million, resulting in income from operations of $25.9 million, compared to $97.8 million in revenue and income from operations of $23.3 million in the year ago period. Both revenue and operating income increased due to ongoing strength of select light pickup truck sales and average snowfall across core markets during the quarter, which positively impacted sales of commercial snow and ice control products and offset the negative impact of chassis availability for municipal products.\nWork Truck Solutions Segment Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nWork Truck Solutions produced revenue of $41.0 million, an increase of 8.1% compared to revenue of $37.9 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Income from operations of $4.7 million compares to $3.5 million during the same quarter in 2016. While revenue was impacted by a short-term decrease in chassis availability, the decline was more than offset by sales from new upfit facilities that began ramping up earlier in 2017. Operating income increased based on higher volumes, which also contributed to improved operating margins.\nConsolidated Full Year 2017 Results\nNet sales were a record $474.9 million, compared to $416.3 million last year. The increase was due to the acquisitions of Dejana Truck & Utility Equipment in July 2016 and Arrowhead Equipment in May 2017, both of which are reflected in the Work Truck Solutions segment. This increase was partially offset by lower revenue in the Work Truck Attachments segment, which related to the cumulative negative impact of two consecutive significantly below average snowfall seasons, plus the chassis availability issues that impacted our municipal and Work Truck Solutions operations.\nNet income was $55.3 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, compared to prior year net income of $39.0 million, or $1.70 per diluted share. The increase is primarily due to a provisional one-time benefit associated with U.S. Tax Reform totaling $22.5 million, or $0.97 per diluted share partially offset by a non-recurring gain of approximately $10 million, or $0.27 per diluted share net of tax, related to the successful conclusion of a patent infringement lawsuit in 2016. Adjusted net income was $33.5 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $36.4 million, or $1.58 per diluted share, for the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $90.9 million declined $0.5 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $91.4 million for the prior year due to lower volumes in Work Truck Attachments and higher labor and overhead costs in light of the chassis availability challenges experienced in 2017. These declines were substantially offset with additional volume in the Work Truck Solutions segment, implemented cost reductions and lower incentive compensation.\nThe effective tax rate for the year was a benefit of 4.6% of pre-tax income due to changes resulting from U.S. tax reform. Excluding the one-time benefit related to U.S. tax reform, the effective tax rate would have been 37.9% for the year, which compares to an effective tax rate of 38.8% for the prior year.\nWork Truck Attachments Segment Full Year 2017 Results\nWork Truck Attachments recorded revenue of $350.6 million, and income from operations of $78.1 million, or 22.3% of net sales, compared to the prior year revenue of $360.6 million, and income from operations of $85.9 million, or 23.8% of net sales. Revenue was negatively impacted by chassis availability issues affecting sales of municipal products throughout the year, and significantly below average snowfall in the previous two winter seasons, which impacted demand for commercial snow and ice control products. Operating income declined primarily due to lower volumes.\nWork Truck Solutions Segment Full Year 2017 Results\nAs a reminder, the acquisition of Dejana Truck and Utility Equipment was completed on July 15, 2016, creating the Work Truck Solutions segment. As such, all references to these segment results for 2016 refer to the period from July 16, 2016 to December 31, 2016.\nWork Truck Solutions recorded revenue of $137.8 million, and income from operations of $9.8 million, or 7.0% of net sales, compared to revenue of $65.0 million and income from operations of $3.1 million, or 4.8% of net sales, during the reported period in 2016. The increase in revenue and operating income relates to capturing a full year of sales for the segment as compared to a partial year in 2016, as noted above. In addition, the segment produced incremental sales from the new facilities that began ramping up in mid-2017.\nBalance Sheet\nFull year net cash provided by operating activities of $67.2 million compares to $69.9 million in the prior year. Excluding a cash settlement of approximately $6.2 million, net of tax, received in 2016 upon the successful conclusion of a patent infringement lawsuit, net cash from operating activities improved $3.5 million.\nInventory at December 31, 2017 was $71.5 million, compared to $70.9 million at the end of 2016. The increase in inventory is due to the addition of four new locations in Work Truck Solutions during 2017, substantially offset by lower inventories in Work Truck Attachments.\nAccounts receivable totaled $79.1 million at the end of 2017, similar to accounts receivable of $78.6 million at the end of 2016.\nCash generated during the year increased cash on hand at year end from $18.6 million at the end of 2016 to $36.9 million at the end of 2017.\nDividend\nAs previously reported, on December 7, 2017, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of the Company's common stock. The dividend was paid on December 29, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 19, 2017.\nIn addition, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.265 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which equates to a projected full year annual increase in the dividend of approximately 10%, or $0.10 per diluted share. The declared dividend will be paid on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 22, 2018.\nMr. Janik noted, “Our primary capital allocation goal of returning cash to shareholders via a robust and sustainable dividend remains unchanged. Based on our financial performance and the recent changes in the corporate tax rate, the Board has decided to increase the dividend by a larger amount this year when compared to previous years.”\nOutlook\nBased on recent results, the overall economic climate, dealer sentiment, information on chassis availability from OEM partners, snowfall data, and industry trends, the Company is outlining its 2018 financial outlook as follows, which includes the expected impact of U.S. tax reform:\nNet sales are expected to be in the range of $475 million and $535 million. Adjusted EBITDA is predicted to be in the range of $85 million to $115 million. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.60 per share to $2.20 per share.\nMr. Janik explained, “We expect 2018 to be a year of execution as we continue to implement DDMS across the Company, while satisfying the growing demand for our market leading products and services. While the temporary headwinds related to chassis supply persist, their impact has moderated recently, and we expect availability to slowly return to normal as we progress through the year.”\nWebcast Information\nThe Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time).

The non-GAAP measures used in this press release are Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share.\nThese non-GAAP disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for stock based compensation, litigation proceeds, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments and certain charges related to certain unrelated legal fees and consulting fees. The Company uses, and believes its investors benefit from the presentation of, Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because Adjusted EBITDA provides the Company and its investors with additional tools to compare its operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company’s core operations. In addition, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of its consolidated financial statements in evaluating the Company’s operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. The Company’s management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget and financial projections, and to evaluate the Company’s ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with its senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (calculated on a diluted basis) represents net income and earnings per share (as defined by GAAP), excluding the impact of stock based compensation, litigation proceeds, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, tax reform and certain charges related to certain unrelated legal fees and consulting fees, net of their income tax impact. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are useful in assessing the Company’s financial performance by eliminating expenses and income that are not reflective of the underlying business performance. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income for the periods presented allows investors to make meaningful comparisons of our operating performance between periods and to view our business from the same perspective as our management. Because the excluded items are not predictable or consistent, management does not consider them when evaluating our performance or when making decisions regarding allocation of resources.\nConsistent with Regulation G under the U.S. federal securities laws, the non-GAAP measures in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure, and these reconciliations are located under the heading \"Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\" and “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income” following the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this press release.\nWith respect to the Company’s 2018 guidance, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP because it does not provide specific guidance for the various extraordinary, nonrecurring or unusual charges and other certain items. These items have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. As a result, reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance measures to GAAP is not available without unreasonable effort and the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
