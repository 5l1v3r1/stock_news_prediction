It’s insane I really thought it’s so hard to ski so fast in slalom,” Gisin told reporters.\n”I tried to give it my all and to put my whole heart in that run and I knew I had to be fast to keep a little distance because with Lindsey, you never know how fast she skis in slalom because she was amazing a couple years ago.\n“I was scared while skiing because this season slalom kicked my butt so many times... I was believing that one day I will put all the pieces together, one day it will all come to me and today it was exactly that,” the Swiss added.\nThe two medals take Switzerland’s tally to six in Alpine skiing at these Games, their most in a single Winter Games since 1988, when they won 11.\n Women's Alpine Combined - Jeongseon Gold medallist Michelle Gisin of Switzerland holds a flag as she celebrates.

I didn’t even know how many I would ski,” she said.\nSlideshow (9 Images) “After the gold in the giant slalom, I was really hopeful and positive. Then I had a tougher day in the slalom (she finished fourth) but it still feels good though.”\nHoldener produced the fastest slalom run of the day with a 40.23 and held on to bronze, with Norwegian Ragnhild Mowinckel struggling in the technical element and then Vonn skiing out early in her effort.\nFor Holdener it was a second medal of these Games following a silver in slalom.\n“The slope wasn’t that good anymore, it wasn’t that smooth so in the end I thought it was going to be fourth place. I‘m really happy it was enough for the third place,” she said.\nThe joy was particularly sweet given that she was able to share success with her compatriot Gisin.\n“It’s a really cool moment because we are friends and grew up together. It’s amazing,” she added.\nReporting by Simon Evans and Rory Carroll; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T05:54:30.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
