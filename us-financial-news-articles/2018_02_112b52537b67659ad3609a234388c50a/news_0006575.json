(NYSE: ZTR) announced the following monthly distribution:\nAmount of Distribution\nEx-Date\nRecord Date\nPayable Date\n$0.113\nFebruary 9, 2018\nFebruary 12, 2018\nFebruary 20, 2018\nUnder the terms of its managed distribution plan, the fund will seek to maintain a consistent distribution level that may be paid in part or in full from net investment income and realized capital gains, or a combination thereof. Shareholders should note, however, that if the fund's aggregate net investment income and net realized capital gains are less than the amount of the distribution level, the difference will be distributed from the fund's assets and will constitute a return of the shareholder's capital. You should not draw any conclusions about the fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the fund's managed distribution plan.\nThe fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"\nThe fund provided this estimate of the sources of the distribution:\nDistribution Estimates\nJanuary 2018 (MTD)\nYear-to-date (YTD) (1)\n(Sources)\nPer Share\nAmount\nPercentage\nof Current\nDistribution\nPer Share\nAmount\nPercentage\nof Current\nDistribution\nNet Investment Income\n$0.011\n10.0%\n$0.011\n10.0%\nNet Realized Foreign Currency Gains\n-\n0.0%\n-\n0.0%\nNet Realized Short-Term Capital Gains\n-\n0.0%\n-\n0.0%\nNet Realized Long-Term Capital Gains\n-\n0.0%\n-\n0.0%\nReturn of Capital (or other Capital Source)\n0.102\n90.0%\n0.102\n90.0%\nTotal Distribution\n$0.113\n100.0%\n$0.113\n100.0%\n(1)\nYTD January 10, 2018 to January 9, 2019.

Please note that all performance figures are based on the fund's NAV and not the market price of the fund's shares. Performance figures are not meant to represent individual shareholder performance.\nJanuary 31, 2018\nAverage Annual Total Return on NAV for the 5-year period (2)\n7.31%\nCurrent Fiscal YTD Annualized Distribution Rate (3)\n10.79%\nYTD Cumulative Total Return on NAV (4)\n-2.83%\nYTD Cumulative Distribution Rate (5)\n0.90%\n(2)\nAverage Annual Total Return on NAV is the annual compound return for the five-year period. It reflects the change in the fund's NAV and reinvestment of all distributions.\n(3)\nCurrent Fiscal YTD Annualized Distribution Rate is the current distribution rate annualized as a percentage of the fund's NAV at month end.\n(4)\nYTD Cumulative Total Return on NAV is the percentage change in the fund's NAV from the first day of the year to this month end, including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions.\n(5)\nYTD Cumulative Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions from the first day of the year to this month end as a percentage of the fund's NAV at month end.\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are estimates only and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the distributions will depend on the fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The fund or your broker will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell shareholders what distributions to report for federal income tax purposes.\nAbout the Fund\nThe Virtus Global Dividend & Income Fund Inc. is a diversified closed-end fund that seeks to generate total return, consisting of capital appreciation and income.
