Though Spain exited recession over three years ago, the highways have also had to compete in many instances with toll-free roads running alongside them.\nThe government recently said it expected to fetch between 700 million euros ($872.34 million) and 1 billion euros after awarding new concessions to reduce the impact of around 3 billion euros on the state coffers.\nSpokesman Mendez de Vigo did not say on Friday how much the takeover would imply for the deficit.
