It said the operators of drones - excluding very small ones weighing less than 250 grammes - should register themselves rather than filling out separate paperwork for each new craft.\nCurrently, the regulation of drones in Europe varies country to country, but that can now change thanks to a reform of EASA approved at the end of last year.\nDrone makers and pilots have pressed for European rules to be endorsed, saying it is essential a new regulatory framework for drones be put in place as soon as possible.\nMakers of commercial drones include China’s DJI and France’s Parrot.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:45:52.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
