Sales and marketing expenses rose 13.3 percent to $689 million.\nIn a blog post, eBay said on Wednesday it has signed an agreement with Adyen to become its primary payments processing partner. ( bit.ly/2rVenNh )\nPayPal Holdings Inc would still remain a payment option as eBay expects the “transition to full payments intermediation will be a multi-year journey.”\nEBay said it would move as quickly as possible to complete the transition within the parameters of its deal with PayPal, which remains in place through mid-2020. PayPal was spun off from eBay in 2015.\nThe e-commerce company said in a post-earnings call that the operating agreement with PayPal “has not been extended and it will not be extended.”\n“With the announcement that eBay will begin to take over payments on the marketplace from PayPal, this opens up new revenue and profit opportunities over the long term,” said Sebastian.\nFor the quarter ending March, eBay forecast revenue between $2.57 billion and $2.61 billion and adjusted earnings of 52 cents to 54 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 52 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nFourth-quarter revenue rose 9.1 percent to $2.61 billion. EBay recorded a $2.6 billion loss for the quarter because of a one-time $3.1 billion charge from the recent changes in U.S. tax laws.\nExcluding one-time items, eBay earned 59 cents per share.\nEBay said it would take a $1.9 billion tax charge related to the repatriation of its foreign earnings, though the charge would largely be offset thanks to accounting from years earlier.\nD.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said in a recent note that repatriation could serve as a catalyst for additional mergers and acquisitions in the United States for eBay.\nEBay on Wednesday also announced a $6 billion share buyback program.\nReporting by Muvija M in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:51:03.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
