Schiff said the White House limited his testimony to a pre-approved set of 14 questions.\nBannon is now expected to appear before the House of Representatives committee next week.\nSchiff said the committee was informed on Tuesday that Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager, would refuse to reappear before the committee to testify any further, despite agreeing earlier to do so.\nWhite House officials and attorneys for Bannon or Lewandowski did not respond to requests for comment.\nSchiff said that neither Bannon nor Lewandowski had given “legitimate” reasons for refusing to appear, and that they were expected to return.\n“It will therefore be necessary for our Committee to enforce the subpoena on Bannon, and now move to compel Lewandowski’s testimony, among other outstanding steps needed to advance the investigation,” Schiff said.\nHouse Intelligence is one of three congressional committees investigating Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, after U.S. intelligence agencies found that Russia attempted to influence the campaign on Trump’s behalf.\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating.\nMoscow has denied meddling in the U.S. presidential election, and Trump denied any collusion between his associates and Moscow.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T00:09:30.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
