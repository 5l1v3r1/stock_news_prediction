Tapestry also raised its full-year forecast.\nCentene – The health insurer beat estimates by 4 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 97 cents per share. Revenue also topped expectations and Centene raised its full-year forecast, as its Affordable Care Act-related business grows and as it benefits from tax reform.\nWellCare Health – WellCare reported adjusted quarterly earnings of 32 cents per share, 11 cents a share above estimates. Revenue beat forecasts, as well, benefiting from growth in its Medicare and Medicaid business. WellCare raised its full-year forecast due to benefits from the new tax law.\nBecton Dickinson – The medical device maker came in 7 cents a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.48 per share.
