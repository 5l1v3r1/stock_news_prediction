Futures markets imply this period of stability will likely last for another year. \nThe RBA cautioned that a rising Australian dollar could also result in a slower pick up in economic activity and inflation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T03:57:19.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
