Jones’ jump shot with 3:18 left giving the Razorbacks their largest lead of the game at 67-46.\nGafford’s emphatic dunk at the 2:07 mark put the exclamation point on the win and gave the freshman his second slam of the game.\nArkansas held a 28-21 lead at the break after Vanderbilt shot just 15.4 percent in the first half and made only four field goals while going 1-of-14 from beyond the arc.\nThe Razorbacks turned the ball over on their first five offensive possessions of the game, which allowed the Commodores to take an early lead.\nVanderbilt led 13-7 after a pair of made free throws by Maxwell Evans, but the Razorbacks countered with a 15-0 run, and the Commodores were never able to regain the lead.\nArkansas led by as many as 11 in the first half after Jones knocked down a jump shot with 3:06 left in the period.\nArkansas earned its 34th consecutive victory when leading at halftime.?\nWith the loss, Vanderbilt fell to 0-9 in true road games this season.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T12:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:09:56.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
