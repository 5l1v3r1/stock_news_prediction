But, “this isn’t the ordinary case,” he said.\nHe suggested the department consider whether it can submit a one-sentence page disclosing when it received the dossier.\nThe Justice Department was in court on Thursday trying to beat back a subpoena from the news organization BuzzFeed.\nIn early 2017, Buzzfeed published a copy of the dossier, penned by Christopher Steele and funded in part by U.S. Democrats.\nThe dossier makes some serious and salacious allegations against Trump, and suggests that the Russians and Trump’s campaign colluded ahead of the 2016 election. Trump has denied colluding with Russia. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign, though Russia has denied it.\nBuzzfeed is seeking material from the Justice Department to help defend itself against a defamation lawsuit it is facing by a Russian businessman who claims he was libeled in the dossier.\nMuch of the information it sought previously it no longer needs because it was disclosed elsewhere, a lawyer for the company conceded on Thursday. But the company still contends it needs to know the time frame for when the FBI obtained the dossier.\nThe dossier has prompted a backlash by Congressional Republicans, who allege the FBI used it to improperly obtain a warrant from a U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court without verifying the facts or disclosing it was funded by Democrats.\nReporting by Sarah N.
