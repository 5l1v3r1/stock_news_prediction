Analysts, on average, had expected a gain of 0.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.\nNet profit was $43.8 million, or $1.55 per share, up from $16 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding the 21 cent per share gain related to the new U.S. tax law, Chipotle beat Street's profit view by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue jumped 7.3 percent to $1.1 billion, to match Wall Street's view. Traffic declines partially offset same-store sales gains related to last year's menu price increases.\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T01:52:06.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
