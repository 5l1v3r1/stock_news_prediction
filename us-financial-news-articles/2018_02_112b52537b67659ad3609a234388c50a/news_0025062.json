The additional portion would be used to help local businesses and repair and build new homes, they said.\nIn addition to a slow recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst natural disaster in 90 years, Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with a combined $120 billion in bond and pension debt.\nThe aid announced on Friday provides just a fraction of the $94.4 billion Rossello has said the island needs to recover from cataclysmic damage to its infrastructure and housing stock, although Puerto Rico is eligible to participate in other programs that could increase the aid to $45 billion, according to Friday’s statement.\nCongress could also appropriate more money later.\nThe governor has asked Congress for $46 billion in CDBG funding alone. Home damage in Puerto Rico, where the poverty rate is around 46 percent, was exacerbated by the existence of hundreds of thousands of sub-standard “informal” homes, which are typically built by the owners themselves, without permits and often in squatter communities.\n”The work carried out in Washington - together with resident commissioner Jenniffer González - was able to deliver the message of the urgency of an allocation of funds that meets the needs of the Island,” the governor said in Friday’s statement.\nThe disaster aid package signed by Trump on Friday - around $90 billion in total - covers a number of major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires.\nReporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T02:58:57.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
