But we have not seen any reaction similar to the one in the Philippines in other countries,” Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt told journalists.\n“We are worried with this insistence of trying to link some deaths of children with the vaccine, something we have absolutely no evidence of,” he said.\nDengvaxia has been approved in almost 20 countries. It is currently under review by European health regulators.\nFourth-quarter business net income fell 10.8 percent at constant exchange rates to 1.33 billion euros. Total sales rose 4.1 percent to 8.7 billion euros.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters in partnership with Inquiry Financial had on average been expecting business net profit of 1.46 billion euros and net sales of 8.7 billion.\n($1 = 0.8069 euros)\nEditing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T09:13:30.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
