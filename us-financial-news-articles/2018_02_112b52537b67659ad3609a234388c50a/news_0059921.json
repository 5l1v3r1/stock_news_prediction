The reform deal seeks to strike a balance between encouraging industries to emit less carbon while avoiding driving them abroad to escape regulation.\n“The revised ETS directive is a significant step toward the EU reaching its target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030,” the European Council said in a statement.\nTo strengthen prices, it will double the rate at which the scheme’s Market Stability Reserve (MSR) soaks up excess allowances, as a short-term measure to beef up prices.\nIn 2023, a new mechanism to limit the validity of allowances in the MSR will be put in place.\nThe overall cap on the total volume of emissions, known as the linear reduction factor (LRF), will be reduced 2.2 percent each year.\nOther measures aim to help defend the competitiveness of the bloc’s industry.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels; Additional reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel and Susanna Twidale in London; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T02:16:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
