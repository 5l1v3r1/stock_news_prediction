The film will be co-financed and distributed by Universal Pictures, but Nintendo’s announcement did not specify a release date. \nThe new film — rumored for several months — will be co-produced by Chris Meledandri, the founder and CEO of Illumination, and Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Super Mario. \nThe animated effort will follow a live action Super Mario movie, fittingly titled Super Mario Bros., that dropped in 1993. The project grossed only $20.1 million off a $42 million budget, according to IMDB .
