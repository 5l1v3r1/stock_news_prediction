Unfortunately, numerous strategic missteps have eroded the brand, resulting in deteriorating operating metrics and a prolonged period of shareholder value destruction. Despite this, the Board has failed to take meaningful action to articulate or implement any type of thoughtful corrective strategy while the Company continues to underperform its peers. Put simply, Potbelly shareholders deserve better.\"\nPrivet has initiated multiple conversations with members of management and the Board in an attempt to engage constructively toward adding highly qualified new directors who are capable of developing a strategy that can revitalize the brand while driving higher returns on invested capital. However, our efforts to work collaboratively through the pursuit of an open and constructive dialogue have not convinced us that the current Board recognizes the need for meaningful, shareholder-driven change.\n\"While we understand that the Company is undergoing a strategic review and shareholders are awaiting the results of that process, we continue to believe that the Potbelly Board lacks accountability for the decline in both financial results and shareholder value that has occurred under its watch. Should the Company's process not culminate in a desirable outcome, we believe substantial changes need to be made to the Board without further delay. Accordingly, we are nominating four highly qualified director candidates who possess a broad spectrum of relevant skills and experience to effectively represent shareholder interests and drive sustainable value creation at Potbelly.\"\nBiographies of Privet's Highly Qualified Director Candidates:\nWilliam (\"Bill\") Mitchell joined Dunkin' Brands in October 2010 and currently serves as President, Dunkin' Brands International.
