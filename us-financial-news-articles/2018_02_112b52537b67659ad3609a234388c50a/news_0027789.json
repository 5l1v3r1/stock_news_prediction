In terms of their mentality also... for this, I‘m very good,” Conte was quoted as saying by British media. \n”But I think I‘m a bit of a disaster to convince the club to buy players. I think in this aspect I can improve a lot. \n“I have to learn a lot from the other coaches, the other managers, in that aspect. I have to speak more with the managers who are very, very good at persuading their clubs to spend money to buy top players.” \nStriker Alexis Sanchez and defender Virgil van Dijk were among the players linked to Chelsea in January, but they went to Manchester United and Liverpool respectively. \nChelsea have since suffered league defeats to Bournemouth and Watford since the transfer window closed, leading to media speculation about Conte’s future. \nThe 48-year-old, however, is confident the reports would not hinder his players’ performances, with Chelsea hosting bottom side West Bromwich Albion later on Monday. \n“Honestly I don’t think talk about my future can affect the players,” he added. \n“I think my players are getting used to these rumours, to this speculation, but for sure I am very happy with the commitment of my players, the behaviour of my players because they show me every day they want to overcome this situation.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T09:23:17.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
