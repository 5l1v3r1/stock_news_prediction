That is above last year’s 1.8 percent growth, but lags the 5 to 6 percent increases in organic revenues Interpublic saw in 2016 and 2015.\nFor the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, Interpublic grew organic revenue by 3.3 percent, easily ahead of Wall Street expectations of 0.9 percent, according to FactSet.\n“Post these results, we see opportunities for the industry to return to organic growth, albeit at levels that are lower than those observed in the 2010-mid-2016 era,” said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.\nInterpublic’s total revenue rose 3.4 percent year-over-year to $2.34 billion, beating analysts’ average expectation of $2.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overseas revenue rose 4.9 percent, while U.S. revenue climbed 2.2 percent.\nNet income available to IPG stockholders fell to $316.6 million from $317.6 million. Results included a one-time benefit of $36 million thanks to new U.S. tax laws.\nExcluding one-time items, Interpublic earned 79 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimates of 77 cents.\nReporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T17:37:19.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
