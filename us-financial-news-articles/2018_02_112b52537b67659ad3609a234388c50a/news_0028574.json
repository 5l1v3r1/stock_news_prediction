The England international, who joined West Brom on loan from Liverpool in January, picked up the knock during his third appearance for the bottom-placed side. “We need him up and running as it’s goals we’ve struggled with,” Pardew said after the match. “He felt his hamstring after a 60 metre sprint in the first moments of the game. We’ll have to nurse him. He won’t play next week but hopefully the week after.” The 28-year-old’s injury is a blow for West Brom, who have struggled to find the net throughout the campaign. West Brom play Southampton in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Saturday followed by a league fixture against Huddersfield Town on Feb. 24.
