About 2,000 owners opted out and most are pursuing court claims seeking additional compensation. The first trials could potentially set a template for the remaining suits.\nThe monkey tests were also sponsored by Daimler AG and BMW and both said this week they had suspended or moved staff linked to the testing. VW said the monkey tests were approved by an independent review board to protect animals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T13:46:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
