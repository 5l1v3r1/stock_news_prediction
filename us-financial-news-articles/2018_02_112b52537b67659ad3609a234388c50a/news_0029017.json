Those ships are due to be delivered this year and next year and each have capacity of about 2,900 passengers. \n* Those two ships are due to replace smaller ships in TUI Cruisesâ€™ existing fleet, though FAZ said the company could hold off retiring one of them, Mein Schiff 2, longer than planned to keep up with rising demand for cruise travel. \n* London-listed TUI Group is due to report first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.
