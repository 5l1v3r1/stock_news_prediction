The article was written by Nick Timothy, a former chief of staff to Prime Minister Theresa May.\nMay’s office repeated its long-standing position that the decision to leave the EU in 2019 after a vote in 2016 was final and would not be reversed. It had also defended the right of campaign groups to accept donations.\nReporting by Abinaya Vijayaraghavan in Bengaluru; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T00:35:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
