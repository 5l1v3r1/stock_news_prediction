REUTERS/Andrew Winning “This is a major step in bringing about the culture change that parliament needs.”\nLast year, parliament became one of several institutions to become embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal after abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted women and men to share stories about improper behavior.\nTwo ministers lost their posts while others in both the governing Conservatives and opposition Labour Party were investigated over allegations of inappropriate behavior, prompting calls for an end to a “locker room” culture.\nThe report said 39 percent of the 1,377 responses described experience of non-sexual harassment or bullying in the last year, while 19 percent reported “experience of sexual harassment, including witnessing sexually inappropriate behavior”. Women reported twice as much as men.\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:38:58.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
