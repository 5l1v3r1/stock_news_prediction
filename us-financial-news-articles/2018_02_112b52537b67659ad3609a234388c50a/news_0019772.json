Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, speaking at a congressional hearing in 2017. \nText messages from 2016 show preparation to brief Barack Obama about Russia’s interference in that year’s election, according to associates of the FBI employees involved in the exchange, not, as a Republican senator suggested, meddling by the then-president in the federal Hillary Clinton email investigation. \nA 25-page report released Wednesday by Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, highlights previously cited text messages between Peter Strzok, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, and Lisa Page, a bureau lawyer with whom he was having an extramarital affair. Strzok supervised the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and was to become the lead agent on the special counsel Robert Mueller’s team investigating any ties between Trump associates and Russia. \nStrzok was removed in July, however, after the Justice Department’s inspector general uncovered numerous text messages between Strzok and Page, in 2015 and 2016, that were highly critical of Trump. Since Strzok’s removal was disclosed in December, staffers for Johnson and other senators have been poring over the pair’s correspondence, and the Justice Department has turned over to Congress two batches of the pair’s texts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T23:47:01.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
