McMaster, learned that Kushner had contacts with foreign officials that he did not officially report or coordinate through official channels, the report said. The foreign officials’ beliefs of Kushner’s vulnerabilities were items raised in McMaster’s daily intelligence briefings, the report said.\nReporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:42:28.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
