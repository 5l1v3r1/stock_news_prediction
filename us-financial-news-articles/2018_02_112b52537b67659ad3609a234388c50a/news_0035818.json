I would like them to have a personal best for the competition,” Bruno Marcotte, a Canadian coach who consults with the pair, told Reuters after a practice at the Gangneung Ice Arena.\n“The focus in on the fact that every time they perform, their score keeps getting better. If they can score in the high 60s in their short program or close to 70, that would be great. And the goal for the long program is above 125.”\nThe pair recorded their current personal best in the short program, 65.25 points, at a competition where they won bronze last month in Taiwan. They also recorded their best total score, 184.98, at that competition.\nThey achieved their personal best in the long program, 119.90 points, last year.\nIn late September, the skaters were the first North Koreans to qualify for the Games after they finished in the top six at a competition in Germany.\nFeb 6, 2018; Gangneung, KOR; Democratic People's Republic of Korea pairs figure skaters, Ju Sik Kim and Tae Ok Ryom, practice in advance of the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Gangneung Ice Arena.

Security Council resolutions.\nNorth and South Korea remain technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty.\nTensions escalated dramatically last year as the regime of Kim Jong Un stepped up its program aimed at developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T08:11:53.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
