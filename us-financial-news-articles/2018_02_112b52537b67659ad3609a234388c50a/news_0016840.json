Besides Tokyo in 1964, it has hosted the Winter Games twice - Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.\nTokyo planners have struggled with surging costs and construction delays, especially with the new national stadium, but the International Olympic Committee has repeatedly said it is pleased with how preparations are going.\nReporting by Elaine Lies and Jack Tarrant, writing by Elaine Lies; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T07:37:52.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
