If we truly embrace this moment, a line in the sand will turn to stone,” it added.\nThe fund, which will support organizations that help victims of harassment and abuse, received donations from numerous actors, including Keira Knightley and Tom Hiddleston - who gave 10,000 pounds each.\n“One concrete way this movement is trying to make a difference is by fundraising for frontline agencies that support women and others that have suffered harassment and abuse,” Knightley said in a statement.\n“Many of these organizations are woefully underfunded and we want to help fund their vital work,” added Kate Kinninmont, who heads the Women in Film & Television UK group.\nAward-winning director Susanna White called for the establishment of an independent body to deal with reports of harassment and bullying in the entertainment sector.\nThe initiative comes after a slew of allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein last year sparked the #MeToo campaign, with women and men using social media to share their experiences of harassment.\nAt Sunday’s BAFTA awards in London many of the female attendees wore black outfits in a gesture of protest, mirroring last month’s Golden Globes awards ceremony in Los Angeles.\nBoth male and female attendees sported badges name-checking the “Time’s Up” campaign against sexual harassment.\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Robert Carmichael and Katy Migiro.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
