Paris is also supporting a new multinational force created by regional governments to take on Islamist groups, some of whom are linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, operating in the area. \n\n(From L) Chad's President Idriss Deby Itno, French President Emmanuel Macron and Senegalese president Macky Sall attend the \"GPE Financing Conference, an Investment in the Future\" organised by the Global Partnership for Education in Dakar, Senegal, February 2, 2018.

Retreat. Hatred of others. A revival of nationalism and everything we have survived and thought we’d vanquished during the 20th century,” he said. \nThe Partnership is seeking $3.1 billion in financing to fund its activities over the coming three years. \nReporting by and Sofia Christensen; Additional reporting and writing by Joe Bavier; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-03T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:27:30.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
