Why we can win that and not the downhill, I don’t know.\n“I don’t worry about it, and I don’t think the other guys do either. It’s not a core driver.”\nJansrud has played the knave to Svindal’s king for much of his career but has had better recent form and enjoyed a stunning Sochi Olympics with the super-G gold and a downhill bronze.\nAlpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Downhill Training – Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 10, 2018 - Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway trains. REUTERS/Mike Segar The consensus was that the Jeongseon piste would suit his style and Jansrud has backed that up this week with the second-best time in all three training runs.\nKilde, whose only World Cup downhill success came in Garmisch in 2016, said the Norwegians had helped each other to improve.\n“We travel around together for most of the year, we’re good friends,” he added.\n“We try to learn from each other and have a good time together. It’s important to have a good time if you want to go fast.”\nAs good as the Alpine trio are, they know they are destined to play second fiddle to the country’s cross-country aces even if one of them snares the downhill gold in South Korea.\n“Cross-country will always be the biggest sport in Norway,” Svindal grinned.\n“Norway’s a small country, there’s not that many things we’re best in the world at.”\nEditing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T12:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T12:52:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
