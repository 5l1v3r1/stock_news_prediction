This signifies “some younger NPR (non-permanent residents) may be receiving parental support to purchase homes,” it noted. \nA backlash against foreign investors, particularly those from mainland China, has spurred provincial governments to impose a foreign buyers tax in Vancouver in 2016 and in Toronto in 2017, despite data showing offshore buyers are a small part of the market. \nThe market for detached homes in both cities has cooled since double-digit price increases in early 2016 sparked fears of a bubble, though condo sales are more robust. Analysts are divided over whether the Canadian housing market will crash or re-inflate in the coming months. \nThe CMHC report, based on data from Canada’s five largest banks, showed 3.9 percent of mortgages issued in Vancouver were held by non-permanent residents in 2016, up from 3.3 percent in 2014. In Toronto, 2.7 percent of mortgages issued in 2016 were held by non-permanent residents, up from 2.1 percent in 2015 and 2.0 percent in 2014. \nFor the report, non-permanent residents included foreign workers, students, refugee claimants and other non-Canadians legally living in Canada.

REUTERS/Julie Gordon/File Photo \nIn a 2015 case study, Yan found that 5 percent of homes that traded hands over a six-month period in a prime swath of Vancouver were purchased by students, with the average sales value of those homes at C$3.2 million. \nWhile non-permanent residents hold a small fraction of mortgages overall, the rapid growth of foreign buyers aged 18 to 44 is shifting the market demographic in Canada, the CMHC said in the report. \nNon-permanent residents preferred more expensive properties, according to the report, buying single detached homes worth an average of C$1.09 million in Toronto and C$1.65 million in Vancouver. That was above the average C$902,000 and C$1.42 million bought by permanent residents in those cities, respectively. \nThe proportion of mortgages held by non-residents, including Canadians and foreigners not living in Canada, also rose from 2014 to 2016, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto, the report showed.
