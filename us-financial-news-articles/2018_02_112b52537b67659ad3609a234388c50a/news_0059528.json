I think that's really the next push.\"\nAnd what could be the main driver of this next leg up? The company's dedication to innovation, says the trader.\n\"They already own about 18 percent of the share of online grocery shopping, so that's going to continue,\" Baruch added. \"Online grocery shopping in general is going to continue. They've redefined the supply chain management and they're going to continue to grow.\"\nOn Tuesday, reports circulated that Amazon would acquire smart doorbell-maker Ring for more than $1 billion. The deal would mark Amazon's second-biggest acquisition ever. The company's almost $14 billion purchase of Whole Foods back in June is still the largest.\nChantico Global CEO Gina Sanchez expects many more deals for Amazon down the pike. \"They went into web services, and they just signed a deal with Lionsgate, that's a lot of different things,\" she said. \"And they're getting into higher and higher margin areas, and I do think that's also important.\"\n\"Don't underestimate the innovation that's happening in Amazon because they're slowly and very surely crushing a lot of their competition,\" she added.\nAmazon was trading at around $1,517 on Wednesday, up about 30 percent year to date.\nDisclaimer Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
