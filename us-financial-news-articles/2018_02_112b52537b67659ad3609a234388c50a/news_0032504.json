It sent a message to the market that the main part of Abenomics (the government’s revival plan) will not change,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n“It must have made the right choice by selecting Wakatabe and Amamiya when the market is volatile.”\nThe broader Topix gained 1.1 percent to 1,738.72, with all 33 subsectors except sea transport in positive territory. Shares in utilities, food and medicine companies, which are most sensitive to domestic demand, outperformed.\nTokyo Electric Power Co soared 3.4 percent, Chubu Electric Power Co jumped 5.4 percent, Astellas Pharma gained 1.6 percent and Ajinomoto Co added 1.5 percent.\nExporters were also strong, with Toyota Motor and Honda Motor and Panasonic Corp all rising 1.7 percent.
