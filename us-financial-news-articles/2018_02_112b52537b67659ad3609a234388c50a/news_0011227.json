The country is also concerned with providing enough power for heating after a government effort to reduce coal-fired heating in order to reduce air pollution.\nReporting by Muyu Xu and Josephine MasonEditing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:21:59.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
