The glycol has been replenished and the airport de-icing equipment is fully functional,” the carrier said.\n“Those developments, coupled with a more positive weather forecast for Chicago position us to safely operate our more than 250 departures out of Chicago Midway.”\nReporting by Alana Wise in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T20:28:01.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
