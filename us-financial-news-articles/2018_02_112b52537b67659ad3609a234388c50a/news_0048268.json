The segment earned $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with earnings of $81.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Improved fourth quarter and full year results were due primarily to a lower effective tax rate in 2017 and lower non-tracked operations and maintenance expense in 2017, partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax expense.\nElectric Transmission\nEversource Energy’s transmission segment earned $391.9 million for the full year 2017, compared with earnings of $370.8 million for the full year of 2016. It earned $102.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with earnings of $104.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher full-year earnings were due primarily to an increased level of investment in Eversource Energy transmission facilities. Lower fourth quarter results in 2017 reflect the impact of a benefit recorded in 2016 related to the recovery of $27.5 million of pre-tax merger-related costs through electric transmission rates.\nNatural Gas Distribution\nEversource Energy’s natural gas distribution segment earned $74.6 million for the full year of 2017, compared with earnings of $77.7 million for the full year of 2016. Fourth quarter natural gas segment earnings were $25.5 million in 2017, compared with $25.8 million in 2016. Lower results in 2017 were driven primarily by higher depreciation, operation and maintenance, and property tax expense, partially offset by higher revenues resulting from colder fourth quarter weather in 2017. Firm natural gas sales rose 3 percent in 2017, compared with 2016.\nEversource Energy Parent and Other Companies\nEversource Energy parent and other companies earned $24.1 million for the full year of 2017, compared with $31 million for the full year of 2016. It earned $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Lower fourth quarter results were due primarily to a higher effective tax rate in 2017.\nThe following table reconciles 2017 and 2016 fourth quarter and full-year earnings per share:\nFourth Quarter Full Year 2016 Reported EPS $0.72 $2.96 Lower non-tracked O&M in 2017 0.06 0.12 Higher/(lower) transmission earnings in 2017 (0.01) 0.07 Higher retail electric and generation results in 2017 0.01 0.01 Higher property tax and depreciation expense in 2017 (0.03) (0.06) Other, including interest expense --- 0.01 2017 Reported EPS $0.75 $3.11 Financial results by segment for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 and 2016 are noted below:\nThree months ended:\n(in millions, except EPS)\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2017 EPS 1\nElectric Distribution/Generation $104.0 $81.5 $22.5 $0.33 Electric Transmission 102.3 104.2 (1.9) 0.32 Natural Gas Distribution 25.5 25.8 (0.3) 0.08 Eversource Parent and Other Companies 5.6 17.7 (12.1) 0.02 Reported Earnings $237.4 $229.2 $8.2 $0.75 Full year ended:\n(in millions, except EPS)\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2017 EPS 1\nElectric Distribution/Generation $497.4 $462.8 $34.6 $1.57 Electric Transmission 391.9 370.8 21.1 1.23 Natural Gas Distribution 74.6 77.7 (3.1) 0.23 Eversource Parent and Other Companies 24.1 31.0 (6.9) 0.08 Reported Earnings $988.0 $942.3 $45.7 $3.11 Retail sales data:\nThree months ended: December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 % Change Electric Distribution (Gwh) Traditional 6,815 6,748 1.0% Decoupled 6,000 5,928 1.2% Total Electric Distribution 12,815 12,676 1.1% Natural Gas Distribution (mmcf) Traditional 14,725 13,744 7.1% Decoupled and Special Contracts 16,615 16,191 2.6% Total Natural Gas Distribution 31,340 29,935 4.7% Full year ended: December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 % Change Electric Distribution (Gwh) Traditional 27,855 28,479 (2.2%) Decoupled 24,391 25,163 (3.1%) Total Electric Distribution 52,246 53,642 (2.6%) Natural Gas Distribution (mmcf) Traditional 46,957 45,314 3.6% Decoupled and Special Contracts 54,069 52,728 2.5% Total Natural Gas Distribution 101,026 98,042 3.0% Eversource Energy has approximately 317 million common shares outstanding and operates New England’s largest energy delivery system.

The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource Energy. The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business, but rather represent a direct interest in Eversource Energy's assets and liabilities, as a whole. EPS by business is a non-GAAP (not determined using generally accepted accounting principles) measure that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to controlling interests of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource parent common shares outstanding for the period. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate earnings results, provide details of earnings results by business, and more fully compare and explain our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 and 2016 results. Management believes that this measurement is useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of Eversource Energy’s businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to Eversource Energy’s consolidated net income attributable to controlling interests or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of Eversource Energy’s operating performance.\nThis news release includes statements concerning Eversource Energy’s expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, assumptions of future events, future financial performance or growth and other statements that are not historical facts.
