The central bank currently forecasts two more rate rises after that this year.\nA boost from the Trump administration’s $1.5 trillion in corporate and individual tax cuts passed late December has caused some policymakers to keep an open mind on whether the Fed may need to tighten more aggressively.\nQuarles’ remarks come one day before the Powell’s keenly awaited semi-annual testimony to Congress after which the Fed chief will answer questions from lawmakers on the U.S. economy.
