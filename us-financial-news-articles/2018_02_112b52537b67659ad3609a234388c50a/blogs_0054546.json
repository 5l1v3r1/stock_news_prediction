Last year, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned after reports that he used private jets for routine travel.\nThe Washington Post had reported that he spent over $100,000 in taxpayer money for premium travel, based on records obtained by the Environmental Integrity Project.\nGowdy asked the EPA to provide the oversight committee a log and details of each flight taken between Feb. 17, 2017 and Feb. 18, 2018, information on whether Pruitt obtained a waiver to purchase a first class or business class ticket and the cost of tickets for each EPA employee traveling.\nThat watchdog group on Friday obtained new travel records, shared with media, showing Pruitt and EPA employees spent upwards of $150,000 on premium commercial and chartered flights from March to August 2017.\nGowdy said he wants answers from Pruitt on the travel questions by 5 p.m. EST on March 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T01:33:43.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
