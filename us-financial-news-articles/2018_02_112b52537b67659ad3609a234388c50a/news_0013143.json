The Democratic Republic of Congo has been hit by unrest this month following the shooting of protesting pro-democracy churchgoers opposed to President Joseph Kabila.\nReporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Crispian Balmer\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T13:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T13:48:36.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
