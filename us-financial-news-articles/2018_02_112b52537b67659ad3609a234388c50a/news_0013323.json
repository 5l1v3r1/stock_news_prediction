The Dow had a more than 1,100-point difference between its high and low on Tuesday. \nThe sharp declines in recent days marked a pullback that had been long awaited by investors after the market minted record high after record high in a relatively calm ascent.

Defensive sectors utilities and real estate were the only major S&P groups to end negative.
