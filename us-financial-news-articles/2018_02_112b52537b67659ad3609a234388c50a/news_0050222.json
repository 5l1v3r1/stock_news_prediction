The FA said in a statement that West Ham were alleged to have failed to ensure their “Club Whereabouts” information was accurate on three occasions within 12 months. West Ham said in a statement on their website that it was a club administrative matter and did not concern any of their players. “The breach relates to administrative oversights on The FA’s whereabouts system, for example a player’s address had been registered and the house number digits transposed, and the club will be responding to The FA in due course,” a club spokesperson said. West Ham have until Feb. 27 to respond to the charge.
