REUTERS/Carlos Barria The two men thundered toward the finish line, both lunging to cross first, and after a photo finish the Italian was declared the silver medalist.\nKlaebo was delighted with his first Olympic win and said he had put the skiathlon behind him.\n“I don’t feel like it’s revenge, for me this has been goal form the Mohole season. To be able to deal with the pressure from the last couple of weeks, it’s a great victory and it feels quite good,” he told reporters.\nKlaebo revealed that his decision about when and where to make a break for victory was not a spontaneous one.\n“I‘m thinking about the last uphill for a long time. I was quite strong in the start of the final, my plan was always to be able to run fast in the last uphill. To be able to get the gap and turn around at the top is a great feeling,” he said.\nThe 21-year-old paid tribute to former team mate Petter Northug, who was not selected for the Games after failing to recover from illness.\n“For a long time when Petter was doing so well from 2006, it’s been a big inspiration for me,” he said of twice Olympic champion Northug, known affectionately as the “bad boy” of Norwegian skiing.\n“When you’re starting to go to high school and you’re looking up to people doing well in championships, you want to do it well and do it your way, and to cross the finish line and get an Olympic gold medal is quite an unbelievable feeling,” Klaebo said.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond/Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:34:34.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
