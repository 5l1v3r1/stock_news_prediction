The student, Gillen Washington, was denied coverage for an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin, a treatment for an immune disorder from which he suffers. \nRead: Why Jeff Bezos Might Be the One To Crack the Health Care Challenge \nIinuma claimed that he was following his training provided by Aetna , in which nurses reviewed the records and gave him recommendations. He further admitted that he did not know about the condition nor its appropriate treatment, or even what would happen if Washington’s treatment was discontinued. Aetna has defended Iinuma. \nIn regards to the investigation, Aetna told CNN that it “look[s] forward to explaining our clinical review process.” While the insurer emphasized that its medical directors “take their duties and responsibilities as medical professionals incredibly seriously,” it noted that they “work collaboratively with our nurses” whose input is factored in to the “decision-making process.” \nRead: Why Did CVS Buy Aetna for $69 Billion? \nIinuma served as medical director for Aetna in Southern California from March 2012 to February 2015. The insurance provider has 23.1 million customers across the country. Commissioner Jones said Californians who believe they may have been adversely affected by the insurer’s decisions should contact his office. \nAetna was not immediately available for comment.
