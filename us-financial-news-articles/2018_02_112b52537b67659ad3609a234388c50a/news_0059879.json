She argued in that piece that the “abuse” came later, when she was “made a scapegoat in order to protect [Clinton’s] powerful position.”\nRead: Kate Upton’s Sexual Harassment Allegations Are Costing This Exec Millions of Dollars\nBut the emergence of sexual misconduct allegations against the likes of Harvey Weinstein and the #MeToo movement have given Lewinsky a “new lens” through which to view the events, leading her to question whether the relationship was consensual given the power dynamics at play.\nI now see how problematic it was that the two of us even got to a place where there was a question of consent. Instead, the road that led there was littered with inappropriate abuse of authority, station, and privilege. (Full stop.)\nNow, at 44, I’m beginning ( just beginning ) to consider the implications of the power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern. I’m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot. (Although power imbalances—and the ability to abuse them—do exist even when the sex has been consensual.)\nRead: Since #MeToo, the Number of Men Who Are Uncomfortable Mentoring Women Has Tripled\nUltimately, however, Lewinsky admits that the whole situation, which she regrets “every day,” is “very, very complicated” and her re-evaluation is not yet complete. Nevertheless, she expresses gratitude for the “heroines” of #MeToo and Time’s Up who have let her know that she is no longer alone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T17:22:34.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
