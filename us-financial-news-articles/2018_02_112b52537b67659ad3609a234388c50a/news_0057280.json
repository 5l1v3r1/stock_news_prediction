The price of 10-year JGB futures rose 0.08 point to 150.97.\nJapanese bond prices had rallied this month in the wake of a global stock selloff that raised the allure of safe-haven JGBs.\nWhile bond markets in the United States and Europe face pressure from concerns about inflation and tightening in monetary policy, the BOJ is seen as nowhere near raising its target in interest rates and bond yields.\nThe 20-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.550 percent from a five-month low of 0.545 percent, while the 30-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.755 percent from a 10-month low of 0.750 percent.\nBut the 40-year yield dipped 0.5 basis point to 0.880 percent.\n$1 = 106.48 yen Reporting by Tokyo Markets Team; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T15:10:37.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
