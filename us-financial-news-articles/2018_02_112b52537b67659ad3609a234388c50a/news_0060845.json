Last week, it flagged a record annual loss of $4.78-$4.98 billion.\nFounded in 1986 by Richard Elman, who rode a commodities bull run to build one of the world’s biggest traders, Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research questioned its books. Noble has defended its accounting.\nNoble’s market value has fallen to just $228 million from $6 billion in February 2015.\nThe company, which had ambitions to rival global commodity traders such as Glencore and Vitol, has shrunk to its Asian roots, dealing in commodities such as coal and owning freight and liquefied natural gas (LNG) businesses.\nNoble’s net loss included $1 billion from discontinued operations and $3.2 billion of exceptional charges made up of $2.1 billion in non-cash losses from the value of its commodity contracts and derivatives portfolio.\nThe company’s debt restructuring deal has been opposed by some bondholders and shareholders including Goldilocks Investment Co, an Abu Dhabi Financial Group equity fund.\nReporting by Anshuman Daga; Editing by David Evans and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:09:01.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
