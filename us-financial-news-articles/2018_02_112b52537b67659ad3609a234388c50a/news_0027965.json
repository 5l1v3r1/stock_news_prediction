ARMOUR posts unaudited and unreviewed Company Updates on www.armourreit.com .\nGAAP Net Income and Comprehensive Income\nFor the purposes of computing GAAP net income, the change in fair value of the Company’s derivatives is reflected in current period net income, while the change in fair value of its Agency Securities is reflected in comprehensive income. GAAP net income for Q4 2017 was approximately $71.0 million, including mark-to-market gains on derivatives and Credit Risk and Non-Agency Securities of $43.7 million and $18.7 million, respectively, and $21.0 million of realized loss on derivatives. Other comprehensive loss for Q4 2017 was $45.3 million, resulting in comprehensive income of $25.7 million for the quarter.\nCore Income, Including Drop Income\nCore Income, including Drop Income, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was approximately $32.5 million, exceeding total dividend payments to stockholders for the quarter of $28.1 million. Core Income, including Drop Income, is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as net income excluding impairment losses, gains or losses on sales of securities and early termination of derivatives, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives and certain non-recurring expenses, plus Drop Income (as defined below). Core Income may differ from GAAP net income, which includes the unrealized gains or losses of the Company’s derivative instruments and the gains or losses on Agency, Credit Risk and Non-Agency and Interest-only Securities.\nFor a portion of our Agency securities we may enter into to-be-announced (TBA) forward contracts for the purchase or sale of Agency Securities at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date but the particular Agency Securities to be delivered are not identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date. We account for TBA Agency Securities as derivative instruments if it is reasonably possible that we will not take or make physical delivery of the Agency Securities upon settlement of the contract. We may choose, prior to settlement, to move the settlement of these securities out to a later date by entering into an offsetting short or long position (referred to as a “pair off”), net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously purchasing or selling a similar TBA Agency Security for a later settlement date. This transaction is commonly referred to as a “dollar roll.” We account for TBA dollar roll transactions as a series of derivative transactions.\nForward settling TBA contracts typically trade at a discount, or “Drop,” to the regular settled TBA contract to reflect the expected interest income on the underlying deliverable Agency Securities, net of an implied financing cost, that would have been earned by the buyer if the contract settled on the next regular settlement date. When we enter into TBA contracts to buy Agency Securities for forward settlement, we earn this “Drop Income,” because the TBA contract is essentially a leveraged investment in the underlying Agency Securities. The amount of Drop Income is calculated as the difference between the spot price of similar TBA contracts for regular settlement and the forward settlement price on the trade date. We generally account for TBA contracts as derivatives and Drop Income is included as part of the periodic changes in fair value of the TBA contracts which we recognize currently in the Other Income (Loss) section of our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nDividends\nThe Company paid dividends of $0.19 per Common share of record for each month in Q4 2017. Payments to Common stockholders for Q4 2017 were approximately $24.0 million. The Company also paid monthly dividends of $0.171875 per outstanding share of 8.250% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and $0.1640625 per outstanding share of 7.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, resulting in aggregate payments to preferred stockholders of approximately $4.1 million in Q4 2017.\nCommon dividends in the amount of $0.19 per Common share were paid on January 29, 2018, to holders of record on January 16, 2018. Common dividends in the amount of $0.19 per Common share have been declared for holders of record on February 15, 2018 (payable February 27, 2018). The board of directors determines the Common share dividend rate based upon the REIT requirements and other relevant considerations. Dividends in excess of current tax earnings and profits for the year (including any amounts carried forward from prior years) will generally be treated as non-taxable return of capital to Common stockholders.\nStock Issuance\nDuring Q4 2017, we issued 297,830 common shares under our Common stock dividend reinvestment program (“DRIP”) for net proceeds of approximately $8.0 million. During Q4 2017, we sold 302,779 shares under our Preferred B ATM Sales Agreement for net proceeds of $7.5 million. To date in Q1 2018, we have sold 106,874 shares of Preferred B stock for net proceeds of approximately $2.6 million.\nPer Share Amounts\nPer Common share amounts are net of applicable Preferred Stock dividends and liquidation preferences.\nPortfolio\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s Agency Securities portfolio consisted of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae mortgage securities, substantially all of which are fixed rate securities, and was valued at $7.5 billion on a trade date basis. The Company’s Credit Risk and Non-Agency Securities portfolio was valued at $1.0 billion and the Company’s TBA Agency Securities portfolio was valued at $1.6 billion. During Q4 2017, the annualized yield on the Company’s MBS portfolio (including TBA Agency Securities) was 3.02%, and the annualized cost of funds on average liabilities (including realized cost of hedges) was 1.47%, resulting in a net interest spread of 1.55% for Q4 2017.\nPortfolio Financing, Leverage and Interest Rate Hedges\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company financed its mortgage backed securities portfolio with approximately $7.6 billion of borrowings under repurchase agreements. The Company’s leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017, was 5.70 to 1 (6.96 to 1, including TBA Agency Securities purchased forward and excluding debt related to forward settling sales). As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s liquidity totaled approximately $676.6 million, consisting of approximately $265.2 million of cash, plus approximately $411.4 million of unpledged securities (including securities received as collateral). As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s repurchase agreements had a weighted-average maturity of approximately 51 days, an average rate of 1.71% and a haircut of 6.39%.\nThe Company had a notional amount of various maturities of interest rate swap contracts of approximately $5.3 billion with a weighted average swap rate of 1.81%.\nRegulation G Reconciliation\nCore Income excludes impairment losses, gains or losses on sales of securities and early termination of derivatives, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives and certain non-recurring expenses, plus Drop Income. The Company believes that Core Income is useful to investors because it is related to the amount of dividends the Company may distribute. However, because Core Income is an incomplete measure of the Company’s financial performance and involves differences from net income computed in accordance with GAAP, Core Income should be considered as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of the Company’s financial performance.\nThe following tables reconcile the Company’s results from operations to Core Income and Core Income per Common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (dollar amounts in millions, except per share amounts):\nCore Income\n(in millions)\nGAAP net income $ 71.0 Book to tax differences: Credit Risk and Non-Agency Securities (18.6 ) Interest-only Securities 0.2 Changes in interest rate contracts (29.6 ) Other than temporary impairment of Agency Securities 3.3 Loss on Security Sales (2.2 ) Drop Income 8.4 Core Income $ 32.5 Core Income $ 32.5 Dividends on Preferred Stock (4.1 ) Core Income available to common stockholders $ 28.4 Common shares outstanding 41.9 Core Income Per Common Share $ 0.68 Common Stock As of December 31, 2017, there were 41,877,404 Common shares outstanding.
