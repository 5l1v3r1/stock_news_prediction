(NASDAQ:ONTX) (“Onconova” or “we”), a Phase 3 stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing small molecule drug candidates to treat cancer, with a primary focus on Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), today announced the closing of its previously announced underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of 9,947,500 shares of its common stock (“Common Stock”) (or Common Stock equivalent) and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 994,750 shares of Onconova’s Series A convertible preferred stock (“Preferred Stock Warrants”), including 1,297,500 shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock Warrants to purchase 129,750 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock issued pursuant to the underwriter’s full exercise of its option to purchase additional securities, at the public offering price of $1.01 per share and accompanying Preferred Stock Warrant.\nH.C. Wainwright & Co. acted as the sole book-running manager for the Offering.\nThe Preferred Stock Warrants are exercisable immediately at an exercise price of $1.01 per 0.1 share of Series A Preferred Stock and will expire on the later of (i) the one-year anniversary of the date on which Onconova publicly announces through the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K that the Charter Amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and (ii) the earlier of (A) the one-month anniversary of the date on which Onconova publically releases certain topline results of the INSPIRE Pivotal phase 3 trial and (B) December 31, 2019. The shares of Common Stock (or Common Stock equivalent) and the accompanying Preferred Stock Warrants were purchased together in this Offering but were issued separately.\nThe gross proceeds of the Offering were approximately $10 million and, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, the net proceeds of the Offering were approximately $8.7 million.

However, there is no assurance that all or a portion of the Preferred Stock Warrants will be exercised prior to their expiration.\nOnconova intends to use the net proceeds from this Offering to fund the development of its clinical and preclinical programs, for other research and development activities and for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures and funding working capital needs.\nA registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-222374) relating to these securities was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 7, 2018.
