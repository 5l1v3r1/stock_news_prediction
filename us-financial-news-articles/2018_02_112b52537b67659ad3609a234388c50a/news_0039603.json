The plan for IPO was already known, however, so the announcement may not boost the stock significantly. \nLast at 2.27 dirhams, Dubai Investments is testing major technical support on the September and December 2017 lows of 2.28 dirhams. This would be a logical base for a rebound, but any clean break of support - two straight daily closes - would be very bearish, triggering a head & shoulders pattern formed by the highs and lows since August and pointing in the medium term down to the mid-2017 lows around 2.0 dirhams.
