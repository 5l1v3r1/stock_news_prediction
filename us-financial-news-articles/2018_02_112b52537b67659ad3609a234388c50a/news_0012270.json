The region is in its annual dry season, which runs from around mid-November until March.\nA prolonged period of low prices has also begun to boost demand, with Europe’s cocoa grind in the fourth quarter of 2017 rising by 4.4 percent year-on-year.\nOne participant said the market’s outlook would depend partly on the extent to which chocolate sales volumes rise to back up the strong grind growth.\nThe survey produced a median forecast for this season’s crop in top grower Ivory Coast of 1.95 million tonnes, down from the ICCO’s estimate of last year’s production of 2.02 million.\nThe crop in number-two producer Ghana was seen at 870,000 tonnes in 2017/18, down from the ICCO’s estimate for the prior season of 970,000 tonnes.\nGhana’s cocoa purchases fell between October and mid-January compared to last season and it may miss its full-season output target because of dry weather, senior regulatory sources said earlier this month.\nReporting by Nigel Hunt; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:43:58.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
