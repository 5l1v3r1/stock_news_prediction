You suggest that small communities won’t be harmed by this proposal. More than 100 mayors in every state, along with rural groups, airport organizations, chambers of commerce and others understand that under this highly controversial proposal, congressional oversight of the nation’s aviation system would be transferred to a private board effectively dominated by the airlines, and unaccountable to Congress. The group would have the authority to target funds and other resources toward the large airline hubs, and make self-serving decisions about access to airports and airspace.\nPhoto: istock/Getty Images Of course these are the same airlines that have dramatically cut service to small towns, which are responsible for the vast majority of their own flight delays and whose consumer treatment prompts one eye-popping news story after another.\nThe airline-takeover plan the Journal supports has prompted concern or outright opposition from a bipartisan group of congressional lawmakers, think tanks on the left and right, the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, the Government Accountability Office, a host of aviation and aerospace leaders (including hero-pilot Capt. Sully Sullenberger), consumer and passenger groups and a majority of American citizens.\nThis growing chorus of voices knows a fundamental truth: A plan to give away our ATC system—a natural monopoly—to the big airlines isn’t a substitute for air traffic modernization, and in fact will impede modernization.\nMark Baker\nPresident and CEO\nAircraft Owners and Pilots Association\nEd Bolen\nPresident and CEO\nNational Business\nAviation Association\nWashington\nThe commercialization of air-traffic control has destroyed nearly all private aviation in the world. Your prescription for aviation in the U.S. will destroy general aviation in the U.S. as it has in Germany, the U.K., Canada and France. The U.S. is the last place where an average person can purchase and learn to fly an aircraft and fly it almost as unencumbered as he could drive an automobile. Your ideas would destroy this last bright spot of aviation freedom.\nLionel D. Alford Jr.\nWichita, Kan.\nWhile most U.S. air passengers fly on airlines, the majority of flights are made by private citizens in their own airplanes. They have found efficient personal transportation in unpretentious aircraft. Ceding control of the public airspace to a group dominated by commercial interests would be like turning the U.S. highway system over to bus and trucking companies.\nFred Stadler\nOshkosh, Wis.\nThe proposal would not reduce flight delays and allow planes to take off and land in more efficient patterns and fly more direct routes. Almost all delays are caused by weather or a lack of concrete. Privatizing ATC can’t possibly change the weather, and it’s possible to safely operate only so many airplanes from an airport. Major terminals in the U.S. are already at capacity, especially at prime travel times. The vast majority of delays aren’t caused in the air, but on the ground.\nThe next time you are sitting on a delayed flight at any hub airport, look out the window. You will see a long line of airliners all scheduled to depart at the same time, but probably no business jets.\nW.T.
