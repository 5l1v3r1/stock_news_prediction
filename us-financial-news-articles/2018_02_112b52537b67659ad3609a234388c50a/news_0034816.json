It said its backlog of projects at the end of December stood at 17.2 billion dirhams, adding that there was a “solid” pipeline of future tender opportunities.\n$1 = 3.6726 UAE dirham Reporting By Tom Arnold Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T13:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:47:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
