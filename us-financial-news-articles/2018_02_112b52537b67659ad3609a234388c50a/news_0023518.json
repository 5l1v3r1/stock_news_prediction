Weinstein was fired by the film company he founded with his brother Robert and expelled from Hollywood's movie academy.\nThe attorney general's office said the lawsuit was filed on Sunday partly due to reports of the company's imminent sale, saying it believed it would leave victims without adequate redress.\n\"Any sale of The Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated, employees will be protected going forward, and that neither perpetrators nor enables will be unjustly enriched,\" court papers said.\nSchneiderman's investigation found that employees were subjected to various verbal threats from Weinstein such as \"I will kill you, I will kill your family, and \"you don't know what I can do.\"\n\"To work for Harvey Weinstein was to work under a persistent barrage of gender-based obscenities, vulgar name-calling, sexualized interactions, threats of violence, and a workplace general hostile to women,\" according to court papers.\nIn one case, the probe found that \"in a fit of rage against one female employee, he yelled that she should leave the company and make babies since that was all she was good for.\"\nFemale executives were forced to facilitate Weinstein's sexual conquests with promises of employment opportunities to women who met his favor, according to the lawsuit, which also accused the company of being \"responsible for the unlawful conduct\" by failing to stop the abuse.\nThe company and co-owner Robert \"are liable because they were aware of and acquiesced in repeated and persistent unlawful conduct by failing to investigate or stop it,\" court papers said.\nRepresentatives for Weinstein have previously denied all accusations of non-consensual sex.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T06:37:43.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
