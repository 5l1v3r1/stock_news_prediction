Judge Emma Arbuthnot ruled earlier that it was still in the public interest for Assange to be arrested and prosecuted for breaching his bail terms when he entered the embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden. “There are 3 months to appeal UK ruling,” Assange said in a statement posted on Twitter.
