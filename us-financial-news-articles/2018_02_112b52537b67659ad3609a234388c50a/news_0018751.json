The deal would be financed with a combination of debt and equity, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe financing is backed by a $300 million commitment from Fortress Investment. bit.ly/2C191jn \nThe offer price represents an 18.6 percent premium to the stock’s closing price on Tuesday \nPerry Ellis confirmed that it received the offer from Feldenkreis and would review the proposal. \n\"I am not comfortable with the motivations, strategy and oversight of the existing board and believe shareholder value will suffer under this board’s stewardship,\" Feldenkreis said in a letter to the company's board. bit.ly/2C2R2cb \nHe also said, as a public company, Perry Ellis is held back by short-term objectives and that the board is reluctant to take risks and is unprepared to underwrite business initiatives and opportunities to drive shareholder value.
