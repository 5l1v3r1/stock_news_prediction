(NYSE:AGO) (Assured Guaranty), announced today that its subsidiary Assured Guaranty US Holdings Inc. (AGUS) acquired a minority interest in Cadia (Malta) Limited (CML), the holding company of Rubicon Infrastructure Advisors (Rubicon). Rubicon is a full-service investment banking firm active in the global infrastructure sector.\nRubicon has advised on over 70 merger and acquisition and capital raising assignments worth in excess of $30 billion over the past five years. Rubicon operates on a global basis and has advised on transactions in Europe, the U.K., North America and Latin America. It provides investors, operating managers and construction companies with independent advice. Rubicon maintains offices in Dublin, New York, and Madrid.\nThe AGUS investment in Rubicon’s growing business capitalizes on core strengths of both companies, including infrastructure credit analysis and strong industry relationships. The primary purpose of the investment is to support Rubicon’s continued international expansion.\nDominic Frederico, President and CEO of Assured Guaranty commented, \"Assured Guaranty’s investment in Rubicon advances one of our key strategic priorities - to pursue carefully selected alternative investments, beyond our core financial guaranty business, that further diversify our revenue sources and have risk profiles consistent with our own. We look forward to cooperating with Rubicon to expand both companies’ opportunities in the global infrastructure finance market.”\nDavid Buzen, Senior Managing Director, Alternative Investments, added, \"Rubicon exemplifies the type of company we are looking for in our alternative investment strategy – it operates in a market we understand well and has complementary strengths and risk appetite, strong management and significant growth potential.”\nAny forward-looking statements made in this press release reflect Assured Guaranty’s current views with respect to future events and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
