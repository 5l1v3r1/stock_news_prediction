The first game was a nightmare for the bowlers and this one was a nightmare for the batters,” Chandimal said at the presentation. \n“The guys executed our game plans really well out in the middle. After the first game we thought the second pitch might be a turning wicket. We were surprised, because we have all the experienced spinners.” \nSilva followed up his 56 in the first innings with an unbeaten 70 in the second and was adjudged the player of the match and the series. \n“I thought this wicket was difficult so I just wanted to keep it simple -- I just played my normal game,” said the 29-year-old, who scored his maiden hundred in the first test in Chittagong. \n“I think one of the strengths we have is the guys in the lower order never throw away their wickets. Even 20-30 runs is very valuable on this wicket.” \nBangladesh skipper Mahmudullah blamed his side’s batting in the first innings for the loss. \n”Feeling really disappointed because we knew the pitch would get us a result,“ he said. ”In this sort of a wicket you should cash in on the first innings. \n“Their bowlers did the job really well, keeping the pressure on us every time we came out. Our bowlers (only) did well in patches.” (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; Editing by Clare Fallon)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T12:31:43.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
