He was found guilty on Thursday of murder and attempted murder after the jury took less than an hour to reach their verdict. \n“This was a terrorist attack. You intended to kill,” said judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb, sentencing him at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London. \n“You had not been radicalized over a long period of time but your rapid decline into irrational hatred of all Muslims turned you into a danger to the public,” she added. “You will pose a significant risk to members of the public .. for a very long time, perhaps for the rest of your life.” Reporting by Michael Holden; editing by Stephen Addison", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T15:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:11:29.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
