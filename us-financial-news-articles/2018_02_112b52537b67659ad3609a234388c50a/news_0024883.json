He declined to comment on the total amount of customers’ yen still stored at the exchange.\nCoincheck, which last month promised to repay about 46.3 billion yen ($425 million) of the cryptocurrency it lost in the theft, declined to specify when it would make the repayments.\nCoincheck Inc Chief Operating Officer Yusuke Otsuka speaks to the media in Tokyo, Japan February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai “We have the funds, but we are making individual checks so there are no problems (with repayments),” said Otsuka.\nHe declined to comment on whether the FSA had verified that Coincheck has enough funds for the repayments.\nLAWSUIT\nSlideshow (2 Images) Despite allowing customers to resume yen-withdrawals, Coincheck said it would keep in place curbs on cryptocurrency withdrawals until it could guarantee the secure resumption of its operations.\n“An external security company is making checks, and we are preparing to resume once we have confirmed the safety of our networks,” Otsuka said, referring to cryptocurrency withdrawals.\nA lawyer representing a group of 10 cryptocurrency traders told Reuters earlier that they would launch a lawsuit against Coincheck on Thursday over the curbs on taking out cryptocurrencies.\nThe group will file a claim at the Tokyo District Court for Coincheck to allow withdrawals to private “wallets” - digital folders for storing money - outside the hacked exchange, the lawyer, Hiromu Mochizuki, said.\nSeparately, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said cryptocurrencies likely would not threaten legal tenders like the yen any time soon as they were mostly used for speculative trading, rather than as payments and settlement means.\nKuroda also said the BOJ was closely watching developments in cryptocurrency trading to ensure they did not erode public trust over the safety of existing settlement systems overseen by the central bank.\n“Cryptocurrencies aren’t legal tender and don’t have assets to back up their value,” the BOJ chief said.\nReporting by Takahiko Wada, Thomas Wilson and Taiga Uranaka; Additional reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Robert Birsel\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T20:26:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
