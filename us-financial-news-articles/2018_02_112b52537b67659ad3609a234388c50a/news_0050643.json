Talks between the two are scheduled to resume on Feb. 27. Skoda declined to comment.\nSkoda, Volkswagen’s second-most profitable brand in terms of operating margin, reported another record year for sales in 2017 with global deliveries up 6.6 percent to 1.2 million vehicles.\nSkoda’s Czech plants accounted for 60.7 percent of the country’s car production in 2017, followed by Hyundai Motor and a joint plant of Toyota and Peugeot Citroen (TPCA).
