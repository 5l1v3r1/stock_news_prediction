The dollar has weakened too fast. We are still looking for dollar weakness this year but we’ve returned to the January trend [of a weaker dollar] too fast,” he said.\nA lack of key data on Monday and market holidays in the U.S. and parts of Asia is likely to keep trading quiet, analysts said.\nThe dollar index .DXY was flat at 89.085 after earlier trading higher. The index is off a low of 88.253 hit last week, which was the weakest level for the U.S. currency since December 2014.\nAgainst the euro, the dollar gave up its earlier gains to trade flat at $1.2423 EUR= with traders pointing to crucial business surveys later this week that could give the single currency some more direction.\nVersus the yen, the dollar gained 0.1 percent to 106.49 JPY= but remained down more than 2 percent this month.\n“The fact that the dollar sell-off ran out of steam on Friday afternoon does not lead me to hope that it is over,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note.\n“The dollar bears did so well recently that there was time for profit-taking ahead of the weekend. That does not mean that they might not be selling dollar again today with renewed enthusiasm,” the analysts said.\nThe U.S. currency’s outlook remains uncertain in the longer-term, strategists said, particularly as other parts of the world where central banks are tightening policy and economies are strong look increasingly attractive for investors.\nThe Swedish crown EURSEK=D3 was down 0.3 percent against the euro to 9.914 crowns per euro.\nThat followed news that banks in Latvia, a country in which Swedish institutions are heavily invested, faced accusations of busting sanctions on North Korea and the central bank governor was detained by the anti-corruption agency. [nL8N1Q90AK]\nAnalysts said it was not clear to what extent the crown’s weakness on Monday could be attributed to the Latvia developments.\nReporting by Tommy Wilkes; editing by Mark Heinrich; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:25:59.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
