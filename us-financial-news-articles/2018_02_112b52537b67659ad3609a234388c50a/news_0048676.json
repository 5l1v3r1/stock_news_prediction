Precisely 206,340 people have signed against lifting the smoking ban in restaurants and bars,” the “Don’t smoke” campaign said on its Facebook page on Tuesday.\nUnder the current system, parliament must hold a debate on any issue that draws 100,000 signatures.\nThat threshold was reached on Sunday but the campaign is continuing to collect signatures in what has become a show of strength against a government that has given no indication that it plans to yield.\nThe rush to sign has been so great that there have been queues at local government offices and the Interior Ministry’s computer system that manages online signatures has frequently collapsed.\n“We have received news that there have been fewer problems with signatures today,” the campaign said, a view confirmed by an Interior Ministry spokesman.\nReporting by Francois Murphy; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T20:37:08.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
