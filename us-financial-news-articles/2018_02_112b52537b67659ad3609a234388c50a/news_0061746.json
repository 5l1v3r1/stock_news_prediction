Sigfox’s technology connects objects and collects data, turning a range of simple electronics into internet devices. The French firm is one of the early developers of so-called low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology, designed to connect billions of simple objects beyond computers or phones to the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). Sigfox’s technology competes with a rival industry standard known as LoRa, whose software is already used in the same ST software package. The company, one of France’s most well-financed start-ups, has raised 277 million euros ($341 million) from investors including Total and Salesforce.com, as well as the venture funding arms of Silicon Valley-based Intel, Japan’s NTT DoCoMo and South Korea’s SK Telecom.
