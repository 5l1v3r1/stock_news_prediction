Elovitch has denied any wrongdoing.\nDiscount said in a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange it was prepared to pay 375 million shekels for smaller units controlled by Eurocom, including Enlight Renewable Energy .\nWithin the following six months it would inject an additional 700 million shekels into Eurocom, which controls Bezeq with a 26 percent stake, in exchange for bonds that could be converted into Eurocom shares.\nDuring this time, depending on approval by Israel’s antitrust authority, Discount said it would sell its shares in Cellcom.\nDiscount is a subsidiary of holding company IDB Development Corp, whose controlling shareholder is Argentinian businessman Eduardo Elsztain.\n$1 = 3.4416 shekels Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:52:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
