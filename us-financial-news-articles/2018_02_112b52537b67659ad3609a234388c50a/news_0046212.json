Latvia's Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola told CNBC Thursday that Riga's strategy communication professionals would continue to assess the corruption allegations leveled against Rimsevics \"so that we can better judge whether there is some active hybrid warfare (being) carried out here in Latvia.\"\n'Very important' moment for Latvia Russia has denied meddling in foreign election campaigns, although respective authorities in the U.S., France and Germany have all directly accused Moscow of interference.\nSpeaking to reporters at a news conference Tuesday, Rimsevics said the allegations he is facing, which were made by the Russian owner of a Latvian bank, marked a \"very important\" moment for Latvia. He denies any wrongdoing.\nInts Kalnins | Reuters A head office of the ABLV Bank is pictured in Riga. Rimsevics added that some Latvian banks \"wanted blood\" after their activities were restricted in the wake of the country's accession to the euro zone.\nLatvia's corruption agency said the investigation concerning Rimsevics was unrelated to money laundering accusations against Riga's third-largest lender, ABLV bank.\nLast week, the U.S. Treasury accused ABLV of defying Western sanctions by allowing its clients to conduct business with parties connected to North Korea. In response, ABLV said the accusations were based on unfounded and misleading information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T14:45:19.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
