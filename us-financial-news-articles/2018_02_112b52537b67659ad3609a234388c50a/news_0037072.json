So you can imagine how it works with a little bit of headwind,” he added.\n”I think there’s a big difference between being negative and being realistic. Realistically, the wind plays its role and it’s a short downhill so realistically it makes it really tough for us.\n“I‘m not being negative, when FIS says go, we go, and everything can happen in slalom part, but it certainly wasn’t the downhill run we wanted.”\nJansrud’s team mate Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, who only managed the 15th fastest time, was equally unimpressed.\n“It’s not funny when you get to the end and you are two seconds down with no mistakes,” he said.
