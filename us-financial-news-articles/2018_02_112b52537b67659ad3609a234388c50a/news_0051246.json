Miller has stopped 61 shots over the past four periods after not allowing a goal in the third period of the Ducks’ 2-0 win over the Vegas Golden Knights on Monday while playing in relief of injured No. 1 goaltender John Gibson.\nThe Ducks recorded their fourth consecutive victory, their longest winning streak this season. Anaheim, 6-1-1 in its past eight games, jumped the idle Los Angeles Kings into third place in the Pacific Division.\nThe Stars, 6-3-0 in their past nine games and 12-6-1 in their past 19, lost for the second time on their three-game California road trip that will end Thursday at Los Angeles. Dallas remains tied with St. Louis Blues for third place in the Central Division.\nThe Stars have allowed two goals or fewer in 11 of their past 16 games.\nIt took just eight seconds of the game’s first power-play chance for Anaheim to jump to a 1-0 lead with 6:45 remaining in the first period. Hampus Lindholm waited in the crease for a rebounded shot from the point by Getzlaf to clear the scrum around Dallas goalkeeper Ben Bishop, and he easily poked it into the net. Brandon Montour was also granted an assist on the goal.\nGetzlaf doubled the lead with a short-handed goal at the 4:28 mark of the third period. He flipped the puck over Bishop into clear ice and wristed a shot off Dallas center Tyler Seguin, who had skated into the crease to try to cover the open net. Francois Beauchemin and Derek Grant got assists on the play.\nAnaheim hits the road for its next game at Arizona on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:42:20.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
