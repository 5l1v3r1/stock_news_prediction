Housing demand remains sturdy with rising income, while home supply has been tight due to limited labor and lots to build on, analysts said.\nThe borrowing cost on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.38 percent in the week ended on Feb. 15, the highest since April 2014. Last week, 30-year home loan rates had averaged 4.32 percent, the mortgage finance agency said.\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield has posted a series of four-year peaks this week on concerns about rising inflation and a surge in federal borrowing to fund major tax cuts passed in December and the budget debt decided on last week. It was 2.886 percent on Thursday after hitting 2.944 percent, Reuters data showed.\nEarlier Thursday, the government said producer prices rose 2.7 percent on a year-over-year basis in January. The core measure of producer prices which excludes food, energy and trade services prices increased 2.5 percent in the 12 months through January, its biggest increase since August 2014.\nThe January PPI report followed stronger-than-expected readings on the Consumer Price Index in January.\n“Inflation measures were broad-based, cementing expectations that the Federal Reserve will go forward with monetary tightening later this year,” Freddie Mac’s deputy chief economist Len Kiefer said in a statement.\nTraders raised bets the U.S. central bank may increase key overnight borrowing costs four times in 2018.\nIn another report on Thursday, the National Association of Home Builders said its index of housing market activity was unchanged at 72 points in February in line with expectations.\nThe index, which is seen as a proxy for future home construction, was 2 points below the level set in December which was the highest since July 1999.\n“With ongoing job creation, increasing owner-occupied household formation, and a tight supply of existing home inventory, the single-family housing sector should continue to strengthen at a gradual but consistent pace,” the industry group’s chief economist Robert Dietz said in a statement.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:58:12.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
