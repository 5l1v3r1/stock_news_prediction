Los Angeles limited the Thunder to 35 second-half points while winning its eighth consecutive home game.\nPaul George had 29 points and nine rebounds for the Thunder, who lost for the fifth time in six games. Oklahoma City played without All-Star guard Russell Westbrook and forward Carmelo Anthony, with both players sidelined due to ankle injuries.\nLos Angeles was without point guard Lonzo Ball (knee). The Lakers also were short-handed after dealing guard Jordan Clarkson and forward Larry Nance Jr. to the Cleveland Cavaliers for guard Isaiah Thomas and forward Channing Frye prior to Thursday’s trade deadline.\n“We know it’s part of the business,” Ingram said in a postgame interview on TNT. “The good thing is we are friends away from the basketball court and will always have a relationship. We know it’s the business of basketball, and I pray for the best on their journeys.”\nLos Angeles led by six points at halftime but doubled the margin as Ingram buried consecutive 3-pointers. Josh Hart followed with another 3-pointer to give the Lakers a 70-55 lead with 6:11 left in the third quarter.\nThe lead was 83-66 entering the fourth quarter, and Los Angeles pounced with the first six points, capped by Corey Brewer’s basket with 9:28 remaining. The Thunder were unable to make a run due to 5-of-17 shooting in the final quarter.\nSteven Adams added 13 points and nine rebounds for Oklahoma City, which shot just 35.6 percent from the field. The Thunder finished 8 of 34 (23.5 percent) from 3-point range.\nThe Lakers shot 43.8 percent from the field and were 10 of 31 (32.3 percent) from 3-point range.\nGeorge scored 22 first-half points, but the Thunder trailed 52-46 at the break.\nOklahoma City raced to an early 13-4 lead before Los Angeles recovered to take a 30-27 lead at the end of the quarter. Caldwell-Pope drained a 3-pointer to give the Lakers a 46-34 advantage with 4:56 left in the half, but the Thunder whittled the margin to six.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:30:49.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
