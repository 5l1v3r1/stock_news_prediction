Mr. Calk’s overtures raised questions among military leaders as to how to respond, this person said.\nMr. Calk, a veteran whose bank caters to former members of the military, didn’t get the Army job.\nThe Journal subsequently reported that the Justice Department had sought Mr. Manafort’s banking records as part of a possible money-laundering probe.\nThe Mueller team’s examination of a possible quid pro quo arrangement between Messrs. Manafort and Calk was reported by NBC News earlier on Wednesday.\nMr. Manafort and a longtime business associate, Richard Gates, were indicted in late October by the special counsel’s office on charges of conspiring against the U.S., money laundering, failing to file reports on foreign bank and financial accounts, and making false statements connected to their work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Both have pleaded not guilty.\nMr. Mueller’s team indicated in a court filing last week that it had uncovered “additional criminal conduct” concerning some of the loans on Mr. Manafort’s properties from Mr. Calk’s bank.\n“That criminal conduct includes a series of bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies” related to property in Fairfax, Va., the filing said.\n“The government has secured substantial evidence that Manafort secured this mortgage from The Federal Savings Bank through a series of false and fraudulent representations to The Federal Savings Bank,” the filing said, adding that Mr. Manafort gave the bank “doctored” financial statements for his company for 2015 and 2016 in which he overstated its income by millions of dollars.\nMr. Mueller’s office has been conducting its probe in collaboration with the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, which has had a continuing investigation into Mr. Manafort and possible money laundering , the Journal reported in October.\nWrite to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.com and Michael Rothfeld at michael.rothfeld@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T08:50:23.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
