World number four Svitolina, who had won both her previous meetings against Kasatkina, dominated the early phase and went on to record a break of serve in the fifth game. Kasatkina, ranked 24 in the world, saved three set points but was inconsistent with her groundstrokes as Svitolina wrapped up the opening set in the 10th game. The 23-year-old Ukrainian made the most of the momentum and produced a spotless display in the second set, recording three more breaks of serve and 18 winners to claim the victory in an hour and 10 minutes.

We will definitely see her winning more this year.” It was an evening to forget for the 20-year-old Kasatkina, who committed 34 unforced errors, but her victories over world number three Garbine Muguruza and Johanna Konta this week reflected her remarkable progress on the WTA Tour this season.
