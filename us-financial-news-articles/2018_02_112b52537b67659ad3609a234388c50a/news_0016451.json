He takes the place of Ben Teo’o, who drops to the bench. \nCare’s understudy will be 34-year-old Richard Wigglesworth, who will become the second oldest scrumhalf in England history if he comes on as a replacement for his first international appearance since the 2015 World Cup. Rugby Union - England Training - Pennyhill Park, Bagshot, Britain - February 7, 2018 England head coach Eddie Jones during training Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs \n“Danny Care very much deserves the honour of being the most capped England scrum half and I am sure he’ll make the most of his opportunity on Saturday,” said Jones in a media statement. \nThe coach is due to address a news conference later on Thursday. \nEngland have won five of their last six meetings against Wales, who beat Scotland 34-7 in their Six Nations opener. \nTeam: \n15-Mike Brown, 14-Anthony Watson, 13-Jonathan Joseph, 12-Owen Farrell, 11-Jonny May, 10-George Ford, 9-Danny Care, 8-Sam Simmonds, 7-Chris Robshaw, 6-Courtney Lawes, 5-Maro Itoje, 4-Joe Launchbury, 3-Dan Cole, 2-Dylan Hartley (capt), 1-Mako Vunipola \nReplacements: 16-Jamie George, 17-Alec Hepburn, 18-Harry Williams, 19-George Kruis, 20-Sam Underhill, 21-Richard Wigglesworth, 22-Ben Te’o, 23- Jack Nowell.
