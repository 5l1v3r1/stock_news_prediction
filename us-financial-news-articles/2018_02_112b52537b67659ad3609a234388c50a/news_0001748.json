It was up 0.11 on the day.\nThe benchmark 10-year cash JGB yield edged down to 0.090 percent, the same level as its previous close, from 0.095 percent touched earlier.\nJGB yields have risen in recent weeks, in line with global peers, on rising expectations that the world’s central banks are increasingly leaning towards winding back stimulus as the global economy gains momentum.\nInvestors have started to speculate that the BOJ could also be moving towards an exit from ultra-easy policy, although BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has denied that he was considering such a major policy adjustment in the near future.\n“I think the BOJ took pre-emptive steps to fend off further rises in JGB yields. JGB prices recovered so I think it was a success at least for now,” said Naoya Oshikubo, yen rates strategist at Barclays.\n“But given that the main reason for higher yields comes from foreign bonds, the market will likely remain capped,” he added.\nIndeed the impact of the BOJ’s action quickly evaporated in the currency market, on which the BOJ has less control.\nThe yen briefly weakened to 109.66 per dollar from around 109.45 but quickly pared its losses.\nReporting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T07:30:53.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
