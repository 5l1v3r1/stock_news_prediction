Suvretta, which ended 2017 with a 24.6 percent gain, owned 2.5 million shares and Citadel, whose multistrategy fund gained roughly 13 percent last year, owned 3.3 million shares after having bought an additional 2.4 million shares during the quarter.\nChilton Investment Co added a new position to own 1.5 million shares at the end of the quarter and Sirios Capital Management bulked up its holding by 264 percent to own 1.8 million at the end of the quarter.\nWhile it is not clear exactly when during the quarter the funds made their bets, several hedge fund managers said the price became more attractive after Harrison’s death, prompting some to buy then.\nThe hedge funds are relatively smaller investors, trailing powerhouses Vanguard Group, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, and activist investor Paul Hilal. Hilal, whose Mantle Ridge owns 42.7 million shares, was instrumental in bringing Harrison to CSX from rival Canadian Pacific last March.\nBut the fact they are there at all suggests confidence that CSX can benefit from the growing economy as well as the new tax plan, analysts and investors said. And it underscores that they are willing to give Harrison’s replacement, Jim Foote, who long worked with Harrison and was most recently CSX’s chief operating officer, a chance, they added.\nAfter Harrison’s death the share price climbed roughly 12 percent in around three weeks, rewarding the newcomers.\nSince then the shares have retreated as investors demand more information on how Foote will handle the turnaround plan that includes deep job cuts and rail yard closures and has triggered persistent service disruptions, customer complaints and federal scrutiny.\nThere were, of course, some funds that exited during the last quarter. Brahman Capital sold 4.8 million shares while OZ Management sold 3.8 million to exit their positions.\nSpokespeople for the funds declined to comment.\nReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T02:56:33.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
