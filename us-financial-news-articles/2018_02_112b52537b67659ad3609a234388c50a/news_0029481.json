In 2012, they were the subject of a U.S. investigation into whether their equipment provided an opportunity for foreign espionage and threatened critical U.S. infrastructure - something they have consistently denied.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T18:41:27.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
