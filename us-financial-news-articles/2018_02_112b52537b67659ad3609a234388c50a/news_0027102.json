FIA European Principal Traders Association said it could not comment immediately.\nIn a related move on Monday, the Bank of England published a consultation paper on what it expects from firms it authorises regarding the management of risks from algorithmic trading.\n“It applies to all algorithmic trading activities of a firm, including in respect of unregulated financial instruments such as spot foreign exchange,” the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority said in a statement.\nAll firms should name a senior person who is responsible for algorithmic trading, and branches of foreign banks in Britain will have to show they are managing risks properly.\nThe PRA guidance will come into effect in June, and the regulator will publish a discussion paper on operational resilience in algorithmic trading later this year.
