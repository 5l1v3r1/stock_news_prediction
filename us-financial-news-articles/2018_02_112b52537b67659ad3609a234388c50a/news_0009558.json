He denies assaulting police officers and posted a link to a video of his detention which showed him trying to stay on his feet as several policemen dragged him to a nearby bus.\nReporting by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Jack Stubbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T14:30:38.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
