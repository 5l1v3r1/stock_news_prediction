Koenninger will be pioneering the CFO role for SOLE Financial, further staffing SOLE's executive team with financial services veterans. She will be responsible for mitigating risk to the company's continued growth, driving regulatory compliance and managing long-term financial strategy.\nKoenninger was a natural fit for the role, but in a corporate world where only 13 percent of CFOs are women , her promotion also marks a small step toward an important goal of equity in business. Inclusivity is a company value at SOLE that plays a key role in the hiring process.\nIn her position as VP of Finance, Koenninger was instrumental in positioning SOLE to become a highly valuable and profitable payroll card provider. Rick Holt , CEO, said of Koenninger's experience, \"Dawn's global perspective on how businesses operate, from startups to large corporations, combined with her Big 4 audit experience, and most of all, her unparalleled integrity, make her uniquely qualified to be SOLE's CFO. To capitalize on the value she brings in managing our company's financial health, especially in our current heavy growth phase, it was essential that we elevate her role.\"\nKoenninger brings with her 26 years of experience in accounting and finance, 14 of which have been with SOLE, after holding positions as Controller and Senior Auditor for various international ATM network companies and a \"Big 4\" accounting firm. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from Portland State University.\nAbout SOLE: SOLE® Financial advances financial inclusion by providing unbanked workers instant and affordable access to their hard-earned pay while helping companies go paperless. The SOLE Visa® Payroll Card eliminates the expensive logistical burden of paper checks and bridges the gap for clients striving to reach 100 percent direct deposit. SOLE celebrates clients who achieve paperless pay by planting a grove of trees in their name through the SOLE Paperless Trees Project .\nMedia Contact:\nTaylor Ellsworth\nPhone: 971.227.5364\nEmail: taylor.ellsworth@solepaycard.com\nRelated Links\nSOLE Financial\nSOLE Team\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growing-rapidly-sole-financial-promotes-dawn-koenninger-to-cfo-300591762.html\nSOURCE SOLE Financial", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-holt-3270b2a/", "https://www.solepaycard.com/paperlesstrees", "https://www.solepaycard.com/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-koenninger-87ab4263/", "https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/women-and-minorities-increasingly-attain-cfo-position", "https://www.solepaycard.com/company", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growing-rapidly-sole-financial-promotes-dawn-koenninger-to-cfo-300591762.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:30:16.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
