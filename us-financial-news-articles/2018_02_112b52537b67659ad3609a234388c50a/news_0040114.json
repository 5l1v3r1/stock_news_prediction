Its shares rose as much as 12.9 percent.\nThe Australian financial index was the top contributor to benchmark gains, led by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, which climbed as much as 1.2 percent.\nThe financial index’s top gainer, NIB Holding Ltd, rose the most in close to 2-1/2 months.\nMoving in the other direction, energy stocks accounted for Monday’s biggest losing sector as the sector index fell by the most in 10 days.\nMaterials stocks also fell sharply with mining major BHP losing as much as 2.1 percent.\nRival Rio Tinto lost as much as 1.1 after giving up intra-day gains which had seen it touch its highest since July, 2011.\nAcross the Tasman Sea, New Zealand trade was marked by falls in consumer discretionary and health care stocks.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index slipped 0.1 percent, or 9.56 points, to 8,115.75.\nFisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Ltd fell 1.4 percent while Skycity Entertainment Group Ltd traded 1.7 percent lower.
