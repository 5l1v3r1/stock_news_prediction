I know my boys are tougher, so I‘m just going, like, ‘I hope it’s cold’.” \nDouble Olympic champion Ted Ligety told a news conference: “It’s fine skiing when it’s cold, it’s just you gotta keep your boots warm I guess... You’ve got to tape your face in the speed events, I think, probably.” \nAmerican hopes in the Alpine skiing events are riding mainly on Ligety for the men, and Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin for the women. \nRearick said the team was taking no chances with health and hygiene in the run-up to competition after organisers moved to combat a norovirus outbreak among private security staff. \n“We’re disinfecting rooms, hand sanitiser everywhere, making sure hydration’s taken care of, and as soon as someone’s sick, isolate them and quarantine them, basically,” he said. \n”Here at the Games we don’t stay in the (athletes’) village, we stay in our own compound where we have our own chefs and our own food. \n“One part of that is to try to keep the home feeling. We cook American food that the guys like, that’s also healthy -- and then controlling the environment, where we try to minimise our exposure (to illness).” Reporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T09:15:33.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
