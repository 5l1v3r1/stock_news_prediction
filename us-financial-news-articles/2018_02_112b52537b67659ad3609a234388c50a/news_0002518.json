Medical costs for the company’s corporate customers rose more slowly than anticipated - less than 3 percent in 2017 - but are still “unsustainable,” he said. \nAmazon’s announcement raised the prospect of changes to the traditional U.S. healthcare system in which companies like Cigna manage benefits for employers. Cordani said Cigna and others could do more to meet corporate demands, particularly around transparency of healthcare costs. \n“We should not view that an industry with stable medical cost trend at 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent is sustainable,” he said. \nThe company focuses on large and medium-sized corporate companies while also selling international insurance and government-backed Medicare plans. EARNINGS TO RISE ON TAXES \nCigna forecast 2018 earnings at $12.40 to $12.90 per share, excluding special items, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $12.20, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nChanges to U.S. tax laws under Republican President Donald Trump will increase profitability, the company said. \nCigna expects revenue to grow 7 percent to 8 percent this year. \nNet income fell to $266 million, or $1.07 per share, in the fourth quarter from $382 million, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding items, Cigna earned $1.94 per share, beating the analysts’ estimate of $1.89.
