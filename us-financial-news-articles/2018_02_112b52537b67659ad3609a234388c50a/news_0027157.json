Smith each added 15. Hill had 12 and Nance chipped in five to help the Cavs to a second straight win.\nIrving led the Celtics with 18 points and five assists. Marcus Morris was the only other player in double figures with 17 for Boston, which dropped its second straight.\nJames’ fadeaway with 8:07 remaining in the first half tied things at 40 after Boston led for much of the first quarter.\nCleveland proceeded to close out the quarter on a 24-12 run to go up 64-52 at halftime and outscored the hosts 31-22 in the third.\nThe Cavs led by as many as 29 in the fourth.\nJames gave Cavs fans a scare when he left the game after suffering an apparent right leg injury late in the first quarter. He barreled into Boston’s Aron Baynes driving to the basket and was called for the charge before limping to the sidelines.\nAfter being treated on the Cavs’ bench, James checked back into the game with 8:58 left before the break.\nFollowing the game, the Celtics held a ceremony to retire Pierce’s number. The 10-time NBA All-Star played 15 seasons in Boston, winning the one Finals series and playing in another in 2010.\nCleveland caps a three-game road trip Tuesday in Oklahoma City. Boston will try to regroup Wednesday night against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:44:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
