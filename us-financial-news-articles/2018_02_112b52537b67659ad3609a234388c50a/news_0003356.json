(NASDAQ: CDNS) today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017.\nCadence reported 2017 revenue of $1.943 billion, compared to revenue of $1.816 billion for 2016. On a GAAP basis, Cadence recognized net income of $204 million, or $0.73 per share on a diluted basis, in 2017, compared to net income of $203 million, or $0.70 per share on a diluted basis for 2016. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $502 million, compared to revenue of $469 million reported for the same period in 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $14 million, or $(0.05) per share on a diluted basis, compared to net income of $38 million, or $0.14 per share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2016.\nDue to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $67 million income tax expense on a provisional basis for a one time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings and a $25 million income tax expense on a provisional basis for the reduction in the value of Cadence’s U.S. deferred tax assets caused by the U.S. corporate tax rate reduction. These provisional amounts may change as Cadence continues to evaluate the impact of the Tax Act.\nUsing the non-GAAP measure defined below, net income for 2017 was $393 million, or $1.40 per share on a diluted basis, as compared to non-GAAP net income of $351 million, or $1.21 per share on a diluted basis for 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, non-GAAP net income was $111 million, or $0.39 per share on a diluted basis, as compared to net income of $95 million, or $0.34 per share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2016.\n“Through the execution of our System Design Enablement Strategy and our innovative solutions, Cadence delivered strong performance for our shareholders,” said Lip-Bu Tan, chief executive officer. “The Data-Driven Economy is emerging as the new paradigm and has key underlying technology waves including mobile, cloud/datacenter, edge computing and automotive. We are confident that we are well positioned to provide enablement solutions to fuel and ride with these technology waves.”\n“Cadence continues to capitalize on the growth opportunities presented by the new trends. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we met or exceeded our key operating metrics and delivered strong financial results for the fiscal year,” said John Wall, senior vice president and chief financial officer. “We are excited about the opportunities we see to drive top line growth in 2018. We also expect to continue to deliver shareholder value by repurchasing approximately $50 million of Cadence common stock per quarter through 2018.”\nCFO Commentary\nCommentary on the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results by John Wall, senior vice president and chief financial officer, is available at www.cadence.com/cadence/investor_relations .\nBusiness Outlook\nThe outlook provided below is on an ASC Topic 606 basis, which Cadence is adopting for its fiscal year 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. As required by the new standard, the company will report revenue under both methods for the 2018 transition year. We expect the difference between revenue under the new and old standard to gradually decline over time and be de minimis within two years.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the company expects total revenue in the range of $500 million to $510 million. First quarter GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.22. Net income per diluted share using the non-GAAP measure defined below is expected to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.38.\nFor 2018, the company expects total revenue in the range of $2.015 billion to $2.055 billion. On a GAAP basis, net income per diluted share for 2018 is expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.90. Using the non-GAAP measure defined below, net income per diluted share for 2018 is expected to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60.\nFor 2018, the company is forecasting a non-GAAP income tax rate of 16 percent, down from 23 percent used in fiscal 2017, primarily resulting from the tax rate reduction.\nFor comparison purposes, the company expects the outlook for 2018 on the prior ASC Topic 605 basis to be as follows: revenue in the range of $2.055 billion to $2.095 billion, GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.93 to $1.03 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $1.62 to $1.72.\nA schedule showing a reconciliation of the business outlook from GAAP net income and diluted net income per share to non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share is included in this release.\nAudio Webcast Scheduled\nLip-Bu Tan, chief executive officer, and John Wall, senior vice president and chief financial officer, will host the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results audio webcast today, January 31, 2018, at 2 p.m. (Pacific) / 5 p.m. (Eastern).

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside Cadence’s control, including, among others: (i) Cadence’s ability to compete successfully in the electronic design automation product and the commercial electronic design and methodology services industries; (ii) the success of Cadence’s efforts to improve operational efficiency and growth; (iii) the mix of products and services sold and the timing of significant orders for Cadence’s products; (iv) change in customer demands, including those resulting from consolidation among Cadence’s customers and the possibility that the restructurings and other efforts to improve operational efficiency of Cadence’s customers could result in delays in purchases of Cadence’s products and services; (v) economic and industry conditions in regions in which Cadence does business; (vi) fluctuations in rates of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of other countries in which Cadence does business; (vii) capital expenditure requirements, legislative or regulatory requirements, changes in tax laws, interest rates and Cadence’s ability to access capital and debt markets; (viii) the acquisition of other companies or technologies or the failure to successfully integrate and operate these companies or technologies Cadence acquires, including the potential inability to retain customers, key employees or vendors; (ix) the effects of Cadence’s efforts to improve operational efficiency in its business, including strategic, customer and supplier relationships, and its ability to retain key employees; (x) events that affect cash flow, liquidity, reserves or settlement assumptions Cadence may take from time to time with respect to accounts receivable, taxes and tax examinations, litigation or other matters; and (xi) the effects of any litigation or other proceedings to which Cadence is or may become a party.

Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures contained within this press release with their most directly comparable GAAP financial results. Investors are also encouraged to look at the GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance.\nTo supplement Cadence’s financial results presented on a GAAP basis, Cadence management uses non-GAAP measures that it believes are helpful in understanding Cadence’s performance. One such measure is non-GAAP net income, which is a financial measure not calculated under GAAP. Non-GAAP net income is calculated by Cadence management by taking GAAP net income and excluding, as applicable, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration-related costs including retention expenses, investment gains or losses, income or expenses related to Cadence’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan, restructuring and other significant items not directly related to Cadence’s core business operations, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments.\nCadence management uses non-GAAP net income because it excludes items that are generally not directly related to the performance of Cadence’s core business operations and therefore provides supplemental information to Cadence management and investors regarding the performance of the business operations, facilitates comparisons to the historical operating results and allows the review of Cadence's business from the same perspective as Cadence management, including forecasting and budgeting.\nCadence's non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 excludes the effect of the transition tax expense and income tax expense related to the reduction in value of the deferred tax assets caused by the U.S. corporate tax rate reduction. Cadence management believes it is useful to exclude these tax expenses since it does not expect these tax expenses to be recorded frequently.\nThe following tables reconcile the specific items excluded from GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share in the calculation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the periods shown below:\nNet Income (Loss) Reconciliation Three Months Ended December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (unaudited) (in thousands) Net income (loss) on a GAAP basis $ (14,442 ) $ 38,477 Amortization of acquired intangibles 13,741 14,474 Stock-based compensation expense 36,015 29,231 Non-qualified deferred compensation expenses 1,295 544 Restructuring and other charges 12,178 26,342 Acquisition and integration-related costs 5,712 1,433 Other income or expense related to investments and non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets* (1,368 ) (655 ) Income tax related to transition tax 67,188 — Income tax related to tax rate change 25,292 — Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (34,328 ) (14,672 ) Net income on a non-GAAP basis $ 111,283 $ 95,174 * Includes, as applicable, equity in losses or income from investments, write-down of investments, gains or losses on sale of investments and gains or losses on non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets recorded in other income or expense.
