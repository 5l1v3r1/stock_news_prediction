The plans to sell Bunge's sugar milling business were not dependent on keeping the company's global sugar trading operations, he said. \n\"We simply decided that it was time to really focus on what's core to us, which is agribusiness, foods, grains and oilseeds and get on with it in a good way,\" he said.
