The Soviet satellite state served as a buffer between China and the Soviet Union until 1990, when it peacefully transitioned to democracy. \nRapid economic growth, driven by immense resource wealth, has prompted interest from foreign nationals. Though foreigners now make up less than 0.4 percent of the population, Ulaanbaatar has used high fees and quotas to rein in immigration. \nLast year, Mongolia cut its foreign workforce in half, and sent home about 1,200 North Korean workers to comply with the sanctions. \nThe Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine, run by mining conglomerate Rio Tinto, has also been under scrutiny for its use of Chinese labourers. \nAbout 93 percent of the Oyu Tolgoi workforce is Mongolian, exceeding a lower limit of 90 percent set in a 2009 investment pact. During construction, no more than 40 percent of workers could come from overseas. \nAfter an inspection of Oyu Tolgoi last month, immigration officials deported foreign contractors with Australian engineering firm Hofmann Engineering for visa violations. \nWith just 3.1 million people in an area almost the size of Alaska, Mongolia is the world’s least densely populated country. \nMany Mongolians are leaving home for work and education elsewhere, including China, and South Korea has eased their pathway to jobs. \n“More Mongolians are leaving to work abroad, which means fewer people in the local labour pool,” said Bontoi. \n“Mongolia capping foreign labour seems very paradoxical.” Reporting by Terrence EdwardsEditing by David Stanway andClarence Fernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T08:36:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
