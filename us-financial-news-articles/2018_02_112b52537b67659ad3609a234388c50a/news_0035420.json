Third-party sellers are required to comply with all relevant laws and regulations when listing items for sale on Amazon,” the company said. \nReporting by Susan Heavey and Makini Brice; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T21:45:59.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
