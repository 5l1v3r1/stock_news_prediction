But there's still underlying strength in this market,\" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC.\nWall Street's three major indexes logged their biggest weekly losses in two years on Friday after a strong payrolls report.

Motiva Enterprises LLC, the largest U.S. refinery, started a planned one-month overhaul on Monday of its key crude processing unit at its 603,000 barrel-per-day facility in Port Arthur, Texas.\n\"Naturally, you get (crude) builds on refinery maintenance, but demand is starting to pick up a bit,\" said John Macaluso, analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors.\nAdding to the pressure on oil, which hit its highest in nearly three years two weeks ago, has been rising U.S. crude production, which could threaten the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' effort to support prices.\nU.S. government data last week showed output climbed above 10 million barrels per day in November for the first time since 1970.\nU.S. energy companies added oil rigs for a second week in a row last week. <RIG-OL-USA-BHI>\n(Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London and Aaron Sheldrick in Tokyo; Editing by Chris Reese)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T00:28:59.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
