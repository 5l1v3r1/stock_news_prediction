The inquiry came in August after the bank was accused of massive breaches of money-laundering rules.\nReporting By Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:57:22.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
