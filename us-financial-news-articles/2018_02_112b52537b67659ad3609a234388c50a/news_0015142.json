Manulife reports fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.\nChief Executive Officer Roy Gori told Reuters in November that Manulife was “looking at all options” for John Hancock. There has been speculation in recent years that the business could be sold.\nNorth American insurance companies have been evaluating their businesses as they attempt to bolster earnings at a time when global interest rates have been at historical lows, with life insurance and annuity operations in particular focus. Some have spun off their life insurance operations into separate units, as MetLife ( MET.N ) did with Brighthouse Financial ( BHF.O ) last year, while a number of companies have sold off blocks of assets, in particular annuities, to private investors that aim to boost returns through cost cutting. Manulife acquired Boston-based John Hancock, one of the biggest life insurers in the United States, for C$15 billion ($12 billion) in 2004 in a deal that doubled the size of the Canadian insurer.\nHowever, it has in recent years made the high-growth Asia market a priority, and last year picked Gori, head of its Asian unit, to lead Manulife. After his appointment, Gori said Manulife has capital tied up in the United States that could be better used.\nRBC analyst Darko Mihelic last year estimated the book value of Manulife’s U.S. legacy businesses, including its long-term care policies, to be C$12.5 billion.\nInstead of seeking a whole-business solution for John Hancock, Manulife plans to start offloading blocks of business in the next few months that it regards as unattractive from a returns perspective, according to the sources.\nThese blocks, which stem both from John Hancock and Manulife’s legacy U.S. operations, are currently being organized internally and would likely include its variable annuity business and parts of its life insurance operations, the people said.\nIts asset management operations would not be part of the sales process, they added.\nManulife would also like to offload its U.S. long-term care unit, but it would be challenging to find a willing buyer for the business, the people said, even if it was offered at a substantial discount to book value.\nLong-term care is considered one of the most difficult parts of the insurance market, as providers struggle to meet the escalating expense of backing policies due to rising healthcare costs and life expectancy.\nAdditional reporting by Matt Scuffham; editing by Denny Thomas and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:13:48.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
