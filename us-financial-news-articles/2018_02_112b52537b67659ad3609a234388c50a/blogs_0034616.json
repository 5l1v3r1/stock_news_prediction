CNBC.com Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump responds to a reporter's question on domestic violence following a working session regarding opportunity zones following the recently signed tax bill in the Oval Office of the White House on February 14, 20218 in Washington, DC. \nPresident Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday that he is \"totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind.\" \nThe president made the statement as the White House continues to deal with a scandal involving former top aide Rob Porter, whose ex-wives have accused him of domestic violence. \n\"I am totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind. Everyone knows that,\" Trump said Wednesday after reporters pressed him on whether he believed the women's accusations. \nIt marked the first time Trump directly addressed the notion of domestic violence during the Porter imbroglio, which has thrust the White House into chaos over the past week. On Friday, Trump defended Porter , stressing that the former staff secretary has claimed he is innocent of the claims. \n\"We wish him well,\" Trump said of Porter last week. \"I think you also have to remember that. He said very strongly yesterday he's innocent.\" \nPorter wasn't the only former White House aide to quit over domestic abuse allegations last week. Speechwriter David Sorensen resigned Friday after The Washington Post reported that Sorensen's ex-wife accused him of emotional and physical abuse . Sorensen, in turn, denied the allegations and said his former wife actually victimized him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:56:47.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
