He was elected to the national assembly in 2014 as the only federal deputy for the National Restoration Party (PRN) formed by Christians from another party. \nLate on Sunday, the PRN appeared to have massively increased its presence in the national assembly to 14 seats. The party opposes the progressive policies of President Luis Guillermo Solis, such as same-sex marriage, in vitro fertilization and sex education in schools. \n“There’s nothing more progressive than defending life and family,” Alvarado Munoz said on Sunday. \nWell known as a television news anchor before he turned more seriously to religion and politics, Alvarado Munoz shot to prominence during the campaign after denouncing a ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights calling on Costa Rica to give civil marriage rights to same-sex couples. \n“All the vestiges of gender ideology will be eliminated from public policy in Costa Rica,” he said in his government plan. \nDuring the campaign, a video was released of his wife apparently “speaking in tongues”, a phenomenon that evangelicals say allows them to communicate in a divine language. DRAMATIKA \nHis rival Alvarado Quesada, 38, backs the court’s decision on same-sex couples. Even though Costa Rica’s 3.3 million voters mostly describe themselves as conservative, he appears to have benefited by energizing voters worried by the strident tone of the campaign. \nThe former Procter & Gamble employee also tried to connect with young voters, highlighting his university rock band Dramatika and career as a fiction writer. He has a masters degree from Britain’s Sussex University, and his last novel was titled “Brighton Season”. \n“The Costa Rica of the 21st century needs a government that knows how to advance with strength, love and happiness, the agenda of equality,” Alvarado Quesada said in a speech on Sunday evening. He won 21.6 percent of the vote in the first round. \nThe two Alvarados will now fight for the votes of third place Antonio Alvarez Desanti, who accepted defeat on Sunday evening with 18.8 percent of the vote, and the 10 other candidates from the first round. \nNo matter who wins, the next president will have to work with other parties in Congress to get legislation passed.
