Ro-Ro - are all expected to hold initial public offerings (IPO) in May, two sources familiar with the matter said.\nThe listings mark a second wave of flotations this year, the sources said, as Turkish companies take advantage of stock prices at record levels and robust international demand for Turkish listings.\nAlready this year Turkey has seen IPOs from energy firm Enerjisa Enerji, private hospital MLP Saglik Hizmetler and port operator Trabzon Port.\n“Sok’s public offering will be large. They are sounding out investors and demand for Sok is quite good,” said one of the sources, declining to be identified because the information is not yet public.\nSok’s IPO might be in the range of $700 million to $1 billion, with 35-40 percent of the firm listed on the stock exchange, the source said.\nDeFacto plans to list 30-40 percent and might reap around $300 million, the source said, adding that Beymen and U.N. Ro-Ro were also looking to list in May.\nA second source said the prospectuses for all four IPO would be released soon.\n“There will be large public offerings in May,” the second source said.\nSok declined to comment.\nA DeFacto representative said it had not made a decision on a listing, nor an official application for a listing. Beymen and U.N. Ro-Ro were not immediately available for comment.
