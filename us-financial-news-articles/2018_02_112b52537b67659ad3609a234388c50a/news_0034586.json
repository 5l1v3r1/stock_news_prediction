Typically, the Secretary-General has already informally consulted with council members before sending official notification.\nGriffiths, currently executive director of the European Institute of Peace, will replace Ould Cheikh Ahmed, who the United Nations said would step down after three years in the job when his current contract finishes this month.\nA Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervened in Yemenâ€™s civil war in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels. Yemen, which relies heavily on imports for food, is on the brink of famine and nearly 1 million people have been infected with cholera.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T06:11:33.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
