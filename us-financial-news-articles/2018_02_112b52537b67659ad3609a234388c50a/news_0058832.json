Fifteen seconds later, Allen answered with two foul shots.\nVirginia Tech’s Chris Clarke scored twice in a row to trim Duke’s lead to 63-62 with less than a minute to play.\nFollowing a Duke turnover, Clarke missed a layup in transition. But Duke’s Trevon Duval missed the front end of a 1-and-1, setting up the final sequence and Clarke’s game-winner.\nAfter a hot start, in which he scored 11 points in the first seven minutes, Allen went about 18 minutes without scoring before his three-pointer gave Duke a 44-35 edge.\nThe Hokies pulled within 46-45 on Robinson’s three-point play. But after a pair of Bagley free throws, Duke was up 60-51 with less than six minutes to play.\nDuke led 33-27 at halftime despite shooting 34.4 percent from the field and committing seven turnovers.\nAfter Duke went up by 15, Virginia Tech scored the next 11 points.
