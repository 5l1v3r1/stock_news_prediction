Competitor Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) reached a multi-billion-dollar U.S. settlement after admitting installing so-called “defeat devices” on its diesel models designed to game emissions tests. VW has been roiled by the “Dieselgate” emissions scandal, which has forced it to set aside 25.8 billion euros ($31.7 billion) to cover fines and related costs, of which it has paid out nearly 20 billion euros. BMW said the models affected were 5- and 7-Series cars made between 2012 and 2017 containing high-performance diesel engines and three turbo chargers. BMW did not say where the cars were but said it would cooperate with the relevant authorities on further steps.
