It was originally scheduled for 2013, then early 2016, then later in 2016, then 2017… and so on. \nSpaceX delayed it by a few more hours on Tuesday due to heavy winds. But then it took off, and two of its three boosters landed back on Earth. This was the first successful re-landing of multiple rocket cores in history. \nCustomers lined up to use the Falcon Heavy system include Arabsat, Inmarsat and Viasat. And then, of course, there’s Mars—SpaceX wants the Falcon Heavy to be the foundation for its Martian colonization plans.
