Everybody knows it's like touching the third rail,\" said Cashin, UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange. \"The assumption is once they do it, all hell will break loose. So we'll wait and see.\"\nAs of early Thursday, the 10-year yield was slightly lower , around 2.91 percent, down from Wednesday's four-year high of 2.95 percent. Wall Street fears returned Wednesday afternoon after minutes from the Federal Reserve 's latest meeting sent bond yields rising and stocks into a tailspin. The last time the 10-year yield traded above 3 percent was in January 2014.\n\"Initially, yields moved down, stocks rallied like crazy,\" Cashin recalled about Wednesday, moments after the Fed minutes were released. \"Then about eight minutes into that move, stocks looked back and noticed bonds had changed their mind.\"\nThe sharp moves seen Wednesday were probably due to \"our friends, the long-lost 'bond vigilantes,'\" Cashin told \" Squawk on the Street .\"\nThe term \" bond vigilantes \" was coined by market historian Ed Yardeni during the 1980s, referring to traders who sell their holdings in an effort to enforce what they consider fiscal discipline. Selling bonds sends yields higher due to the inverse relationship between bond prices and bond yields.\n\"We're going to need a couple weeks to see if the bond vigilantes really are back or not,\" Cashin said. \"Or whether it was simply a fluke. But remembering what bond vigilantes look like, it certainly had fingerprints on them.\"\nU.S. stocks ended lower Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down nearly 167 points after rising more than 300 points earlier in the day.\nThe stock market had gotten off to a roaring start in January after rallying in 2017.\nBut stocks tanked in early February after a higher-than-expected wage number in January's jobs report sparked fears of inflation and rising rates. Equities on a closing basis eventually bottomed out Feb. 8, briefly plunging into 10 percent correction territory. The market had been up for six-straight sessions before declines Tuesday and Wednesday.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
