Detroit-based GM has said the factory in Gunsan will be closed by May and it is mulling the fate of its three remaining plants in South Korea.\nReporting by Christine Kim and Ju-min Park; Editing by Lincoln Feast\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T06:07:56.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
