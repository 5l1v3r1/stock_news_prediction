Exclusive behind-the-scenes-footage follows Elon Musk in the moments before the Falcon Heavy launch \nThe footage from Tuesday's launch was shot for the second season of National Geographic's show, \" Mars .\" \nThe video shows Musk running outside and gawking at the sky seconds after Falcon Heavy took off. \"Look at that! That's unreal!\" he says. It was a milestone because the successful launch makes the rocket the largest in operation today. \nMusk also shared two images of himself from the clip on Instagram. \nMusk wasn't alone in his excitement. Even his space race competitor, Jeff Bezos , expressed his enthusiasm. \nThe founder and CEO of Amazon and aeronautics company Blue Origin tweeted Musk congratulations after the launch.
