He also suffered some memory loss.\nHowever, Muss said the experience also changed him as an athlete.\n“I am stronger, I am fitter. I am more determined than ever,” he said. “I honestly think this accident made me who I am today and made me a better athlete.”\nMuss said people who work with him understand what he has been through, but it’s not something he talks about constantly with other snowboarders.\n“I want to be recognized as one of the best in my sport just for being one of the best in my sport, not because I overcame something,” he said.\nThere were times when he got depressed about his situation and felt like giving up on snowboarding. But he persevered and would like to help others going through the same problems.\n“Just having someone there to talk to can really make a world of difference and really change what can happen in your life,” Muss said.\n“I would like to be that person.”\nEditing by Darren Schuettler/Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:12:51.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
