(\"RSI\"), for up to $460,000,000 in aggregate principal amount (the \"Tender Cap\") of RSI's 6Â½% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 (CUSIP Nos. 74977X AB7 and U7501X AB9) (the \"RSI Notes\"), and the related solicitation of consents (the \"Consent Solicitation\") from the holders of the RSI Notes to amend the indenture governing the RSI Notes (the \"RSI Indenture\"). The Tender Offer expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on February 26, 2018 (the \"Expiration Date\"), and RSI Notes may no longer be tendered for purchase in the Tender Offer.\nOn February 12, 2018, RSI accepted for purchase, and paid for, $449,118,000 in aggregate principal amount of RSI Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 9, 2018 (the \"Consent Date\"). No additional RSI Notes were validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer after the Consent Date and prior to the Expiration Date. As a result, as previously announced, on February 28, 2018, RSI will redeem $10,882,000 in aggregate principal amount of RSI Notes not tendered and purchased in the Tender Offer at a \"make-whole\" redemption price of 105.061% of the principal amount of the RSI Notes being redeemed, as determined in accordance with the RSI Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. The aggregate principal amount of all RSI Notes purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer and redeemed pursuant to the \"make-whole\" redemption will equal the Tender Cap.\nOn February 26, 2018, RSI redeemed $115 million in aggregate principal amount of RSI Notes pursuant to the previously announced conditional partial redemption. As a result of the purchase of RSI Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer and the redemptions of the RSI Notes pursuant to the conditional partial redemption and the \"make-whole\" redemption, no RSI Notes will remain outstanding after February 28, 2018.\nRSI previously satisfied and discharged its obligations under the RSI Indenture by irrevocably depositing with the trustee for the RSI Notes funds sufficient to redeem the RSI Notes pursuant to the conditional partial redemption and the \"make-whole\" redemption and to pay related fees and expenses.\nThe Tender Offer and the Consent Solicitation were made solely pursuant to the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated January 29, 2018 and a related Letter of Transmittal and Consent (the \"Offer Documents\"), which more fully set forth the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer and the Consent Solicitation. D.F. King & Co, Inc. acted as the Tender Agent and Information Agent for the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as the Dealer Manager for the Tender Offer and the Solicitation Agent for the Consent Solicitation.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to purchase or solicitation of consents, an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to purchase or sell with respect to any securities.
