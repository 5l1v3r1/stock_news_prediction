Here’s a short guide to what to expect on Saturday.\nWHAT IS IT? Super-G is part-way between downhill and giant slalom - it involves more turns than the downhill but is steeper than GS, with the gates placed further apart. Downhill and super-G are known as the speed events, while GS and slalom are the technical disciplines. Like the downhill, the super-G is decided by the fastest time over a single run.\nWHEN IS IT?\nFeb 15, 2018; Pyeongchang, South Korea USA; Tina Weirather (LIE) competes in alpine skiing ladies giant slalom run 1 during the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympic Games at Yongpyong Alpine Centre. Mandatory Credit: Michael Madrid-USA TODAY Sports 11 a.m. local time on Saturday (0200 GMT, 9 p.m. ET Friday).\nWHO ARE THE FAVORITES?\nSlideshow (3 Images) Switzerland’s Lara Gut and Liechtenstein’s Tina Weirather are the top-ranked super-G skiers this season, although Gut’s Olympics got off to a shaky start when she lasted just 17 seconds before crashing out in the giant slalom on Thursday. Austria’s Anna Veith is the defending Olympic champion. This race should provide a first glimpse of American Lindsey Vonn in action at these Olympics, although her best chance is in the downhill next Wednesday. Another athlete in with a chance is Federica Brignone of Italy, who took bronze in the giant slalom.\nWHICH COUNTRIES TRADITIONALLY DOMINATE? Austria. If they win, it will be their fourth successive victory in women’s super-G, equaling their longest winning run in any Winter Olympic event.\nReporting by Mark Trevelyan, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T12:53:23.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
