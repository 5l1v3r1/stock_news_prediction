Analysts on average were expecting 3.7 percent, according to a company-supplied consensus.\nThat marks an improvement from 3 percent in the first half and 2.6 percent in the third quarter.\nReporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:11:41.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
