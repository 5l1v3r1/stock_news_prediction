Spain now has fibre penetration to households of 33.9 percent and France has 14.9 percent, compared with just 2.3 percent in Germany.\nTelefonica - which also offers services in Britain, Germany and throughout Latin America - trades at 10.9 times this year’s earnings compared to main rivals Deutsche Telekom at 14.9 times and Orange at 13.3 times.
