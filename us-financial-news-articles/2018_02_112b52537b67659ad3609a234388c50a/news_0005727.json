Built on land that was once a lake, it is also prone to flooding.\nGreater Miami and the Beaches has a high groundwater table and complex canal system, making it especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and tidal flooding.\nThe British port of Hull, meanwhile, has experienced extensive floods in recent years, with 90 percent of the small city standing below the high-tide line.\nMartin Shouler, CWRF project manager at Arup, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the new approach would explore the links between cities and the basins that furnish their natural water supply.\n“Our clients are beginning to understand ... that when it comes to water, you can’t think of a city in splendid isolation - it is part of its catchment,” he said. “Vice versa, the city then impacts on its catchment when its water discharges back into the ecosystem.”\nAs part of this wider view, the project will bring in different groups like farmers whose activities around a city affect its water supply, he added.\nAndrew Salkin of 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) noted that, of the more than 1,000 cities that had applied to join its network to help them tackle modern-day pressures, over 60 percent said water issues posed “critical resilience risks”.\nThe five working on the new water framework in 2018 - four of which belong to 100RC - will share lessons and expertise with “the many cities around the world grappling with water challenges”, he added.\nOther partners in the project include The Rockefeller Foundation, the World Bank, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Alliance for Global Water Adaptation.\nShouler said mapping water risks would help urban planners, city governments and other decision-makers come up with ways to prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from potential crises such as water shortages or floods.\nOnce cities have identified water-related challenges, they can set priorities, devise solutions and look for investors.\n“Once it becomes more obvious what those pathways to resilience might be ... it could well help attract money into this area,” said Shouler.\nReporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Alex Whiting.
