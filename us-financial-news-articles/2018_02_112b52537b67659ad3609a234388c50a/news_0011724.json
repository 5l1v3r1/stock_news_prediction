Job creation picked up as services firms remain positive about the outlook and business confidence was the highest since March 2017.\nInflation in the prices charged by firms eased to a four-month low but remained high. Input prices rose at their slowest pace since September 2016.\nEditing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T12:29:48.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
