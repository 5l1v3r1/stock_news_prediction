If we go into the lower part of the village, the company will sue us,” Saw Chit Wey Htoo, a villager, was Quote: d as telling CAT.\nFrank Momberg of the British conservation group Flora & Fauna International said his organization backed away from promoting the proposed parks three years ago, after consulting local organizations and the KNU.\n“We have changed our strategy to community based conservation,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email.\nReporting by Jared Ferrie.
