(\"ESSA\" or the \"Company\") (TSX-V: EPI, NASDAQ: EPIX), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies for the treatment of prostate cancer, today provided a corporate update and reported financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2017. All references to \"$\" in this release refer to United States dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\n\"The past several months have been transformational for ESSA,\" said President and CEO, David R. Parkinson. \"Most importantly, we began applying the learnings from the recently completed Phase 1 study of our first-generation N-terminal domain inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer, EPI-506, to the development of potentially more potent next-generation aniten compounds. In addition, the successful $26 million financings we closed in early 2018 will support preclinical and clinical development activities within our next-generation aniten program. We intend to identify a next-generation clinical candidate in 2018, and to initiate a clinical trial in the first half of 2019.\"\nCorporate Update\nInitiated multiple pre-clinical characterization studies in order to identify a potential future next-generation clinical candidate with greater potency and other enhanced pharmaceutical properties as compared to first-generation aniten N-terminal domain inhibitor compound, EPI-506. Previously completed Phase I clinical trial of EPI-506 for treatment of prostate cancer: Generally well-tolerated and caused transient falls in prostate-specific angiten (\"PSA\") in some patients who had progressed on current anti-androgens at highest dose levels administered PSA decreases not sufficiently large or long-lasting enough to suggest meaningful clinical benefit Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that EPI-506 was rapidly metabolized, resulting in a short half-life Completed $26 million financings to fund preclinical and clinical development within our next-generation aniten program Presented corporate overviews at multiple investment conferences: Rodman & Renshaw 19 th Annual Global Investment Conference Noble Capital Markets' NobleCon14\nSummary Financial Results\nNet Income (Loss) . ESSA recorded a net loss of $2.1 million ($0.07 loss per common share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net income of $1.5 million ($0.05 earnings per common share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\") expenditures. R&D expenditures for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $1.0 million (net of grants and gross), compared to a $1.0 million recovery net of grants ($3.1 million gross) for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, decreases in R&D expenditures were primarily related to decreases in manufacturing and clinical trial costs as the Company had concluded its Phase I clinical study of EPI-506, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, during which the Company continued its clinical development of EPI-506, which commenced in November 2015.\nGeneral and administration (\"G&A\") expenditures. G&A expenditures for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $1.0 million, compared to $1.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This decrease primarily reflects the reduction in administrative costs, as well as reduced share-based payments reflecting vesting of stock options granted in previous years.\nLiquidity and Outstanding Share Capital\nCash on hand at December 31, 2017, was $1.9 million, with a working capital deficiency of $1.6 million, reflecting the $2.7 million current portion of the Silicon Valley Bank term loan, for which repayment obligations commenced in January 2018. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company completed financings totaling $26 million in aggregate gross proceeds in January 2018.\nAs at December 31, 2017, the Company had 29,101,889 common shares issued and outstanding, 3,542,519 common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at a weighted-average exercise price of C$2.78 per common share and 6,992,710 common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.27 per common share.\nAbout ESSA Pharma Inc.\nESSA is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (\"CRPC\") in patients whose disease is progressing despite treatment with current therapies. ESSA believes that its proprietary compounds can significantly expand the interval of time in which patients suffering from CRPC can benefit from hormone-based therapies, by disrupting the androgen receptor (\"AR\") signaling pathway that drives prostate cancer growth and by preventing AR transcriptional activity by binding selectively to the N-terminal domain (\"NTD\") of the AR. A functional NTD is essential for transactivation of the AR. In preclinical studies, blocking the NTD has demonstrated the capability to overcome the known AR-dependent mechanisms of CRPC. ESSA was founded in 2009.\nAbout Prostate Cancer\nProstate cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and the fifth most common cause of male cancer death worldwide (Globocan, 2012). Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is dependent on androgen for tumor progression and depleting or blocking androgen action has been a mainstay of hormonal treatment for over six decades. Although tumors are often initially sensitive to medical or surgical therapies that decrease levels of testosterone, disease progression despite castrate levels of testosterone generally represents a transition to the lethal variant of the disease, metastatic CPRC (\"mCRPC\"), and most patients ultimately succumb to the illness. The treatment of mCRPC patients has evolved rapidly over the past five years. Despite these advances, additional treatment options are needed to improve clinical outcomes in patients, particularly those who fail existing treatments including abiraterone or enzalutamide, or those who have contraindications to receive those drugs. Over time, patients with mCRPC generally experience continued disease progression, worsening pain, leading to substantial morbidity and limited survival rates. In both in vitro and in vivo animal studies, ESSA's novel approach to blocking the androgen pathway has been shown to be effective in blocking tumor growth when current therapies are no longer effective.\nForward-Looking Statement Disclaimer\nThis release contains certain information which, as presented, constitutes \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and/or applicable Canadian securities laws.
