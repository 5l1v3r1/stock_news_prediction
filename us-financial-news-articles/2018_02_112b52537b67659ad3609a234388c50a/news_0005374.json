And Dombrovskis told a separate event in Dublin late on Wednesday this could be discussed given Britain’s wish to leave the single market. \n“Equivalence is applied to a third country with a regulatory and supervisory framework comparable with the EU and can be used as a tool,” Dombrovskis told a news conference in Dublin. \n“Another possibility, which is currently available is the establishment of presence in the EU27, that doesn’t mean letterbox companies.” \nEquivalence is a legal mechanism that allows countries from outside the bloc to access the single market of 440 million consumers in limited circumstances. \nBanks were already speaking to local authorities in connection with relocating within the single market, Dombrovskis said. \n“This is all that is currently available, but I cannot prejudge at this stage what the outcomes of the negotiations will be,” he added.
