(NASDAQ:ALDR), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of migraine, today provided a corporate update and reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“The data from eptinezumab’s Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials in episodic and chronic migraine patients support Alder’s goal to advance the treatment paradigm for migraine prevention. In both trials, eptinezumab’s clinical profile included rapid Day 1 reduction in migraine risk, high levels of efficacy with patients achieving 75% and 100% responder rates and sustained migraine relief for 3 months following a single infusion administration,” said Randall C. Schatzman, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Alder. “If approved, eptinezumab has the potential to provide a meaningful treatment option for millions of migraine sufferers. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2018 and into 2019, we are focused on our BLA submission, gaining FDA approval and on our commercial readiness activities ahead of eptinezumab’s launch. Our 2017 year-end cash balances, together with the net proceeds of our two successful 2018 financings, total over $600 million, leaving us well-positioned to meet our projected operating requirements into 2020.”\nRecent 2018 Company Highlights\nPROMISE 2 Phase 3 eptinezumab top-line data in chronic migraine patients: Met the primary endpoint with very high statistical significance vs. placebo (p<0.0001) for both dose levels tested in the trial following the first quarterly infusion. Met all key secondary endpoints with very high statistical significance vs. placebo including prevention beginning Day One (p<0.0001) and 50 percent (p<0.0001) and 75 percent (p<0.0001) responder rates month one through month three. Furthermore, an average of 15 percent of eptinezumab patients had no migraines (i.e., 100 percent response) for months one to three (p<0.0001 unadjusted). Safety and tolerability were similar to previously reported eptinezumab studies. European patent settlement and global license agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals International GmbH clears Alder’s freedom to develop, manufacture and commercialize eptinezumab in the U.S. and globally. Alder received approximately $97.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of convertible preferred stock in a committed equity financing with certain institutional and other accredited investors affiliated with or managed by Redmile Group LLC. Alder received approximately $277.7 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2025 (including approximately $36.3 million from the exercise of an over-allotment option granted to the underwriters in the offering).\nUpcoming Corporate Milestones\nPlanned 2018 Corporate Milestones for eptinezumab Timing PROMISE 1 12 month data (episodic migraine) 1H 2018 PROMISE 2 6 month data (chronic migraine) 1H 2018 12 month open label safety study 1H 2018 Pharmacokinetic comparability study 2H 2018 BLA submission 2H 2018 Key 2017 Company Highlights\nPROMISE 1 Phase 3 eptinezumab data in episodic migraine patients: Met the primary endpoint with highly statistically significant reductions in monthly migraine days in the trial following the first quarterly infusion. Significant clinical benefit achieved on Day One post-infusion (p=0.0087 unadjusted) and significant 50 percent (p=0.0001) and 75 percent (p=0.0007) responder rates month one through month three. Efficacy further improved following a second quarterly infusion; an average of 17% of patients had no migraines following the first administration and that rose to 26% of patients following the second administration. The safety profile was similar to placebo and consistent with previously reported eptinezumab studies. Alder completed a public offering of common stock on July 18, 2017 resulting in net proceeds to Alder of approximately $161.5 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Eptinezumab data presentations at top tier medical conferences highlighted Phase 2b (chronic migraine) and PROMISE 1 Phase 3 (episodic migraine) clinical data and analyses: Three scientific presentations at the 69th Annual American Academy of Neurology (AAN) April 22-28. Four scientific presentations at the 59th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Headache Society (AHS) June 8-11. Seven scientific presentations at the 18th Congress of the International Headache Society (IHC) September 7-10.\nFourth Quarter and Year-End 2017 Financial Results\nAs Alder had $286.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, compared to $340.9 million as of Sept. 30, 2017 and compared to $351.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 totaled $44.7 million, compared to $41.8 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, research and development expenses totaled $252.9 million, compared to $132.8 million for the full year 2016. The increases in spending for both periods were primarily due to manufacturing and clinical trial costs for the company’s eptinezumab program and commercialization preparations.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 totaled $10.3 million, compared to $7.4 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, general and administrative expenses totaled $38.1 million, compared to $26.1 million for the full year 2016. The increases in spending for both periods were primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense and salaries due to headcount growth, and an increase in professional fees and other administrative costs, primarily to support commercial readiness activities. Net loss for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 totaled $54.4 million, or $0.80 per share, compared to net loss of $48.9 million, or $0.97 per share on a fully-diluted basis, for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, net loss totaled $288.9 million, or $4.95 per share on a fully-diluted basis, compared to net loss of $156.3 million, or $3.23 per share, for the full year 2016.\nFinancial Outlook\nAlder estimates its available cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totaling $286.2 million as together with the net proceeds of approximately $97.7 million received in 2018 from the sale of shares of convertible preferred stock in its committed equity financing and approximately $277.7 million received in 2018 in its underwritten public offering of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2025 will be sufficient to meet projected operating requirements into 2020. These projections assume the BLA filing and approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the commercial launch of the infusion formulation of eptinezumab in this time period.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAlder will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss these financial results and recent corporate highlights.
