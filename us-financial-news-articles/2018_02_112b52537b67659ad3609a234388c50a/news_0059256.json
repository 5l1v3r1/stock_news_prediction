Most people applying for international protection in Poland are from the Russian republic of Chechnya, he said. Islam is the republic’s main religion.\n“Some foreign children do not learn despite attending school because they have educational gaps compared to their Polish peer and so struggle to catch up with school material,” said the proposal.\n“These factors may have a negative and demotivating effect not only on foreign children, who are reluctant to go to school, but also on Polish children,” it said.\nCritics say PiS has stoked popular hostility towards foreigners for electoral reasons ahead of local elections this year and a general election next year. The ruling party has 40 percent support, according to opinion polls.\nThe migrant issue is just one of several over which Poland is at odds with the European Union.\nThe government this month introduced a bill imposing jail terms of up to three years for anyone who says Poland was complicit in Nazi crimes. The government says the bill protects national honor but it has angered Israel and the United States.\nPolish newspaper Dziennik Gazeta Prawna called the school plan an “Educational ghetto for refugees” and Quote: d a leading educator Krystyna Starczewska who said the idea was horrific.\nThe Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights told Reuters in an email: “Separation of both groups can make integration difficult.”\nThe ministry said in a statement the proposal would be amended. Its aim: “is not to exclude the children of foreigners ... but only to provide support during the preparatory phase of education before children enter school.”\nThe Dziennik Gazeta Prawna headline is “absurd and unfair”, it said.\nEditing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:43:27.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
