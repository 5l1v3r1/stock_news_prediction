Miners use special software to solve math problems and are issued a certain number of bitcoins or cryptocurrenices in exchange.\nCrypto Jacker software allows users to clone popular websites and initiate spam campaigns.\nThe cybersecurity company said criminals also perpetrate mining fraud using botnets, collections of internet-connected devices, which may include PCs, servers, and mobile devices that are infected and controlled by a common type of malware. Users are often unaware a botnet has infected their system.\nBotnets were first used to mine bitcoin in 2014. The process was too complex to be financially viable, but botnets have made a comeback because newer cryptocurrencies like Monero are easier to “mine”, Digital Shadows said.\nThe company said botnets could be rented for $40. It said one such offering had “flown off the shelves” with almost 2,000 rentals so far.\nCybercriminals have also been drawn to the surging initial coin offering market, the report said. ICOs have raised roughly $5 billion for various startups and projects in 2017, according to data from Crunchbase. That is up exponentially from just $100 million in 2016.\nRather than selling scam tokens, criminals target legitimate currencies, either by stealing funds from ICOs or by manipulating prices through the type of “pump and dump” schemes often used with penny stocks and other less-liquid assets, the report said.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:54:19.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
