During several logging expeditions, a need emerged for temporary access ways to transport heavy equipment through wetlands. This prompted the design of construction mats, which led to the discovery and development of products and services in the energy industry. Today, Jones consists of 10 privately owned entities including construction mat leasing, pipeline pipe logistics, pipe traceability software, portable refrigerated storage equipment, paper and plastics recycling, mobile fuel management, as well as other products and services that support power line and pipeline companies.\nMedia Contact:\nKathy Hopper\n936.203.7980\nKathy.Hopper@JonesCompanies.com\nView original content with multimedia: releases/jones-lumber-acquires-lumber-mill-in-natchez-ms-300604379.html\nSOURCE Jones Lumber Company", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jones-lumber-acquires-lumber-mill-in-natchez-ms-300604379.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T19:40:28.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
