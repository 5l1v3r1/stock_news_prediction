He earned 81.66 points to finish third.\n“It was not the best but this is the advantage of a team event - it’s what we can each contribute,” Chan told reporters. “If anything, I think I was too eager on the jumps.”\nNathan Chen of the United States hung on to land his opening quad flip but went on to double his quad toeloop and make an uncharacteristic fall on his triple Axel, earning him 80.61 points.\nThe countries’ pairs for the team event are set to skate their short programmes later on Friday.
