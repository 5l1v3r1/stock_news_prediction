Sears lost $607 million during the same period in 2016. \nThe company also said it will record a noncash impairment charge \"related to the Sears trade name\" of between $50 million and $100 million. A year ago, that charge was $381 million. \nSears said the ongoing closure of unprofitable stores (under both the Sears and Kmart banners) has \"resulted in meaningful improvement\" in the department store chain's overall performance. The company said it's moving toward a \"less asset-intensive business model.\" \nShares were up more than 11 percent Thursday afternoon on the news. Sears' stock has tumbled more than 65 percent from a year ago, recently trading below $2, an all-time low.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T18:37:40.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
