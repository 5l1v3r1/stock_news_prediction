By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Company cautions that its assumptions may not materialize and that current economic conditions render such assumptions, although reasonable at the time they were made, subject to greater uncertainty. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “assumes,” “outlook,” “plans,” “targets,” or other similar words.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results or performance of the Company to be materially different from the outlook or any future results or performance implied by such statements. Accordingly, readers are advised not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that could affect the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the effects of general economic and business conditions; industry competition; inflation, currency and interest rate fluctuations; changes in fuel prices; legislative and/or regulatory developments; compliance with environmental laws and regulations; actions by regulators; increases in maintenance and operating costs; security threats; reliance on technology and related cybersecurity risk; trade restrictions or other changes to international trade arrangements; transportation of hazardous materials; various events which could disrupt operations, including natural events such as severe weather, droughts, fires, floods and earthquakes; climate change; labor negotiations and disruptions; environmental claims; uncertainties of investigations, proceedings or other types of claims and litigation; risks and liabilities arising from derailments; timing and completion of capital programs; and other risks detailed from time to time in reports filed by CN with securities regulators in Canada and the United States. Reference should be made to Management’s Discussion and Analysis in CN’s annual and interim reports, Annual Information Form and Form 40-F, filed with Canadian and U.S. securities regulators and available on CN’s website, for a description of major risk factors.\nForward-looking statements reflect information as of the date on which they are made. CN assumes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect future events, changes in circumstances, or changes in beliefs, unless required by applicable securities laws. In the event CN does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be made that CN will make additional updates with respect to that statement, related matters, or any other forward-looking statement.\nContacts: Media Investment Community Patrick Waldron Paul Butcher Senior Manager Vice-President Media Relations Investor Relations (514) 399-8803 (514) 399-0052\nSource:Canadian National Railway", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=K14zMVTyPLJEfKVNLvsQ4GGKi0blbU0QrKyU9GqOsDxup-neEoOTGiJguET2GfJRVqlFDY22q1EQUbXzwrHkDP983I6dm7mKsViHMRt5KpncFMdNknPKM1ZE-jCh2b9FdiU6fylwM0ddi9BCjbq45Q==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SfgHAo3dlsUbi3p8Fc3HPr8v5zDLIaZYWdShsGKTXR8EEcxuxIy3H1GMSF-LKNHmJdQ9MPGPL5XylD9ltA3VFjAf4iG1yUy0ngaszOHhyve2yqCcOU9gzB0PX_YdWu4K", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fdbCaCguxsjrbC0Ficq7VK_9FZgS8Fi2UK7Rghi42N4iiSHmAV-YpxZb4hKnp8FMmZYRj202nqHheJQU9Lpgj_qG3Yh_Rj3efkagGd28gvM=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ab3930c8-c447-4ba0-bba9-eb6477d86a5f"], "published": "2018-02-02T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T02:40:28.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
