I would like to think this case will be shelved and I can return home,” Gabriel told Catalan television in an interview from Geneva on Wednesday. \nThe Catalan independence drive has taken Spain to the brink of its worst political crisis since the transition to democracy in the mid-1970s and has prompted thousands of companies based in region to relocate to avoid potential fallout. [L8N1Q234K] \nThe Supreme Court has not issued an international arrest warrant but the state’s attorney has said it would adhere to the prosecutor’s call to internationally pursue her detention. \nA Swiss Federal Office of Justice spokesman said \nit would not grant extradition or legal assistance for any political offences, based on agreements between non-EU member Switzerland and Spain via the European Convention on Extradition, as well as the European Mutual Assistance Act, among other pacts governing cooperation. \nAdditional reporting by Carla Raffin; Writing by Paul Day, Editing by Angus |MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T15:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T15:30:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
