They’ve learned how to win and it’s tough to keep up,” he said.\n“As a Canadian that wants to win everything, it sucks. But I‘m a fan of the sport, it’s wonderful, so if other countries are getting to finals and winning, then it’s awesome.”\nAs a lover of the sport, and its values, Kennedy would certainly have enjoyed what panned out once he was on his way home.\nAmerican skip John Shuster had borne the brunt of the criticism for his team’s failures in 2010 and 2014 and was dropped from the team for a while, which made his moment in the spotlight all the sweeter.\nLocked at 5-5 against a Swedish team also seeking a first gold, Shuster played the shot of his life to score a rare five-pointer -- and what a time to do it in the eighth end of the Olympic final -- to spur the U.S. to an eventual 10-7 triumph.\nThe Americans were so happy they did not even mind when they were mistakenly awarded the women’s medals by mistake.\nOn the women’s side South Korea took “Team Kim”, with their members sharing the same surname, to their hearts as they steamrollered through qualifying, winning eight of nine games.\nHalf the country reportedly tuned in to watch the semi-final against Japan as Kim Eun-jung, worshipped for her inscrutable body language, threaded a superb extra-end last stone to clinch victory for the “Garlic Girls”, so named for the growing region they all hail from.\nThe final proved a step too far as the experienced Swedes made it three golds and a silver from the last three Games with a dominant 8-3 win -- a great performance alongside their men’s best-ever runners-up spot.\nKorea’s silver in their second Olympic appearance and Japan’s bronze in the women’s event marked the first time two Asian teams had medaled -- China’s women’s bronze in 2010 was the only previous Asian medal -- so Canada’s return to the top and Sweden’s continued success, with the next Games in Beijing, are by no means assured.\nAdditional reporting by Steve Keating, editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T06:30:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
