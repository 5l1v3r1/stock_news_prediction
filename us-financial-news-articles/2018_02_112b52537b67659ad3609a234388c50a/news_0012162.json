The Lebanese government says it passes through territory that belongs to Lebanon but which lies on the Israeli side of the Blue Line, where the U.N. demarcated Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000. \nThe three leaders met to study the recent “Israeli threats, and saw in them ... a direct threat to the stability” of the border region, the president’s office said in a statement. \nThey agreed to take measures “at various regional and international levels to prevent Israel from building the cement wall...and from the possibility of infringing on Lebanon’s oil and gas wealth and its (territorial) waters,” it said. \nLast week, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman called Lebanon’s first offshore oil and gas exploration tender “very provocative” and urged international firms not to participate. \nLebanon has an unresolved maritime border dispute with Israel over a triangular area of sea of around 860 sq km (330 square miles). The zone extends along the edge of three of five energy blocks that Lebanon put to tender early last year. \nLebanon in December approved a bid by a consortium of France’s Total TOTF.PA, Italy’s Eni ENI.MI and Russia’s Novatek NVTK.MM for two blocks.
