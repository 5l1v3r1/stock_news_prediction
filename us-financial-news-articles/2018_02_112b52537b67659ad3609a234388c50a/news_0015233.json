Congress could appropriate more money later. \nThe governor has asked Congress specifically for $46 billion for CDBG, a program overseen by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development often used to repair housing. \nHome damage in Puerto Rico, where the poverty rate is around 46 percent, was exacerbated by the existence of hundreds of thousands of sub-standard “informal” homes, which are typically built by the owners themselves, without permits and often in squatter communities. \nIt was unclear whether any of Wednesday’s disaster package could be used for home repair. \nIn his statement, Rossello said he was “grateful that Congressional leaders have finally headed [sic] our demands to provide badly needed emergency relief.” \nHe added, however, that the approved Medicaid funding would provide only a “period of stability.” \n“We look forward to working with Congress to find a sustainable long-term solution to” Puerto Rico’s healthcare crisis, Rossello said. \nThe $90 billion package covers a number of major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires.
