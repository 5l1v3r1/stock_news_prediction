Dozens of suspects in the crackdown agreed to hand over more than $100 billion of assets to the state in financial settlements of allegations against them, officials said.\nIbrahim, who could not be reached for comment, agreed to an undisclosed settlement after admitting to unspecified violations, according to senior Saudi officials. MBC said he had been found innocent of any wrongdoing in the probe and would keep control of MBC.\nIn its statement on Tuesday, the sports authority did not mention MBC, and MBC could not immediately be reached for comment.\nSaudi Telecom’s memorandum of understanding covers exclusive rights to broadcast matches of Saudi Arabia’s Professional Football League and the national team, as well as sponsorship rights, the authority said.\nDuring the two-month period of the memorandum, a detailed agreement will be negotiated, it added. Saudi Telecom currently offers access to television channels and movies over its broadband network.\nThe government is keen to develop the sports industry as part of reforms to diversify the economy beyond oil exports, and the authority said its deal was in line with that drive.\nLast year Jadwa Investment, a top local investment bank, was appointed to advise on the planned privatisation of as many as five soccer clubs in the Saudi Professional League. The Saudi Telecom deal may be a step towards privatisation deals, but the authority did not mention the issue.
