Greek Cypriots live in its south and Turkish Cypriots in the north.\nNatural gas discoveries by Egypt and Israel in areas not far from Cyprus have given sharper focus to the island’s standoff.\nThe discoveries could either add impetus to a deal on Cyprus, or impede resolving a complex conflict on power-sharing and boundaries that concern tens of thousands of internally displaced people on either side of the divide.\nAnastasiades said his government had prepared legislation to create a sovereign hydrocarbons fund. In previous consultations, the two sides had also agreed on how potential revenue would be distributed, he said.\nEni and France’s Total reported in early February a promising natural gas field south of Cyprus, which they said looked geologically similar to the mammoth Zohr field off Egypt.\nWriting By Michele Kambas, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:32:16.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
