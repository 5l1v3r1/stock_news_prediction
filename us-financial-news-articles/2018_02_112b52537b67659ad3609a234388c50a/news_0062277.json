Riley FBR in Boston.\n“I surely think the current Fed would let some inflationary pressure run hotter than their target for a period without getting more aggressive.”\nThe Fed said on Friday it expected economic growth to remain steady and saw no serious risks on the horizon that might pause its planned pace of rate hikes.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yields eased to 2.8405 percent , slipping from the four-year high it hit last week, while the CBOE Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was last at 16.65.\nAt 11:08 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 218.13 points, or 0.86 percent, at 25,528.12, boosted by gains in 3M and Boeing.\nThe S&P 500 was up 14.73 points, or 0.54 percent, at 2,762.03 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 42.07 points, or 0.57 percent, at 7,379.46.\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.81 percent gain in the technology index.\nApple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet were up between 0.7 percent and 1.5 percent.\nBerkshire Hathaway rose 2.66 percent after Warren Buffett said his conglomerate, which is sitting on $116 billion of cash, is “more inclined” to repurchase stock than pay dividends as a means to use excess cash.\nQualcomm shares rose 3.2 percent after the chipmaker urged Broadcom to enter into price negotiations on its $117 billion offer for the company. Broadcom was down about 0.7 percent.\nGE dipped more than 2 percent after the industrial conglomerate nominated three new candidates to its board.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,557 to 1,219. On the Nasdaq, 1,477 issues rose and 1,286 fell.
