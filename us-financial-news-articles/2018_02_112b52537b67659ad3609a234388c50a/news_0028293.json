The result beat a A$475 million average estimate of four analysts polled by Reuters.\nMargins for the first half were significantly higher than a year earlier at 17.3 percent, up from 13.5 percent in the first half of the previous fiscal year, prompting it to raise its guidance for the full year to 15.5 percent to 17.5 percent.\nIt expected “low single-digit growth” in gross premiums for the full year.\nIAG shares posted their biggest intraday gain in six years shortly after the results release, before paring some of those gains. By early afternoon they were 2.8 percent higher at A$7.4, amid broader market falls.\nIAG, which has a strategic partnership with U.S. investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, increased dividends by one cent to 14 Australian cents per share, and said it was in a flexible position to consider capital initiatives in the future.\nGross written premiums rose about 1 percent for the half-year, helped by rate increases.\nIAG, which specialises in motor and property insurance, said last year it would share 12.5 percent of its premiums and costs with Munich Re, Swiss Re and Hannover Re , to help release capital.\nShares of IAG fell sharply in August after it reported weaker margins due to disaster claims, but have since been gaining steadily to scale a record peak this month.
