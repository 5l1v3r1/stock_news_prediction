It says it has other investors on its side.\nThe appointment of Kurumatani, effective from April, comes as Toshiba seeks to recover from the worst year of its 142-year history.\nAlso helped by the sale of claims against now-bankrupt unit Westinghouse Electric Co LLC to a group of hedge funds, Toshiba predicted record net profit of 520 billion yen ($4.9 billion) for the financial year ending March.\nThat is up from a prior forecast of a 110 billion yen loss and much higher than a consensus estimate of a 188 billion yen profit.\nThe return to profit, combined with an additional 600 billion yen gained from the issue of new shares to overseas funds, will help Toshiba avoid falling into negative net worth for a second consecutive year, allowing it to remain a listed company.\nThe share issue has helped ease pressure to complete the sale of the chip unit by the end of March - a deadline it is widely viewed as unlikely to meet due to regulatory reviews in China.\nIf it doesn’t complete the deal by then, it has the option of walking away, sources have said.\nThe chip unit, the subject of a long and hotly contested auction before the Bain-led consortium was finally chosen, has seen earnings surge on booming demand for semiconductors.\nThe unit is expected to book an annual operating profit of around 450 billion yen. By contrast, without earnings from the chip unit, Toshiba is expected to post zero operating profit.\n($1 = 107.32 yen)\nReporting by Makiko YamazakiEditing by Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T05:23:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
