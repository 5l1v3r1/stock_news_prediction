Choksi’s firm, Gitanjali Gems, has also denied involvement in the alleged fraud.\nAt least a dozen people - six from the bank and six more from Modi’s and Choksi’s companies - have been arrested and the investigation is still continuing.\nSeparately, India’s federal police registered a case against a Delhi-based jeweller on a complaint of fraud filed by Oriental Bank of Commerce, another state-owned bank, a police source said.\nThe lender has alleged the firm, Dwarka Das Seth International, cheated the bank with the help of some of its officials, using Letters of Credit (LCs) — a banking instrument similar to those used by firms led by Modi and Choksi.\nReuters was unable to reach the Delhi firm as the phone numbers listed online did not work.\n$1 = 64.7000 Indian rupees Reporting by Swati Bhat; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:03:28.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
