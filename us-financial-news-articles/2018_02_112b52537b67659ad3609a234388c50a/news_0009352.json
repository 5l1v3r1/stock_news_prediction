The air defenses had been sent to frontlines with militants in rural areas of Aleppo and Idlib.\nTurkish warplanes have been mounting air strikes against the northwestern Syrian Kurdish region of Afrin, which is part of Aleppo province, as part of a major offensive targeting Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters.\nAhead of the Turkish offensive against Afrin, the Syrian government had threatened to shoot down any Turkish warplanes in Syrian air space.\nThe U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State also operates in northern Syria, though some distance from Aleppo city in territory stretching from the city of Manbij to the Iraqi border.\nSyrian government forces, supported by Iran-backed Shi‘ite militias, are waging an offensive into rebel-held Idlib province, which borders the Afrin region to the west and is the largest chunk of Syria still in insurgent hands.\nWriting by Tom Perry; Editing by Leslie Adler and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:04:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
