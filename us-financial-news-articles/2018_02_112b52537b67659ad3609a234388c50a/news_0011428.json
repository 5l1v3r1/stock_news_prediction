For example, Serbia does not recognise the independence of Kosovo, its former province. Some EU states have also refused to recognise Kosovo, including Spain, which is trying to contain its own separatists in Catalonia.\nGermany, the biggest provider of EU funds to candidate countries, is cautious about throwing open the door to the six countries, saying organised crime and corruption are entrenched and the rule of law needs to be assured first.\nGerman diplomats say they are wary of repeating mistakes made in 2007 with Romania and Bulgaria, which many EU officials believe were allowed to join the bloc before they were ready and are still dogged by corruption and a weak judiciary.\nHowever Bulgaria now holds the EU’s rotating six-month presidency until June 30 and is keen to champion the membership drive of its Western Balkan neighbours by holding a special Balkan summit in Sofia in May.\nAnd despite its own decision to leave the EU, Britain also backs the group’s aspirations to join the bloc and will host another top-level Balkan gathering in July.\nReporting by Robin Emmott; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T13:01:50.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
