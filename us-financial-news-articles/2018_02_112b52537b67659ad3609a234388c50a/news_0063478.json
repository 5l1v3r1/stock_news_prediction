It proposed a full year dividend of 11 cents per ordinary share.\nAfter coming through the financial crisis relatively unscathed, StanChart ran into trouble when global commodity prices crashed and bad debts started to rise on its books following over-exuberant lending.\nInvestors are now hoping that it can return to revenue growth again after a two-year restructuring under chief executive Bill Winters who has cut more than 15,000 jobs and axed business lines such as Asian equities.
