Albania expects GDP growth of 4 percent in 2018.\n“These reforms should contribute to raising efficiency, expanding the country’s productive potential and strengthening the economy to resist possible hits,” Sejko added.\nThe governor said the bank had adopted measures to reduce the use of the euro, by making it “more expensive and less favourable”, to help Albania maintain its own monetary policy.\nA candidate to eventually join the EU, Albania allows the use of the euro along its Lek currency, but has seen the euro being used at very high levels in both deposits and lending.
