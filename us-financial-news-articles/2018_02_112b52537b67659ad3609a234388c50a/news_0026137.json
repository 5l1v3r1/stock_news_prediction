He denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.\nSchneiderman said in a statement that any sale of The Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated.\nThe studio has been in talks to sell itself to a group of investors led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, but Scheiderman’s lawsuit has put deal negotiations on hold, according to people familiar with the matter.
