In Venezuela so there will be presidential elections and the people will decide who is their president in a free way.” \n\nVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro attends a ceremony to mark the opening of the judicial year at the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) in Caracas, Venezuela February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Marco Bello On Tuesday, the Lima group of 14 Latin American countries plus Canada said the election would not be free and fair as long as Venezuela has political prisoners, the opposition was not fully participating and Venezuelans abroad were not allowed to vote. \nThey urged the government to present a new electoral calendar. Several members, notably including Colombia, have said they would not recognize the results of the election. \n\nVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro gestures as he speaks during a ceremony to mark the opening of the judicial year at the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) in Caracas, Venezuela February 14, 2018.

Many traveled to other states to vote in the election. \nReporting by Deisy BuitragoWriting by Girish GuptaEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T14:52:21.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
