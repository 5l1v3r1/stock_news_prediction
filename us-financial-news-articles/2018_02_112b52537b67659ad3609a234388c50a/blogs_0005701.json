It is considering a massive break-up fee, perhaps the biggest of all time, to soothe anti-trust concerns, the sources said. It could also include a material adverse effect clause.\nQualcomm reported first quarter revenue and profit that beat expectations on Wednesday, but its operating profit fell 96 percent year over year to break even as Apple and its partners continued to withhold royalty payments.\nOf concern was the company's guidance for sales in the quarter ending in March, which were below analyst expectations.\nShares of Qualcomm are down 2.2 percent on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T18:21:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
