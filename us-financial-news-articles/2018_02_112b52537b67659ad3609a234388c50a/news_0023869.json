The work stoppage also slowed the unloading of beans at soyoil and meal manufacturing sites.\nThey appeared to be growing more aggressive on Friday and Argentina’s Security Ministry said in a statement 12 truckers had been detained for using “extortionist methods” and “throwing large quantities of grain in the road.”\nArgentina is the world’s top exporter of soybeans and soymeal and the No. 3 exporter of both corn and soymeal. Some 80 percent of Argentina’s agricultural exports depart from Rosario.
