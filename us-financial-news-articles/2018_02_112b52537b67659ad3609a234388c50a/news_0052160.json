The agency doesn’t have the authority to review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness.\nHerbal remedies with loquat have been produced in China for hundreds of years. The Nin Jiom Medicine Manufactory began producing Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa in Hong Kong in 1946. The Chinese characters on the bottle translate to “Beijing, in memory of my mother loquat thick paste.” The company began marketing it to mainland China, North America, and Europe in the 1980s. Competing loquat syrup remedies are still produced in Hong Kong, but they remain less popular.\n“All of a sudden, everybody is talking about it,” said Ching Weh Chen, owner of Pearl River, a Chinese market in New York City where the syrup is sold for $7.80. “Chinese people have known about it for a long, long time. It goes back to Qing dynasty, but now it’s Caucasian customers coming in and asking for it.”\nSue Decottis, a physician in internal medicine at New York University Langone Medical Center who also has a private practice, says herbals can have some value and she will, on occasion, recommend them to her patients. She hasn’t prescribed Pei Pa Koa. “There’s also the placebo effect with anything like that, but there’s no real money behind it to do big studies,” Dr. Decottis said.\n“I got a bottle of it in the height of my flu which seemed to hang about this year for two months deep in my chest and not let go,” said Matthew Modine, the actor currently starring in Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” Mr. Modine bought the product on Amazon and paid about $30.\n“My only trepidation was that it was coming from a country with different standards,” said Mr. Modine, who was familiar with loquat from his childhood in Los Angeles. “They’d fall off a tree and we’d pick them up and throw them at cars.”\n“With respect to influenza, the most critical time to get attention is when the virus hits because antivirals like Tamiflu need to be administered within the first 48 hours if they’re going to be effective,” said Dr. Brenner. “If herbals are the first line of defense, we’d lose that window, especially if someone has other medical problems, and there’s a higher risk the flu virus will lead to hospitalization or even death.”\nNew York State Department of Health Commissioner Howard Zucker urged everyone to get a flu shot and said anyone with flu symptoms should see their health-care provider.\nPoet Max Blagg, who learned about Pei Pa Koa from an acupuncturist in Chinatown, said: “I was a little apprehensive. If you look on the label, there’s a thousand herbs you’ve never heard of.”\nMr. Blagg passed the recommendation along to painter James Gilroy, who had the flu for three weeks. “He showed me a bottle with some crazy Chinese writing on it and I thought no, I’m going to go to a doctor,” said Mr. Gilroy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T02:03:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
