The 19-year-old shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida had bought his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle legally.\n“That’s what the NRA came out and said, that’s correct,” Loesch said when pressed on whether the group opposes raising the minimum age.\nTrump also has asked the Justice Department to develop a regulation that would effectively ban the sale of bump stocks, an accessory used last year by a shooter who killed 58 people at a Las Vegas outdoor concert, the deadliest attack by a single gunman in U.S. history.\nTrump has also said he supports legislation to tighten background checks for gun buyers, although he has not provided specific details.\nRepublican Senator Pat Toomey, a sponsor of a bill that would require background checks for weapons sold at gun shows and on the internet, said Trump’s support could help advance proposals that floundered in years passed.\nStudents who walked out of their Montgomery County, Maryland, schools protest against gun violence in front of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 21, 2018.

So I intend to give this another shot,” Toomey said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\nLegislation to close background checks loopholes failed to clear the 60-vote threshold in the U.S. Senate after a shooter killed 26 children and teachers in 2012 at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.\nDAYLIGHT WITH NRA?\nSlideshow (3 Images) Loesch tried to play down the emerging differences between the NRA and the White House.\n“I know that people are trying to find daylight between President Trump and five million law-abiding gun owners,” she said. “He’s really looking for solutions ... so far nothing’s been proposed yet.”\nTweaks to gun laws face an uphill battle among conservative Republicans in Congress. On Sunday, Representative Thomas Massie from Kentucky said he opposed changes to background check laws and other restrictions on gun ownership.\n“I wish that background checks stopped criminals or stopped school shootings, but they don’t,” Massie told NBC.\nTrump has strongly endorsed the idea - backed by the NRA in the wake of the Newtown shooting - of arming trained teachers with guns.\nLoesch said the group believes individual schools should decide whether to arm teachers. On Saturday, Trump said on Twitter the proposal would be left “up to states.”\nLoesch said more emphasis should be placed on how the FBI and local police missed warning signs and tips about the shooter, calling it an “abdication of duty.”\nBroward County Sheriff Scott Israel has come under fire after a deputy at the school at the time of the shooting stayed outside. Several news reports said that three other deputies were slow to enter the building.\nIsrael said on CNN on Sunday that he had no plans to resign, and that the department would investigate all aspects of the shooting.\nReporting by Roberta Rampton, Pete Schroeder and Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Kieran Murray, Andrea Ricci and Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T19:06:37.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
