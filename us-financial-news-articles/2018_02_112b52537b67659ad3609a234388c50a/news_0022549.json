And we will obviously review the facts and take the right decision,” Champagne told reporters, without giving more details.\nThe Bell 412EPI helicopters were due be delivered early next year as the Philippine military prepares to step up operations against Islamist and communist rebels.\nNearly 4,000 Filipinos have been killed by police in a war on drugs since June 2016. Human rights groups accuse police of carrying out illegal killings, staging crime scenes and falsifying reports, a charge they deny.\n“Human rights is a key element of our foreign policy and of our trade policy,” said Champagne.\nIn 2016, the Liberal government was criticized for deciding to honor a contract to sell light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia, despite human rights concerns. Like the helicopter contract, the deal had been arranged by Canada’s former Conservative administration.
