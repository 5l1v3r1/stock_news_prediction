Courtesy U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Prosecutors said TelexFree sold a voice-over-internet telephone service but was actually a pyramid scheme whose money came not from the product it sold but from people paying to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.\nMassachusetts-based TelexFree collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.\nJames Merrill, another TelexFree co-founder, was arrested in May 2014 and was sentenced to six years in prison in March 2017 after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.\nWanzeler, a citizen of Brazil, fled to that country in 2014 and cannot be extradited. He left behind tens of millions of dollars that he laundered from TelexFree accounts, prosecutors said.\nTo retrieve the money, he and Leonardo Casula Francisco, Wanzeler’s nephew, sent Rocha to the United States on several trips to deliver portions of it to other money launders, prosecutors said.\nThey said on two trips Rocha delivered about $4 million to people Wanzeler or Casula delegated, and on Jan. 4, 2017, tried to give someone in a parking lot a suitcase with $2.2 million.\nThat person, though, was cooperating with U.S. authorities, who were watching and soon after arrested Rocha, prosecutors said.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T01:34:44.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
