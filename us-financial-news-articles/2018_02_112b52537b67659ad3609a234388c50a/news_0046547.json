The three people couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.\nThere have also been cuts outside Europe. Last week IFR reported that Paul Saltzman, US head of global transaction banking, was to leave the bank in March. And on February 6 Deutsche confirmed that Mohamed Atmani, head of financial sponsors for Asia-Pacific, would leave the bank.\nOther cuts are expected in Deutsche’s debt capital markets business in Birmingham.\nThe moves come after Deutsche reported that revenues in its investment bank fell 15% to €14.23bn last year but compensation and benefits rose 8% to €4.26bn, despite a pledge by chief executive John Cryan not to pay bonuses last year.\nHe has since reversed that policy, putting pressure on the bank to find other ways of cutting costs. Deutsche will inform staff of any bonus awards next month, at the same time as it issues its annual report on March 16.\nAt the end of December the corporate and investment bank had 41,349 staff, or 1,700 more than a year earlier. Some 17,251 of them were costly front-office staff, up 122 during the year.
