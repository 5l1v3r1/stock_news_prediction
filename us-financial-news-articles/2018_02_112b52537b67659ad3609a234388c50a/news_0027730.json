One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about five million U.S. homes.\nCheniere’s Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana is currently the only big LNG export facility operating in the country. Several other companies are building other trains at six sites which is expected to make the United States into the third biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2018.\nTotal U.S. export capacity is expected to rise to 4.6 bcfd by the end of 2018 and 9.4 bcfd by the end of 2019 from 3.0 bcfd now.\nReporting by Oleg Vukmanovic in London and Scott DiSavino in New York, editing by Adrian Croft and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T20:34:10.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
