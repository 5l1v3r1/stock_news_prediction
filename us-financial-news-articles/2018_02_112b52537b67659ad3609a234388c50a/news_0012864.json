When former Chelsea chairman Ken Bates took charge, he branded Leeds fans “morons” and “sickpots” as well as raising ticket prices. \nPoor results blighted the short reign of Bahrain-backed owners GFH Capital, while the turmoil only increased under volatile Italian Massimo Cellino, who had convictions for fraud and false accounting. HIRE AND FIRE \nWhen Andrea Radrizzani bought out his compatriot last year, a more stable future seemed to lie ahead, particularly after the club bought back its Elland Road ground which had been sold in 2004. \nHope flickered earlier this season when more than 20,000 supporters snapped up season tickets for the new campaign under the untried Dane Christiansen, whose only previous managerial success had been in Cyprus. \nLeeds even topped the table in September but injuries, suspensions and the failure to bring in reinforcements in the January transfer window led to Christiansen departing after 15 wins from 35 games in charge. \nBritish media report that Leeds expect a quick appointment ahead of Saturday’s Yorkshire derby with Sheffield United. Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom is the early favourite, ahead of former Scotland manager and ex-Leeds player Gordon Strachan and former boss Simon Grayson. \nFormer Leeds player Noel Whelan, who has his own show on BBC local radio, said the club needed to appoint “someone with heart, desire, passion and discipline,” adding that the new man must “install into the players the expectations from our club.” \nAs ever, those remain high, with a quickly delivered promotion top of most people’s agenda. However, few now believe it will come this season.
