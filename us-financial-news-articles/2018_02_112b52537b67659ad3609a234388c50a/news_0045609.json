The contest was the final game of a 13-day, seven-game, 6,491-mile road trip for Los Angeles.\nDustin Byfuglien, Blake Wheeler and Patrik Laine each had a goal and an assist for Winnipeg, which had a three-game win streak snapped in the final game of a franchise-record 10-game homestand. Connor Hellebuyck finished with 28 saves for the Jets, who fell two points behind first-place Nashville in the Central Division and lost for just the sixth time in 31 home games (23-6-2) this season.\nThe Jets, who entered the game ranked third in the NHL in power-play percentage (23.9), had an early 5-on-3 advantage when Drew Doughty (elbowing) and Christian Folin (interference) went off just 38 seconds apart. It took Wheeler just 34 seconds to give Winnipeg a 1-0 lead, firing a wrist shot past Kuemper’s glove from the right circle.\nLos Angeles answered with a pair of power-play goals; one by Martinez on a wrist shot from the high slot that went past a screened Hellebuyck, and another by Phaneuf on a one-timer from the right circle, his sixth of the season and third in the last four games.\nByfuglien tied it at 2 at 18:55 of the second period with his fourth goal of the season, a shot from the left point that deflected off the stick of Kings’ center Anze Kopitar, who was playing in his 900th NHL game.\nMitchell then gave the Kings a 3-2 lead at 6:17 in the third period when he pounced on a loose puck in the slot and then slid it around Hellebuyck’s left pad.\nBrown then slammed home a pass from Tyler Toffoli with 4:07 remaining to make it 4-2. Kopitar earned an assist on the play, his 800th career point.\nLaine scored his 28th goal of the season with 48.5 seconds to go during a 6-on-4 with Doughty serving a hooking penalty to make it 4-3, but the Jets never got a serious scoring chance after that.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T12:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:32:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
