They are really going to test us. England have been in great form the last couple of years so we know the challenge we face but we have had a good couple of weeks in camp and we are looking forward to going up to Twickenham.” \nWales go into the match with a starting line-up featuring 10 players from in-form Pro14 side Scarlets, aiming for a first success at Twickenham since the 2015 Rugby World Cup. \nThey began this year’s Six Nations with a bonus point win over Scotland 34-7 in Cardiff last Saturday. \nTeam:15-Leigh Halfpenny, 14-Josh Adams, 13-Scott Williams, 12-Hadleigh Parkes, 11-Steff Evans, 10-Rhys Patchell, 9-Gareth Davies, 8-Ross Moriarty, 7-Josh Navidi, 6-Aaron Shingler, 5-Alun Wyn Jones (captain), 4-Cory Hill, 3-Samson Lee, 2-Ken Owens, 1-Rob Evans \nReplacements: 16-Elliot Dee, 17-Wyn Jones, 18-Thomas Francis, 19-Bradley Davies, 20-Justin Tipuric, 21-Aled Davies, 22-Gareth Anscombe, 23-George North.
