Now I’ve got two rounds to fill it out,” said the confident Coleman, who hopes to use the rarefied air at high-altitude in Albuquerque to eclipse Maurice Greene’s 20-year world record of 6.39 seconds.\nColeman ran 6.37 seconds last month in South Carolina, but the performance will not be ratified because electronic starting blocks were not in use.\nAmerica’s hurdlers also are expected to be major factors at the world championships with Christina Manning clocking 7.84 seconds in 60 metres hurdles qualifying.\nWorld outdoor record holder Kendra Harrison won her heat in 7.87 seconds with Sharika Nelvis (7.91) also a heat winner.\nJarret Eaton led the men’s preliminaries, running 7.53 seconds with Devon Allen 0.05 seconds slower in another heat. Aries Merritt, the outdoor record holder, was fifth fastest at 7.66.\nOlympic silver medalist Paul Chelimo outkicked Shadrack Kipchirchir for the 3,000 metres win in 7:57.88.\nAnother fast closer, Shelby Houlihan, took the women’s 3,000 in 9:00.08.\nWorld silver medalist Jarrion Lawson narrowly missed the year’s best long jump when he leaped 8.38 metres to defeat world indoor champion Marquis Dendy (8.22) and Erik Kynard cleared 2.30 metres to win his fifth consecutive high jump title.\nReporting by Gene Cherry in Salvo, North Carolina; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T04:37:32.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
