I hope we will be able to resolve these disagreements in the next round.”\n“The sooner the UK makes its choices, the better,” Barnier also said of the EU’s expectation that London should present its vision of its new relationship with the bloc after the post-Brexit transition ends.\nReporting by Gabriela Baczynska; editing by Philip Blenkinsop\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:06:00.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
