It was not immediately clear who would represent him in the discussions on Ukraine.\nSocial Democratic Party (SPD) leader Martin Schulz, who is scheduled to take over as foreign minister if SPD members approve a new “grand coalition” with Chancellor Angela Merkel, will address the conference, Ischinger told reporters.\nIschinger welcomed plans for a meeting of the four countries as a possible way to jumpstart the long-stalled Minsk peace process. “It is good to use the opportunity in Munich to try to get some movement back into the somewhat stalled Minsk talks,” he said. “I hope it works.”\nGermany and France have urged the parties involved in the conflict to implement decisions already agreed, including the withdrawal of heavy equipment from front lines.\nThe annual Munich Security Report issued in the runup to the conference called the conflict in eastern Ukraine “the most important stumbling block” on the path to better relations between Russia and the West, adding that prospects for a political solution appeared dim.\nA decision by the United States in December to begin approving lethal arms sales to Ukraine would likely prolong the current stalemate, the report said.\nIschinger told reporters it would nonetheless be useful if Washington got engaged in the Minsk process, and the same was true for the European Union.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Michael Nienaber and Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T03:18:49.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
