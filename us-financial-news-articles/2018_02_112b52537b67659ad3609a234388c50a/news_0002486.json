(NYSE:BKH) today announced 2017 fourth quarter and full year financial results. GAAP income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 was $71 million and $201 million, or $1.30 and $3.65 per diluted share, respectively, compared to $52 million and $137 million, or $0.96 and $2.57 per diluted share, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. The three and 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2017 included a $15 million or $0.26 per share tax benefit resulting from the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on Dec. 22, 2017. This impact from the TCJA is discussed in more detail below.\nGAAP net income for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 was $58 million and $184 million, or $1.05 and $3.34 per diluted share, respectively, compared to $18 million and $73 million, or $0.33 and $1.37 per diluted share, respectively, for the same periods in 2016. Net income includes results for our Oil and Gas operations, which are reported as discontinued operations.\nIncome from continuing operations, as adjusted, for the three and 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2017 was $54 million and $185 million, or $0.98 and $3.36 per diluted share, respectively, compared to $58 million and $167 million or $1.06 and $3.13 per share, respectively, for the same period in 2016 (this is a non-GAAP measure and an accompanying schedule for the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment reconciliation is provided).\n“Although we faced challenges during the year, we delivered solid earnings growth and strong operational execution across our business segments,” said David R. Emery, chairman and CEO of Black Hills Corp. “Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2017 increased 7.3 percent compared to the prior year, highlighted by a full year of financial results from the acquired SourceGas properties. We also benefited from additional natural gas utility investment opportunities and significant cost savings resulting from the successful integration of SourceGas. Overall financial results were negatively impacted by mild weather.”\nThree Months Ended Dec. 31, Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP: Income from continuing operations $ 71.3 $ 52.1 $ 201.1 $ 137.1 (Loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes (13.6 ) (34.0 ) (17.1 ) (64.2 ) Net income available for common stock $ 57.7 $ 18.2 $ 184.0 $ 73.0 Earnings per share from continuing operations, diluted $ 1.30 $ 0.96 $ 3.65 $ 2.57 Earnings per share from discontinued operations (0.25 ) (0.63 ) (0.31 ) (1.20 ) Earnings per share, diluted $ 1.05 $ 0.33 $ 3.34 $ 1.37 Non-GAAP:* Income from continuing operations, as adjusted $ 53.9 $ 57.7 $ 185.3 $ 166.9 Earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, diluted $ 0.98 $ 1.06 $ 3.36 $ 3.13 * An accompanying schedule for the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment reconciliation is provided below. In November 2017, Black Hills announced its intent to exit the oil and gas business, therefore, results for that segment are reported as discontinued operations beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017. “We have made excellent progress in winding down this business,” said Emery. “Asset sales have been closed or contracts have been signed to divest all of our operated properties, and we expect to divest the remaining non-operated assets by mid-year, completing the divestiture process earlier than originally anticipated. Our ongoing strategic focus will be on our electric and natural gas utilities supported by assets from the power generation and mining segments.”\nBlack Hills’ 2017 consolidated financial results were impacted by the recently enacted TCJA. The company reported a one-time $15 million tax benefit at year-end 2017 to reflect the required revaluation of deferred taxes. This benefit was included in GAAP earnings but excluded from earnings as adjusted from continuing operations. The TCJA lowers the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. “Lower tax rates mean lower utility bills for our customers,” said Emery. “We are working with utility regulators in each of the states we serve to provide benefits from tax reform to our customers.\n“Throughout the year, our focus has been on delivering safe and reliable utility service to our customers,” continued Emery. “We continued to invest in the nearly 800 communities we serve. As an example, since early 2016, we have invested more than $160 million in natural gas infrastructure in northwest Arkansas to support the economic growth in those communities.\n“As we enter 2018, we are excited to execute our long-term capital investment program to better serve customers. We are upgrading our natural gas pipeline system, enhancing our electric transmission and distribution system and planning to add more renewable generation. We are also managing costs and improving efficiencies throughout our organization. We are committed to driving long-term earnings and dividend growth,” concluded Emery.\nBlack Hills Corp. highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, recent regulatory filings, updates and other events include:\nElectric Utilities\nOn Sept. 22, the Mountain West Transmission Group, which includes the company’s three electric utilities and seven other electricity providers, formally expressed an interest in joining the Southwest Power Pool regional transmission organization. If the group can reach an acceptable agreement with SPP, filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state public utility commissions would be expected in mid-2018 with integration into the SPP in late 2019.\nOn Aug. 4, Colorado Electric received bids related to its request for proposals for an additional 60 megawatts of renewable energy resources to be in service by 2019 to meet Colorado’s renewable energy requirements.

Black Hills is reviewing the impact of tax reform as it applies to the filing.\nOn Nov. 17, Wyoming Gas filed a rate review with the Wyoming Public Service Commission to recover safety, reliability and system integrity investments made in Northwest Wyoming since 2015 in its natural gas transmission and distribution pipeline system. The filing seeks to increase annual revenues by approximately $1.4 million and requests a 10.2 percent return on equity and a capital structure of 54.0 percent equity and 46.0 percent debt. The filing seeks to implement new rates in the third quarter of 2018. Black Hills is reviewing the impact of tax reform as it applies to the filing.\nOn Oct. 3, Rocky Mountain Natural Gas, an intrastate natural gas pipeline in Colorado, filed a rate review with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to recover investments for maintaining and/or enhancing the safety and integrity of its pipeline system during the last three years. The filing seeks to increase annual revenues by approximately $2.0 million and requests a 12.3 percent return on equity and a capital structure of 46.6 percent equity and 53.4 percent debt. The filing seeks to implement new rates in the second quarter of 2018. Black Hills is reviewing the impact of tax reform as it applies to the filing.\nCorporate\nOn Jan. 31, 2018, the board of directors declared a dividend of $0.475 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend rate of $1.90 per share. This annual equivalent rate represents an increase of 5 percent over the total 2017 dividend of $1.81 per share and the 48th consecutive annual dividend increase. Common shareholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 15, 2018, will receive $0.475 per share, payable March 1, 2018.\nOn Dec. 12, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed its corporate credit rating of Black Hills Corp. at Baa2 with a stable outlook.\nOn Oct. 4, Fitch Ratings affirmed its corporate credit rating of Black Hills Corp. at BBB+ with a stable outlook.\nOn Aug. 4, a new shelf registration statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In conjunction with the shelf registration statement, the company renewed its At-the-Market equity offering program under which it may sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock with an aggregate value of up to $300 million\n. On July 21, S&P Global Ratings affirmed its corporate credit rating of Black Hills Corp. at BBB with a stable outlook.\nDuring the first quarter, Black Hills began issuing commercial paper under a program implemented in late 2016. The company utilized favorable short-term rates on its commercial paper program to repay $100 million of corporate term loan borrowings due in 2019 with principal payments of $50 million paid in May and an additional $50 million paid in July.\nOn Apr. 1, Robert Myers, senior vice president and chief human resources officer, retired after nine years of service. Jennifer Landis, previously vice president of human resources and 15-year veteran of the company, was appointed senior vice president and chief human resources officer, effective Feb. 1, 2017.\nEffective Jan. 1, 2017, Robert P. Otto joined Black Hills’ board of directors\nDiscontinued Operations - Oil and Gas\nAs of Jan. 29, 2018, Black Hills has either closed transactions or signed contracts to sell more than 90 percent of its oil and gas properties for an aggregate value of approximately $75 million. The company has executed agreements to sell all its operated properties, and has only non-operated assets with minimal value left to divest. The company plans to conclude the sale of all remaining assets by mid-year 2018.\nOn Nov. 1, Black Hills’ board of directors authorized the sale of all oil and gas assets and the exit of the business. Black Hills began reporting the segment as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSummary of Tax Reform Impacts\nThe TCJA legislation was signed into law on Dec. 22, 2017. The new tax law contains several provisions that impacted Black Hills’ 2017 financial results and will impact the company well into the future. The following summary describes the major impacts of the TCJA. Black Hills continues to evaluate the new tax law and has made its assumptions based on information currently available.\nThe new tax law required revaluation of federal deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new lower corporate tax rate of 21 percent. The revaluation for the utilities required the creation of a regulatory liability of approximately $300 million and an offsetting reduction in deferred tax liability. This regulatory liability will generally be amortized over the remaining life of the related assets as specifically prescribed in the TCJA. On a consolidated financial statement basis, the revaluation resulted in a one-time, non-cash, income tax benefit of approximately $15 million in 2017.\nTax reform will be beneficial to our utility customers primarily as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. The lower tax rate will negatively impact the company’s cash flows by approximately $35 million to $45 million annually for the next several years. We are working with utility regulators in each of the states we serve to provide the benefits from tax reform to our customers.\nThe TCJA includes provisions limiting interest deductibility in certain circumstances. Black Hills expects to maintain deductibility of interest expense. However, the lower tax rate reduces the tax benefits on holding company debt. This effect will be largely offset by the impact of the lower tax rate on non-utility earnings.\nBLACK HILLS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS\n(Minor differences may result due to rounding.)\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended Dec. 31, Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) available for common stock: Electric $ 41.7 $ 23.2 $ 110.1 $ 85.8 Gas 24.4 29.6 65.8 59.6 Power generation 28.5 6.0 46.5 25.9 Mining 5.3 3.1 14.4 10.1 99.9 62.0 236.7 181.4 Corporate and Other (28.6 ) (9.8 ) (35.6 ) (44.3 ) Income from continuing operations (a) 71.3 52.1 201.1 137.1 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (13.6 ) (34.0 ) (17.1 ) (64.2 ) Net income available for common stock $ 57.7 $ 18.2 $ 184.0 $ 73.0 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 53.3 52.9 53.2 51.9 Diluted 54.9 54.4 55.1 53.3 Earnings per share: Diluted - Continuing Operations $ 1.30 $ 0.96 $ 3.65 $ 2.57 Discontinued Operations (0.25 ) (0.63 ) (0.31 ) (1.20 ) Total Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 1.05 $ 0.33 $ 3.34 $ 1.37 (a) Income from continuing operations available for common stock for 2017 includes a net tax benefit of $15 million from the revaluation of deferred tax balances due to the decrease in the statutory Federal income tax rate as a result of the TCJA. The impact to our operating segments included: a tax benefit at Electric Utilities of $23 million, Power Generation $24 million and Mining $2.7 million; and tax expense at Gas Utilities of $6.8 million, and Corporate and Other of $28 million.\nThe variances to the prior year are discussed below in the Segment Performance Summaries.\n2018 EARNINGS GUIDANCE REVISED\nBlack Hills reduced guidance for 2018 earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50 per share (a non-GAAP measure*), from $3.35 to $3.55 per share, due primarily to rising short-term interest rates and tax reform impacts. The revised guidance range is based on the following assumptions:\nCapital spending of $431 million; Normal weather conditions within our utility service territories including temperatures, precipitation levels and wind conditions; Normal operations for planned construction, maintenance and/or capital investment projects; Successful completion of rate reviews for electric and gas utilities; No significant unplanned outages at any of our power generation facilities; No planned equity financing under our At-the-Market equity offering program; Conversion of equity units prior to Nov. 1, 2018; Lower tax benefits on holding company debt (due to the lower tax rate), which are largely offset by the benefit of the lower tax rate on non-utility earnings; No significant acquisitions or divestitures; and Oil and gas segment reported as discontinued operations\n* Earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, is defined as GAAP Earnings per share from continuing operations, adjusted for expenses and gains that the company believes do not reflect the company’s core operating performance. Examples of these types of adjustments may include unique one-time non-budgeted events, impairing of assets, and acquisition and disposition costs. The company is not able to provide forward-looking quantitative GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for the 2018 earnings guidance, as adjusted, because we do not know the unplanned or unique events that may occur.\nANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS\nThe company’s annual meeting of shareholders will be held on Tuesday, April 24, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. local time, at Black Hills’ company headquarters located at 7001 Mt. Rushmore Road in Rapid City, South Dakota. The company plans to mail the Annual Report and Proxy Statement on or about March 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of March 5, 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nThe company will host a live conference call and webcast at 11 a.m. EST on Friday, Feb. 2, 2018, to discuss the company’s financial and operating performance.\nTo access the live webcast and download a copy of the investor presentation, go to the Black Hills website at www.blackhillscorp.com and click on “Events & Presentations” in the “Investor Relations” section. The presentation will be posted on the website before the webcast. Listeners should allow at least five minutes for registering and accessing the presentation. Those interested in asking a question during the live broadcast or those without internet access can call 866-544-7741 if calling within the United States. International callers can call 724-498-4407. All callers need to enter the pass code 4396776 when prompted.\nFor those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available on the company’s website or by telephone through Friday, Feb. 23, 2018, at 855-859-2056 in the United States and at 404-537-3406 for international callers. The replay pass code is 4396776.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE\nAs noted in this news release, in addition to presenting its earnings information in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the company has provided non-GAAP earnings data reflecting adjustments for special items as specified in the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment reconciliation table below. Net income (loss), as adjusted, is defined as Net income (loss), adjusted for expenses and gains that the company believes do not reflect the company’s core operating performance. The company believes that non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because the items excluded are not indicative of the company’s continuing operating results. The company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as an indicator for planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under GAAP. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will not be affected by unusual, non-routine, or non-recurring items.\nGross margin (revenue less cost of sales) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure due to the exclusion of deprecation from the measure. The presentation of gross margin is intended to supplement investors’ understanding of operating performance. Gross margin for our Electric Utilities is calculated as operating revenue less cost of fuel, purchased power and cost of gas sold. Gross margin for our Gas Utilities is calculated as operating revenue less cost of gas sold. Our gross margin is impacted by the fluctuations in power purchases and natural gas and other fuel supply costs. However, while these fluctuating costs impact gross margin as a percentage of revenue, they only impact total gross margin if the costs cannot be passed through to customers. Our gross margin measure may not be comparable to other companies’ gross margin measure. Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENT RECONCILIATION\nThree Months Ended Dec. 31, Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, (In millions, except per share amounts) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Income EPS Income EPS Income EPS Income EPS Income from continuing operations available for common stock (GAAP) $ 71.3 $ 1.30 $ 52.1 $ 0.96 $ 201.1 $ 3.65 $ 137.1 $ 2.57 Adjustments: External acquisition costs (pre-tax) 2.0 0.04 8.5 0.16 4.4 0.08 45.7 0.86 Tax reform and other tax items (18.7 ) (0.34 ) — — (18.7 ) (0.34 ) — — Total adjustments (16.7 ) (0.30 ) 8.5 0.16 (14.3 ) (0.26 ) 45.7 0.86 Tax on adjustments: Acquisition costs (0.7 ) (0.02 ) (3.0 ) (0.06 ) (1.5 ) (0.03 ) (16.0 ) (0.30 ) Total tax on adjustments (0.7 ) (0.02 ) (3.0 ) (0.06 ) (1.5 ) (0.03 ) (16.0 ) (0.30 ) Rounding — — 0.1 — — — 0.1 — Income from continuing operations available for common stock, as adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 53.9 $ 0.98 $ 57.7 $ 1.06 $ 185.3 $ 3.36 $ 166.9 $ 3.13 SEGMENT PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nOur segment highlights for the three months and 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2017, compared to the three months and 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2016, are discussed below.

An additional $1.3 million of indirect corporate costs are included at the electric utilities; these costs were previously charged to the Oil and Gas segment, now reported as discontinued operations. Employee costs increased $0.6 million as a result of prior year integration activities and transition expenses charged to Corporate and Other. In addition, operating expenses increased $0.3 million from the addition of the Peak View Wind Project and the 40-megawatt gas turbine at the Pueblo Airport Generating Station. A variety of smaller items contribute to the remainder of the increase in operations and maintenance expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization increased primarily due to a higher asset base driven by the addition of the Peak View Wind Project and the 40 megawatt gas turbine at the Pueblo Airport Generating Station.\nInterest expense, net was comparable to the same period in the prior year.\nOther income (expense), net was comparable to the same period in the prior year.\nIncome tax benefit (expense): The effective tax rate decreased in 2017 due to a tax benefit of $23 million resulting from revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities in accordance with the ASC 740 and the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. This benefit was primarily related to the revaluation of net operating losses and other tax basis items not included in the ratemaking construct. Production tax credits associated with the Peak View Wind Project increased by $0.8 million reflecting a full quarter of production tax credits compared to a partial quarter in 2016. The prior year included a $1.3 million benefit related to the flow-through treatment of a treasury grant related to the Busch Ranch Wind Project.\nFull Year 2017 Compared to Full Year 2016\nGross margin increased over the prior year primarily reflecting a $7.8 million return on investment from the Peak View Wind Project, a $7.4 million increase in rider revenues primarily related to transmission investment recovery, and a $2.1 million increase in commercial and industrial margins driven by increased demand largely associated with data centers in Cheyenne, Wyoming. A variety of smaller items contribute to the remainder of the net increase.\nOperations and maintenance increased primarily due to $4.8 million of higher employee costs as a result of prior year integration activities and transition expenses charged to Corporate and Other, $2.6 million of higher generation outage expenses, $1.9 million of higher property taxes with an increased asset base, and $1.7 million of higher operating expenses from the Peak View Wind Project and the 40-megawatt gas turbine at the Pueblo Airport Generating Station. An additional $1.3 million of indirect corporate costs are included at the electric utilities; these costs were previously charged to our Oil and Gas segment, now reported as discontinued operations.\nDepreciation and amortization increased primarily due to a higher asset base driven partially by the addition of the Peak View Wind Project and the 40-megawatt gas turbine at the Pueblo Airport Generating Station.\nInterest expense, net increased primarily due to higher intercompany debt resulting from additional investments as compared to the prior year.\nOther (expense) income, net decreased due to reduced AFUDC with lower capital spend.\nIncome tax benefit (expense): The effective tax rate is lower in 2017 primarily due to a $23 million benefit resulting from revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. This benefit was primarily related to the revaluation of net operating losses and other tax basis items not included in the ratemaking construct. Production tax credits associated with the Peak View Wind Project increased by $4.0 million reflecting a full year of production tax credits compared to two months in 2016.
