It had earlier caused extensive damage in Samoa and American Samoa.\nThe cyclone had since been downgraded to a storm, but forecasters warned it was still likely to wreak havoc as it traversed the centre of New Zealand, parts of which were still reeling from a huge storm that prompted authorities to declare of states of emergency at the start of February.\nMore than 40 schools and preschools were closed in the upper South Island, while local mayors urged people not to leave their homes.\nTransport authorities shut a stretch of highway along the east coast of the South Island and the Department of Conservation was closing picturesque seaside hiking tracks and campsites along the West Coast and ushering tourists away from low-lying areas, media said.
