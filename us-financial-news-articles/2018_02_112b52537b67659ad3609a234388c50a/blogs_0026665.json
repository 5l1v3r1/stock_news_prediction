Apple offers all this as well as opportunities for future growth. Apple's large cash balance offers the opportunity to expand into new markets,\" he added. \nMohan reaffirmed his $220 price target for Apple shares, representing 38 percent upside to Wednesday's close. The $220 forecast represents a $1.1 trillion market valuation for the company. \nThe analyst predicts Apple will raise its dividend by 10 percent this year. Mohan forecasts the smartphone maker will be able to generate $50 billion to $60 billion in free cash flow annually for the next two years. He expects the company will announce a new share buyback program in April. \nMohan downplayed investors' recent concerns over slowing iPhone demand. \n\"While iPhone X sales may be lower than the Street had predicted (our estimates were lower) we view low single digit unit growth and mix adjusted ASP (average selling price) growth into 2019, with upside to gross margins,\" he wrote. \"In addition, Services remain a key growth driver in future years.\" \nThe firm's note comes after the market's volatility rose this past week. A stronger-than-expected jobs report and wage number on Friday sent interest rates higher, sparking a 6 percent sell-off in the S&P 500 over two trading sessions. \nApple shares were slightly higher at the open of trading Thursday. Despite Mohan's thesis, Apple has actually underperformed the market during the last week of turmoil. The shares are off 7 percent in five days compared with a 5 percent drop for the market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T16:52:06.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
