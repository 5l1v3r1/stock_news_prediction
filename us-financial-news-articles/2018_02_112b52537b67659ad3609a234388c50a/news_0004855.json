Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish and CBS CEO Leslie Moonves talked about the potential merger earlier this month, Reuters reported.\nViacom's Nickelodeon and MTV networks and Paramount films could help broadcast-focused CBS' All Access streaming service become more competitive, and the combined company could also better negotiate with cable and satellite distributors.\n\"They might be better able to develop more robust OTT offerings faster as a combined entity,\" said Michael Nathanson, analyst with Moffett Nathanson, referring to \"over the top\" streaming.\nSome could argue Viacom's international presence is now more important for CBS given the rapid decline in U.S. cable subscriptions, some analysts have noted.\nWalt Disney Co's recent deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox Inc assets has stoked a fresh push from Shari Redstone to rejoin the companies her father split in 2006.\nBakish has improved distributor relations, found financing for Paramount Pictures after Chinese investors dropped out and shuffled programming since taking over Viacom in late 2016. But Viacom shares trade around $33, below a $35 to $38.80 range when the merger was last on the table, potentially making a deal more feasible.\nCBS and Viacom last explored merging at the urging of ailing media mogul Sumner Redstone, 94, and Shari Redstone, who control both through privately held National Amusements. Moonves and CBS' board had concerns over corporate governance and the deal's financial rationale, and the Redstones called off the effort in December 2016.\nFor CBS, which owns the CBS network, local broadcasters and Showtime, taking on cable networks could mean a difficult integration and tough negotiations, said Tim Nollen, analyst with Macquarie Research.\nMerging for size alone may not make sense in the long term, and CBS could be better off on its own, some analysts cautioned.\nViacom shares were down 0.4 percent in afternoon trade. CBS shares fell 1.8 percent.\nWATCH: CBS, Viacom CEOs talk about merger show chapters Viacom, CBS CEOs talked about a merger, says Reuters 8:06 PM ET Thu, 25 Jan 2018 | 00:32", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T00:13:48.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
