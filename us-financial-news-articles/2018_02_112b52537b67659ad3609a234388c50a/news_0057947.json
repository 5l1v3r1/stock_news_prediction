Artios is based at the Babraham Research Campus in Cambridge, UK.\nAbout the DNA Damage Response (DDR)\nDNA Damage occurs in cells throughout the body every day. To counteract the harmful effects that DNA damage can cause, the human body possesses a network of DNA repair pathways, which act to correct the damage. This process is known as the DNA Damage Response (DDR). Defects in the body's DDR can lead to an increased risk of cancer. Human cells have multiple DNA repair pathways, but in cancer cells, some of these pathways are lost, which result in genetic instability. Changes to DNA repair pathways can also drive the growth of tumours. By inhibiting DDR in cancer cells that have impaired repair pathways, scientists can selectively kill cancerous cells. DDR inhibitors, therefore, have the potential to act as: single agents that selectively kill tumour cells through synthetic lethality; adjunctive therapy to overcome resistance to current cytotoxics, and potentiating agents to radiotherapy and novel therapies including immune-oncology treatments.\nSource:Artios Pharma Ltd.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EM0H55KIuxlVIgqiOxMwwC5avFCQmjTY5x-3uJdVgE4ef2FMnTGMq6E8DkLYKfuH9Q4CFg0IQa9CY3hp9fyZY5QgjuF-ximunyH691oJJcryTNNxcFFEqkfrKJNSQKPD"], "published": "2018-02-26T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T17:10:58.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
