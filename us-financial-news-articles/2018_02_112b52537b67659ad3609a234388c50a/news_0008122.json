At this time, the railway is not on the government’s agenda,” Arbache said. “The engineering challenges were absurd.”\nThe Peruvian government has said the railway could be feasible if it took a more direct route through Bolivia that would reduce costs and have less of an environmental impact, in addition to giving Peru’s landlocked neighbor better access to Pacific export markets.\nArbache said talks on an alternative route were only at an “embryonic” stage.\nChina is Brazil’s biggest trading partner and invested $20.9 billion in the South American country in 2017, the most since 2010, as a recession eroded asset prices and attracted investors, according to the planning ministry.\nThe bulk of that investment has gone into energy, logistics and agriculture.\nArbache said Brazil expects China to take a longer-term view and diversify its investments towards Brazilian manufacturing and services, including the health and education sectors.
