There are estimated to be between 7,000 - 8,000 figures in total.\nQin Shihuangdi is regarded as having laid the foundations for Chinese society. Between 221 BC and his death in 210 BC he imposed the Qin penal code, created a single currency, standardized weights and measures and imposed a single written language and bureaucracy in China.\nThe warriors’ first visit to Britain, for a 2007-2008 exhibition in the British Museum, proved highly popular: It drew 850,000 visitors, making it the second most-visited exhibition in the museum’s history after a 1972 Tutankhamun showcase.\nThe exhibit opens on Feb. 9 and runs until Oct. 28 at Liverpool’s World Museum.\nWriting by Mark Hanrahan in London, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T18:35:00.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
