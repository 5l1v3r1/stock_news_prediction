The IIFH counts just seven rinks in the entire country.\nYet Slovenia’s men’s national team, ranked 15th globally by the IIHF, has qualified for two straight Olympics, muscling past more highly ranked squads like Belarus. In Sochi in 2014, they battled into the knockout round and finished seventh.\nReuters ran the numbers from the IIHF's global database of players and facilities. Following are some other findings on the countries sending the 12 men's teams and eight women's teams to Pyeongchang: tmsnrt.rs/2Eur8Bj\nTALLEST CHALLENGE This year’s hosts – South Korea – rank as the most hockey-challenged country competing.\nRanked 21st and 22nd respectively by the IIHF, the men’s and women’s squads were awarded automatic bids but have a small talent pool. The country has just 2,675 players out of a total population of nearly 51 million and just 30 rinks.\nAt the over-20 level, South Korea has just 490 players, the second fewest after Slovenia. That is just one player for every 104,000 people compared with one per every 123 in the Czech Republic, which has the world’s largest density of adult hockey players.\nEven North Korea, which will send players for a unified women’s team with the South, has more than twice the number of adult players, at 1,090 with roughly three times as many women playing the game as its southern neighbor: 920 vs 319.\nSMALL BUT MIGHTY Finland clocks in with the fourth smallest population of the 14 participants at around 5.5 million people, but it packs a powerful hockey punch.\nThe Finns come into the games ranked fourth by the IIHF and as the only team in the men’s tournament to have won a medal in each of the last three Olympics.\nIn two of three measures of ice hockey might examined by Reuters, it comes in at number two - players per capita (one per 148) and rinks per capita (one per 18,000).\nOne problem is that Finland produces so many players, those rinks are crowded. It has one rink for every 121 players. Only the Czechs have more crowded conditions, at one for every 420.\n(For graphic click tmsnrt.rs/2EruxAz )\nSIZE MATTERS The United States ranks number six in players per capita, number nine in rinks per capita and number 12 in players per rink.\nStill, thanks to its substantially larger overall population - around 325 million - there are more American players participating at the over-20 level than in any other country, nearly 235,000.\nAs a result its men’s program is ranked fifth and the women are the world’s number one team, likely to battle Canada for gold.\nSOFT TOUCH Several countries stand out for under-delivering on their hockey potential, perhaps most notably Switzerland.\nThe country has about 8.2 million people but comes in at number five in players per capita and number four in rinks per capita and has a middle of the road 41 players per rink. But the Swiss come to South Korea with a men’s team ranked seventh by the IIHF and a women’s team ranked sixth.\nThe Swiss women won their first medal in Sochi - a bronze - and could contend again this year. The Swiss men, meanwhile, have not won a medal since 1948.\nReporting By Dan Burns; editing by Nick Mulvenney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T11:47:45.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
