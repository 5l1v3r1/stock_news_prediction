Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP financial measure is presented in the accompanying financial table under the headings “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP.”\nInnoviva believes that the non-GAAP financial information provided in this release can assist investors, research analysts and others in understanding and assessing Innoviva's on-going operations, financial performance and prospects for the future and provides an additional tool to use in comparing Innoviva's financial results with other companies in Innoviva's industry or with similar operating profiles, without regard to financing or capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are used as supplemental financial operating measures by Innoviva's management and frequently discussed with external users of its financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is determined by taking GAAP net income attributable to Innoviva stockholders and adding back interest expense (income), taxes, stock-based compensation expense, write off of debt issuance costs, depreciation expense and amortization of capitalized fees paid to a related party. Innoviva believes the non-GAAP measure of adjusted EBITDA is important as it measures the Company's ability to generate cash to pay interest costs and support its indebtedness, and it is also used currently in the Company's annual performance review process. Innoviva's method of computing adjusted EBITDA may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted earnings per share is determined by taking adjusted net income and dividing the total by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding used to calculate the GAAP diluted EPS. Adjusted net income is determined by taking GAAP net income attributable to Innoviva stockholders and adding back stock-based compensation expense, write off of debt issuance costs, amortization of debt discount, depreciation expense and amortization of capitalized fees paid to a related party. Innoviva believes the non-GAAP measure of adjusted earnings per share provides useful information about the Company's core operating performance, and enhances the overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance and its prospects for the future. Innoviva's method of computing adjusted earnings per share may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted earnings per share is not intended to represent cash flow per share and does not represent a measure of liquidity or cash available for distribution. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that it excludes significant elements that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Innoviva's consolidated financial statements. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgments by management in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management of Innoviva presents its non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its GAAP results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of Innoviva's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAbout Innoviva\nInnoviva is focused on bringing compelling new medicines to patients in areas of unmet need by leveraging its significant expertise in the development, commercialization and financial management of bio-pharmaceuticals.
