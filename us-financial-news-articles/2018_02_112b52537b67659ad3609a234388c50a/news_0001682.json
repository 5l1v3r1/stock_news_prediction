The S&P 500 gained 5.96 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,828.39 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.34 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,424.82.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 0.25 percent, pulled lower by a tumbling healthcare sector, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.04 percent.\nThe U.S. dollar fell ahead of a Fed statement that was widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged but indicate a strengthening economy.\nThe euro rose on firm underlying euro zone inflation data.\nThe dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.15 percent, with the euro up 0.28 percent to $1.2435. The Japanese yen weakened 0.45 percent versus the greenback at 109.27 per dollar.\nOil prices fell for a third day after the U.S. Energy Department said oil inventories rose for the first time in nearly three months and by an amount that exceeded expectations.\nU.S. crude fell 12 cents to $64.38 per barrel and Brent was last at $68.90, down 12 cents on the day.\nBenchmark 10-year notes fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.7368 percent.\nEditing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:16:19.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
