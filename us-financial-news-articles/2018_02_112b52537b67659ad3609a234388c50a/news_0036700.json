Wainwright analyst Raghuram Selvaraju, who had expected an approval, told Reuters ahead of the decision.\nSelvaraju estimated that Vitaros could take in $200 million four or five years after its launch.\nOutside of the U.S., Vitaros has been on the market for several years and is sold in Canada, Mexico, parts of the Middle East and much of Europe by the company’s commercial partner, privately held Ferring International Center S.A.\nChief Executive Officer Richard Pascoe said the company will provide an update in early March on its plans for the drug.\nReporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Bernard Orr\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T14:27:30.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
