She denies wrongdoing. \nThe prosecution’s recommendation came two weeks after Choi Soon-sil, a longtime friend of Park who was at the center of the scandal, was jailed for 20 years for taking bribes from “chaebol”, or conglomerates, including electronics powerhouse Samsung and retail giant Lotte. \n  reuters.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:58:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
