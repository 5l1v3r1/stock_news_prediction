In addition, we maintained a conservative and flexible balance sheet at TEP,\" said Tallgrass Energy President and CEO David G. Dehaemers Jr. \"We steadily grew TEP through continued drop-down transactions, organic projects and third-party acquisitions.

(6) Common units represent the number of units as of the date of record for the fourth quarter distributions in both 2017 and 2016. Tallgrass Energy Financial Outlook and Guidance\nTallgrass Energy expects its Adjusted EBITDA to be $755 - $835 million and maintenance capital expenditures of $20 - $30 million for the year ending Dec. 31, 2018. Additionally, management expects distribution growth of 7 - 10 percent for TEP and 37 - 40 percent for TEGP if they were to each remain standalone entities for all of 2018.\nTallgrass Energy Adjusted EBITDA includes the Adjusted EBITDA for the assets owned by TEP as of Dec. 31, 2017, the additional 2 percent of Pony Express (acquired by TEP effective Feb. 1) and the distributions attributable to the additional 25.01 percent membership interest in REX (acquired by Tallgrass Equity on Feb. 7). Tallgrass Energy Adjusted EBITDA does not include our estimate of approximately $15 - $25 million of shipper deficiency payments that would be included in Distributable Cash Flow. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. For additional detail see \"Non-GAAP Measures\" below. For reconciliations of Tallgrass Energy Adjusted EBITDA for prior years, please refer to the \"Webcasts & Presentations\" section of the TEP investor relations site at www.tallgrassenergy.com .\nConference Call\nPlease join Tallgrass Energy for a conference call and webcast to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results at 3:30 p.m. Central Time on Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2018. Interested parties may listen via a link posted on the Investor Relations section of our website and the replay will be available on our website for at least seven days following the live call.\nTallgrass Energy Partners, LP Alternative Reconciliations\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, as defined in \"TEP's Non-GAAP Measures\" below, may be impacted by the timing of cash payments received as a result of shipper deficiency payments received or utilized during the period or incremental barrels shipped during the period. As such, we have also provided alternative reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow that illustrate the impact of these items. These alternative reconciliations are also non-GAAP Measures. Management believes this information provides investors useful information regarding the impact of these items on our current results as well as the potential impact on future results.\nAlternative Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands) 2017 2017 Adjusted EBITDA $ 173,213 $ 678,007 Add: Volumetric deficiency payments received, net (1) 543 27,182 Alternative Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 173,756 $ 705,189 (1) Cumulative net volumetric deficiency balance at Dec. 31, 2017, is $88.4 million. (2) Alternative Adjusted EBITDA shows what TEP's Adjusted EBITDA would have been for the period presented if TEP included net volumetric deficiency payments from shippers' firm, take-or-pay contracts in calculating Adjusted EBITDA. TEP's reported distributable cash flow and distribution coverage would remain unchanged. Alternative Reconciliation of Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands, except coverage) 2017 2017 Distributable Cash Flow $ 141,572 $ 611,286 Add: Cash flow impact of reduction in accumulated incremental volumes (1) 8,318 8,558 Alternative Distributable Cash Flow (2) 149,890 619,844 Less: Distributions (111,014 ) (415,716 ) Amounts in excess of distributions $ 38,876 $ 204,128 Alternative distribution coverage (2) 1.35 x 1.49 x (1) Accumulated incremental volume balance at Dec. 31, 2017, is $1.5 million. (2) Alternative Distributable Cash Flow and alternative distribution coverage show the impact of a reduction in accumulated incremental volumes. Incremental volumes (volumes shipped in excess of firm committed volumes) increase distributable cash flow during periods when shipped. Conversely, previously shipped incremental volumes reduce distributable cash flow during periods when they are utilized by a shipper to meet current period firm committed volumes, thereby reducing an accumulated incremental volume balance.

Tallgrass Energy GP, LP Deferred Tax Asset Adjustment\nTEGP is a limited partnership that has previously elected to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. As a result of the Dec. 22, 2017, passage of the legislation originally introduced as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, TEGP re-assessed the valuation of its deferred tax asset as of Dec. 31, 2017. TEGP recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 a non-cash deferred income tax expense of $183.5 million. $172.9 million of this deferred tax expense is the remeasurement of the deferred tax asset as a result of the reduced federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective on Jan. 1, 2018. After the remeasurement and as of Dec. 31, 2017, TEGP has a deferred tax asset of $313.0 million which is the expected tax benefit of available future deductions that offset future taxable income. It is currently expected that no cash taxes will be paid by TEGP for a period estimated to exceed 10 years.\nAnnual Report\nTEP and TEGP will file their 2017 Annual Reports on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on Feb. 13, 2018. A copy of the reports will be available for viewing through a link on the Tallgrass Energy website at www.tallgrassenergy.com or on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .\nTEP unitholders and TEGP shareholders may request a hard copy of the applicable Annual Report on Form 10-K (including complete audited financial statements) free of charge. Requests should be communicated in writing to either Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP for TEP unitholders or Tallgrass Energy GP, LP for TEGP shareholders; Attention: Investor Relations, 4200 W. 115th Street, Suite 350, Leawood, KS 66211.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that TEP management and external users of our consolidated financial statements and financial statements of our subsidiaries and unconsolidated investments, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n• our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods;\n• the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders;\n• our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n• the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various expansion and growth opportunities.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP, nor should Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow be considered alternatives to available cash, operating surplus, distributions of available cash from operating surplus or other definitions in our partnership agreement. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nWe generally define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding the impact of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash income or loss related to derivative instruments, non-cash long-term compensation expense, impairment losses, gains or losses on asset or business disposals or acquisitions, gains or losses on the repurchase, redemption or early retirement of debt, and earnings from unconsolidated investments, but including the impact of distributions from unconsolidated investments. We also use Distributable Cash Flow, which we generally define as Adjusted EBITDA, plus deficiency payments received from or utilized by our customers, less cash interest costs, maintenance capital expenditures, distributions to noncontrolling interests in excess of earnings allocated to noncontrolling interests, and certain cash reserves permitted by our partnership agreement. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see \"Summary Financial Information\" above.\nTEP is unable to project net cash provided by operating activities or net income attributable to partners to provide the related reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, because the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the volume and timing of deficiency payments received and utilized from our customers are out of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. TEP provides a range for the forecasts of Adjusted EBITDA to allow for the variability in the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, customer utilization of our assets, and maintenance capital spending and the impact on the related reconciling items, many of which interplay with each other. The timing of maintenance capital expenditures is volatile as it depends on weather, regulatory approvals, contractor availability, system performance and various other items. Therefore, the reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA to projected net cash provided by operating activities and net income attributable to partners is not available without unreasonable effort.\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nDisclosures in this press release contain “forward-looking statements.” All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that management expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this press release specifically include the belief that TEP will have a strong year in 2018 due to stable cash flows and attractive growth project opportunities, the Tallgrass Energy Financial Outlook and Guidance and that TEGP will not pay cash taxes for a period estimated to exceed 10 years. Forward looking statements may also include the expectations of plans, strategies, objectives and growth and anticipated financial and operational performance of TEP, TEGP and their subsidiaries, including: the ability to pursue expansions and other opportunities for incremental volumes; natural gas and crude oil production growth in TEP's operating areas; expected future benefits of acquisitions or expansion projects; timing of anticipated spending on planned expenses and maintenance capital projects; and distribution rate and growth, including variability of quarterly distribution coverage. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by TEP and TEGP based on management’s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of TEP and TEGP, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. These include risks relating to TEP and TEGP’s financial performance and results, availability of sufficient cash flow to pay distributions and execute their business plans, the demand for natural gas storage, processing and transportation services and for crude oil transportation services, operating hazards, the effects of government regulation, tax position and other risks incidental to transporting, storing and processing natural gas or transporting crude oil and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, including those set forth in reports filed by TEP and TEGP with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any forward-looking statement applies only as of the date on which such statement is made and TEP and TEGP do not intend to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nAbout Tallgrass Energy\nTallgrass Energy is a family of companies that includes publicly traded partnerships Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: TEP) and Tallgrass Energy GP, LP (NYSE: TEGP), and privately held Tallgrass Development, LP.
