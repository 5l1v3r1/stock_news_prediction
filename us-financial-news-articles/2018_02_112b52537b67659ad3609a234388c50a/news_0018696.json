Rogers, of rights group Global Diligence LLP. \nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case, which Sam Rainsy’s lawyers said had been brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. \nHun Sen’s Facebook profile was private, the Cambodian government spokesman added. \n“The Facebook profile of the Samdech Prime Minister is private, it’s not a terrorist group to cause any insecurity with any country,” said Phay Siphan, using the official title for Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 33 years. \nFacebook, which has more than 2 billion users globally, tells advertisers they have the potential to reach 6.6 million people in Cambodia, from a population of nearly 16 million. \nIt says more than 5.5 million people have expressed an interest in, or liked, pages related to Hun Sen, of whom 1.8 million are in Cambodia. \nComparable figures for Sam Rainsy are 2.2 million people expressing an interest, with 1.7 million within Cambodia.
