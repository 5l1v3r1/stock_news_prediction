Oxfam has neither confirmed nor denied that specific account but has said an internal investigation in 2011 confirmed sexual misconduct occurred, and it has apologized.\nThe charity is under threat of losing its British government funding over sexual misconduct accusations in Haiti and Chad.\nSenior staff have already left the charity. The former Haiti country director at the heart of the scandal denied on Thursday that he had paid for sex with prostitutes or abused minors.\nReporting by Ed Cropley; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:04:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
