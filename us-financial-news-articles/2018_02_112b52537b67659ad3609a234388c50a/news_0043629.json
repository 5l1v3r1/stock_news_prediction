Net income attributable to common units was $99 million for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $40 million compared to $59 million for fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for fourth quarter 2017 was $238 million, an increase of $20 million compared to $218 million for fourth quarter 2016. DCF for fourth quarter 2017 was $146 million, an increase of $14 million compared to $132 million for fourth quarter 2016.\nNet income attributable to limited partners for full-year 2017 was $436 million, an increase of $124 million compared to $312 million for full-year 2016. Net income attributable to common and subordinated units for full-year 2017 was $400 million, an increase of $110 million compared to $290 million for full-year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for full-year 2017 was $924 million, an increase of $51 million compared to $873 million for full-year 2016. DCF for full-year 2017 was $660 million, an increase of $21 million compared to $639 million for full-year 2016.\nFor fourth quarter 2017, DCF exceeded declared distributions to common unitholders by $8 million, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.06x. For full-year 2017, DCF exceeded declared distributions to common and subordinated unitholders by $109 million, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.20x.\nAdjusted EBITDA and DCF are non-GAAP financial measures, and this press release provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nMANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE\n“2017 marked an exceptional year of financial and operational performance, driven by our high-quality customer base, strategically-located midstream assets and dedicated employees,” said Enable Midstream President and CEO Rod Sailor. “For 2017, we exceeded our guidance for net income, Adjusted EBITDA and DCF while funding a meaningful portion of our capital investment program with internally generated cash flows.\n“Momentum from previously announced projects coming into service and increasing producer activity in our basins is driving demand for midstream services across our footprint and setting up Enable for another strong year of performance in 2018.”\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, per-day natural gas gathered volumes grew for the eighth consecutive quarter as a result of strong rig activity across Enable's footprint. As of Feb. 5, 2018, there were 49 rigs across Enable's footprint that were drilling wells expected to be connected to Enable's gathering systems. Thirty-five of those rigs were in the Anadarko Basin, 10 were in the Ark-La-Tex Basin, two were in the Arkoma Basin and two were in the Williston Basin.\nEnable was awarded a 10-year, fee-based natural gas gathering contract with approximately 138,000 gross acres of dedication in the Arkoma Basin. This contract will support drilling activity that is primarily focused on dry gas areas of the Arkoma Woodford Shale. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Enable's Bear Den crude oil gathering system had first flow on its 8.4 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) system expansion.\nEnable Gas Transmission, LLC (EGT) entered into a 3-year, 100,000 dekatherms per day (Dth/d) firm transportation agreement with an Anadarko Basin producer. This transportation agreement provides access to delivery points on the west side of the EGT system that connect to downstream markets in the West and Midwest. The new contract contributes to Enable's 1.1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of contracted market solutions for growing SCOOP and STACK production since 2015, including the CaSE, Line AD Expansion and Bradley Lateral projects on EGT and Project Wildcat in Enable's Gathering and Processing segment. Intrastate transportation deliveries also increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the continued supply growth in the Anadarko Basin.\nEnable's previously announced Wildcat, CaSE and Muskogee projects remain on schedule. Project Wildcat, a 400 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) rich natural gas takeaway solution from the Anadarko Basin to North Texas, is expected to be in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018. The CaSE project, a 205,000 Dth/d firm natural gas transportation solution for growing Anadarko Basin production, is expected to be fully in service by the fourth quarter of 2018. The Muskogee project, a 20-year, 228,000 Dth/d firm transportation service agreement with Oklahoma Gas and Electric on the Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission (EOIT) system, is expected to commence service in late 2018.\nIn January, EGT announced a non-binding open season for 600,000 Dth/d of capacity on EGT's Line CP. The open season included a foundation shipper that subscribed to a total of 300,000 Dth/d of firm capacity for a primary term of seven years. The open season closed in early February, and EGT is currently evaluating the bids received.\nKEY OPERATING STATISTICS\nNatural gas gathered volumes were 4.11 trillion British thermal units per day (TBtu/d) for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of 29 percent compared to 3.19 TBtu/d for fourth quarter 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher gathered volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, partially offset by lower gathered volumes in the Arkoma Basin.\nNatural gas processed volumes were 2.16 TBtu/d for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of 17 percent compared to 1.85 TBtu/d for fourth quarter 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher processed volumes in the Anadarko Basin.\nNGLs produced were 108.18 MBbl/d for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of 34 percent compared to 80.55 MBbl/d for fourth quarter 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher natural gas processed volumes and higher plant recoveries.\nCrude oil gathered volumes were 28.86 MBbl/d for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of 32 percent compared to 21.93 MBbl/d for fourth quarter 2016. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the Bear Den system and the commissioning of multi-well pads on the Bear Den and Nesson systems.\nInterstate transportation firm contracted capacity was 5.79 Bcf/d for fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of 19 percent compared to 7.14 Bcf/d for fourth quarter 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower contracted firm transportation volumes between Carthage, Texas, and Perryville, Louisiana.\nIntrastate transportation average deliveries were 1.94 TBtu/d for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of 13 percent compared to 1.71 TBtu/d for fourth quarter 2016. The increase was primarily related to increased supply in the Anadarko Basin.\nFOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nRevenues were $806 million for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $192 million compared to $614 million for fourth quarter 2016. Revenues included $163 million of intercompany eliminations for fourth quarter 2017 and $119 million of intercompany eliminations for fourth quarter 2016.\nGathering and processing segment revenues were $657 million for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $192 million compared to $465 million for fourth quarter 2016. The increase in gathering and processing segment revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenues from NGL sales resulting from higher average NGL prices and higher processed volumes in the Anadarko Basin, an increase in revenues from sales of natural gas as a result of higher gathering volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, an increase in natural gas gathering revenues due to higher fees and gathered volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, an increase in processing service revenues resulting from higher processed volumes in the Anadarko Basin and an increase in revenues from changes in the fair value of condensate and NGL derivatives. Transportation and storage segment revenues were $312 million for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $44 million compared to $268 million for fourth quarter 2016. The increase in transportation and storage segment revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenues from higher natural gas sales associated with higher sales volumes, an increase in revenues from changes in the fair value of natural gas derivatives, an increase in revenues from off-system transportation, an increase in revenues from NGL sales due to an increase in transported volumes and NGL prices and an increase in realized gains on natural gas derivatives. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in firm transportation services between Carthage, Texas, and Perryville, Louisiana.\nGross margin was $361 million for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $47 million compared to $314 million for fourth quarter 2016.\nGathering and processing segment gross margin was $235 million for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $43 million compared to $192 million for fourth quarter 2016. The increase in gathering and processing segment gross margin was primarily due to an increase in natural gas sales due to higher gathering volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, an increase in processing margins resulting from higher average NGL prices and higher processed volumes in the Anadarko Basin, an increase in gathering margin due to increased gathered volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins and an increase in gross margin from changes in the fair value of condensate and NGL derivatives. Transportation and storage segment gross margin was $129 million for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $7 million compared to $122 million for fourth quarter 2016. The increase in transportation and storage segment gross margin was primarily due to an increase in gross margin from changes in the fair value of natural gas derivatives, an increase in NGL sales due to an increase in transported volumes and NGL prices, an increase in off-system transportation margins and an increase in realized gains on natural gas derivatives. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in firm transportation services between Carthage, Texas, and Perryville, Louisiana, and a decrease in system management activities.\nOperation and maintenance and general and administrative expenses were $116 million for fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of $6 million compared to $122 million for fourth quarter 2016. The decrease in operation and maintenance and general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in loss on sale of assets and a decrease in materials and supplies and contract services costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in payroll-related costs and a reduction in capitalized overhead costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $99 million for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $9 million compared to $90 million for fourth quarter 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of the Align Midstream, LLC acquisition and additional assets placed in service.\nTaxes other than income tax were $17 million for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $2 million compared to $15 million for fourth quarter 2016. The increase was primarily a result of higher accrued ad valorem taxes due to additional assets placed in service.\nInterest expense was $31 million for fourth quarter 2017, an increase of $6 million compared to $25 million for fourth quarter 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates on outstanding debt as a result of a long-term debt issuance in first quarter 2017 that resulted in the repayment of amounts outstanding under Enable's revolving credit facility and an increase in the amount of debt outstanding.\nEnable’s net income attributable to limited partners and net income attributable to common units for fourth quarter 2017 includes a $4 million loss on derivative activity, compared to a $21 million loss on derivative activity for fourth quarter 2016, resulting in an increase in net income of $17 million. The increase of $17 million is comprised of an increase related to the change in fair value of derivatives of $19 million and a decrease in realized gain on derivatives of $2 million. Additional details on derivative instruments and hedging activities can be found in Enable’s 2017 Form 10-K.\nCapital expenditures, including the acquisition of Align Midstream, were $464 million for fourth quarter 2017, compared to $94 million for fourth quarter 2016. Expansion capital expenditures, including the acquisition of Align Midstream, were $416 million for fourth quarter 2017, compared to $44 million for fourth quarter 2016. Maintenance capital expenditures were $48 million for fourth quarter 2017, compared to $50 million for fourth quarter 2016.\nQUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS\nAs previously announced, on Feb. 9, 2018, the board of directors of Enable’s general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.318 per unit on all outstanding common units for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017. The distribution is unchanged from the previous quarter. The quarterly cash distribution of $0.318 per unit on all outstanding common units will be paid on Feb. 27, 2018, to unitholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 20, 2018.\nAlso, as previously announced, the board declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.625 on all Series A Preferred Units for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017. The quarterly cash distribution of $0.625 on all Series A Preferred Units outstanding will be paid on Feb. 15, 2018, to unitholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 9, 2018.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nEnable reaffirms the 2018 outlook presented in its third quarter 2017 financial results press release dated Nov. 1, 2017.\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nA conference call discussing fourth quarter results is scheduled today at 10 a.m. Eastern.

For more information, visit http://www.enablemidstream.com .\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nEnable has included the non-GAAP financial measures Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio in this press release based on information in its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nGross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio are supplemental financial measures that management and external users of Enable’s financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies may use, to assess:\nEnable’s operating performance as compared to those of other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis; The ability of Enable’s assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to its partners; Enable’s ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and The viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nThis press release includes a reconciliation of Gross margin to total revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to net income attributable to limited partners, Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and Adjusted interest expense to interest expense, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as applicable, for each of the periods indicated. Distribution coverage ratio is a financial performance measure used by management to reflect the relationship between Enable’s financial operating performance and cash distributions. Enable believes that the presentation of Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio provides information useful to investors in assessing its financial condition and results of operations. Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, total revenue, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Additionally, because Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio may be defined differently by other companies in Enable’s industry, its definitions of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nSome of the information in this press release may contain forward-looking statements.
