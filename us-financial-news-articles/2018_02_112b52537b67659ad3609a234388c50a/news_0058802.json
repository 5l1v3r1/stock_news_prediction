Multiple private blockchain-related companies who are looking to go public have presented themselves to HIPH. In order to operate on the forefront of cutting-edge blockchain technology, HIPH felt the necessity to create an advisory board with some of the best the blockchain sector has to offer.\n“Because blockchain is an open, distributed ledger, it allows anyone to securely enter a business transaction with someone else without needing to go through a trusted intermediary and, with its proven ability to cut out the middleman, while still retaining security, speed and functionality; it is the perfect fit to HIPH’s model as a diversified holding company.” Stated Ryan Fishoff, CEO American Premium Water Corporation. Fishoff continued, “Acquisitions in this space are sure to magnify the strength of American Premium Water Corporation’s (OTC: HIPH) income statement and balance sheet, while maximizing shareholder value, which is our utmost priority.”\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that it has retained International Monetary (IM) to lead the company’s efforts in evaluating and arranging financing for blockchain acquisition opportunities. IM has established relationships within the private and public sector and has the deep pool of investment groups along with the knowledge base that will guide HIPH into this new exciting sector. “IM has had a successful track record in emerging growth markets and has the relationships that will help add accretive value to HIPH. IM understands the different facets of the blockchain ecosystem, including crypto marketplaces, coins, tokens, ICO’s and DAO’s, which will be instrumental for us as they guide our evaluation of different opportunities”, said Alfred Culbreth, Founder of American Premium Water Corporation (OTC Pink: HIPH)\nIM ( www.IntlMonetary.com ) was established by Blaine Riley to service the emerging growth sectors, especially in technology. One of IM’s primary focuses is on M&A combined with arranging debt/equity financing for small and mid-cap companies under $1 billion. In addition to evaluating acquisitions, IM provides advisory services related to international licensing, commercialization of intellectual property, research and development resources, and investor awareness services.\nRyan Fishoff, CEO of American Premium Water Corporation (OTC Pink: HIPH) commented, “I’m happy to join forces with IM. Their expertise in emerging sectors like the blockchain & crypto related fields will be an asset to HIPH. The blockchain space is a huge growth sector and there have been multiple opportunities coming our way. We created our own advisory board, our internal group, which will appraise and evaluate different acquisition opportunities over the coming months. Looking at the success IM has had with other microcap companies in our space like nFusz, I am quite confident that they replicate for HIPH.”\nMr. Riley commented, “My firm is looking forward to assisting the HIPH team. I think there is tremendous opportunity for the company to enter the blockchain space, and we are excited to help guide Ryan and senior management as the company looks at acquisition opportunities in the sector. We foresee that blockchain marketplaces may become businesses’ key sources for liquidity in the next 5-7 years and feel that HIPH can capitalize off this disruption in the short, and especially, long term.”\n“The blockchain/crypto space is certainly a high growth area. I see lots of exponential growth in this sector. We brought IM in to help source and qualify these acquisition candidates, so that they will ultimately increase shareholder value. I am looking to build a company founded on premium brands and goods and I would be remiss to ignore this sector. I am optimistic that with IM’s assistance, we will be able to evaluate and close on opportunities in the blockchain/crypto space that will complement our existing brands, which cover the luxury apparel and CBD market. We will only entertain opportunities that will add revenue and increase shareholder value for the company”, added Mr. Fishoff.\nMr. Fishoff concluded, “Our exploration of blockchain/crypto opportunities will not change the company’s focus on its core premium brands LALPINA and Gents. We are still on track to release LALPINA Hydrogen CBD before the end of June as we have previously announced. The Cannabidiol industry has tremendous growth potential, and we feel that LALPINA Hydrogen CBD, being the first to market in this category, can capture market share quickly. Gents continues to be a growth story as we are working on a number of collaborations and brand extensions of which, I look forward to providing updates to our shareholders and the investment community. I also expect that I will be able to give a full update on any blockchain M&A by the end of the 1 st quarter 2018, or sooner.”\nAmerican Premium Water Corporation (OTC Pink:HIPH), parent company of LALPINA Hydrogen, LALPINA Hydrogen CBD and Gents, is in the midst of a growth and expansion plan. Ryan Fishoff, CEO of HIPH, has outlined a strategic growth plan for 2018 focusing on the organic growth of the subsidiary brands as well as acquisitive M&A to increase top and bottom line revenue. Reviewing opportunities in the blockchain space fall within that mandate.\nThe company has recently announced the development of hydrogen-infused CBD prototype, LALPINA Hydrogen CBD, in addition to its LALPINA Hydrogen energy drink. LALPINA had a presence at Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis, MN along with Gents. The company will provide an update on its M&A efforts in the blockchain space no later than the end of the 1 st quarter 2018.\nPlease follow us on our social media outlets listed here:\n@americanpremium\n@lalpinawater\n@GentsCo\n#Gentsco\n#lalpinahydrogen\nFor more information on American Premium Water Corporation/HIPH, go to www.LalpinaHydrogen.com/Investor-Page.html\nGents, the New York-based Gents is a producer of luxury hats and other fine accessories and apparel.
