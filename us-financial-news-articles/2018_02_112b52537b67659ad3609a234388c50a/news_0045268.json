Petra has denied this.\nThe company has also been hit by the strengthening of the South African rand. Miners in South Africa pay costs in rand and earn revenue in dollars.\nThe company’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization fell to $80.1 million in the six months ended Dec. 31, from $87.1 million a year ago.\nPetra said output rose 9.6 percent to 2.2 million carats (mcts) in the first half, while carats sold fell 5.2 percent to 1.8 million due to the blocked diamond parcel not being sold.\nThe company said it expects to produce 2.4 – 2.5 mcts in the second half and added that it expects 2018 revenue in line with consensus.\n“The diamond market is currently experiencing positive momentum post the healthy Christmas sales period, with pricing up about 3 percent to 4 percent sequentially on a like-for-like basis based on the company’s first tender for the second half of the year,” Petra said.\nThe company, which is currently at peak debt levels at $644.7 million, also said it has sufficient banking facilities to meet its working capital and capital development requirements and it maintains headroom against its revised financial covenants going forward.\nIt expects net debt of about $600 million by June 30, at the higher end of the $560 million to $600 million range it forecast in January.
