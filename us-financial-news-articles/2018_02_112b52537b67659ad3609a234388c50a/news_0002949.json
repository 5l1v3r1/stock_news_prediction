But it said it would reconsider an IPO if market conditions become more supportive.\nLast year Cabot was aiming to raise 195 million pounds through the listing, which was led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\nCabot's adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 19 percent to 214.3 million pounds ($304 million) in the first nine months of 2017.\nArrow Global, Cabot's closest comparable listed rival, traded down sharply around the time of Cabot's proposed IPO. Since then it has recovered more than 10 percent.
