The proposal valued Persidera at 290 million euros, one of the sources added.\nI Squared could not be reached for immediate comment.\nVivendi last year agreed to sell TIM’s 70 percent stake in Persidera to win antitrust approval for its own plan to gain de facto control of the Italian phone group. The remaining 30 percent is owned by Italian media group GEDI.
