This raised concerns about access to, and use of, consumer data.\nEstimates of the size and breakdown of the German online advertising market vary, but the cartel office put it at between 5 billion and 9 billion euros ($6.2-$11.2 billion) last year.\nGoogle, a unit of tech giant Alphabet, and Facebook are estimated to have taken half of online ad revenue worldwide in 2017 and more than 60 percent in the United States, according to research firm eMarketer.\nThe anti-trust office said it was investigating the sector, and not individual firms. It would hold meetings and do survey research this spring as a basis for its final report.\n“We will cooperate fully with the Bundeskartellamt on this sector inquiry and welcome the opportunity to share our insights on the dynamic and competitive nature of the advertising industry,” a Facebook spokesperson said.\nGoogle also said it would cooperate fully, but declined further comment.\n($1 = 0.8046 euros)\nReporting by Douglas Busvine and Emma Thomasson; Editing by Mark Potter and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:48:56.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
