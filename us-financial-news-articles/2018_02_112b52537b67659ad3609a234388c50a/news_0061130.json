Bonuses across the industry were also low, and some hedge funds have chosen to exit energy trading.\nKoch “made adjustments to its global commodity trading presence to better reflect the current market opportunities,” said spokesman Rob Carlton, adding it would retain an active presence in commodity markets globally.\nHe declined to comment and the scope of the layoffs.\nSources said at least 10 traders globally had been let go at Koch as the company seeks to optimize under-performing units.\nOn Monday, trader AOT Energy separately said it had reduced some staff, including parting ways with its senior management team in Houston, and earlier this year pared its European distillates and U.S. Gulf Coast fuel oil business due to shrinking margins.\nSeveral key commodities traders left Goldman Sachs Group Inc earlier this year, sources said, as the Wall Street firm seeks to turn around its struggling commodities unit.\nCommodity-focused hedge funds including Andy Hall’s Astenbeck Capital Management and Texas tycoon T. Boone Pickens’ BP Capital have shuttered some operations in recent months.
