Qualcomm's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is scheduled for March 6, 2018.\nIn its February 16, 2018 report, ISS stated 1 :\n\"The election of four Broadcom nominees to the 11-member board seems to offer a reasonable path to a negotiated deal, which is likely to be the most beneficial path for shareholders.\"\n\"Qualcomm's optimistic vision of the future would likely resonate more effectively among shareholders if the company's track record was more like that of its would-be acquirer.\"\n\"The deterioration of [Qualcomm's] fundamentals, combined with the significant underperformance relative to peers and the SOX index, calls into question Qualcomm's business model, and what kind of long-term return shareholders should expect over the next transition to the 5G technology.\"\n\"…much of Qualcomm's promised cost cuts, the board has argued, will come from reduced SG&A expenses once it can unwind its ongoing legal campaign. The open question, it seems, is how long it will be until the next legal showdown expands SG&A once again.\"\n\"The assertion that certain customers and regulators might be very receptive to a revamp of Qualcomm's approach to licensing seems credible.\"\n\"Broadcom is well known for its expertise with integration of acquired companies. Its M&A strategy has helped the company drive 1,173.5 percent shareholder return over the same period Qualcomm delivered 74.2 percent TSR.\"\n\"…Broadcom's more extensive experience with regulatory proceedings would seem to provide a better reference point for timing than Qualcomm's own lengthy process with NXP. Based on the frequency and complexity of Broadcom's acquisitions, and the two companies' historical relationship with regulators, a timeline for regulatory approval of one year does not seem unreasonable.\"\n\"[W]hile the proportionality of the Qualcomm board's future responses to any new information remains to be seen, the tenor of its engagement leading up to the present raises questions as to whether the incumbent board is committed to playing its part in attempting to maximize the offer.\"\n\"…Samih Elhage seems well qualified to assess the upside potential inherent in Qualcomm's 5G strategy, a key component of the company's standalone plan. Julie Hill's role as an independent director of a large investment manager would also provide the board with a shareholder viewpoint. John Kispert's previous experience with large-cap mergers in the semiconductor space, particularly his exposure to another highly acquisitive firm, Cypress Semiconductors, could prove valuable as well. Lastly, Harry You brings CEO and CFO experience at several large, publicly traded technology companies, as well as many years' experience as an investment banker - skill sets that could benefit potential negotiations.\"\nCommenting on the report, Broadcom issued the following statement:\nWe are pleased that ISS is recommending that Qualcomm stockholders vote on the BLUE card. It is important that Qualcomm stockholders vote for ALL six Broadcom nominees on the BLUE card to elect a majority of new board members so that Qualcomm stockholders will have the opportunity to obtain the benefit of Broadcom's best and final offer for Qualcomm of $82 per share.\nBy voting the BLUE card for all six nominees, Qualcomm stockholders will show support for Broadcom's highly compelling, best and final $82 per share offer. At $82 per Qualcomm share – which consists of $60 in cash and $22 in Broadcom stock – Broadcom is offering Qualcomm stockholders a significant cash premium plus the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of the combined company. Broadcom is also offering substantial deal certainty with downside protection in the form of an $8 billion reverse termination fee and a ticking fee. Broadcom remains confident in its ability to complete the transaction within approximately 12 months following the signing of a definitive agreement.\nVote the BLUE Proxy Card Today!
