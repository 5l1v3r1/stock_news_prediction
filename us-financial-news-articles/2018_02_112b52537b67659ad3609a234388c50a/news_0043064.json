Three friends and I were climbing up a narrow gorge, carved into a snow-packed peak on Norway’s Senja island, our skis strapped to our backs. The cliffs edging the gorge were an icy gray, the sky nothing but pale clouds, and the blanket of snow we wallowed through, at some points waist deep, was hypnotically white.\nOur plan: to reach the summit and ski back down—a sure-to-be-sublime run down 2,000 feet of pure powder, straight to the shore of the slate-hued Norwegian Sea. But the extraordinary effort threatened to crush our morale. “I don’t know if we’re gonna make it to the top,” huffed one friend, an exceptionally fit skier and endurance athlete. \nSenja exists a world away from the realm of glamorous, pampering winter holidays. The island boasts snowy-wonderland scenery and incredibly varied terrain, but nary a ski lift, let alone a ski resort. The Norwegian government forbids heli-skiing, so you can’t easily fast-track to the tops of its mountains. If you want to ski beautiful Senja, you better want it enough to climb its peaks first. \nSki touring along the coastline of Senja. Photo: Re Wikstrom Only 8,000 or so Norwegians live on the country’s second largest island; visitors largely bypass it. Senja lies at a latitude of close to 70 degrees north, comfortably inside the Arctic Circle and suitably difficult to access. The remoteness was palpable: Oslo felt as distant as New York, and we seemed to have the island all to ourselves.\nUntil recently, Senja was more or less isolated from mainland Norway. A connecting bridge was built in the 1970s, but some tiny villages dotting the island’s west coast, where the best skiing is found, remained too tough to reach over the mountains. Only in the last decade and a half have authorities burrowed several new tunnels under the peaks, giving cars access. \nExploring the island of Senja the old-fashioned way. Photo: Re Wikstrom The 600-square-mile, fjord-riven island is as Norwegian as you can get: Fishing fuels the economy and most residents choose Nordic skiing when it comes to recreation. To visit neighbors or a store, locals still cruise around snowy streets on kick-sleds (traditional Scandinavian sleds propelled by a foot push) and the island’s tourism page lists trolls and goblins as possible diversions, along with reindeer and the northern lights. A few scattered small hotels operate, catering to tourists during the summer season and aurora chasers during polar night.\nI knew next to nothing about Senja before the trip. An offhand comment by a Norwegian friend initially piqued my interest, but further research yielded little information about skiing on Senja. I found a few guidebooks...written in Norwegian. From what I could piece together, it sounded like a great adventure, a travel mystery of the sort you rarely encounter in our ultra-connected world.\nWith three experienced ski friends on board, I bought flights to Oslo and Bardufoss, the closest airport to Senja, and booked accommodations for the week at Senja Lodge, a place I only discovered via my Norwegian friend. This fisherman’s house turned bare-bones hostel hosts skiers and mountaineers in Medfjordvaer, one of the largest villages on the island’s west coast. \nCLUB RED The author’s friends, Brandyn Roark and Rachael Burks, ski touring outside of Medfjordvaer. Photo: Re Wikstrom We showed up in late April, when ski season has typically receded to a memory in most places, and found Senja still covered in meters of snow. Medfjordvaer consisted of a few dozen traditional, colorful homes, a sometimes-open grocery and restaurant, a dock full of fishing boats and our lodge. \nThe four of us piled into one small room with four bunk beds, and spent most of our time there in the communal kitchen or living room, chatting with Bent, a mountain guide who owns the lodge, and the other guests. Three gregarious, 50-something Finnish men had driven from Helsinki in a spectacularly shiny Jaguar, with their own ski guide and chef in tow.\nNevertheless, they seemed thrilled with their sardine-can-size bunkroom and told us they had come to Senja to learn the ropes of backcountry skiing. “It is amazing,” one told me. “All the free nature, everything opens up in ski touring.” \nAs experienced backcountry skiers, my friends and I planned to guide ourselves. Still, I pried some information about avalanche and snow stability conditions from Bent, our laconic host. Our first day, we climbed and skied Keipen, a relatively easy peak that took just a few hours to ascend with climbing skins on our skis. The summit overlooked the sea to the east and west. We skied down in the pink alpenglow that lasted late into evening.\nRachael Burks skiing a couloir on Senja. Photo: Re Wikstrom After dinner, while we pored over topographical maps searching for more demanding areas to ski than Keipen, Bent pointed to 2,000-foot Husfjellet mountain. ”The world’s short approach couloir is right there,” he said, indicating the gorge. It’s easy to find, he said, right next to the road. “You can’t miss it, if you’re looking up,” he added, before drifting out of the room.\nThe next day we drove along a desolate, snowy coastal road, eyes glued upward. We spotted the couloir and crammed our rental into a snowbank to keep the narrow road passable. After hours of creeping up the mountain like four inchworms, we flew back down the mountain in glorious, arcing turns on pristine powder, in a fraction of the climbing time. \nBack in Medfjordvaer, after stopping to take photos at the dock, we chatted with a fisherman who gifted us fresh-caught cod to cook up at the lodge. \nWe spent the rest of the trip doing much the same—opening the topo maps, looking up at the peaks and charting our own path. There was no one to see our tracks and be impressed, no distractions of après-ski cocktails, nothing but a few other skiers happy with their own daily accomplishments. \nAuthor Brigid Mander and friends Brandyn Roark and Rachael Burks in the Senja village of Senjahopen.
