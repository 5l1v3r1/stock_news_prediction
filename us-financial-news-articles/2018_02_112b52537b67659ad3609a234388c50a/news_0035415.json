Prices are now 23 percent below the peak hit at the height of a property bubble a decade ago.\nOn the month, house prices rose by 0.5 percent, after a 1 percent rise in November. However, growth over the last three months moderated to 1.8 percent, the slowest pace of expansion by that measure in seven months.
