We believe this is very good for, once again, thinking jointly about oil,” he said.\nDmitriev also said the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the Saudi Public Investment Fund and Aramco planned to invest in several projects through their joint energy platform including in Russia’s Eurasia Drilling, a major independent driller.\n“We expect to finalize an agreement very shortly to have our energy platform with Saudi Aramco invest in Eurasia Drilling and also provide services to Saudi Aramco,” Dmitriev said.\nAn announcement is expected later on Wednesday on a partnership between Aramco and a liquefied natural gas project in Russia, Dmitriev said.\nRussia also has significant investments in Saudi Arabia’s petrochemicals industry, he said.\nSibur, Russia’s largest producer of petrochemicals, is building a petrochemicals facility in the kingdom. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak had said in October the deal would be worth $1.1 billion.\n“Sibur, jointly with us, is building a petrochemical facility focused on ... manufacturing, which is really one of the big Russian projects in Saudi Arabia and underscores the potential for cooperation in petrochemicals,” he added.\nIn October, Russia and Saudi Arabia announced a $1 billion fund to invest in energy projects.\nDmitriev also said a global deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers to cut crude supply was stabilizing the oil market.\nRussia and Saudi Arabia are leading the supply deal, which runs until the end of 2018.\nReporting by Rania El Gamal; Writing by Maha El Dahan; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T15:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:44:13.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
