That suit is set to go to trial in March.\nThe results demonstrate that Time Warner Inc’s risk may be limited if the Department of Justice “defies our expectation and succeeds in its antitrust suit,” Barton Crockett, a B. Riley FBR analyst wrote in a note.\nAd revenue was up two percent for its Turner division, which includes TBS, CNN and TNT, due to higher revenues associated with Major League Baseball post-season games and growth in Turner’s international networks.\nRevenue from Warner Bros, which includes the movie business and is the company’s biggest unit by revenue, rose 4.8 percent to $4.05 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $4.03 billion, according to data and analytics firm FactSet.\n\"Justice League,\" featuring Israeli actress Gal Gadot and American actor Ben Affleck, had grossed more than $655.9 million globally as of Jan. 28, according to tracking firm Box Office Mojo. ( bit.ly/2FtGPrn )\nRevenue from Home Box Office (HBO), home to hit fantasy show “Game of Thrones,” rose 12.7 percent to $1.68 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $1.65 billion, according to data and analytics firm FactSet.\nHBO premium channel has more than 5 million online streaming subscribers, up from 2 million a year ago, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday.\nThose online subscribers come from all online streaming offerings it works with, including its own HBO Now as well as Amazon’s Amazon Channels, AT&T&rsquo;s DirectTV Now and Sony Vue.\nThe company’s net income attributable to shareholders surged to $1.39 billion, or 1.75 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to a gain of $1.06 per share related to changes to U.S. tax laws.\nIn the year-ago quarter, the company earned $293 million, or 37 cents per share.\nRevenue rose 9 percent to $8.61 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $8.42 billion. According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, Time Warner’s adjusted EPS was $1.60 per share, while the average analyst estimate was $1.43.\nReporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T18:08:02.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
