He was sentenced in January and February in two separate hearings to 40 to 175 years and 40 to 125 years in prison.\nAround 200 women, including Olympic gold medal-winning gymnasts Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber, gave courtroom statements at the sentencing hearings about Nassar’s abuse, leading to the resignation of the USA Gymnastics’ board.\nMichigan State’s president and athletic director have resigned.\nThe Department of Education said in a statement that its probe would center on whether Michigan State met requirements under Title IX, a federal law that bars sexual discrimination in schools that receive federal funding.\nA sign for Michigan State University is seen near the campus in East Lansing, Michigan, U.S., February 1, 2018.
