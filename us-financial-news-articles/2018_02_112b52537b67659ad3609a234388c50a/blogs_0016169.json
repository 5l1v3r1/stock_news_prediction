Ron Antonelli—Bloomberg/Getty Images By Laignee Barron 10:37 PM EST \nAmerica can keep running on Dunkin’, so long as it’s ready to switch to paper cups. Dunkin’ Donuts (dnkn) announced Wednesday that it’s doing away with its controversial, non-recyclable foam coffee cups, and will instead start using only double-walled paper cups by 2020. \nIn California and New York, the move is expected to start even sooner, with a rollout this spring. The new paper cups are already in use at a store in the company’s birthplace, Quincy, Massachusetts. \nThe New England-based fast-food company said in a statement that it’s making the eco-friendly switch “to serve both people and the planet responsibly.” \nDunkin’ Donuts’ foam cups have previously stoked controversy , with environmental activists targeting the cups for being non-recyclable and containing styrene, a potential carcinogen. Some communities even banned the use of Dunkin’s styrofoam cups, which forced the company to start coming up with alternative ways to serve its signature hot coffee — a goal it named as a top priority back in 2000. \nDunkin’ Donuts is the latest in the fast-food industry to adopt more environmentally conscious packing and ditch foam. Starbucks (sbux) launched reusable cup goals in 2008 , while McDonald’s (mcd) last month announced its own no-foam goal with a 2019 global timeline. \nDunkin’ Donuts’ sustainability kick has also featured a shift to Rainforest Alliance-certified coffee beans and a pledge to transition to cage-free eggs by 2025, SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T05:37:42.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
