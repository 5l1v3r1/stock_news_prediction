REUTERS/Brendan McDermid In Norway, the University of Oslo will this spring start building a 7,000-square-feet (650 square meters) climate museum thanks to a donation of nearly $9 million, said a spokeswoman.\nThe Klimahuset (Climate House) has big ambitions.\nThe museum - its designers call it a “climate machine” - will open with an exhibition that will include a section tracking the “fingerprints” left on the atmosphere by carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas, said project leader Torkjell Leira by phone.\nIn Britain, entrepreneur Joe Inglis was in talks with the University of Oxford’s School of Geography in the hope of creating a first British climate change museum, dubbed Climatic. His initial plans stalled but he hopes to resurrect the dream.\nMore than 500 museum staff have joined Canada’s Coalition of Museums for Climate Justice, hoping to push their places of work into staging more exhibits on the issue, said a spokesman.\nA man looks at a photo of ice cores drilled from the depths of the Greenland Ice Sheet, displayed as part of an installation called '88 Cores' by artist Peggy Weil at New York's Climate Museum inaugural show, featured at the Parson's School of Design in New York City, U.S., February 6, 2018.
