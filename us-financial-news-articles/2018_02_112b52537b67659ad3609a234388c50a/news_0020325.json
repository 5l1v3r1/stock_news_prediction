A crossing was opened till they exited, and then it was closed,” the commander said. \nThe Syrian army could not be reached for comment. A Syrian military statement said troops and allied forces had gained control of several towns in rural parts of Hama, Idlib, and Aleppo provinces. \n“The strategic importance of this achievement is that it ends the presence of the terrorist Daesh organization in both Aleppo and Hama provinces,” the statement said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State The advance also secures supply routes between Hama and Aleppo and links them to the southeast desert near the Iraqi border, it said. \nThe military said it had destroyed militant targets, and made no mention of a corridor letting Islamic State fighters depart. \n“The regime started the operation against this pocket seven days (ago). Suddenly they were able to take 80 villages and towns after giving them a corridor,” said Rami Abdulrahman, director of the Observatory, a Britain-based war monitoring group. \nHasan Haj Ali, commander of the Free Idlib Army rebel group, confirmed the report. Ali said his fighters were taking part in clashes against some 200 Islamic State fighters who had arrived in southern Idlib early on Friday. \n“This morning at dawn we were surprised by the joint treachery by the regime and Daesh,” he told Reuters. Clashes were under way in the village of Lweibdeh, he said. “They have six armored vehicles with them.” \nA source in the Ahrar al-Sham faction said Islamic State fighters had pushed into south Idlib from government territory. \n“The rebel factions are repelling Daesh attempts to advance,” the source said. “The regime’s militias opened a gap helping the besieged Islamic State forces pass.” \nIdlib is the largest chunk of Syrian territory held by insurgent factions opposed to President Bashar al-Assad’s government. Islamist factions, including al Qaeda’s former affiliate in the Syrian war, dominate the province.
