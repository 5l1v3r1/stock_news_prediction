Excluding the revenue from RAPID and the impact of discontinued services, revenue increased 26.1 percent compared with the prior year’s fourth quarter. Adjusting for the positive impact on revenue from foreign currency exchange rates, revenue growth was 28.3 percent. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The number of unique product developers and engineers served totaled 16,985 in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 20.9 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a record $14.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) resulted in a current period net benefit of $1.9 million, with a benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities partially offset by deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. Non-GAAP net income, excluding the after-tax expense of stock compensation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition costs, impairment on assets, unrealized foreign currency gains and the net benefit in the current period resulting from the Tax Act was $15.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nAdditional Fourth Quarter 2017 Highlights include:\nGross margin was 56.2 percent of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 55.7 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016.

We were especially pleased with the growth of revenue from our CNC business, up 37.6 percent organically. We continue to enhance our technology to further expand the services that we can provide to our customers.”\nFull Year 2017 Highlights include:\nRevenue increased 15.6 percent to $344.5 million compared with $298.1 million in 2016. Adjusting for the $3.6 million revenue contribution from RAPID, and the impact of discontinued services, adjusted revenue totaled $340.4 million, an increase of 16.1 percent compared to 2016. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Net income for 2017 increased to $51.8 million, or $1.93 per diluted share compared with $42.7 million, or $1.61 per diluted share in 2016. Non-GAAP net income, excluding the after-tax expense of stock compensation, amortization of intangibles, impairment of assets, acquisition costs, unrealized foreign currency gains, legal settlement and the net benefit in the current period resulting from the Tax Act was $57.4 million, or $2.14 per diluted share. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Cash generated from operations during the year totaled $81.7 million.\nAdditional 2017 Highlights include:\nCompletion of our acquisition of RAPID manufacturing in the fourth quarter.

These accomplishments have positioned us well for continued, sustainable growth in both revenue and earnings. Our customer focus will continue in 2018 as we continue to evolve our sales approach to develop deeper customer relationships, further advance each of our four service offerings, and increase the scale of our operations, with an initial focus on integrating the RAPID acquisition.” concluded Holt.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company has included non-GAAP adjusted revenue growth that excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and non-GAAP adjusted revenue growth that excludes the impact of acquired and discontinued businesses in this press release to provide investors with additional information regarding the company’s financial results.
