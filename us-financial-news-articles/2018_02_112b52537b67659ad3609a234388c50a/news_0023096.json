A presentation of the results by the Company's senior management team will take place today at 10.00 am CET in Oslo – details below.\nRichard Godfrey, Chief Executive Officer of BerGenBio, commented: \"BerGenBio has made solid progress during 2017 and achieved all of the milestones we outlined at the time of our IPO in April. We have advanced, as planned, our clinical development strategy for bemcentinib, the recently accepted generic name for our lead candidate BGB324, such that it is now being evaluated in six Phase II clinical studies in multiple cancer indications. These trials are designed to deliver initial proof-of-concept of bemcentinib's potential as a future cornerstone of cancer therapy in combination with immuno-oncology drugs, chemo- and targeted therapy. Initial clinical data presented during the year continue to give us confidence that bemcentinib is a very exciting drug candidate with broad application across many types of cancer, and in combination with existing and emerging modalities of cancer treatment. We will continue to drive these trials towards interim read outs in mid-2018 and look forward to an exciting year ahead.\"\nQ4'17 highlights\nFirst patients enrolled and dosed in Phase II trials of bemcentinib (BGB324) in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

The Company is a world leader in understanding the essential role of AXL kinase in mediating cancer spread, immune evasion and drug resistance in multiple aggressive solid and haematological cancers.\nBerGenBio's lead product, bemcentinib (BGB324), is a selective, potent and orally bio-available small molecule AXL inhibitor in four Company sponsored Phase II clinical trials in major cancer indications, with read-outs anticipated during 2018. It is the only selective AXL inhibitor in clinical development.\nThe Company sponsored clinical trials are:\nBemcentinib with TARCEVA® (erlotinib) in advanced EGFR mutation driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Bemcentinib with KEYTRUDA in advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung, and Bemcentinib with KEYTRUDA in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Bemcentinib as a single agent and combination therapy in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) / myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS)\nThe clinical trials combining bemcentinib with KEYTRUDA in adenocarcinoma of the lung and TNBC are conducted in collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. (Kenilworth, NJ, USA), through a subsidiary.\nIn addition, a number of investigator-sponsored trials are underway, including a trial to investigate bemcentinib with either MEKINIST® (trametinib) plus TAFINLAR® (dabrafenib) or KEYTRUDA in advanced melanoma, as well as a trial combining bemcentinib with docetaxel in advanced NSCLC.\nBerGenBio is simultaneously developing a companion diagnostic test to identify patient subpopulations most likely to benefit from treatment with bemcentinib. This will facilitate more efficient registration trials and support a precision medicine based commercialization strategy.\nThe Company is also developing a diversified pre-clinical pipeline of drug candidates, including BGB149, an anti-AXL monoclonal antibody.\nFor further information, please visit: www.bergenbio.com\nKEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, TARCEVA® is a registered trademark of OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC., marketed by Roche-Genentech.
