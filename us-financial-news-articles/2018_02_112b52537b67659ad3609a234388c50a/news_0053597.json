(NYSE: FIX), a leading provider of mechanical services including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, piping and controls, today announced net income of $7.5 million or $0.20 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $16.9 million or $0.45 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted for the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets for the corporate tax rate reduction of $9.5 million, were $0.45 per diluted share. The Company reported revenue of $461.1 million in the current quarter, as compared to $392.1 million in 2016. The Company reported free cash flow of $30.3 million in the current quarter, as compared to $35.7 million in 2016. Backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $948.4 million as compared to $901.2 million as of September 30, 2017 and $763.4 million as of December 31, 2016.\nBrian Lane, Comfort Systems USA’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “2017 was another strong year for Comfort Systems USA. Our fourth quarter was marked by strong earnings and year over year quarterly revenue growth of 17.6%, including same store revenue growth of 10.9%. Bookings remain a source of optimism, as our backlog has continued to build, increasing by 5.2% on a same store basis since the third quarter. Our backlog has increased since last year by more than $185.0 million, including $155.0 million in same store backlog growth.”\nThe Company reported net income of $55.3 million or $1.47 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $64.9 million or $1.72 per diluted share, in 2016. Earnings per share for 2017, adjusted for the fourth quarter remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and a first quarter goodwill impairment, were $1.74 per diluted share. The Company also reported revenue of $1.79 billion, as compared to $1.63 billion in 2016. Free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $80.0 million, as compared to $69.0 million in 2016.\nMr. Lane continued, “We wrote off $9.5 million in deferred tax assets at year end, and our after-tax earnings and cash flow will benefit in future periods from the tax rate reduction starting in 2018. We estimate that our effective tax rate in future periods will be 10% to 11% lower than our normalized rates have averaged in the past. We are anxious to invest the additional cash flow to grow our business, benefit our employees and reward our shareholders.”\nMr. Lane concluded, “Increased investment appetite from private companies, together with our investments over the last few years to prepare for growth, have positioned us for continued success. Our backlog is strong, and our ongoing prospects are good. We remain optimistic that Comfort Systems USA will continue to grow and improve.”\nAs previously announced, the Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss its financial results and position in more depth on Friday, February 23, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time.
