Analysts expect rates to go to 2 percent in the first quarter of 2019.\nMarkets see an 80 percent probability the Bank of Canada will raise rates in May, while a hike is fully priced in for July.\nHow heavily indebted Canadians will handle the rate hikes the central bank has already put in place is another risk factor policymakers have said they are closely watching.\nConsumer debt in Canada has ballooned in the years since the global financial crisis, with much of that going to a housing market where prices have climbed, particularly in the major cities of Toronto and Vancouver.\nTighter mortgage lending rules put in place at the start of the year have already dampened house resales and economists expect the central bank will be wary of moving too aggressively and risking a more disorderly pullback in the market.\nAs well, the province of British Columbia, home to Canada’s most expensive real estate market, earlier this month announced it will crack down on real estate speculators by expanding its foreign buyers tax and introducing a new speculation tax.\n“It wouldn’t be appropriate to increase the policy rate further knowing that the British Columbia housing market is about to begin a challenging adjustment period,” said Sebastien Lavoie, chief economist at Laurentian Bank of Canada.\nPolling by Kailash Bathija; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:53:06.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
