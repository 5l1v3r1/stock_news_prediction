There is less fish and some exporters need more fish to comply with their contracts”, said one producer who declined to be named.\nAn exporter, who also declined to be named, confirmed the price rise.\n“In Northern Norway we are at 63-64 crowns per kilo and about 64-65 crowns for deliveries in Oslo,” said the exporter, who agreed that the lack of supply was pushing up prices.\nSalmon prices peaked at around 80 crowns per kilo in early January of 2017 at a time when supply constraints supported prices, but have since fallen as volumes grew.\nProduction growth from Norway is expected to be around 9 percent in 2018, the Norwegian Seafood Council predicted in early January.\nLater on fish farmers have cut their expectations for growth to somewhat less than that level.\nNorway is the world’s top salmon exporter, and the share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish.\nAverage production costs for whole fish, including the cost of harvesting, rose by 13 percent to 34.29 crowns per kilo in 2016, according to data from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries.\nLeading Norwegian producers include Marine Harvest, Salmar, Leroy Seafood, Grieg Seafood and Norway Royal Salmon.
