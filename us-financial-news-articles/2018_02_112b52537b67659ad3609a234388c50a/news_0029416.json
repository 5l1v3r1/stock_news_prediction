The pair were the first North Korean athletes to qualify for the Games but it was unclear for several months whether they would actually compete in South Korea. The sense of anticipation was palpable at the Gangneung Ice Arena before the pairs short programme.

In the stands, they rhythmically chanted the skaters’ names as they waived flags of the country. A small group of university students supporting better inter-Korean ties brandished a banner that read: “Pyeongchang fairy Ryom Tae Ok, jump toward unification!” Skating to an instrumental cover of “A Day in the Life” by the Beatles, the pair cleanly executed all the elements of their programme with a technically-sound performance that earned them a personal best score of 69.40 points.

The skaters were the first North Koreans to qualify for the Games after they finished in the top six at a competition in Germany in September North Korea did not have any athletes at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games. They have sent 22 athletes to compete in Pyeongchang, including 12 ice hockey players in a combined North and South Korean women’s team.
