That stimulus is in addition to the Republican-led Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December, which is estimated to deliver $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over next decade. And interest payments will add $420 billion to the national debt over that same time frame, pushing the deficit above $2 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget. The current budget deficit is $440 billion.\nGetty Images President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with state and local officials to unveil his administration's long-awaited infrastructure plan in the State Dining Room at the White House February 12, 2018 in Washington, DC. Together, this is slated to expand the deficit by more than 5 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of this year, according to some estimates. While likely to spur economic growth and activity in the immediate term, the spending and borrowing expansion could also foreshadow a significant uptick in inflation.\nThe Federal Reserve may therefore have to step on the gas just to counter all this fiscal stimulus and issuance of new debt, and as a result Treasury bond yields and rates could rise, risking a further fall for equities. Markets plummeted at the start of last week and entered correction mode on the back of spiked yields and stronger-than-expected U.S. wage and employment data . Companies experience higher borrowing costs when yields rise and investors grow more cautious of investing in their stock.\nInflation data posted Wednesday came out at 0.5 percent for January, up from a previous 0.4 percent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was higher on Thursday morning at around 2.962 percent.\nshow chapters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T12:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T12:33:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
