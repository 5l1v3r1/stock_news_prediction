Poling. \"Construction markets are healthy, and we are optimistic about our key commercial growth programs as well as the technology investments we are making to deliver value to our customers.”\n\"Our net sales increased 11% with strong growth in North America and Europe. Higher sales and restructuring program savings produced Adjusted EBIT growth of 16% despite raw material inflation. We also completed two acquisitions. Ductilcrete Technologies provides specialty concrete flooring systems, while Contek's quality control software offers value to concrete producers and enhances our VERIFI ® product offering.”\nFourth Quarter 2017:\nNet sales increased 10.7% with sales excluding acquisitions growing 6.7% Gross margin increased 70 basis points to 37.9% due primarily to lower pension costs, partially offset by higher raw material inflation Adjusted gross margin of 38.2% decreased 210 basis points as increased raw materials costs were partially offset by higher price. We announced price increases to recover higher costs and recapture margins. Adjusted EBIT* of $38.2 million increased 16.1% and Adjusted EBIT margin increased 60 basis points to 13.2% as higher sales volumes and restructuring program savings were partially offset by increased inflation Net loss from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders was $69.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net loss of $5.6 million for the prior-year quarter. The change was primarily due to $81.7 million of income tax expense related to our provisional estimate of the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nFourth Quarter Segment Performance\nSpecialty Construction Chemicals\n( $ Millions )\nQ4 2017 % Change FY 2017 % Change Net sales $166.6 6.0% $615.7 (1.3)% Net sales, constant currency* $164.9 4.9% $630.1 1.0% Gross margin 35.2% (190) bps 35.5% (140) bps Segment operating income $18.9 —% $63.4 (12.7)% Segment operating margin 11.3% (70) bps 10.3% (130) bps Net sales increased 6.0% primarily as a result of higher concrete admixtures sales in North America and Europe, as well as growth in cement additives and our VERIFI ® In-transit Concrete Management System Gross margin decreased 190 basis points as increased raw materials costs were partially offset by higher price Segment operating income was unchanged compared to prior year period\nSpecialty Building Materials\n( $ Millions )\nQ4 2017 % Change FY 2017 % Change Net sales $122.9 17.9% $468.7 10.9% Net sales, constant currency* $120.6 15.7% $469.8 11.1% Gross margin 42.3% (280) bps 43.5% (300) bps Segment operating income $28.8 14.7% $109.4 (4.0)% Segment operating margin 23.4% (70) bps 23.3% (370) bps Net sales increased 17.9%.

See the tables herein for important information regarding these measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nNM - Not meaningful.\nSale of Darex Packaging Technologies\nOn July 3, 2017, GCP completed the sale of Darex to Henkel for $1.06 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments. GCP recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of Darex of approximately $880.8 million during 2017, or $678.9 million after income taxes. Darex has been reclassified and reflected as \"discontinued operations\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.\nRestructuring and Repositioning Expenses\nOn June 28, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a restructuring and repositioning plan. Upon completion of the plan, the Company expects to achieve a net annualized cost reduction of approximately $24 million to $28 million. The Company expects approximately $9 million to $13 million to benefit continuing operations, while approximately $15 million relates to discontinued operations. During the year-ended December 31, 2017, we achieved a net cost reduction of approximately $13 million, of which $7 million and $6 million relates to continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses from continuing operations were $13.5 million for 2017. Repositioning expenses related to the plan were $9.8 million for 2017, substantially all of which represent professional fees and employee-related costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $14.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $16.8 million for the prior year period. The decrease reflects the repayment and extinguishment of the Company's Term Loan in the third quarter of 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense attributable to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $82.1 million, compared with $6.7 million for the prior year, representing effective tax rates of 290.1% and 19.0%, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rate year-over-year was primarily due to income tax expense related to the Company's provisional estimate of the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Company is assessing the implications of the Act, but anticipates that it will lower GCP's future effective tax rate and is evaluating the potential for increased cash flow flexibility that the Act may provide.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook 1\nGuidance 2018 Net Sales, Constant Currency Growth of 5% to 10% Adjusted EBIT $135 million to $150 million Adjusted EPS (2)(3) $0.84 to $1.03 Adjusted Free Cash Flow $35 million to $45 million 1 GCP guidance figures assume average 2017 FX rates carried forward into the guidance period.\n2 Includes effective tax rate of 28% to 31%, which reflects the Company's current estimate of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n3 Assumes 72 million shares outstanding.\nInvestor Call\nGCP has scheduled a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET today to review its 2017 results and full year outlook.

In the table, the Company presents financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures, which it describes below in further detail. GCP believes that the non-GAAP financial information supplements its discussions about the performance of its businesses, improves period-to-period comparability and provides insight to the information that management uses to evaluate the performance of its businesses. Management uses non-GAAP measures in financial and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting, and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes, as these measures provide additional transparency to GCP's core operations.\nIn the table, the Company has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered substitutes for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the financial results that the Company calculates and presents in the table in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as well as the corresponding reconciliations from those results, should be carefully evaluated.\nConstant currency means current period revenue in local currency translated using prior period exchange rates. GCP uses constant currency in assessing trends in sales excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBIT (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be net income from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders adjusted for interest income; interest expense and related financing costs; income taxes; currency and other financial losses in Venezuela; costs related to legacy product, environmental and other claims; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; gains and losses on sales of businesses, product lines and certain other investments; third-party and other acquisition-related costs; amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustments; and certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends (such as legal settlements). GCP uses Adjusted EBIT to assess and measure its operating performance and in determining performance-based compensation. GCP uses Adjusted EBIT as a performance measure because it provides improved period-to-period comparability for management's decision-making and compensation purposes and because it allows management to measure the ongoing earnings results of the Company's strategic and operating decisions.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be Adjusted EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization. GCP uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure in making significant business decisions.\nThe Company defines Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be earnings per share (\"EPS\") on a diluted basis adjusted for costs related to legacy product, environmental and other claims; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; gains and losses on sales of businesses, product lines and certain other investments; third-party acquisition-related costs; other financing costs associated with the modification or extinguishment of debt; certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends; and certain discrete tax items. GCP uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure to review its diluted earnings per share results on a consistent basis.\nThe Company defines Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be gross profit adjusted for pension-related costs included in cost of goods sold; loss in Venezuela included in cost of goods sold; and amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment. Adjusted Gross Margin means Adjusted Gross Profit divided by net sales. Management uses this performance measure to understand trends and changes and to make business decisions regarding core operations.\nThe Company defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be net cash provided by or used for operating activities minus capital expenditures plus cash paid for restructuring and repositioning; taxes paid for repositioning; capital expenditures related to repositioning; accelerated payments under defined benefit pension arrangements; and expenditures for legacy items. GCP uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure to evaluate its ability to generate cash to support its ongoing business operations, to invest in its businesses, to provide a return of capital to shareholders and to determine payments of performance-based compensation.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be Adjusted EBIT (on a trailing four quarters basis) divided by the sum of net working capital, properties and equipment and certain other assets and liabilities. Management uses Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital as a performance measure to review investments and to make capital allocation decisions.\nAdjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBIT Margin and Adjusted Free Cash Flow do not purport to represent income measures as defined under U.S. GAAP. These measures are provided to investors and others to improve the period-to-period comparability and peer-to-peer comparability of GCP's financial results and to ensure that investors understand the information GCP uses to evaluate the performance of its businesses.\nAdjusted EBIT has material limitations as an operating performance measure because it excludes costs related to income and expenses from restructuring and repositioning activities, which historically has been a material component of our net income. Adjusted EBITDA also has material limitations as an operating performance measure because it excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. GCP's business is substantially dependent on the successful deployment of capital, and depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of its costs. GCP compensates for the limitations of these measurements by using these indicators together with net income as measured under GAAP to present a complete analysis of its results of operations. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated together with net income measured under GAAP for a complete understanding of GCP's results of operations.\nThe Company does not provide GAAP earnings on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to estimate with reasonable certainty unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP.\nGCP Applied Technologies Inc.\nAnalysis of Operations

Invested Capital (non-GAAP) 20.2 % 30.2 % Amounts may not add due to rounding. (A) GCP's segment operating income includes only GCP's share of income of consolidated joint ventures.\n(B) Management allocates corporate costs to each segment to the extent such costs are directly attributable to the segments. Corporate costs include $5.4 million and $10.3 million of allocable costs in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Such costs did not qualify to be reclassified to discontinued operations and, therefore, were not allocated. As of the third quarter of 2017, the Company began allocating these costs to its remaining operating segments. (C) Certain pension costs include only ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which include service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs/credits. SCC and SBM segment operating income and corporate costs do not include any amounts for pension expense. Other pension-related costs including annual mark-to-market adjustments, actuarial gains and losses, gains or losses from curtailments and terminations and other related costs are excluded from Adjusted EBIT. These amounts are not used by management to evaluate the performance of the GCP businesses and significantly affect the peer-to-peer and period-to-period comparability of our financial results. Mark-to-market adjustments, actuarial gains and losses and other related costs relate primarily to changes in financial market values and actuarial assumptions and are not directly related to the operation of the GCP businesses. (D) Legacy product, environmental and other claims include costs relating to businesses that are no longer part of GCP's core business portfolio. These businesses were divested or otherwise ceased operations; however, GCP retains certain risks and obligations, which we refer to as legacy liabilities. The principal legacy liabilities are product and environmental liabilities.
