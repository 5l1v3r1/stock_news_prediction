The Capitals outshot Tampa Bay 37-19.\nTo boost their blue line, the Capitals acquired defenseman Michal Kempny from the Chicago Blackhawks on Monday for a conditional third-round draft pick. Kempny was a scratch but he could make his debut Thursday against the Florida Panthers.\nWashington, which was coming off a hard-fought 3-2 win over Buffalo on Monday, could not get much going offensively early against Tampa Bay\nThe Lightning took advantage of an interference penalty on the Capitals’ Brett Connolly with a goal by Point just 2:30 into the opening period. Tampa Bay took a 2-0 lead with four minutes remaining when Kunitz deflected a longs shot by Andrej Sustr past Braden Holtby. The Lightning continued to maintain the pressure and had a three-goal cushion when Point scored again two minutes later.\nThe Capitals pulled to within 3-1 on a power-play goal by Lars Eller with 10:28 left in the second period.
