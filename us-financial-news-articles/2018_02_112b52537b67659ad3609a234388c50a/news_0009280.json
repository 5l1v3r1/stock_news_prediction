The pan-European index hit a two-month low in early dealing, having given back all the gains it made in the exuberant new year rally.\nAmong major European equity markets, only Spain and Italy are still higher than at the turn of the year, with the UK the worst performer.\nAll sectors were in the red on Monday, but the sell-off hit the highest valued parts of the market hardest, with tech stocks falling 1.6 percent.\nChipmaker AMS, one of the best-performing European stocks last year, fell 4.5 percent. Siltronic tumbled 3.7 percent while BE Semiconductor fell 3 percent.\nResults also weighed on some stocks. Ryanair fell 3.5 percent after the airline struck a cautious tone about fares and potential disruption from pilot unions, though it reported rising profits.\nTravel and leisure stocks were among the worst-performing, down 1.3 percent as shares in airlines Air France, easyJet, IAG and Lufthansa fell.\nFiat Chrysler fell 2.7 percent after sources told Reuters late on Friday that the U.S. Justice Department was seeking “substantial” fines in the emissions case against the Italian carmaker.\nA downgrade to “sell” from DNB drove Hexpol shares down 5 percent, the worst-performing company on the STOXX index.
