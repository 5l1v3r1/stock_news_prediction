Rover’s Seneca Lateral is not the same pipe as REX’s Seneca Lateral.\nOfficials at Energy Transfer Partners LP, that owns Rover, said the pipeline was operating safely.\nOverall flows on the Rover pipe were expected to decline to about 0.9 bcfd on Wednesday from an average of over 1 bcfd over the past couple of weeks, the Reuters data showed.\nOne bcfd of gas is enough to power about five million homes.\nMPLX LP’s MarkWest Energy unit owns the MarkWest Seneca processing plant in Ohio.\nCompanies that operate pipelines in the vicinity have shut their facilities as a precaution, said Chasity Schmelzenbach, director of Noble County Emergency Management Agency.\nReporting by Arpan Varghese, Eileen Soreng and Swati Verma in Bengaluru and Scott DiSavino in New York; Editing by Richard Chang and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:43:44.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
