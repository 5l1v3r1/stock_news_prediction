I’ll try to do the same like my first run, concentrate on my skiing, stay calm and give my best,” she said.\nShiffrin, who won gold in the giant slalom on Thursday, is bidding to become the first skier to successfully defend an Olympic slalom title following her triumph in Sochi in 2014.\nThe 22-year-old was confident she could make up the time on Holdener in the second leg.\n“It’s really nice, the surface is still really nice. You can be super clean, unfortunately I wasn’t clean enough,” she told reporters.\n“But I‘m looking forward to the second run. I don’t think it will take anything special, just skiing clean,” she said.\nThe 24-year-old Holdener, who has yet to win a World Cup race in slalom, could become the first Swiss to win Olympic slalom medal since Vreni Schneider in 1994.\nAfter the top 20 skiers had completed their opening runs, Sweden’s Frida Hansdotter (49.09) and Anna Swenn Larsson (49.29) were second and third fastest.\n“That was fun,” said Hansdotter, “I‘m happy with that run... Nice to have my team mate up high as well ... if we can stay like this at the end it would be a dream.”\nThere was a disappointing run from Slovak contender Petra Vlhova, second in the World Cup slalom standings this season, who was 2.23 seconds behind Holdener.\nThe second leg begins at 13:15 local (0415 GMT).\nAdditional reporting by Ian Ransom and Rory Carroll; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:01:28.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
