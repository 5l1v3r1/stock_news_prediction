Ayari has been in office since 2012.\nAbassi is the World Bank representative for Tunisia’s neighbor Libya, according to the lender’s website. He holds a doctorate in economics from the Sorbonne University in Paris.\nChahed heads a coalition of Islamists and secularists who have been trying to reduce the country’s budget deficit by imposing austerity measures, including tax hikes on some goods on Jan 1, as part of steps agreed with the country’s foreign lenders.\nThe measures triggered protests last month as many normal Tunisians say they are materially worse off than before the 2011 revolution.\nAnnual inflation rose to 6.9 percent in January, the highest level in 20 years, from 6.4 percent in December, the statistics office said on Tuesday.\nWhile tourism revenues climbed somewhat last year as the number of visitors rose by 23 percent, protesters calling for jobs brought Tunisia’s entire phosphate output to a halt last week with sit-ins at installations of the sole local producer.\nIn another blow to the economy, the European Union in December included Tunisia on a blacklist of 17 jurisdictions it deemed tax havens.\nEuropean lawmakers confirmed the decision on Wednesday, according to parliament’s website, saying Tunisia was among the countries deemed a “high risk” for money laundering and “terrorist financing”.\nReporting by Tarek Amara; Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Toby Chopra and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T01:42:19.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
