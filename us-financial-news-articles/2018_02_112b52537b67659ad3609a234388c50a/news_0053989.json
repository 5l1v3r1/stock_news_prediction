But their suppliers are still feeling the squeeze and trying to cope with low profitability.\nSince 2015 Schlumberger and Subsea 7 have collaborated for some of their work in designing, building and laying oil and gas production installations that lay on the seabed.\nThe two firms are now aiming to build a 50-50 joint venture that would deliver subsea installations, maintenance and repair services.\n“The proposed joint venture will give us the opportunity to capitalize on the synergies already established and significantly improve subsea economics over the lifetime of the field,” Schlumberger said in a statement.
