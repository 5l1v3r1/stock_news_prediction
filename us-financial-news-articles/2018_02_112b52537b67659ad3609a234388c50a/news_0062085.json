Maxx and Marshalls stores, recorded comparable-store sales that rose 3 percent, beating estimates of 1.5 percent. \nFor the first quarter, TJX also forecast adjusted earnings of 85 cents to 87 cents per share, below average analysts’ estimate of 99 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nExcluding items, the company earned $1.19 per share. Net sales rose 15.8 percent to $10.96 billion. \nAnalysts on average had expected the company to earn $1.28 per share on revenue of $10.76 billion. \nReporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T16:12:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
