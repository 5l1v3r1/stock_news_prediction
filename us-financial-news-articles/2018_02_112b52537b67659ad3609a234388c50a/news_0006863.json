Bundesen recently won $710,00 for copyright and trademark infringement. \nThe offending party is Grenade Beverage, the maker of Grumpy Cat Grumpuccino, which tried to sell other unlicensed Grumpy Cat products, NPR reports . \nEver since she clawed her way to internet fame, Grumpy Cat's likeness has been licensed for use on calendars, books, toys and more. She even became the official \"spokescat\" for Nestle Purina PetCare's Friskies brand in 2013. \nWhile how much she's made has been widely disputed , Grumpy Cat (whose real name is Tardar Sauce), has raked in serious money since her photo went viral on Reddit nearly six years ago . \nOf course, internet fame can be a double-edged sword — just ask disgraced YouTuber Logan Paul .
