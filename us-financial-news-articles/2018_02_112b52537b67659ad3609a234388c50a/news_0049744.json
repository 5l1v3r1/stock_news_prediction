Reuters reported on Saturday that Indian banks could take a hit of more than $3 billion from loans and corporate guarantees provided to diamond companies, according to a tax department note.\n“It could continue to impact for some more time. The issue of its impact on the entire PSU banking system will keep markets edgy,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research, Motilal Oswal Securities.\nThe broader NSE index was down 1.3 percent at 10,316.20 as of 0642 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 1 percent lower at 33,670.65.\nThe Nifty PSU bank index dropped as much as 3.2 percent to its lowest since October 2017.\nUCO Bank slumped as much as 12.3 percent to its lowest since April 2009 after the state-run lender said it had $411.82 million in exposure to fraudulent transactions carried out at PNB.\nCity Union Bank declined as much as 5.3 percent after its chief executive said “cyber criminals” hacked the bank’s systems and transferred nearly $2 million via unauthorised remittances to lenders overseas.\nThe Nifty IT index dropped as much as 0.9 percent on profit-taking, after having gained over 6 percent this year as of Friday’s close.\nShares of air carriers rose after the aviation regulator said passengers carried by domestic airlines rose nearly 20 percent to 11.5 million in January.\nBhushan Steel Ltd surged by its daily limit of 19.9 percent after the Economic Times newspaper reported that Tata Steel Ltd emerged as the front runner to buy the debt-laden firm.
