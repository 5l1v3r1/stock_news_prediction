LEVEL PLAYING FIELD \nThe Commission proposed in the presentation that in seeking to ensure a level playing field after Brexit the EU should follow the principle of non-lowering of existing standards. \nOne of the ways to do that could be to include the non-regression clause in a FTA with Britain, similar to ones in trade agreements with Japan or Canada. \n“The Parties shall not encourage trade and investment by relaxing or lowering the level of protection provided by their respective domestic environmental or labour laws and regulations,” the clause in the Japan agreement says. \n“To this effect, the Parties shall not waive or otherwise derogate from such laws and regulations or fail to effectively enforce them through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction, in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties,” it says. \nTo make sure Britain abided by the agreement the EU and Britain would have to agree on a way to resolve disputes and also on enforcing the deal, including various sanctions. \nThe EU’s sanctions options included the “suspension of obligations, temporary compensations, financial sanctions, cross retaliation,” and “interim measures need to be available in some areas” like state aid. \nThe EU could also “blacklist” Britain as a non-cooperative jurisdiction on tax matters.
