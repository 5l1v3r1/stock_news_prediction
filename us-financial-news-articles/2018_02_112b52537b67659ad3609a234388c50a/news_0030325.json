Romana, told reporters late on Tuesday after diplomats from both sides met for the second time under a bilateral mechanism aimed at defusing longstanding maritime tensions. \nHe said the decision to form a working group on cooperating on energy was a “breakthrough”. \nForming an agreement for a joint project would be extremely complex and sensitive as both countries claim jurisdiction of the site of the oil and gas reserves, so sharing them could be deemed legitimizing the other side’s claim, or even ceding sovereign territory. \nThe idea of joint development was first hatched in 1986, but disputes and the sovereignty issue have stopped it from materializing. \nBut time is of the essence for the Philippines, which relies heavily on energy imports to fuel its fast-growing economy. That is complicated by estimates that its only domestic natural gas source, the offshore Malampaya field, will be depleted by 2024. \nSta. Romana said a second coordinating group was created to address sovereignty issues and “to prevent any crisis from escalating”. \nThe Philippines in 2011 accused Chinese ships of harassing a survey vessel hired by a Forum Energy, which won a contract to explore oil and gas in the Reed Bank, near the Spratly. \nThe Philippines went the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2013 to question that, among other bones of contention. \nThe tribunal’s 2016 ruling, which China refuses to recognize, included clarifying that the Reed Bank was within the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone of the Philippines and therefore it had sovereign rights to exploit resources there. \nA senior Philippine official also said Southeast Asian countries and China would next month start negotiations on a long-awaited maritime code of conduct. \nReporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T08:46:33.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
