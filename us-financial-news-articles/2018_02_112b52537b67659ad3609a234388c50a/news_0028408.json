But in recent years jihadists have extended their reach into wetter, more populated central regions. \nThey have also used Mali as a launchpad for raids into neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger, including one last October that killed four U.S. Special Forces soldiers. \nLate last month, a landmine explosion in Mopti region killed 26 people and wounded several others, many of them from Burkina Faso. Two days later, unidentified gunmen killed at least 14 soldiers in a pre-dawn assault on a military camp in central Mali.
