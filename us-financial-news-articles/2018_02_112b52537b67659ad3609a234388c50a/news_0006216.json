He did not name the countries involved in investigations.\nEarlier this week, Japanese authorities said they would investigate all cryptocurrency exchanges in the country for security gaps and ordered Tokyo-based Coincheck to raise its standards after hackers stole $530 million of digital money from the exchange.\nHe said the foundation confirmed the transfer of some of the stolen coins to two exchanges, adding that it appeared the purpose of the transactions was to test the tracking system rather than moving the coins.\nReporting by Takahiko Wada; Writing by Taiga Uranaka; Editing by Malcolm Foster and Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T12:03:05.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
