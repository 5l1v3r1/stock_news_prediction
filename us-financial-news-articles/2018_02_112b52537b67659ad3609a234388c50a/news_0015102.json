Of course, he wants to score goals and win titles but I cannot say anything more about this.” \nKane has attracted interest from major European clubs in recent seasons, with Real Madrid’s former president Ramon Calderon stating in October that he expected the Spanish club to try to sign the forward. \n“He is so happy here and he loves Tottenham but this is a personal question, regarding what he thinks and how he feels. I cannot answer for him,” Pochettino added.

I am worried. It’s a sport that we love, a passionate sport that people love to watch around the world,” the Argentine added. \n“We will be pushing that sport into a very rigid structure with VAR, with being focused too much on the small actions like this,” he added. \nTottenham host north London rivals Arsenal in a league match at Wembley on Saturday.
