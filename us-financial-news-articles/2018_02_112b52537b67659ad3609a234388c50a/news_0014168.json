The Dow had a more than 930-point difference between its high and low on Tuesday. \nThe sharp declines in recent days marked a pullback long-awaited by investors after the market minted record high after record high in a relatively calm ascent. \n“When you get these periods of intense panic, it makes sense to be buying while others are forced sellers but on the other hand you don’t know that the negative mood will go away quickly,” said Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management in London. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.07 points, or 0.24 percent, to 24,286.68, the S&P 500 lost 13.09 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,635.85 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.63 points, or 0.04 percent, to 6,964.90. \nDefensive sectors utilities and real estate lagged, while technology and consumer discretionary were among the top-performing sectors.
