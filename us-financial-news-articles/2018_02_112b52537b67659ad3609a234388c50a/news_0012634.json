Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos declined to comment. \nThe lawsuit is one of many over the years accusing U.S. banks of favoring male bankers, traders and financial advisers over their female counterparts, and permitting improper conduct. \nErin Daly claimed that Citigroup stripped her of client contact and responsibilities because of her gender, in an effort to reduce her to a “glorified secretary” because its “boys’ club” policies dictated that “the men were doing business.” \nSullivan agreed with Citigroup that Daly’s whistleblower claim under the federal Sarbanes-Oxley governance law was stale because Daly brought it two years after her December 2014 dismissal, missing a 180-day deadline. \nHe also said Citigroup’s having allegedly alerted a U.S. brokerage regulator, the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), about shortcomings in Daly’s work did not create a “continuing violation” that meant the 180-day limit had not run. \nThe plaintiff, a resident of Manhattan’s Upper West Side, had sought double back pay, unpaid bonuses and punitive damages. \nThe case is Daly v. Citigroup Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-09183.
