(NYSE:LSI) a leading national owner and operator of self storage properties, reported operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company achieved net income attributable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $21.1 million or $0.45 per fully diluted common share. This compares to net income attributable to common shareholders of $18.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, or $0.39 per fully diluted common share.\n“Our same store performance exceeded guidance as a result of gains in both same store revenue and occupancy. Topline improvement was supported by stronger traction in organic search and continued attraction of business customers,” commented David Rogers, Chief Executive Officer. “Despite near-term industry headwinds, we look toward 2018 with the confidence that we’ve made our company stronger than ever. We have a brand that resonates with the consumer, an expanded business model that includes third party management and joint ventures, and one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. These are essential ingredients that provide us with the ability to grow shareholder value over the long term,” concluded Mr. Rogers.\nHighlights for the 4 th Quarter Included:\nIncreased same store revenue by 1.3% and same store net operating income (\"NOI\") (1) by 0.4% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Grew same store average occupancy for the quarter by 70 basis points to a record high 91.6% compared to the same period in 2016 and quarter-end occupancy by 60 basis points to 91.0% at December 31, 2017. Achieved adjusted funds from operations (“FFO”) (2) per fully diluted common share of $1.34. Paid a quarterly dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock. Completed a public debt offering of $450 million of 10-year notes at an annual interest rate of 3.875%.\nHighlights for the Full Year Included:\nIncreased same store revenue by 1.7% and same store net operating income (\"NOI\") by 0.6% as compared to 2016. Grew management and acquisition fee income by 62% year over year. Achieved adjusted funds from operations (“FFO”) per fully diluted common share of $5.31 compared to $5.19 in 2016. Acquired 29 high-quality assets with its joint venture partners for a total cost of $549.9 million, and two certificate of occupancy facilities for its own portfolio for a total cost of $22.2 million. The Company also entered into an agreement to lease one property with an option to purchase the asset in 2020 at a price of $14.1 million. Added 18 facilities to its 3 rd party management platform, with an additional 15 under contract.\nFunds from operations for the quarter were $1.09 per fully diluted common share compared to $1.28 for the same period last year. Absent a $10.6 million charge associated with the debt refinancing and a $0.9 million cost related to an officer’s retirement, adjusted FFO per fully diluted common share was $1.34 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted FFO per fully diluted common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $1.31.\nOPERATIONS:\nTotal revenues increased 3.4% over last year’s fourth quarter while operating costs increased 6.3%, resulting in an NOI increase of 2.0%.\nRevenues for the 430 stabilized stores wholly owned by the Company since December 31, 2015 increased 1.3% from those of the fourth quarter of 2016, the result of a 70 basis point increase in average occupancy and increases in tenant insurance administrative fees.\nSame store operating expenses increased 3.2% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year period. Higher property taxes and payroll and benefits were offset by lower maintenance expenses. Consequently, same store NOI this period increased 0.4% over the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were essentially flat with those in the 4 th quarter of 2016, primarily due to reduced legal and other expenses, offset by officer retirement costs.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company experienced same store revenue growth in 21 of its major markets in the same store pool. Overall, the markets with the strongest revenue impact include New England; Buffalo, NY; Beaumont, TX and all Florida markets.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, revenues at the 430 properties owned since December 31, 2015 increased by 1.7% over those of the full year in 2016. Operating costs increased by 4.1% over those of the prior year, inclusive of a 6.6% increase in property taxes. Net operating income increased by 0.6% in 2017 over 2016.\nPROPERTIES:\nDuring the quarter, the Company acquired a previously announced certificate of occupancy property in Charlotte, NC for $12.5 million. The facility is approximately 70,000 sq. ft. and is located in a market where the Company already has a presence.\nThe Company disposed of one 86,000 sq. ft. store in Salt Lake City, UT for $9.4 million. The Company has no other facilities in Utah.\nAlso during the quarter, one of the Company’s joint venture partners constructed a 61,000 sq. ft. facility in Queens, NY in which the company is 5% owner.\nSince January 1, 2017, the Company has added a total of 29 high-quality assets with an aggregate cost of $549.9 million to its portfolio through joint ventures.\nThe Company now manages a total of 140 properties through its joint venture and third party management agreements. It has an additional 15 development properties under contract to manage commencing in 2018.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had no active purchase agreements.\nCAPITAL TRANSACTIONS:\nIllustrated below are key financial ratios at December 31, 2017:\nDebt to Enterprise Value (at $89.07/share) 29.5% Debt to Book Cost of Storage Facilities 40.3% Debt to Recurring Annualized EBITDA 5.6x Debt Service Coverage 4.9x\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $9.2 million of cash on hand, and $395.0 million available on its line of credit.\nCOMMON STOCK DIVIDEND:\nSubsequent to quarter-end, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.00 per share or $4.00 annualized.\nYEAR 2018 EARNINGS GUIDANCE:\nThe following assumptions covering operations have been utilized in formulating guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018:\nSame Store\nProjected Increases Over 2017\n1Q 2018\nFY 2018\nRevenue 1.25 – 2.25% 1.00 – 2.00% Operating Costs (excluding property taxes) 1.00 – 2.00% 1.00 – 2.00% Property Taxes 5.50 – 6.50%\n5.50 – 6.50%\nTotal Operating Expenses 2.50 – 3.50% 2.50 – 3.50% Net Operating Income 1.00 – 2.00% 0.75 – 1.75% The Company’s 2018 same store pool consists of the 535 stabilized stores owned since December 31, 2016, which includes the stabilized legacy LifeStorage locations. The stores purchased in 2015 and 2016 at certificate of occupancy or that were in the early stages of lease-up are not included, regardless of their current occupancies. The Company believes that occupancy levels achieved during the lease-up period, using discounted rates, are not truly indicative of a new store’s performance, and therefore do not result in a meaningful year-over-year comparison in future years. The Company will include such stores in its same store pool in the first year after the stores achieve 80% sustained occupancy using market rates and incentives. Accordingly, three certificate of occupancy facilities constructed in 2014 that have achieved stabilized occupancy and rates will be added to the 2018 same store pool.\nThe Company plans to complete $40 – $50 million of expansions in 2018. It also has budgeted $20 - $25 million to provide for recurring capitalized expenditures including roofing, paving, and office renovations.\nThe Company has not included any acquisition activity for 2018. Should any acquisitions or joint venture investments occur, they are expected to be funded by free cash flow and draws on its line of credit which carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.10%.\nIn 2018, the Company anticipates entering into additional joint ventures, or adding to its existing agreements, contributing up to $50 million.\nAt the conclusion of 2017, the Company operated 25 self storage facilities that it acquired between 2014 - 2017 upon issuance of certificate of occupancy or in the early stages of lease-up. These properties are expected to contribute above average revenue growth in 2018.\nAnnual general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately $44.0 – $45.0 million.\nAs a result of the above assumptions, management expects adjusted funds from operations for the full year 2018 to be approximately $5.33 to $5.43 per share, and between $1.24 and $1.28 per share for the first quarter of 2018.\nReconciliation of Guidance 1Q 2018\nRange or Value\nFY 2018\nRange or Value\nEarnings per share attributable\nto common shareholders - diluted\n$ 0.69 - $ 0.73\n$ 3.09 - $ 3.19\nPlus: real estate depreciation and\namortization\n0.55 - 0.55\n2.24 - 2.24\nFFO per share $ 1.24 - $ 1.28\n$ 5.33 - $ 5.43 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:\nWhen used within this news release, the words “intends,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify “forward looking statements” within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which could cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; the Company’s ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into the Company’s existing business and operations; the Company’s ability to enter new markets where it has little or no operational experience; the Company’s existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with the Company’s outstanding floating rate debt; the Company’s ability to comply with debt covenants; the future ratings on the Company’s debt instruments; the regional concentration of the Company’s business may subject it to economic downturns in the states of Florida and Texas; the Company’s ability to effectively compete in the industries in which it does business; the Company’s reliance on its call center; the Company’s cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal, interest and dividends; and tax law changes which may change the taxability of future income.\nCONFERENCE CALL:\nLife Storage will hold its Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, February 22, 2018.

NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net income: interest expense, impairment and casualty losses, depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition related costs, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net income: income from discontinued operations, interest income, gain on sale of real estate, and equity in income of joint ventures. We believe that NOI is a meaningful measure to investors in evaluating our operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. Additionally, NOI is widely used in the real estate industry and the self storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending on accounting methods and book value of assets. NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, operating income and net income. (2) We believe that Funds from Operations (“FFO”) provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. FFO adds back historical cost depreciation, which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future. In fact, real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions. Consequently, we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance by disregarding (or adding back) historical cost depreciation. Funds from operations is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (“NAREIT”) as net income available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus impairment of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. (3) Includes the stores owned and/or managed by the Company for the entire periods presented that are consolidated in our financial statements. Does not include unconsolidated joint ventures or other stores managed by the Company. (4) Does not include unconsolidated joint venture stores or other stores managed by the Company. (5) Other administrative expenses include office rent, travel expense, investor relations and miscellaneous other expenses.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221006210/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nLife Storage, Inc.\nDiane Piegza, 716-633-1850\ndpiegza@lifestorage.com\nSource: Life Storage, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifestorage.com%2F&esheet=51762118&newsitemid=20180221006210&lan=en-US&anchor=Life+Storage%2C+Inc.&index=4&md5=b597debf8e8ae168a5b2dfd8e03a7642", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvest.lifestorage.com%2F&esheet=51762118&newsitemid=20180221006210&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvest.lifestorage.com%2F&index=5&md5=351956157358e766c3465c588a95ce4a", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifestorage.com%2F&esheet=51762118&newsitemid=20180221006210&lan=en-US&anchor=lifestorage.com&index=3&md5=685a6004b79f3a14397e7485c12a9a1b", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221006210/en/", "http://invest.lifestorage.com/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifestorage.com&esheet=51762118&newsitemid=20180221006210&lan=en-US&anchor=Life+Storage%2C+Inc&index=1&md5=8d6ba38cf8b2d33e5cd1d62c82728a7c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fservices.incommconferencing.com%2FDiamondPassRegistration%2Fregister%3FconfirmationNumber%3D13675344%26linkSecurityString%3D34ee749b0&esheet=51762118&newsitemid=20180221006210&lan=en-US&anchor=this+link&index=2&md5=57915131ade594e5993fc3b3e96a4ada"], "published": "2018-02-22T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T23:55:12.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
