All that is going to do is basically pull the scab off for everybody to have a look at.”\nFILE PHOTO: Australian Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources Barnaby Joyce looks at Australian beef as he visits at a supermarket to promote Australian products in Tokyo, Japan, November 16, 2015. REUTERS/Issei Kato/Files Turnbull refused to comment on Joyce’s criticism but the public spat fuels pressure on him to sack his deputy, which would put the government’s one-seat majority at risk should he choose to leave parliament.\nThe Senate on Thursday passed a motion for Joyce to resign, saying he had breached standards of behaviour expected of a minister.\nLawmakers had been reluctant to criticise Joyce, a plain-spoken small-town accountant turned politician, but came under pressure following revelations that the former press secretary was given two highly paid jobs after leaving his office.\n“This government is in crisis,” said Bill Shorten, leader of the main opposition Labor Party. “The prime minister and deputy prime minister are at war with each other. This crisis cannot be allowed to continue. Malcolm Turnbull must sack the deputy prime minister from the cabinet.”\nEager to draw a line under the scandal, Turnbull on Thursday said he would change ministerial conduct rules, introducing a ban on relationships between lawmakers and staffers adopted last week by U.S Congress.\nUnlike the U.S. rules, the Australian rules only relate to cabinet ministers and their direct subordinates.\nIt was not immediately clear how the rules could be enforced. A spokesman for Turnbull told Reuters that was under consideration.\nPolitical analysts said the ban would do little beyond giving Turnbull additional political ammunition.\n“It will just be a way for the prime minister to call for resignations from his cabinet,” said Will Barsby, head of employment law at Shine Lawyers.\nReporting by Colin Packham in SYDNEY; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T05:53:01.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
