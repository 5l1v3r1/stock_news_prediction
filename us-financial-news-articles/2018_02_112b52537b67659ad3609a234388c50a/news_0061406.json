If that’s true, investors should be extremely wary of the dollar’s decline on the world’s foreign exchanges and Wall Street’s recent move into a “secular overvaluation zone”.\nThese are the observations of two men with nearly a century of financial market and academic expertise behind them who say U.S. stocks are setting up for an almighty crash.\nUnsurprisingly, Robert Aliber, Emeritus Professor at the University of Chicago and Jonathan Wilmot, a former Credit Suisse investment strategist with over 40 years experience, are a little less sure of when the collapse will come.\nBut come it will.\nThe two were on a panel in London last week explaining their gloomy outlook. Wilmot based his analysis on a composite corporate earnings valuation measure going back to the 1850s, and Aliber based his on U.S. dollar cycles since 1980.\nFirst Wilmot. According to his analysis, U.S. stocks entered the “secular overvaluation zone” in December last year for the 13th time since 1850 and only the seventh time since 1905. Curiously, the prelude to the 1987 crash isn’t one of them.\nWilmot’s measure of U.S. market valuation is a mix of his own price-to-earnings ratio, real market returns, the relative performance of stocks versus bonds, and corporate earnings. When this goes one standard deviation above the mean, stocks are in the “secular overvaluation zone”.\nThere’s no formula to establish when the market heads south after entering the “zone”. Sometimes it’s a few months, sometimes it’s three years. The average of all previous “SOZ” episodes is 11 months, during which time equities can rally a further 5-10 percent.\nDuring what Wilmot defines as “true bubbles” in 1929 and the dot com boom, stocks rose a further 54 percent and 83 percent before crashing.\nThe U.S. stock market has been on the rise since plumbing the post-crisis depths in March 2009. That’s a nine-year bull run, the second longest since 1928, according to Yardeni Research. Even Wall Street’s fiercest cheerleaders recognise at least some parts of the market are on the expensive side.\nBut once the market turns, it typically falls 30-50 percent, Wilmot says. What will burst the bubble? Usually it’s one of three things: a sharp tightening of monetary policy, a major credit event or sudden capital flight by foreign investors.\nNone appear to be on the horizon. But the same could have been said in early 1987, early 2000 and 2007.\nDOLLAR CYCLE #4? Bob Aliber is equally bearish but at the centre of his more panoramic view is the U.S. dollar.\nThere have been three dollar cycles since 1980, all of which follow a similar pattern of boom followed by bust. We’re in the middle of the fourth cycle, Aliber argues.\nThey go something like this: The “expansive phase” consists of rising investor demand for dollar securities, a stronger dollar, and higher U.S. asset prices. There’s then a transition to the “contractive phase” in which demand for dollar securities declines, the dollar falls and U.S. asset prices head south.\nThere’s no unified turning point for capital inflows, the dollar and U.S. asset markets. They can and do turn at different stages. But they all result in major market crashes.\nThe first cycle was in the 1980s. The dollar peaked in Q3 1985 with the Plaza Accord and Aliber estimates that U.S. capital inflows peaked in Q3 1986. The “Black Monday” crash of Oct. 19, 1987 then followed. It remains by far the biggest one-day fall in Wall Street history.\nThe second was in the late 1990s. The dollar rose around 50 percent between 1995 and 2000, during which time the S&P 500 again rose more than three-fold. The Nasdaq rose more than six-fold before the tech bubble spectacularly burst and precipitated an 80 percent slide.\nThe dollar’s third juiced-up rally was in the mid-2000s even though it fell nominally against a basket of major currencies. In real terms it rose against the Chinese yuan just as China was emerging as America’s single biggest trading partner and a global economic and financial powerhouse, Aliber argues.\nThe surge in Chinese productivity meant a real depreciation of the yuan and de facto a stronger dollar. China’s boom and demand for oil also fuelled huge appetite for U.S. dollar foreign exchange reserves, which drove a surge in U.S. securities.\nDollar-denominated FX reserves rose by an estimated $3 trillion between 2002 and 2008. Much of that went to U.S. Treasury bonds, but large amounts wound their way into U.S. property and stocks. We all know what happened in late 2008.\nAliber reckons we are now in the “transition phase” of the fourth cycle that began in late 2009. The dollar has fallen 15 percent from its high just over a year ago, while U.S. capital inflows may have peaked in Q4 2017 and U.S. stocks on Jan. 26.\n“If the model is correct, if there is a dollar cycle and capital inflows have peaked, then we can expect a very sharp decline in stock prices. How sharp? That’s hard to say, but it could easily be 50 percent,” Aliber said.\nReporting by Jamie McGeever Graphics by Ritvik Carvalho Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T03:46:25.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
