This represents a 13% increase to the prior quarter’s dividend. The dividend is payable on or about April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, the Willis Towers Watson Board of Directors approved a replenishment of the amount authorized under the share repurchase program. In 2016, the Board had authorized up to $1.2 billion for share repurchases. Approximately $600 million remained under the previous Board authorization at December 31, 2017. Accordingly, the Board authorized up to an additional $400 million under the Share Repurchase Program to be consistent with the previous authorization. The Company is authorized to repurchase shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions. We anticipate this authorization to be executed in 2018 and 2019.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
