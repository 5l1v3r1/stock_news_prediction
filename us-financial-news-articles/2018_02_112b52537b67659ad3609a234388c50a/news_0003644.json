It was merchandise from merchants that was incidentally there.” Aidi also described two other tweets as misleading.\nHenschke, a Jakarta-based Australian citizen, later took down the photograph and tweeted: “Adding important NOTE: Other sources say this is NOT aid but normal supplies. Huge relief effort underway here.”\nA father holds his sick child on a boat after getting medical treatment in Jetsy village, Asmat district, after the government dispatched military and medical personnel to the remote region of Papua to combat malnutrition and measles, Indonesia, January 23, 2018.

Antara Foto/M Agung Rajasa/ via REUTERS Indonesia has deployed additional military personnel to help in Asmat, where at least 61 infants are reported to have died from malnutrition and diseases such as measles.\nHenschke had asked to be allowed to continue covering the story during questioning by security forces over her tweets on Friday, but was escorted to the city of Timika and held by immigration, the military statement said.\nHenschke declined to comment, but a BBC spokesperson said via email: “A BBC team on a deployment to Papua province has now returned to Jakarta. They had the necessary documentation and the authorities were aware of their visit. The BBC respects local laws wherever it operates.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) Many Papuans, who are predominantly Christian and a minority in Muslim-majority Indonesia, criticize Jakarta for neglecting Papua and instead being too focused on the densely-populated island of Java.\nCatholic priest and rights activist John Jonga blamed the crisis on a lack of vaccinations and a switch from more nutritious tubers to rice as a staple food. Some of the forest-dwelling Asmat are also reported to be increasingly relying on instant food or energy drinks.\nAndreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch said Henschke’s treatment showed pledges to open up Papua had not materialised.\n“She had her travel permit - the only Indonesian area where foreign journalists need to get a permit to visit - and still got intimidation for a single tweet,” said Harsono.\nA presidential spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nEditing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T16:43:27.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
