But it illustrates the high stakes for Canada’s energy industry if new pipelines are not built, and the fierce environmental opposition against them.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has approved the pipeline expansion, said last week that he would ensure the project gets built.\nExperts disagree over whether British Columbia has authority to block inter-provincial transport, which is a federal jurisdiction, however the move by B.C.’s left-leaning New Democrat government adds another potential snag to a project that is already a year behind schedule.\nTight capacity moving crude by pipeline and railway from landlocked Alberta generated last month the biggest price discount on the province’s heavy oil in more than four years compared to the West Texas Intermediate North American benchmark.
