He called on May to “pick up the pace” of negotiations so that a withdrawal treaty, including terms for keeping the status quo during a two-year transition, could be agreed this autumn and ratified by March. \nAs the rhetoric on both sides has taken a more irritable turn, and negotiations have stalled since the interim accords in December, Barnier said he was “preparing for every situation” in case the continent’s second-biggest economy lurches out of the Union without a deal after 46 years. \n\nEuropean Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier holds a news conference at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir May, who will lay out her vision for a future trading relationship with the EU on Friday and deliver a full response to the withdrawal draft on Monday, said she would work to protect UK unity in the negotiations. She again ruled out an EU-UK customs union -- something that her Labour opponents advocate as a way to avoid disruptive controls at the Irish land border. \n“Overall the work has been progressing well in recent weeks,” her spokesman said. “This is just a draft document ... and we will be having discussions where we don’t agree in the coming months.” \nUnionists fear new barriers with the British mainland could increase the chances of the Republic, which broke from British rule a century ago, absorbing the province, most of whose 1.8 million people are entitled to Irish, and hence EU, citizenship. \nBarnier conceded there might be new checks on trade between Northern Ireland and the mainland -- but definitely no “border”. \n\nEuropean Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier attends an EU's General Affairs Council in Brussels, Belgium, February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “NO ARROGANCE HERE” \nThe Democratic Unionist Party’s Nigel Dodds, however, said his “ludicrous” plan “will not go anywhere”. \nBarnier dismissed suggestions that the draft was an attempt to “shock” Britons into concluding a deal, insisting that his sole goal was to avoid a disorderly divorce. “There is no arrogance here,” he said. \nThe draft treaty sees a joint EU-UK committee overseeing the arrangements but the European Court of Justice remaining the ultimate authority to resolve disputes. \nAsked why the draft made no mention of a section in December’s EU-UK joint report that there should be no regulatory divergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Barnier said it was because that was an internal UK matter. \nHe restated his view that the proposals for future trade that May is expected to make on Friday - to maintain a mixture of common and different regulations with the EU - were not acceptable. “There will be no cherry-picking,” he said. \nBarnier said he would engage in a new round of negotiations next week and would also meet leaders of Northern Ireland. \nHe also said “significant divergences” remained in talks on a transition period, and so a deal, which both sides hope to clinch in March to calm business nerves, was “not a given”. \nSupporters of Brexit argue that Britain will benefit from no longer being bound by EU rules and can do more trade with the rest of the world, while opponents say the prospect of new barriers to trade in Europe is already hurting its economy. \nMay’s government got a boost on Wednesday when Japanese carmaker Toyota confirmed plans to build a new model in England. \nAdditional reporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Jan Strupczewski, Robert-Jan Bartunek, Robin Emmott and Samantha Koester in Brussels, William James and Elizabeth Piper in London and Padraic Halpin in Dublin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T14:12:23.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
