To be able to walk around in a tracksuit for three weeks, that’s good too,” she said.\nFILE PHOTO - Alpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Downhill – Yongpyong Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 10, 2018 - Volunteers leave the Yongpyong Alpine venue.

It feels a bit strange,” he said.\nEditing by Darren Schuettler and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://reut.rs/2G8pGUr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T11:40:48.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
