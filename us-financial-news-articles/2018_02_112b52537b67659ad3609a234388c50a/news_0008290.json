The allegations led to the IOC to ban the country from the Olympics for what is says was “systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system at the 2014 Sochi Games.\nMutko said Russian authorities had nothing to do with the anti-doping laboratory in Sochi, stressing that WADA should be held responsible for its activities.\nMutko stressed that the tampering of samples by Russian security officials would have been impossible.\n“It’s impossible, what some people want to imagine,” said Mutko, who was banned for life from the Olympics by the IOC. “There were cameras at every step.”\nThe CAS ruling that cleared the 28 athletes backed the belief that there was no state-sponsored doping cover-up scheme in the country, Mutko said.\n”This is a small element (of proof) that there was no such (state-sponsored doping) system,“ he said. ”We would like to hope that this decision will be respected by the world.\n”Everyone wanted one decision, and it wasn’t the one (they wanted).\n“If there in no trust in our justice system, in our law enforcement agencies, in our witnesses, then maybe there will be trust in the Court of Arbitration for Sport. We consider this to be a very important decision.”\nACKNOWLEDGING MCLAREN‘S FINDINGS\nRussia, however, has found itself struggling to fulfill all the criteria to reinstate its suspended athletics federation, anti-doping agency RUSADA and Paralympic Committee.\nInternational sports bodies such as the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) require Russian authorities to publicly accept the findings of the McLaren report on the alleged existence of widespread state-sponsored doping in order to have the country reinstated.\nThe 2016 WADA-commissioned report by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren found that more than 1,000 Russian competitors in more than 30 sports were involved in a conspiracy to conceal positive drug tests over a period of five years.\nMutko said that Russia could not accept the report’s findings, which he called “superficial and manipulated.”\n“Speaking about WADA, they want us to acknowledge the McLaren report unconditionally. We cannot do that,” Mutko said. “CAS yesterday ruled to clear 28 athletes. This would betray them.”\nAlthough Russia will not acknowledge the report’s findings, Mutko said the country would continue to work with global sports bodies to combat doping in the country.\n“We are open to dialogue and cooperation with WADA and the IOC,” he said. “We will continue supporting our athletes, to fight for clean sport. We are open. We are reliable partners in this. We never set a goal for ourselves of winning at all costs, as we are often portrayed.”\nMutko, who has appealed his lifetime ban from the Olympics, recently left his positions as the chairman of the World Cup organizing committee and president of the Russian Football Union.\nHowever, he still oversees the government’s participation in the hosting of the 2018 World Cup finals in 12 venues spread across 11 cities, including Moscow, St Petersburg and Sochi, from June 14 to July 15.\nMutko assured that preparations were on track and that the authorities were working to curb racist and discriminatory incidents in Russian soccer while ensuring crowd safety.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by William Maclean and Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-03T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:31:52.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
