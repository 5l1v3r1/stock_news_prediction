O‘Neill fired a wrist shot that beat Slovenia goaltender Gasper Kroselj on his stick side.\nREFILE - CORRECTING SLUG Ice Hockey – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men Preliminary Round Match - U.S. v Slovenia - Kwandong Hockey Centre, Gangneung, South Korea – February 14, 2018 - Ryan Stoa (R) of the U.S. in action with Mitja Robar of Slovenia.
