Benco invited a fourth group, Burkhart Dental Supply, to join but was rebuffed, the FTC said.\n“The complaint details communications between executives of the two companies evidencing the agreement, as well as attempts to monitor and ensure compliance with the agreement,” the FTC said in a statement.\nA complaint was filed with an FTC internal court, with a trial set to begin on Oct. 12.\nAttempts to reach spokespeople for the three companies were not immediately successful.\nReporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Susan Thomas and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T01:24:45.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
