REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo \nThe bank said it would seek to operate with a common equity Tier-1 ratio of at least 10.5 percent in March and September. \nA new A$750 million capital notes launch would replace similar convertible notes due to expire in April, it said. \nThe notes would pay an annual margin of between 3.20 percent and 3.40 percent, and was timed to coincide with the expected redemption and conversion of existing preference shares on April 3 that paid a margin of 3.25 percent. \nWestpac does not disclose profit or revenue numbers in its limited quarterly updates. In November, Westpac’s annual cash profit missed estimates, while full-year net interest margin slipped. \n($1 = 1.2649 Australian dollars) Reporting by Paulina Duran in Sydney; additional reporting by Ambar Warrick and Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Jane Wardell and Stephen Coates", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T05:41:11.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
