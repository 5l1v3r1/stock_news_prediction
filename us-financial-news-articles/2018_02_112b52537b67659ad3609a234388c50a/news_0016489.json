It now trades at just one fifth of its assets’ value, Reuters data showed.\nBy 1128 GMT shares rose 4 percent against a lower sector with traders citing a better-than-expected 10.6 percent core capital ratio at the end of last year and a 17 percent annual cost reduction.\nCreval said its net interest income fell 7 percent in 2017 from a year earlier, but fees rose 4 percent.\nA more conservative approach in evaluating soured loans and the sale of nearly 1.5 billion euros in bad debts pushed Creval to book 405 million euros in writedowns last year.\nUnder pressure from regulators to get rid of debts that turned sour during a deep recession which ended in 2014, Italian banks can only sell them at a loss.\nCreval, headquartered in the wealthy Lombardy region, will use the new capital to sell more doubtful loans and cut their weight over total debts to just below 10 percent in 2020 from nearly 22 percent at the end of last year.\nCreval said at the weekend that more banks had joined a consortium led by Milanese merchant bank Mediobanca which will take on unsold shares in the capital increase.\nCreval’s cash call comes after rival Carige pulled off a 540 million euro new share issue in December thanks to accords struck with a number of new investors while shareholders took up only 66 percent of the offer.\nCreval last tapped markets in 2014, raising 400 million euros in capital.\nSince then the bank has shed its cooperative status, which granted each shareholder one vote regardless of the size of their stake, to comply with a government reform aimed at improving governance.
