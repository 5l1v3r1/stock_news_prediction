It wants the new aircraft to be delivered by 2025.\nReporting by Michael Shields, Editing by William Maclean\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:51:48.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
