The contract of the 64-year-old Mueller, who took the reins at Volkswagen (VW) a week after the “dieselgate” scandal was revealed, will expire in 2020.\n“Now is not the right occasion to say something about this,” Poetsch told reporters late on Monday at a business event in Linz, Austria. “I believe there is also no background to this.”\nVW has struggled to rebuild its reputation after admitting in 2015 that it had cheated exhaust emissions tests, a task that was made harder by revelations earlier this year about how the carmaker exposed monkeys to toxic exhaust fumes.\nNearly two-and-a-half years after the “dieselgate” scandal, VW is grappling with investigations and lawsuits around the world and about $30 billion in fines and costs for the fraud just as it pushes a multi-billion strategic shift to electric and self-driving cars.\nDespite the challenges, VW seems to be succeeding in putting the scandal behind it as far as the consumer market is concerned.\nSales of the core VW brand set a new record at 6.23 million cars last year and VW said earlier on Monday that its deliveries jumped 7.1 percent in January.\n“It has become clear meanwhile that the company is on a very successful path operationally,” said Poetsch who had been VW’s finance chief throughout the period that VW managers were installing the illicit emissions software and subsequently tried to conceal its existence.\nVW, whose legal liability can still grow if it turned out that top executives had prior knowledge of the fraud, continued to downplay the biggest corporate scandal in its 81-year history.\nAsked when VW will finally be able to fully overcome its crisis, Poetsch replied: “What crisis?”\nThe 66-year-old has been investigated by German prosecutors for more than a year over suspicion that VW manipulated the markets by withholding key information about the scandal from shareholders.\n“There are always topics that one is obliged to deal with,” Poetsch said. “I think we are moving very well on the diesel issue.” (Reporting by Kirsti Knolle; Additional reporting by Ilona Wissenbach, Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz; Editing by Adrian Croft)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:55:37.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
