(NASDAQ:WSTL), a leading provider of high-performance wireless infrastructure solutions, announced results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended December 31, 2017 (3Q18). Management will host a conference call to discuss financial and business results tomorrow, Thursday, February 8, 2018, at 9:30 AM Eastern Time (details below).\nRevenue was $13.7 million and comprised $5.2 million from the In-Building Wireless (IBW) segment, a strong $5.8 million performance from the Intelligent Site Management and Services (ISMS) segment, and a seasonally low $2.7 million from the Communication Network Solutions (CNS) segment. Cash and short-term investments grew to $26.0 million at December 31, 2017, up from $24.2 million at September 30, 2017.\n“Westell continued to generate positive operating profit margin and net income, and increase cash, even with the revenue seasonality that typifies our December quarters. These positive results demonstrate the tremendous operating leverage we have in the business,” said Kirk Brannock, Westell’s President and Chief Executive Officer.\n3Q18\n3 months ended\n12/31/17 2Q18\n3 months ended\n9/30/17 + favorable /\n- unfavorable Revenue $13.7M $17.2M -$3.5M Gross Margin 44.4% 42.2% +2.2% Operating Expenses $6.0M $7.2M +$1.2M Operating Margin 0.3% 0.3% —% Net Income $0.8M $0.7M +$0.1M Earnings Per Share $0.05 $0.05 $— Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (1) $4.7M $5.7M +$1.0M Non-GAAP Operating Margin (1) 10.2% 9.3% +0.9% Non-GAAP Net Income (1) $1.5M $1.7M -$0.2M Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share (1) $0.09 $0.11 -$0.02 Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (1) $1.6M $1.8M -$0.2M (1) Please refer to the schedule at the end of this press release for a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other information related to non-GAAP financial measures. “The momentum of the efficiencies created over the past year resulted in our fifth consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating profit margin. Along with our healthy cost structure, we are encouraged by the revenue growth opportunities we have in the IBW public safety market, which grew sequentially this quarter, and in emerging wireless network densification applications like centralized radio access networks (CRAN). At the same time, we continue to evaluate new growth opportunities to increase shareholder value,” Brannock added.\nIn-Building Wireless (IBW) Segment\nIBW’s sequential revenue decrease was driven by lower sales of our Universal DAS Interface Tray (UDIT) and passive system components, both of which achieved record quarterly revenue levels last quarter. IBW’s segment gross margin increase was driven primarily by lower costs.\n3Q18\n3 months ended\n12/31/17 2Q18\n3 months ended\n9/30/17 + favorable /\n- unfavorable IBW Segment Revenue $5.2M $7.9M -$2.7M IBW Segment Gross Margin 47.3% 46.1% +1.2% IBW Segment R&D Expense $0.8M $1.4M +$0.6M IBW Segment Profit $1.7M $2.2M -$0.5M Intelligent Site Management & Services (ISMS) Segment\nISMS’s sequential revenue increase was driven primarily by higher support services revenue and increased sales of Remote units, resulting in ISMS attaining its highest revenue level since the December 2015 quarter. ISMS’s segment gross margin increase was primarily due to a more favorable mix.\n3Q18\n3 months ended\n12/31/17 2Q18\n3 months ended\n9/30/17 + favorable /\n- unfavorable ISMS Segment Revenue $5.8M $4.7M +$1.1M ISMS Segment Gross Margin 54.5% 46.9% +7.6% ISMS Segment R&D Expense $0.5M $0.5M $— ISMS Segment Profit $2.6M $1.7M +$0.9M Communication Network Solutions (CNS) Segment\nCNS product lines are used primarily in the outdoor communication network; as a result, the December quarter tends to be its lowest performing quarter. In 3Q18, CNS’s sequential revenue decrease was most affected by lower sales of Integrated Cabinets and Tower Mounted Amplifiers. CNS’s gross margin decrease was primarily due to the lower revenue.\n3Q18\n3 months ended\n12/31/17 2Q18\n3 months ended\n9/30/17 + favorable /\n- unfavorable CNS Segment Revenue $2.7M $4.6M -$1.9M CNS Segment Gross Margin 16.9% 30.7% -13.8% CNS Segment R&D Expense $0.2M $0.2M $— CNS Segment Profit $0.2M $1.2M -$1.0M Conference Call Information\nManagement will discuss financial and business results during the quarterly conference call on Thursday, February 8, 2018, at 9:30 AM Eastern Time.

The schedules above reconcile the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The adjustments share one or more of the following characteristics: they are unusual and the Company does not expect them to recur in the ordinary course of its business; they do not involve the expenditure of cash; they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course; or their magnitude and timing is largely outside of the Company's control. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial information provides meaningful supplemental information to investors. Management also believes the non-GAAP financial information reflects the Company's core ongoing operating performance and facilitates comparisons across reporting periods. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results. Non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company's GAAP results.\nFootnotes:\n(1) On April 1, 2013, the Company purchased Kentrox. The acquisition required the step-down on acquired deferred revenue, which resulted in lower revenue that will not recur once those liabilities have fully settled. The adjustment removes the step-down on acquired deferred revenue that was recognized.\n(2) Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense incurred in accordance with share-based compensation accounting standards.\n(3) Non-cash impairment related to tangible long-lived assets associated with the previously announced strategic decision related to the discontinuation of ClearLink DAS.\n(4) Amortization of intangibles is a non-cash expense arising from previously acquired intangible assets.\n(5) Restructuring expenses are not directly related to the ongoing performance of our fundamental business operations, including costs relating to abandonment of excess office space at our headquarters and in New Hampshire, and severance costs for terminated employees.
