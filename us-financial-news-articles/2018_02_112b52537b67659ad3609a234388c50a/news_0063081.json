That means viewers will get to watch more programming during those shows. \nThe reduction in number of commercials doesn’t exactly match up to the reduction in ad time because the company is also introducing a new feature for marketers. NBCU announced a new 60-second commercial pod in the first or last break of a show that will be dedicated to up to two advertisers. The goal is to create a “stronger impact with viewers,” NBC said in a statement. \n“The industry knows that television is already the most effective advertising medium there is, but we need to make the experience better for viewers,” said Linda Yaccarino, chairman of advertising and client partnerships at NBCUniversal, in the statement. “We’re reimagining the advertising experience for consumers, marketers, and the entire industry.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T21:56:57.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
