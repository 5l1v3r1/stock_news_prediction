He walked down the Simon Bolivar bridge linking the two countries and greeted Venezuelan migrants.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last year threatened military intervention in Venezuela, but Latin American countries have strongly opposed the idea of any such action. Venezuela’s government has seized on the threat as evidence that Washington, its ideological foe, is seeking to overthrow leftist President Nicolas Maduro.\nColombia, which shares a large and porous border with Venezuela, is bearing the brunt of a growing exodus of Venezuelans fleeing malnutrition, disease and hyperinflation.\nLast week, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said he would impose stricter migratory controls, suspend new daily entry cards for Venezuelans, and deploy thousands of new security personnel along the frontier.\nAdditional reporting by Vivian Sequera, Writing by Alexandra Ulmer, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T01:02:56.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
