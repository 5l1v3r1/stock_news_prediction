But they have offered to prevent the repeated renewal of such short-term employment contracts as a compromise.\nThe two sides are also still at odds over the SPD’s call to replace Germany’s dual public-private healthcare system with a universal insurance system for all.\nMonday’s talks are expected to focus on improving public healthcare, such as by changing billing rules for doctors, who earn more by treating private patients.
