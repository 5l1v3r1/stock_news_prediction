The assets could have been valued at more than $8 billion at the time. ( reut.rs/2f5y6R4 )\n“We expected that AT&T would sell it (DirecTV Latin America stake) rather than publicly list it, this could presumably mean they weren’t able to find a buyer,” MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said, raising concerns over the valuation of the assets.\nCable service providers have been facing stiff challenges as the industry battles with cord-cutting, where people are moving towards on-demand video streaming services such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s Amazon Prime.\nThe Latin America business, excluding Mexico, has been AT&T&rsquo;s best candidate to divest, as the region is largely non-strategic and “didn’t fit very well with any of their other significant initiatives”, Moffett said.\nAT&T, which acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015, reported about 13.6 million video connections for Latin America as of Dec. 31, 2017, an addition of 1.1 million from a year earlier.\nReporting by Supantha Mukherjee and Muvija M in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T17:38:17.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
