REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo Pilots, who enjoy increased leverage due to a relative shortage of experienced pilots in Europe, say they only want the same conditions to those at low-cost rivals such as easyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle.\nSome have complained of a toxic working atmosphere at Ryanair and a lack of trust between staff and management.\nThey say they will refuse a unilateral offer of a pay rise unless they get assurances it won’t impact future talks on pay and conditions.\nGoodbody Stockbrokers said that while the airline’s operating performance was solid, there was a heightened risk of a showdown with unions.\n“This is Ryanair drawing the line in the sand” with unions, analyst Mark Simpson said.\nProfit after tax for the quarter was 106 million euros, up 12 percent from a year ago and slightly ahead of a consensus forecast of 101 million euros in a Ryanair poll of analysts.\nRevenues for optional extras such as pre-booked seats and extra bags beat expectations, while the airline increased its passenger forecast for the year to end-March to 130 million from 129 million.\nThe cancellation of thousands of flights in the quarter cost Ryanair 25 million euros in passenger compensation, while pay increases for pilots are expected to cost 45 million euros in the six months to the end of March.\nRyanair said it expected to post profit after tax of between 1.4 billion and 1.45 billion euros in its financial year, which ends on March 31, 2018, a forecast that has remained unchanged since May.\n($1 = 0.8035 euros)\nReporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Louise Heavens and Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T10:52:40.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
