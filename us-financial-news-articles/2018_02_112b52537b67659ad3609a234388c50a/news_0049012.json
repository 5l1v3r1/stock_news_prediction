Ltd. (TSX:GQM | OTCQX:GQMNF) (\"Golden Queen\" or \"the Company\") today announces its operating results for January 2018, including total gold production of 2,026 ounces and revenue of US$3.18m from its Soledad Mountain gold-silver mine (the \"Mine\") located south of Mojave, California. All amounts herein are in US dollars and reflect 100% of the operating results of Golden Queen Mining Company, LLC (\"GQM LLC\"), the Company's 50%-owned subsidiary that holds the Mine, unless otherwise stated.\nGolden Queen accelerated the East Pit development to access higher-grade ore tons to compensate for the shortfall in the ore supplied and the lower than expected gold ore grades from the North-West and Main (Phase 1) Pits. Since November 2017, six benches have been mined out in the East Pit and the Company is pleased to report the following positive reconciliation between Ore Control (production) and Reserves:\nOre Control v.

In addition, the gold grade was 21% higher than estimated for a total of 1.6 times the expected gold ounces that had been predicted. The silver grade was 15% higher than estimated for a total of 1.5 times the predicted number of silver ounces.\nThe Company's drill program comprising up to 20 holes and approximately 20,000 feet of reverse circulation drilling at a projected cost of US$1.0m commenced on January 28 th , 2018. To date, five holes have been completed with the assays pending. The Company looks forward to releasing assay results in the near future. This drilling is designed to increase confidence in the currently modelled ore grades and tonnage associated with the Golden Queen vein structure, to improve the Company's understanding of the Patience vein structure with the objective of adding additional ounces to the reserves with immediate impact to the mine plan, and to investigate the Silver Queen vein structure in the South-East section where historical underground development appears on historic maps but has not been evidenced in historic extraction reports.\nAbout Golden Queen Mining Co. Ltd.:\nGolden Queen is a gold and silver producer holding a 50% interest in an open pit, heap leach mining operation on the Soledad Mountain property, located just outside the town of Mojave in Kern County in southern California. The mine also produces aggregate rock.\nTechnical Information:\nThe scientific and technical content of this news release was reviewed, verified, and approved by Tim Mazanek, SME; a qualified person as defined by Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 \"Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.\nC aution With Respect To Forward-looking Statements: This news release contains forward-looking information and statements within the meaning of applicable Canadian and United States securities laws (herein referred to as \"forward-looking statements\") that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
