The first ever domestic final clash between the sides was a largely disappointing affair at a freezing Wembley Stadium but runaway Premier League leaders City had far too much for an Arsenal side who suffered a forgettable afternoon. Slideshow (11 Images) Aguero’s 18th-minute goal gave City a halftime lead and Arsenal withered after the break as Kompany prodded in from close range after 58 minutes before Silva effectively ended the contest seven minutes later with a left-foot finish. After a trophy-less first season in charge of City, Guardiola’s career trophy haul as a manager now stands at 19, having won 11 with Barcelona and seven at Bayern Munich. Arsenal have now lost a record six League Cup finals while City have won it three times in five years.
