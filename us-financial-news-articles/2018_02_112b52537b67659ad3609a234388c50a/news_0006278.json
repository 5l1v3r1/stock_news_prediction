Full autonomy - known as an “eyes off, brains off” or “level 5” system - does away with even the need for a steering wheel.\n“The big difference to other competitors is that we are conceptualising our vehicle as a robo-taxi right from the beginning and not as a technology-kit mounted on a serial vehicle. We will not have a makeshift solution,” Stark added.
