That compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a fall of 0.3 percent and came after a downwardly revised 1.9 percent rise in November.\nThe data contradicts a spending trend in Germany, where consumers are revelling in record-high employment, a secure job market, rising wages and low borrowing costs, helping private consumption replace exports as the main growth driver.\nOn the year, retail sales also fell by 1.9 percent, confounding a Reuters consensus forecast for a 2.8 percent increase.\nThe retail sales data came after a GfK survey last week showed consumers felt more optimistic heading into February, unperturbed by political parties’ failure to form a new government.
