He established the Vision Fund, the world’s largest private equity fund, which, in conjunction with the Delta Fund set up to invest in Chinese ride-sharing firm Didi Chuxing, has funneled $27.5 billion into 20 tech firms as at the end of December. \nSon on Wednesday said he expected several of the firms SoftBank has invested in to list each year. \nSoftBank’s early-stage, $20 million investment in Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ( BABA.N ) was a bet that paid off spectacularly and helped cement Son’s reputation. \nIt has since shifted to investments of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in later-stage startups - an approach widely seen as contributing to a spike in startup valuations. \nSoftBank’s investments this year include leading an $865 million investment in construction startup Katerra, a $300 million investment in dog-walking app Wag, and the closure of a deal to become Uber Technologies Inc’s largest shareholder. \nSeparately on Wednesday, the group reported a 2.8 percent fall in third-quarter operating profit, due in part to higher costs. It did not release a forecast for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertain factors. \n($1 = 109.1500 yen)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T09:03:32.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
