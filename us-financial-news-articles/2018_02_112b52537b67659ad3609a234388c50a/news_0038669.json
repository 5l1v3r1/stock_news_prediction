However, critics say more house-building is needed to slow the pace of price rises.\nThe IFS said that for 90 percent of 25-34 year-olds, average house prices were more than four times their after-tax income, while this was true for under half of 25-34 year-olds in the mid 1990s. This reflected much faster growth in house prices than in wages over that period.\nYoung people whose incomes allowed them to buy a house were just as likely to as 20 years ago, the IFS added.\nThe IFS defined a middle income household as one with an after-tax income of 22,200-30,600 pounds ($31,217-$43,029), which would place them in the middle 20 percent of the income distribution for their age group.
