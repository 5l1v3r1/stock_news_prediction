All deposits guaranteed by the Deposit Guarantee Law shall be disbursed with the funds of ABLV Bank,” it said in a statement.\nThe bank, like many others in Latvia, has sizable deposits from foreign clients, many from Russia and Ukraine. Around 40 percent of all bank deposits in the Baltic country are from non-residents, and international agencies have long warned that some are related to illegal activities.\nTo combat money laundering, Latvia announced plans on Friday to gradually halve the share of bank deposits held by non-residents. But that was not enough to save ABLV, which had until Friday to present the ECB with a credible survival plan or face closure.\nHinting at its eventual fate, Latvian Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola said the state would not step in to rescue ABLV if it were about to collapse.\n“ABLV is not regarded as a systemic bank, which means the government would not rescue it because its exposure to the Latvian economy is low,” Reizniece-Ozola said. “There is some systemic importance (but) ... it is not crucial or critical.”\n($1 = 0.8129 euros)\nReporting by Balazs Koranyi; Additional reporting by Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm; Editing by Leslie Adler and David Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T03:58:36.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
