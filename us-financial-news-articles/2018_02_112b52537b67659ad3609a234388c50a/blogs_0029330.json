It's a little tough for them because they've gotten away with murder for 25 years. But we're going to be changing policy,\" he said. \nTrump said his administration will impose a \"reciprocal tax\" to charge other countries - \"some of them are so-called allies but they're not allies on trade.\" \nHe did not specify how such a tax would be structured, or whether he meant that U.S. tariff rates should be raised to equal to those charged by other major trading partners. Administration officials were not immediately able to elaborate on the president's comments. \nTrump cited motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson as an example of the problem of unfair trade. Harley is building a factory in Thailand, partly because its U.S.-built bikes face a 60 percent tariff there. \nThe United States has pledged to the World Trade Organization a relatively low, 3.5 percent applied tariff rate, compared to 9.9 percent for China and 5.2 percent for the European Union. For some products, the gap is much wider, such as in passenger vehicles, where the United States charges 2.5 percent tariffs, versus 25 percent in China and 10 percent in the EU. \nIt was also unclear whether Trump was reviving the idea of a border adjustment tax, an idea rejected by congressional Republicans in last year's tax reform effort. \nRetailers and some import-dependent industries strongly opposed the plan for a 20 percent tax on imports aimed at offsetting the value-added tax refunds that some countries grant to their exporters. The National Retail Federation at the time called it a \"bad tax\" that would \"drive up the prices of countless products Americans use every day.\" \nTrump asked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross if he agreed with the idea of a reciprocal tax during the infrastructure event. \nRoss said, \"sure,\" and proceeded to say that the United States for too long had offered trade concessions to other countries that were no longer needed. \n\"Well, we gave away so much unilaterally that we really have to claw it back,\" Ross added.
