(TSX:TMD) (OTCQB:TITXF) (“Titan” or “the Company), a medical device company focused on the design and development of a robotic surgical system for application in minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”), announces financial results for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017.\nAll financial results are prepared under Canadian GAAP and are reported in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated. The audited financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017 may be viewed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nDavid McNally, President and CEO, said, “I joined Titan Medical in January 2017 and based on our achievements this past year, I am more confident than ever in our future. With the addition of Dr. Perry Genova, our Senior Vice President of R&D, and Curtis Jensen, our Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs, we now have a management team experienced in complex medical device development and commercialization, including relevant expertise in engineering, regulatory affairs, intellectual property and global marketing.”\nMr. McNally continued, “I am proud that our team successfully met all of our published 2017 milestones on or ahead of schedule. Our work in 2017 culminated in the first single-port procedures performed at our three Centers of Excellence in the U.S. and Europe. Having now validated the performance of our single-port robotic surgical system, during 2018 we will focus on further product development in key areas identified as opportunities for improvement and competitive advantage before launch. We will also continue to actively engage with both the U.S. FDA and our European Notified Body to ensure we pursue the least burdensome yet fully compliant pathways toward regulatory clearances in both geographies.”\nIn conclusion, Mr. McNally said, “We acknowledge that the work ahead will impact our historical timeline to commercialization. We also know that the specific timetable and requirements of regulatory submissions will become clear over the coming months. However, based on the enthusiasm of the experienced robotic surgeons who have operated prototypes of our system, we are confident our single-port surgical system can play a meaningful role in advancing robotically-assisted surgery, and it’s worth our investment of time and capital to do the job right.”\nOperational highlights for 2017 include:\nOn February 6, 2017, the Company announced the appointment of Perry A. Genova, PhD as Vice President of Research and Development. On April 3, 2017, the Company announced the appointment of Curtis R. Jensen as Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs.
