Emerging market stocks lost 0.58 percent, and Asian stocks were also subdued.\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.38 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.01 percent.\nEuropean shares held steady, supported by softer domestic currencies. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.22 percent.\nInvestors looking to the greenback shrugged off worries about the U.S. budget deficit, focusing on large U.S. government debt auctions this week and sending the dollar higher.\n“What we are seeing is just a little bit of profit-taking (in other currencies), a little bit of bargain-hunting,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist with Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.\n“Given the focus on the deficit, the dependence on foreign investment, I think we will have to see relatively strong demand at these auctions,” he said.\nU.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday, with the benchmark 10-year yield hovering near a four-year peak as investors made room for this week’s deluge of $258 billion of government debt supply.\nThe dollar index, tracking the unit against key world currencies, rose 0.59 percent, continuing its rebound from three-year lows. The euro was last 0.51 percent lower at $1.2344.\nThe stronger dollar and uncertainty about big Treasury auctions weighed on gold prices, which dropped for a third session.\nSpot gold dropped 0.6 percent to $1,338.00 an ounce.\nEMERGING PRESSURE The dollar’s rebound also meant most emerging market currencies were under pressure.\nSouth Africa’s rand and Turkey’s lira both gave back more of their recent gains, while growing concerns about fraud at India’s second-largest state-run bank sent the rupee skidding to a near three-month low.\nU.S. crude rose 0.31 percent to $61.74 per barrel. However, Brent was last at $65.12, down 0.84 percent on the day, under pressure from a stronger dollar and a bout of profit taking.\nReporting by Hilary Russ in New York; Additional reporting by Marc Jones and Eric Onstad in London; Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Richard Leong in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:41:23.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
