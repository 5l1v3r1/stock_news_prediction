The Hang Seng index was 1.48% lower while the Nikkei lost 1.07%.\nDespite the soft equities, Asian credit spreads were flat with the iTraxx Asia ex-Japan IG index largely unchanged at 70bp/71bp.\nSecondary markets were quiet but steady, with the focus on the first deals since the Chinese markets reopened after the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.\nThe Republic of Indonesia is marketing a US dollar five-year green sukuk and a 10-year regular sukuk, respectively at 4.05% area and 4.70% area, while Far East Horizon is offering US dollar five-year notes at 200bp area over Treasuries and a three-year Dim Sum at 5.2% area.\n“The markets are still a bit thin as players are sitting on the sidelines because of rate volatility,” said one DCM syndicate banker.\nIndonesia’s sovereign yield curve was mostly unaffected by the new bond, said a banker watching the new deal.\nThe sovereign’s longer-dated outstanding notes fell slightly while the shorter-dated notes recouped some of their earlier losses.\nThe 3.4% 2022s were seen at 99.60 while the 4.15% 2027s were at 99.62, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAmong high-grade credits, China Cinda’s recent bonds were mostly flat with the 3.875% 2023s at 143bp over Treasuries and the 4.375% 2025s at 179bp.\nReporting by Kit Yin Boey; Editing by Vincent Baby\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:52:40.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
