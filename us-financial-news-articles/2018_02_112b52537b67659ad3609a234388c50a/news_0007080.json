However, with the intelligence and data gathered by Hemp Business Journal, we are beginning to understand the full extent of the opportunity presented by hemp not only nationally, but worldwide. As one of the most versatile plants in our agricultural economy, the applications of hemp, ranging from bio-plastics to textiles to food and body care products, the activation of hemp markets in the U.S. and around the world represents an opportunity for tremendous economic impact. Through this acquisition, we are excited to now have data and market intelligence across the entire global cannabis industry from industrial hemp to medical and adult use cannabis,” said New Frontier Data Founder & CEO Giadha Aguirre de Carcer.\n“We built Hemp Business Journal to be the premier resource of hemp market data and intelligence and I am proud to say we have achieved that,” said Sean Murphy, founder of Hemp Business Journal. “New Frontier Data is an ideal partner to build upon our foundation of data and expertise, to expand our reach and analytical resources, as well as deepen our breadth and expand our market coverage. We are excited about the work our teams will be doing in the years ahead to help investors, entrepreneurs and governments better understand the opportunities created by this unique plant.”\nThe expansive commercial applications of hemp, which remain largely untapped in the United States, represent a significant economic opportunity. U.S. laws have evolved to allow states to conduct research and establish commercial hemp pilot programs, but outside of these state-run programs cultivation remains federally illegal. Thus, institutional investors and the Fortune 1000 have been hesitant to enter the market given the uncertainty surrounding hemp laws and bureaucratic hurdles obstructing major industry development. As supply chains mature and federal laws loosen, the consumer demand driving the hemp market will increasingly represent a lucrative high-growth opportunity across industrial, agricultural, natural product and cannabis markets.\n“Hemp is a truly remarkable plant. If cultivated and used in products on a global scale this plant could revolutionize the global economy — as a food source to address hunger and malnutrition, as a bio-material to stop plastic pollution, as a medicinal to help people of all ages, and as a natural fiber and fuel source to build a more sustainable common home for us all,” Murphy added.\nAbout New Frontier Data:\nNew Frontier Data provides objective, rigorous and comprehensive analysis and reporting for the nascent and underserved cannabis industry. New Frontier’s data and reports have been cited in over 65 countries around the world to inform industry leaders. New Frontier Data, the premiere Big Data shop in the sector looks beyond the plant cultivation and distribution, to raise the industry bar and improve visibility into what will inevitably soon be a mature and more complex industry.
