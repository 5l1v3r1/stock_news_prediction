The company had temporarily suspended operations in the region in October after a controversial independence referendum sparked tensions between Baghdad and the semiautonomous area’s government. Before that, Chevron in September had drilled an oil well at its Sarta block in Iraqi Kurdistan after a two-year gap, as its confidence in the area was stablizing despite an international row over the region’s independence referendum plan.
