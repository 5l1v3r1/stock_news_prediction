Security Council, where veto-wielding powers Russia and China said this month they believe the situation in Rakhine was stable and under control.\nThe United States, as well as United Nations, have described the military crackdown in Myanmar as “ethnic cleansing”. About 655,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine for shelter over the border in Bangladesh, according to the United Nations.\nReporting by Robin Emmott; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T14:14:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
