British skier Isabel Atkin took the bronze.\n”After 180 degrees, I stopped my rotation and I fell on my back and hit my head pretty hard,“ Gremaud said. ”I was crying.\n”I had a little bit of a headache... This morning I was praying that everything was alright. I did some concussion test with the doctor.\n“He said everything was alright and I just enjoyed the day.”\nGremaud, who was fifth at last year’s world championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain, appeared to have landed a knock-out punch in the first run of the final when she scored an 88.00 with an acrobatic routine that put her top of the standings.\nShe held the lead until deep into the third and final run before the 27-year-old Hoefflin snatched the gold away from her at the death with a score of 91.20.\nShe was still thrilled with her silver and happy for Switzerland to have two on the podium in the event’s second Games following its debut at Sochi where North Americans hogged the podium.\n”I was so stoked, that was really amazing,“ said Gremaud. ”I was just staying cool and not really thinking about it, just enjoying it.\n“I was happy for (Hoefflin), I got a silver, so I can’t complain.” (Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:09:01.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
