He recorded the primary assist on Granlund’s first goal and the secondary assist on Granlund’s second goal.\nA night after becoming the eighth active player to reach 900 career points, Staal recorded his 13th career game with at least four points and first since March 8, 2015, when he played for the Carolina Hurricanes. He has six goals and 12 points in his last eight games and 904 career points.\nFor most of the game, Granlund had his third career hat trick. He was credited with Minnesota’s second first-period goal until a scoring change with about a minute left gave the tally to Staal.\nGranlund scored Minnesota’s first goal and recorded his second goal midway through the third period, as Minnesota never trailed and won its fourth straight road game while completing a sweep of the three New York-area teams. He tied a career high with his second career four-point game.\nDevan Dubnyk made 22 saves for Minnesota.\nJesper Fast scored for the Rangers, whose losing streak reached six games. The Rangers scratched Rick Nash, who will likely be dealt before Monday’s trading deadline, and have lost six straight in regulation for the first time since a seven-game skid Dec. 17-29, 2006.\nThe Wild took a 2-0 lead in a span of 97 seconds late in the first.\nMinnesota went up 1-0 with 3:54 remaining when Staal deflected a clearing attempt by New York defenseman Anthony DeAngelo from behind the net to the low slot. Granlund quickly gained possession and lifted a shot over Alexandar Georgiev’s glove.\nThe Wild doubled their lead with 1:17 left when Granlund forced a turnover in the defensive zone. Parise and Staal teamed up on a give-and-go, and Parise’s pass was deflected in by Staal.\nNew York scored 2:41 into the second when Fast finished off an odd-man rush with J.T. Miller.\nThe Wild scored twice in the third period to seal it, as Staal deflected defenseman Ryan Suter’s point shot on a power play 52 seconds in and Granlund finished an odd-man rush with Jason Zucker with 10:38 remaining.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:12:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
