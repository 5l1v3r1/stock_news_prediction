Several more remain under pressure to answer questions around their eligibility.\nDespite the upturn in support for Turnbull, the government has now recorded 26 consecutive polls showing Labor will win a decisive victory at the next election.\nTurnbull now faces the embarrassing prospect of surpassing the 30 consecutive losing polls that he said justified his ousting of former leader Tony Abbott in September 2015.\nAbbott offered little support to his long-time rival as parliament resumed for the first sitting day of 2018.\n“The next election is winnable for the coalition provided we sharpen up the policy difference with Labor,” Abbott told 2GB radio.\nIncome tax cuts are likely to form the centerpiece of Turnbull’s plan to win favor with the electorate, but with a large budget deficit the government is left with only a few fiscal tools to win over disillusioned voters.\nReporting by Colin Packham; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T03:47:25.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
