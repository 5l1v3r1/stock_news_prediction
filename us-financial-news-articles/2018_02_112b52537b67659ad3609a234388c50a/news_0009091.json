He succeeds Thomas Doran, who departed MRM last year.\nKhoja brings an extensive background as a healthcare actuary and management consultant to his new role, joining MRM from Milliman in Chicago, where he focused on the growth of Milliman’s stop-loss management and employee benefits businesses. Prior to Milliman, Khoja spent 13 years with Mercer Health and Benefits as a principal and actuary, most recently serving as Central Market Stop Loss Center of Excellence leader and an employee benefits consultant to a range of mid-market employers. Khoja is a frequent conference speaker on stop-loss marketplace issues and the author of multiple industry survey reports.\n“I could not be more pleased to have Mehb join MRM’s leadership team,” said MRM Chairman Mike McLean. “Mehb’s impressive background is deeply rooted in understanding both the client and carrier sides of the medical stop-loss equation. His expertise will be especially valuable to MRM clients in today’s fluid healthcare environment as employers continue to look for solutions to help them efficiently manage employee benefit costs.”\nKhoja received a Bachelor of Arts in actuarial science and finance from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries and a Member of the American Academy of Actuaries.\nSymetra Financial Corporation acquired Medical Risk Managers, Inc., in May 2007.

Medical stop-loss insurance coverage helps protect employers that self-insure their employee benefit plans against large, potentially catastrophic claims.\nAbout Medical Risk Managers\nMedical Risk Managers, Inc. is a full-service managing general underwriting and consulting firm that specializes in group stop-loss insurance.
