Nashville held leads of 2-0 after the first period and 3-1 after the second before adding four more goals in the third.\nNick Bonino scored a goal and assisted on the winner. Viktor Arvidsson, Ryan Johansen and Calle Jarnkrok also tallied a goal and an assist for the Predators, who posted their third straight win. Scott Hartnell, Kevin Fiala and Mattias Ekholm had one goal apiece.\nP.K. Subban and Roman Josi both furnished two assists as Nashville remained two points back of the Tampa Bay Lightning in the race for the league’s best overall record.\nLogan Couture scored San Jose’s lone goal as the Sharks saw their win streak end at three games.\nSharks goaltender Aaron Dell recorded 39 saves on 46 shots in his first start since Feb. 10 against Edmonton. With San Jose playing the first of back-to-back road games, Dell went the distance instead of being pulled.\nBonino opened the scoring on a wraparound 1:55 into the game. The Predators went ahead 2-0 with 43 seconds left in the first period as Hartnell put in Bonino’s bouncing pass on a two-on-one.\nCouture got the Sharks on the scoreboard at 8:37 of the second period, squeezing a backhand from the corner between Rinne and the post. However, Fiala gave the Preds a 3-1 advantage at 15:57 as he kept the puck on a two-on-one. Fiala appeared to lose control of the puck as he attempted a deke, but the disk slid under Dell.\nArvidsson, with his fourth goal in three games, and Johansen put the game out of reach as they scored less than three minutes apart early in the third period. Then Ekholm and Jarnkrok padded Nashville’s lead further.\nSharks forward Tomas Hertl returned to the lineup after missing three games with an undisclosed upper-body injury. Center Eric Fehr played his first game for San Jose since being acquired in a trade Tuesday from the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:39:09.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
