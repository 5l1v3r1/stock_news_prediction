Our action follows a full and thorough investigation. \n”West Ham United will not tolerate any type of discrimination. \n“The West Ham United family is an inclusive one where, regardless of gender, age, ability, race, religion or sexual orientation, everybody feels welcome and included.” \nThe decision follows the Football Association announcing on Thursday that it was investigating the matter, the same day that West Ham launched their own investigation and suspended Henry. \nHenry joined West Ham in 2014, having previously worked for Everton, Sunderland and Chelsea. \nWest Ham have six first-team squad members of African descent - Cheikhou Kouyate, Pedro Obiang, Joao Mario, Angelo Ogbonna, Arthur Masuaku and Edimilson Fernandes. \nKouyate posted a message on Instagram on Thursday, saying: “African and proud”. \nThe post was liked by team mates Obiang, Masuaku, Manuel Lanzini and Adrian.
