Lawmakers representing Mittelstand interests have long been among her critics.\nParliamentary Mittelstand Circle (PKM) leader Christian von Stetten, 47, was a loud opponent of Merkel’s policies on bailing out Greece during the euro zone crisis and of her decision to open Germany’s borders to over a million migrants in 2015.\nCarsten Linnemann, head of the Mittelstand Association of the CDU/CSU (MIT), went as far as to abstain in the party leadership’s vote on endorsing the new grand coalition.\nBut other powerful interests, including the women‘s, social policy and senior citizens’ wings of the parties are all strong backers of Merkel.\nTHE YOUTH WING Jens Spahn, the 37-year-old arch-conservative state secretary in the finance ministry, has long been seen as one of the conservatives’ rising stars and has long been rumoured to be eyeing the succession.\n“The chancellor should have the courage to make ministers of critical people as well,” his ally Paul Ziemiak, head of the conservative youth organisation, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, urging Merkel to find senior jobs for the next generation.\nDaniel Guenther, 44, the more liberal - and more popular - premier of the state of Schleswig-Holstein, fresh from a shock victory in regional elections last year, is seen as a less threatening possible successor.\nOLD RIVALS Friedrich Merz, 62, and Wolfgang Bosbach, 65, who once vied with Merkel for the party leadership, are freer than most to criticise the chancellor, but their age means none could offer the kind of generational handover many are pushing for. The same goes for Roland Koch, 59, former premier of the state of Hessen. All three are regarded as more uncompromisingly conservative than Merkel.\nTHE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS Despite the SPD’s dismal poll showing - an INSA poll has them on 16.5 percent, barely ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) - the party holds Merkel’s future in its hands.\nIf the more radical members follow their hearts and vote against party leadership to reject a new grand coalition, fresh elections, a minority government, or renewed negotiations with smaller parties on a three-way coalition could ensue. In all those scenarios, the price could be Merkel’s departure.
