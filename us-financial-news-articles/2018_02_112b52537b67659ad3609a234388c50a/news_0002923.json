The pipeline hauls more than 3 million barrels of fuel from the refinery hub on the U.S. Gulf Coast to northeast distribution centers every day.\nChevron, Valero and Delta complained to FERC that Colonial overcharged the companies by more than $60 million combined, and is potentially monopolizing fuel delivery into the New York region.\nBP and Trafigura joined the companies in alleging that Colonial’s opaque fee structure pushed its 2016 interstate revenue to exceed its costs by $339.3 million, earning it about a 29 percent realized return on equity.\n“Excess earnings of this magnitude are far above the levels that the Commission has found to be sufficient to justify holding hearings in recent rate investigations of other pipelines,” BP and Trafigura said.\nOverall, BP Products’ total estimated overpayment to Colonial for shipping fuel between January 2016 through December 2017, including so-called contentious “product loss allocation fees,” was $55.5 million, according to the complaint. Trafigura’s total estimated overpayment to Colonial during the same period was $27.2 million, the complaint said.\nThe companies seek reparations of those amounts and asked FERC to investigate whether Colonial should be allowed to charge market-based rates due to its monopoly in some markets.\nColonial could not immediately be reached for comment but the company defended its fees in December saying the complaint from Chevron, Valero and Delta was based on “purposefully manipulated” financial data.\nOthers including refiner Phillips 66, Flint Hills Resources LP and Castleton Commodities have filed to intervene in the proceeding.\nReporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T01:24:41.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
