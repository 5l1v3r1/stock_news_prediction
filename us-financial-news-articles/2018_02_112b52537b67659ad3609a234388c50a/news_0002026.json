It expects adjusted free cash flow of $500 million to $700 million, compared to previous estimates of breaking even.\nShares jumped 4.9 percent to $5.35 in premarket trading.\nThe company reported net additions of 184,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the quarter, compared to additions of 368,000 a year earlier.\n“Volumes came in surprisingly strong while profitability and cash flow were also better,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note.\nNet operating revenue in the third quarter ended Dec. 31 was $8.24 billion, down from $8.55 billion a year earlier.\nSprint reported quarterly net income of $7.16 billion, or $1.79 per share, due to the impact of federal tax reforms, after a loss of $479 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding the impact of tax cuts signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year, net income was 3 cents a share.\nAccording to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts had expected revenue of $8.15 billion and a net loss of 4 cents a share.\nReporting by Anjali Athavaley; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:18:22.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
