We see opportunities for improvement across the business and are focused on optimizing store-level inventory to drive productivity throughout our entire store base. The shifting retail landscape is providing an attractive environment for quality, branded merchandise and new vendor relationships. Heading into the spring selling season, we are well positioned from an inventory standpoint with fresh receipts and consistent flow of new product.”\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results of Operations\nNet sales were $333.8 million, compared to $328.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company’s sales comparison to the prior year is impacted by the net closure of 16 stores during the last twelve months.\nComparable store sales increased 1.8% compared to the same period a year ago, and were comprised of a 1.9% increase in customer transactions, slightly offset by a 0.1% decrease in average ticket. During the second quarter, 14 stores were relocated, four stores were opened, two stores were expanded, and eight stores were closed, for an ending store count of 724 as of December 31, 2017. Sales at the 55 stores relocated during the past 12 months increased approximately 52% on average for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the prior year quarter and contributed approximately 340 basis points of comparable store sales growth, driven primarily by better real estate and larger average store footprint.\nGross profit decreased $0.3 million to $105.7 million compared to $106.0 million of gross profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the second quarter fiscal 2018 was 31.7% compared to 32.3% last year. The decrease in gross margin for the quarter was primarily due to a significant unfavorable shift from the first fiscal quarter in markdown timing as compared to the same period in the prior year. Partially offsetting this increase in costs was a continued improvement in initial merchandise mark-up along with lower buying and supply chain costs recognized as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were relatively consistent at $97.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $97.2 million in the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 29.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 29.6% in the same period last year. This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by reduced advertising expenses in the current year. Also contributing to the decrease in SG&A in the current quarter were reductions in certain other corporate expenses, including labor costs, and legal and professional fees, which decreased both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in the current year quarter from the prior year quarter. Partially offsetting these decreased costs were higher store rent and depreciation, due in part to the Company’s strategy to improve store real estate.\nThe Company’s operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $8.3 million, compared to operating income of $8.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company reported net income of $8.7 million, or $0.19 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to net income of $8.4 million, or $0.19 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company’s net income in the current period reflects a favorable tax impact of approximately $0.5 million resulting from recent tax law changes.\nThe Company reported EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $15.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to EBITDA of $14.5 million for the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $16.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $17.2 million for the prior year period, primarily driven by the change in net income as compared to the prior year period as adjusted for incremental costs relating to the ramp-up of the Company’s Phoenix distribution center in the prior year period. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided below.\nSix Months ended December 31, 2017 Results of Operations\nNet sales were $552.6 million, compared to $540.0 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017. The Company’s sales comparison to the prior year is impacted by the net closure of 16 stores during the last twelve months.\nComparable store sales increased 2.5% compared to the same period a year ago, and were comprised of a 2.3% increase in customer transactions, along with a 0.2% increase in average ticket. During the first six months of fiscal 2018, 26 stores were relocated, eight stores were opened, seven stores were expanded, and 15 stores were closed, for an ending store count of 724 as of December 31, 2017. Sales at the 55 stores relocated during the past 12 months increased approximately 59% on average for the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the prior year quarter and contributed approximately 370 basis points of comparable store sales growth, driven primarily by better real estate and larger average store footprint.\nGross profit increased $0.3 million to $183.6 million compared to $183.3 million of gross profit in the first six months of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 33.2% compared to 33.9% last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the recognition of previously capitalized supply chain and freight costs, including an approximate 50 basis point impact of elevated costs related to the supply chain issues the Company incurred in the prior fiscal year. Additionally, markdowns increased slightly in the current year period. Partially offsetting these increases in costs was an improvement in initial merchandise mark-up.\nSG&A increased $3.6 million to $187.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared to $183.8 million in the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 33.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to 34.0% in the same period last year. This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by reduced advertising expenses in the current year. Also contributing to the decrease in SG&A in the current year period were reductions in certain other corporate expenses, including labor costs, and legal and professional fees, which decreased both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in the current year from the prior year period. Partially offsetting these decreased costs were higher store rent and depreciation, due in part to the Company’s strategy to improve store real estate.\nThe Company’s operating loss for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was $3.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $0.5 million for the prior year period.\nThe Company reported a net loss of $3.6 million, or $0.08 per share, in the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per share, in the prior year period. The Company’s net loss in the current period reflects a favorable tax impact of approximately $0.5 million resulting from recent tax law changes.\nThe Company reported EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $9.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared to EBITDA of $10.2 million for the prior year period. The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $12.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $14.8 million for the prior year period, primarily driven by the change in net income as compared to the prior year period as adjusted for incremental costs relating to the ramp-up of the Company’s Phoenix distribution center in the prior year period. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided below.\nThe Company ended the second quarter of fiscal 2018 with $9.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, no outstanding balance under its line of credit, and availability on the line of $102.9 million. Inventories at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $220.0 million compared to $251.5 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017, a decrease of $31.5 million or 12.5%. The decrease in inventory was driven primarily by lower distribution center and in-transit inventory levels, due in part to the Company’s continued supply chain and inventory management improvements. The Company’s inventory turnover for the trailing five quarters as of December 31, 2017 was 2.6 turns, an improvement of approximately 9% from the trailing five quarter turnover as of December 31, 2016 of 2.4 turns.\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company continues to expect comparable sales for fiscal 2018 to increase 2% to 5%. Gross margin is expected to show year over year improvement beginning in the second half of fiscal 2018 resulting in significant projected EBITDA improvement. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of approximately $25 million to $30 million in fiscal 2018, with a continuing focus on real estate strategy for new stores, relocations and expansions of existing stores, and IT infrastructure and enhancements.\nAbout Tuesday Morning\nTuesday Morning Corporation (NASDAQ:TUES) is one of the original off-price retailers specializing in name-brand, high quality products for the home, selling luxury textiles, furnishings, housewares and seasonal decor.

Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash items and other items that the Company does not believe are representative of its core operating performance. These measures are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss as a measure of operating performance. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not presented as, and should not be considered as, alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by such adjustments. The Company believes it is useful for investors to see these EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures that management uses to evaluate the Company’s operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are included to supplement the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and because the Company uses these measures to monitor and evaluate the performance of its business as a supplement to GAAP measures and believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures enhances investors’ ability to analyze trends in the Company’s business and evaluate the Company’s performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry. The non-GAAP measures presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income/(Loss) to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:\nThe following table reconciles net income/(loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure:\n(unaudited - in thousands) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Six Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income/(loss) (GAAP) $ 8,692 $ 8,430 $ (3,562 ) $ (426 ) Depreciation and amortization 6,516 5,393 12,724 9,976 Interest expense, net 530 403 965 658 Income tax provision/(benefit) (587 ) 312 (408 ) 11 EBITDA $ 15,151 $ 14,538 $ 9,719 $ 10,219 Share-based compensation expense (1) 1,171 1,578 1,946 2,316 Cease-use rent expense (2) 449 166 794 473 Phoenix distribution center related expenses (3) — 1,087 — 2,137 Stockholder nominations related expenses (4) 29 — 408 — Gain on sale of assets (5) (186 ) (185 ) (371 ) (371 ) Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 16,614 $ 17,184 $ 12,496 $ 14,774\n(1) Charges related to share-based compensation programs, which vary from period to period depending on volume and vesting timing of awards.
