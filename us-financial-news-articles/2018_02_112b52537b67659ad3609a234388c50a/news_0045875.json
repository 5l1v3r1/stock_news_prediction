Thomson Reuters Foundation / Adela Suliman Residents say it has boosted incomes, too.\nSarki, a 54-year-old widow, said the time she has saved by no longer having to walk far to fetch water has allowed her and other women farmers to take up second jobs - in her case as a laborer on a dairy farm.\nThe additional water also means she can grow more produce not just to feed herself, but to sell at the market.\n“My income has doubled,” she said, noting proudly that she can now grow crops, including tomatoes and cauliflowers, for two seasons a year.\nThe project also trains farmers to use water more efficiently, grow off-season vegetables such as sweet peppers under plastic sheets that serve as makeshift greenhouses, and promote their produce to local markets and traders.\nCOMMUNITY SPIRIT One unintended consequence, said Bolakhe, has been bringing the community closer together as neighbors have to interact to manage the water system.\nIt allows for equal distribution of water among all castes, including lower-caste Dalits like Sarki, and encourages villagers to meet and collaborate, he said.\nRabindra Karki from International Development Enterprises (iDE) Nepal, a partner of the project that helps poor farmers, said the initiative had united villagers over a shared resource.\n“They’re aware of the system as theirs - they perceive that it’s for them, to fulfill their needs,” he said.\nKarki, whose organization has set up other solar-powered water systems in Nepal as part of the Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) program, funded by the British government, said access to water is crucial for villagers to get back on their feet after the quake.\nSolar irrigation is more reliable and efficient than traditional water systems as it is less vulnerable to erratic rainfall and high altitudes, he said.\nThe technology should be rolled out to more remote parts of the country to help disadvantaged communities, he added.\nReporting by Adela Suliman; editing by Zoe Tabary and Megan Rowling.
