We all know that ... But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong and they’re headed in the right direction.”\n(See the interactive graphic \"Trump takes credit for stock market records\" here: tmsnrt.rs/2E4FmaQ )\nThroughout a speech at a factory in Blue Ash, Ohio, Trump made no mention of stock markets, departing sharply from past practice.\nIn his State of the Union address last week, Trump said, “The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion and more in value in just this short period of time.”\n‘TREMENDOUS BENEFITS’\nOn Jan. 7, he wrote on Twitter, “The Stock Market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only Record Setting Stock Prices, but present and future Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. Seven TRILLION dollars of value created since our big election win!”\nThree days before that, he tweeted, “Dow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.” He had sent similar tweets for months.\nThe Republican president told Reuters in a Jan. 17 interview he has been getting kudos from people grateful for increased 401(k) retirement plan values and he believed the rise would not have happened if his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 presidential election.\n“If the Democrats won the election, the stock market would have gone down 50 percent from where it was, and now look at the percentage increase. It’s a record increase,” Trump said.\nThe benchmark Dow Jones industrial average soared 42 percent between Election Day 2016, when Trump won the presidency, and its historic peak a week ago above 26,400.\nOn Monday, the Dow fell to below 24,000 but regained some of its midday losses to close at 24,345. In the past five trading days, the index has erased all its gains since late November.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 has pulled back more than 6 percent from a Jan. 26 record high.\nThe “Trump rally,” as some traders have dubbed it, has coincided with a sweeping tax code overhaul approved in December, which slashed corporate taxes, and a deregulation push.\nThe S&P 500 rose 34 percent from Trump’s election to its recent high.\nBut stock prices have been climbing since March 2009, when Obama inherited a serious financial crisis and the worst economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s from the previous Republican administration of George W. Bush. At that time, the Dow was trading at around 6,500.\nTrump has also criticized his predecessor Obama’s effect on markets. In November 2012, Trump tweeted, “The stock market and U.S. dollar are both plunging today. Welcome to @BarackObama’s second term.”\nThe S&P 500 rose 126 percent from Obama’s 2008 election to his final day in office in 2017.\nFormer Obama press secretary Jay Carney on Monday tweeted, “Good time to recall that in the previous administration, we NEVER boasted about the stock market -- even though the Dow more than doubled on Obama’s watch -- because we knew two things: 1) the stock market is not the economy; and 2) if you claim the rise, you own the fall.”\nDoug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former economic adviser to 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, said, “The president shouldn’t comment about the stock market. Indeed if anyone is going to make major pronouncements about economic data, it should be the Treasury secretary or the agency releasing the data, so if they get it wrong you can get rid of them. You don’t want the president owning those things.”\nReporting by Steve Holland in Washington and Trevor Hunnicutt in New York; Writing by Kevin Drawbaugh; Editing by Will Dunham and Caren Bohan.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T02:46:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
