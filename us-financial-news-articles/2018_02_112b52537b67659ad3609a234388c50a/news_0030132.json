Qualcomm said the meeting was attended by Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf, Chief Financial Officer George Davis and Chairman Paul Jacobs, among others.

However, the company offered to meet Broadcom to see if it can address what it called “serious deficiencies in value and certainty in its proposal.” Qualcomm and Broadcom planned to meet on Feb. 14, Reuters reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. Broadcom had initially made a $103 billion offer for Qualcomm in early November.
