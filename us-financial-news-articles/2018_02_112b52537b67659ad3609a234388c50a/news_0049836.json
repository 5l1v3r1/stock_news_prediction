Her diverse supply chain and client management experience helps shape Transportation Insight's multi-phase solution designs, empowering clients to expand market presence, reduce total landed cost of goods and increase customer satisfaction. Led by Dabbs for nearly a decade, Transportation Insight's Solutions division has helped hundreds of clients evolve their processes to realize millions of dollars in hard and soft savings.\n\"Sophie's expertise is foundational in the architecting of robust solutions that help client partners protect profit margins, realize measurable supply chain value and drive enterprise sustainability,\" says Transportation Insight President and CEO Chris Baltz. \"Retailers, manufacturers and distributors increasingly are seeking a logistics partner with data-driven insights and proven strategies for maximizing agility. Sophie's approach to change management, and in particular the leading role culture plays in business transformation, enables Transportation Insight to design the most effective methods to evolve a client's processes and drive compliance to improve business performance.\"\nDabbs regularly shares her insight with the marketplace. Her content has appeared in industry publications such as Inbound Logistics including \"10 Tips: Cutting Costs While Delighting Customers.\" Dabbs frequently presents at industry and association events such as the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program's Manufacturing Day. She has served as exhibit speaker at the Council for Supply Chain Management Professionals' national conference and at Association for Manufacturing Excellence events, where she discussed Transportation Insight's proprietary Extended LEAN® methodology of continuous improvement for the end-to-end supply chain.\nIn conjunction with logistics industry thought leaders across all disciplines, Transportation Insight leverages Dabbs' two decades of experience managing transportation and supply chain operations to design efficient, sustainable strategies that better align shippers' processes with business goals. As a U.S. EPA SmartWay® Excellence Awardee, Transportation Insight executes supply chain solutions that offer immediate and long-term return while allowing for flexibility to address inevitable shifts in the marketplace.\n\"Creating hard ROI for our clients is a key part of what our Solutions team does,\" says Dabbs, \"but what I am most proud of is what we do to make the client better over the course of our partnership – how we help them scale, avoid risk and grow in their marketplace.\"\nThrough a pragmatic approach and candor, Dabbs facilitates high-trust, open conversations that drive action plans and help client partners understand the importance of adapting initiatives as goals are reached and strategies evolve.\n\"For a small to mid-cap client, we may be talking about a consultative Co-managed Logistics® partnership solution that employs technology applications to improve supply chain visibility and provide better connectivity with their carriers,\" Dabbs says. \"With a Fortune 500 enterprise, while our solutions are based on the same core components, that conversation may be more focused around control, risk mitigation and broader data visibility so they can make more advanced business decisions. Further, that very large company could be a retailer with an acute e-commerce issue they need to solve, and they need a partner that can provide parcel optimization, transparency in the supply chain and understanding of SKU-level profitability.\"\nDabbs' experience gained working alongside clients with diverse operations and products – including those in the Automotive, Paper, Consumer Packaged Goods, Industrial and Food Manufacturing, and Entertainment industries – enhances Transportation Insight's ability to evaluate and counsel shippers on multiple value streams.\n\"The overarching theme in the industry today is disruption, and the speed of change is unprecedented. Business transformation isn't optional – it is necessary for survival,\" Dabbs says. \"As an expertise multiplier, we are taking work off other people's plates, so they can focus on things that are more strategic. The work is still being done – in an effective, visible fashion that allows more information to be collected and acted upon – but we are freeing up time, so that a client's human capital can focus on accomplishing bigger and better things for their organization.\"\nDabbs is among three Transportation Insight thought leaders receiving 2018 Pros to Know recognition. Executive Vice President of Enterprise Business Solutions Ken Wacker and Senior Director of Integrated Solutions Bill Loftis were also selected as Pros to Know from more than 300 nominations. With this year's awards, Transportation Insight's industry experts have received Pro to Know recognition nine times in the past five years.\nThe Pros to Know Awards recognize supply chain executives, and manufacturing and non-manufacturing enterprises, that are leading initiatives to help prepare their companies' supply chains for the significant challenges of today's business climate.
