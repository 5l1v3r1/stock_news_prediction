REUTERS/Pedro Nunes \nThis year’s theme is Tides and Oceans. On a tableau in the town centre, there is a figure of German Chancellor Angela Merkel as a mermaid. The heads of Putin and Kim are attached to the bodies of sharks holding knives and forks. \nPresident Donald Trump also appears with a shark’s body and is held fast by Neptune, god of the sea.

Behind him is an angry Kim Jong Un holding a rocket. \n“We have a great variety of originality,” said Cesar Costa, one of the organizers. “This is a carnival about political and social satire.” \nCarnivals marking the start of Lent have been celebrated in Portugal for centuries and in many towns last several days.
