Ronaldo returned to the starting line-up after being rested for Wednesday’s game with Leganes and after shaking off a painful ankle knock the Portuguese put Real ahead on the stroke of halftime, taking advantage of a clever backheel from Benzema. Slideshow (7 Images) Benzema was also the catalyst for Real’s second goal which came under a minute into the second half, with the Frenchman winning the ball back in midfield and tearing towards goal, slipping it into Bale’s path for the Wales international to slot it inside the near post. Ronaldo struck Real’s third goal of the day and his 299th in La Liga in the 61st minute, meeting a cutback from in-form winger Lucas Vazquez first time and sending it under the reach of former Real goalkeeper Fernando Pacheco. Ronaldo then surrendered the opportunity to score a hat-trick by offering Benzema penalty-taking duties after Bale was brought down, and the Frenchman made no mistake, converting from the spot in the 89th minute. Real are third in the standings on 51 points, 11 behind leaders Barcelona who host Girona later on Saturday and four from Atletico, who can widen the gap back to seven when they visit Sevilla on Sunday.
