NATSO's Board of Directors also deemed that revenue generated by any funding solution should contain automatic adjustments to mitigate trends that decrease the revenue it generates.\nWith the Trump Administration calling on Congress to produce a bipartisan $1.5 trillion bill for new infrastructure investment, a number of business groups have introduced plans for making the Highway Trust Fund solvent, including the American Trucking Associations' Building America Fund, which is consistent with most of NATSO's newly adopted funding principles. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also has proposed a 25-cent per gallon increase in the gasoline tax.\nNATSO has long supported an increase in the motor fuels taxes as the most efficient and cost-effective method for generating long-term, sustainable revenues for infrastructure.\nNATSO is the trade association of America's travel plaza and truckstop industry. Founded in 1960, NATSO represents the industry on legislative and regulatory matters; serves as the official source of information on the diverse travel plaza and truckstop industry; provides education to its members; conducts an annual convention and trade show; and supports efforts to generally improve the business climate in which its members operate.\nContact: Tiffany Wlazlowski Neuman\nVice President, Public Affairs\ntwlazlowski@natso.com\n(o) 703-739-8578\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/natso-board-of-directors-adopts-infrastructure-funding-principles-300601255.html\nSOURCE NATSO, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/natso-board-of-directors-adopts-infrastructure-funding-principles-300601255.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T22:18:00.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
