Robben curled the ball home from the edge of the area and then tapped in from close range to complete an emphatic win late on. \nBayer Leverkusen host Werder Bremen later on Tuesday, while the semi-final lineup will be completed on Wednesday when last year’s runners-up Eintracht Frankfurt host Mainz 05 and VfL Wolfsburg visit Schalke 04 in the remaining quarter-final ties.
