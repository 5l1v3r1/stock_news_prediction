What you can’t do is rock the boat. \n“He played cat-and-mouse with us. It arrived at a point where we saw where things were going so we told him we would not pay his contract renewal loyalty fee.” \nNeymar and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. \nNeymar renewed his deal with Barcelona in July 2016, which meant he was owed a 26-million-euros renewal bonus. \nBarcelona did not pay it and deposited the money with a notary. FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, are investigating an official complaint from the forward regarding the matter. \nMestre said Neymar’s behaviour caused inflation in the transfer market. \n“He told us nothing. If he had done PSG would have been able to buy him for less money and it would have cost us less to sign players too,” added the Barcelona executive. \n“What Neymar’s behaviour created was the market inflation. We would have saved a lot of money and a lot of media noise.” \n($1 = 0.8026 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T16:22:10.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
