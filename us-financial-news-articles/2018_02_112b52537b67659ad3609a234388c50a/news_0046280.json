Noi has established career-highs in scoring in three of his past four games.\nKenrich Williams added 16 points, Vladimir Brodziansky hit for 14, Alex Robinson scored 11 points and distributed 9 assists and Desmond Bane tallied 10 points. Ahmed Hamdy-Mohamed racked up 12 points off the bench for TCU, which has won two of its past three games.\nThe Horned Frogs (18-9, 6-8 in Big 12 play) swept the season series from the Cowboys for the first time ever. TCU outshot Oklahoma State 54.4 percent-36.7 percent for the game\nKendall Smith led the Cowboys (15-12, 5-9 in Big 12 play) with 21 points while Mitchell Solomon added 13 points for Oklahoma State, which suffered its second straight loss and third in its past four games.\nOklahoma State scored the first nine points of the game and led by as many as 12 points before the Horned Frogs finally found their stride. Down 14-2, TCU fought back to take the lead at 29-28 on two Brodziansky free throws with 4:53 to play in the first half and stayed on top the rest of the half.\nThe Horned Frogs led 39-36 at halftime thanks to a 12-of-17 showing from the free throw line and shooting 46.4 percent from the floor, a number brought down when they made just 1 of 8 shots from beyond the arc.\nNoi led all scorers with 11 points while Cameron McGriff paced the Cowboys with 9 points over the game’s first 20 minutes of action.\nNext up for TCU is a road game at Iowa State on Wednesday, the same night Oklahoma State plays at home vs. No. 7 Texas Tech.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:09:07.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
