It will be an excellent Olympic Games.”\nThe flame will be lit during the opening ceremony inside the Olympic Stadium, the torch completing its journey from ancient Olympia in Greece last October and reaching its destination after more than 100 days moving around South Korea.\nPresident of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach and United Nations President of the General Assembly, Miroslav Lacjak, take part in the PyeongChang 2018 Torch Relay ahead of the start of the games in Pyeongchang, South Korea February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Florian Choblet/Pool Preparations for the Games were rocky in the initial years after Pyeongchang was awarded the Games on its third attempt in 2011, with construction delays, changes in leadership and financial problems among the early issues.\nHowever, organizers have managed to complete construction in time for the Feb. 9-25 Olympics.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “I am sure Korea will show all its culture and welcome all the world to this festival. I wish these Games to be remembered as a great festival on a human scale,” Bach added. “That is the message we want to get across.”\nBach also briefly chatted with Games chief Lee Hee-beom, who was set to run with the flame a little later.\n“It is finally time,” Lee said. “We start tonight after seven long years. We can also say that God has helped us with the weather as it will be warmer this evening.”\nTemperatures have stayed below freezing in the past days, dropping to as low as minus 21C and causing headaches for organizers, but the forecast for Friday evening suggests there will be milder weather in the region.\n“We are now ready and look forward to the start and to successful Games,” Lee said.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T04:47:33.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
