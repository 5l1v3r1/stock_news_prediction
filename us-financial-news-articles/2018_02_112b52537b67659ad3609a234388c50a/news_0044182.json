REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton The doping case has come at a delicate time for Russia, which has been accused of running a state-backed, systematic doping program for years, an allegation Moscow denies.\nRussians are competing at Pyeongchang as neutral athletes, and Russia had been hoping that a clean record at the Games would enable it to return to full Olympic status.\nKrushelnitsky and his wife Anastasia Bryzgalova have agreed to surrender their medals, according to the Russian curling federation.\nRussian Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov said on Wednesday he hoped the Pyeongchang doping case would not impact the IOC’s deliberations on whether to let Russia regain full Olympic status.\nThe IOC has said it might allow the Russians to march with the country’s flag and in national uniform at the closing ceremony of the Games on Sunday, provided they have complied with its code of conduct on neutrality.\nThe code requires compliance with IOC anti-doping rules.\nThe Russian Olympic delegation has said it could not explain how meldonium had ended up in Krushelnitsky’s body and pledged to investigate.\nEditing by Toby Davis/Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T10:10:16.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
