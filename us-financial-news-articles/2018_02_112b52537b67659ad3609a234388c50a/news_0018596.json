The U.S. case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the Canadian case is filed in the Canadian Federal Court in Toronto.\nShares of Gilead, which rose 3 percent to close at $82.76 in regular trading, were down 1 percent at $82.01 after hours.\n(Reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Matthew Lewis and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T01:15:56.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
