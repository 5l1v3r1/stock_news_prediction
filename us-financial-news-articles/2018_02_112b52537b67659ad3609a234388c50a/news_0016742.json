Details of the terminated talks were not available. \nAshland has a $4.6 billion market capitalisation and is active in more than 100 countries, providing chemicals products to various industries including automotive, energy and construction. \nThe IPO of its Valvoline business marked the last stage of the companyâ€™s move away from oil refining to focus on specialty chemicals, a shift that took a decade. Ashland did not respond to a request for comment. Croda declined to comment. \nThe talks between the two chemicals firms comes amid a surge in dealmaking since the start of 2018. Global merger and acquisitions volumes reached $332.8 billion last month, making it the busiest January for deals since 2000, when markets were gripped by the dotcom bubble, Thomson Reuters data shows. \nThe jump in M&A activity has included British companies, with Melrose Industries ( MRON.L ) last month launching its hostile pursuit of FTSE 100 engineering business GKN ( GKN.L ) and Informa ( INF.L ) striking a deak to acquire conference organiser UBM ( UBM.L ) \nShares in Ashland were down 2 percent at 1558 GMT and Croda stock was up 2.8 percent. \n($1 = 0.7191 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T16:12:34.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
