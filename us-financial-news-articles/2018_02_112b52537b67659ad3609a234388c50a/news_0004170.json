If the employers are willing to do that, talks can resume on Monday,” IG Metall chief Joerg Hofmann said.\nThe head of the national employers’ association had told German TV station ZDF earlier on Friday that he hoped the conflict could be resolved early next week.\nReiner Hoffmann, head of Germany’s association of labor unions, said he expected other unions to follow IG Metall’s example and fight for more flexible working hours in upcoming negotiations, according to German weekly Spiegel.\nGermany’s second-biggest union, Verdi, is expected to publish its wage demand for the public sector on Feb. 8.\nVerdi and IG Metall together account for about 15 percent of the German workforce, and other sectors tend to broadly follow their agreements.\n($1 = 0.8039 euros)\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T17:26:43.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
