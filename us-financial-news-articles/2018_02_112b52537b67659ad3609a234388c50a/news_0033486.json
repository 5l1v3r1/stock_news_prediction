Obviously, I’ve watched her play for many years and she’s one of my idols for sure. I‘m just really happy to was able to get through it.”\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:23:35.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
