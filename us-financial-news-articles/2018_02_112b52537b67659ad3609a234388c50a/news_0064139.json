We will never race in this circumstance, and the only thing you do is risk the car,” commented Haas team principal Guenther Steiner.\n“This being the first test of the season, we are lean on spares, and we cannot risk it. And at the moment it does not look much better on Thursday. It is getting warmer but still wet.”\nSlideshow (4 Images) The first of two pre-season tests is due to end on Thursday, with the second at the Circuit de Catalunya next week. The season starts in Australia on March 25.\nTeams had discussed adding a day on to the second test but that would only have been possible by all agreeing to scrap Wednesday’s session.\nMcLaren racing director Eric Boullier said two teams had objected, a move he said was “purely wasting money for selfish interests”.\nWilliams have a private filming day scheduled at the circuit for this Friday.\nThe lack of testing was a blow to Mexican Sergio Perez, who had been due in the Force India on Wednesday and has yet to drive his team’s new car.\nFour-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who completed 25 laps for Mercedes in cold and damp conditions on Monday, was another lacking mileage - which at least allowed Valtteri Bottas to feel ahead of his team mate.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin; Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:30:07.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
