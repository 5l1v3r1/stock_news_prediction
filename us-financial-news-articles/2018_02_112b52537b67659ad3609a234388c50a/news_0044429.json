Product revenues on a comparable basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, rose 4.1% year over year Added $8.4 million in revenue associated with acquisition of Etratech Operating profit of $21.1 million as compared with $26.5 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, largely reflective of increased investment in research and development to drive accelerated revenue growth and CEO transition expenses (“Transition Expenses”) Earnings per share was $(0.14) as compared with $0.71 for the prior-year period Adjusted earnings per share, excluding $0.55 per share of expense related to U.S. tax reform and $0.07 per share related to the Transition Expenses, as well as other items (see table herein), was $0.61. Adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period was $0.68\nFull Year Highlights\nRecord product revenues of $985.7 million increased 7.4% from $917.6 million in 2016. Product revenues on a comparable basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, rose 4.6% year over year Operating profit of $97.3 million as compared with $106.1 million in 2016, reflective of $9.6 million in increased research and development expense as well as higher selling, general and administrative costs related to the full-year impact of acquired companies Earnings per share was $0.96 as compared with $2.09 for the prior-year period Adjusted earnings per share, excluding $0.55 per share of expense related to U.S. tax reform and $0.12 per share related to the Transition Expenses, as well as other items (see table herein), was $2.31. Adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period was $2.59\nGentherm President and CEO, Phil Eyler, said: “The results in the fourth quarter reflect solid growth even as market conditions remain challenging, especially in the North America automotive market. Positive results are beginning to show as we focus on extending our business into new automotive applications such as Battery Thermal Management and Electronic Systems. We also continue to make progress in expanding our technology and innovative capabilities to the medical and industrial markets. I am delighted to be joining Gentherm as we approach the $1 billion dollar revenue mark and, most importantly, as we plot our course for accelerated revenue and earnings growth.”\n2017 Fourth Quarter Financial Review\nProduct revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 grew by $20.6 million, or 8.7%, as compared with the prior-year, to $257.2 million. The year-over-year growth was comprised of a $13.8 million increase in the automotive segment and $6.8 million increase in the industrial segment. On a comparable basis, adjusting in both periods for acquisitions and foreign currency translation, the year-over-year increase in product revenues was 4.1%.\nRevenue growth in Automotive was driven by an $8.4 million contribution from the acquisition of Etratech, as well as higher sales in seat heaters, steering wheel heaters, automotive cables and battery thermal management, partially offset by lower sales of climate controlled seats (“CCS”). The lower CCS revenue was mainly due to the continuing effect of the transition from the higher-priced active cool seat technology to the lower-priced heated and ventilated technology, and a 4% decrease in vehicle production in North America where the Company’s CCS business is concentrated. The technology mix headwind is expected to abate over the course of 2018 as higher volume from new product launches for both technologies and the anticipated increase in North American vehicle production begin to offset the effect of lower prices on platforms that have switched technologies.\nRevenue growth in Industrial resulted from a significant increase in the remote power generation business, partially offset by a modest contraction in the Cincinnati Sub-Zero (“CSZ”) business. See the “Revenue by Product Category” table enclosed herein for additional detail.\nGross margin rate declined to 30.1% in the current year period, as compared with 33.2% in the prior-year period, primarily as a result of cost overruns in the CSZ business, higher fixed costs associated with increased capacity at new manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Macedonia, ramp-up costs in preparation for volume expansion in electronics and battery thermal management, and labor expense inflation at the Ukraine factory.\nNet research and development expenses in the 2017 fourth quarter rose $3.5 million, or 19%, year over year as the Company continued to invest in innovation in automotive interior thermal management devices, automotive cooled storage devices, battery thermal management devices, battery management systems, advanced automotive electronics solutions, medical thermal management devices, and other potential products and related technologies.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $33.6 million in the 2017 fourth quarter were essentially unchanged from the $33.7 million in the prior year-period. The 2017 period included $3.8 million of Transition Expenses, $1.0 million associated with the acquisition of Etratech and $1.0 million of incremental expense related to expansion of the salesforce at CSZ. Offsetting these year-over-year increases were a reduction in equity compensation costs of $3.4 million and $2.0 million recorded in the prior-year period related to a reorganization which was not repeated in the current year.\nAs described more fully in the table included below, “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA,” the Company recorded year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the Transition Expenses in the current year period. Adjusted EBITDA comparisons are particularly valid for the current-year period as they negate the impact of the one-time adjustments required by the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) discussed below.\nIncome tax expense in the 2017 fourth quarter was $23.8 million, as compared with $6.3 million in the prior-year period, including $20.2 million associated with the required adjustments under the Tax Act. While effective tax rates for corporations have been lowered under the Tax Act, the Company’s current expectation is that its full-year effective tax rate will be approximately 24% in 2018 which includes a 400 basis point increase due to the change in accounting required under Accounting Standards Update 2016-16.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company incurred a net foreign currency loss of $1.2 million, which included a net realized gain of $1.2 million and a net unrealized loss of $2.4 million. This unrealized loss was primarily the result of holding significant amounts of U.S. Dollar cash at the Company’s subsidiaries in Europe, as well as certain intercompany relationships between these European subsidiaries and the Company’s U.S.-based companies. In the prior-year period, the Company recognized a net foreign currency gain of $7.7 million, which included a net unrealized foreign currency gain of $6.3 million also related to the Company’s cash held at its European subsidiaries and intercompany cash balances.\nEarnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $(0.14) as compared with $0.71 for the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding $0.55 per share of expense related to U.S. tax reform and $0.07 per share related to the Transition Expenses, as well as other items (see table herein), was $0.61. Adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period was $0.68.\nFull Year Revenue and Earnings Per Share Discussion\nDuring 2017, the Company achieved a $68.1 million, or 7.4%, increase in product revenues as compared with the prior year to $985.7 million. On a comparable basis, adjusting in both periods for acquisitions and foreign currency translation adjustments, the year-over-year increase was 4.6%. This growth was achieved despite a contraction in the U.S. automotive industry, which is a market where the Company derives 50% of its annual Automotive segment revenue.\nIn the Automotive segment, 2017 full-year revenues were $879.5 million, a $32.0 million, or 3.8% increase compared to the prior year. The year-over-year growth included increases in seat heaters ($18.4 million or 6.4% growth), steering wheel heaters ($12.6 million or 25.5% growth), the acquisition of Etratech ($8.4 million), automotive cables ($6.8 million or 8% growth) and battery thermal management ($3.5 million or 53.4% growth). Due to a continuing technology shift, CCS product revenues declined by $17.8 million, or 4.4%.\nThe Company’s Industrial Segment businesses also grew year over year, with 2017 revenues increasing $36.1 million, or 51.4% to $106.2 million. Revenue from the remote power generation business rose $13.3 million, or 71.2%, due to the significant increase in shipments in the current year, as compared with the prior year when demand was impacted by weakness in the energy markets. The CSZ business recorded a revenue increase of $22.8 million, or 44.2%, over the prior year due to 10% organic growth for the full year and the inclusion of twelve months of results as compared with nine months in the prior-year period.\nEarnings per share was $0.96, as compared with $2.09 for the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding $0.55 per share of expense related to U.S. tax reform and $0.12 per share related to the Transition Expenses, as well as other items (see table herein), was $2.31. Adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period was $2.59.\nGuidance\nWith the recent transition to a new Chief Executive Officer, the Company is undertaking a detailed review of its strategic plan and opportunities to accelerate revenue and earnings growth. The Company anticipates that, over the course of the next few months, the management team and the Company’s Board of Directors will collectively determine a new strategic plan. In the interim, the Company provided the following guidance for 2018:\nProduct revenue is expected to grow between 8% and 10% to a range of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion, reflecting 3% to 5% organic growth and the full-year contribution from Etratech, which was acquired in November 2017 Gross margin rate is expected to be between 30% and 32% Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately 15% of product revenue Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $50 million\nDue to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of certain items that would impact net income, such as foreign currency gains and losses, we are unable to reasonably estimate net income, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income with respect to the guidance provided.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, Gentherm will conduct a conference call today at 8:00 AM Eastern Time to review these results.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, deferred financing cost amortization, transaction expenses, debt retirement expenses, unrealized currency gain or loss and unrealized revaluation of derivatives. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of liquidity and the Company's ability to service debt because it provides a measure of cash available for such purposes. Management provides an Adjusted EBITDA measure so that investors will have the same financial information that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors in properly assessing the Company's performance on a period-over-period basis.\nThe term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Gentherm compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\nGENTHERM INCORPORATED ACQUISITION TRANSACTION EXPENSES, PURCHASE ACCOUNTING IMPACTS AND OTHER EFFECTS (Unaudited and in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, Future Full Year Periods (estimated)\n2017 2016 2017 2016 2018 2019 2020 2021 Transaction related current expenses Acquisition transaction expenses $ 789 $ 50 $ 789 $ 743 $ — $ — $ — $ — Non-cash purchase accounting impacts Customer relationships amortization 2,412 1,962 8,197 7,600 10,495 8,281 6,954 34,798 Technology amortization 844 890 2,943 3,407 3,001 2,426 2,426 4,791 Product development costs amortization ― ― ― 42 — — — — Trade name amortization 45 43 132 172 — — — — Inventory fair value adjustment 20 ― 20 3,973 118 39 — — Other effects Unrealized currency loss (gain) 2,393 (6,293 ) 21,819 (6,104 ) — — — — CEO transition expenses 3,757 — 6,694 — — — — — Management reorganization — 2,000 — 2,000 ― ― ― ― Total acquisition transaction expenses, purchase accounting impacts and other effects $ 10,260 $ (1,348 ) $ 40,594 $ 11,833 $ 13,614 $ 10,746 $ 9,380 $ 39,589 Tax effect of above (2,625 ) 253 (10,855 ) (3,549 ) (2,443 ) (1,797 ) (1,489 ) (5,525 ) U.S. Tax Reform 20,153 ― 20,153 ― ― ― ― ― North America reorganization withholding tax (1) ― ― ― 10,100 ― ― ― ― Net income effect $ 27,788 $ (1,095 ) $ 49,892 $ 18,384 $ 11,171 $ 8,949 $ 7,891 $ 34,064 Earnings per share - difference Basic $ 0.76 $ (0.03 ) $ 1.36 $ 0.50 Diluted $ 0.76 $ (0.03 ) $ 1.36 $ 0.50 Adjusted earnings per share Basic $ 0.61 $ 0.68 $ 2.32 $ 2.60 Diluted $ 0.61 $ 0.68 $ 2.31 $ 2.59\n(1) During the first quarter of 2016, we completed a legal reorganization in North America by shifting certain operations located in Canada to other subsidiaries.
