The S&P 500 fell 1.27 percent to finish at 2,744.28 as real estate, consumer discretionaries and telecommunications pulled the broader market lower.\nThe Dow and S&P remain 4.5 percent and 4.4 percent off their all-time highs respectively.\nThe Nasdaq composite fell 1.23 percent to close at 7,330.35 amid declines in Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet.\n\nJerome Powell addressed Congress on Tuesday, detailing the central bank's outlook for monetary policy and economic growth for the coming years. Asked about rate hikes in 2018, the Fed Chair signaled that the option for more than three increases remains open.\n\"We've seen some data that in my case will add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target,\" Powell told lawmakers. \"We've also seen continued strength around the globe. And we've seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. So I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting.\"\nPowell said individual Fed members will be crafting new projections at the central bank's meeting in March, which would be influenced by federal government's ambitious fiscal policies including tax cuts.\nSaul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, testifies during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, February 27, 2018. \"I think [the stock] reaction to his comments about slightly strong growth and that the Fed was more likely to raise rates more in 2018 than investors had anticipated,\" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. \"You saw some reaction, but not a dramatic one. Investors have become increasingly comfortable that if rates continue to rise slowly in response to economic growth, that's a good thing.\"\nWarne added that despite expected hikes, the Fed's monetary policy remains largely accommodative.\nU.S. Treasury yields rose sharply following Powell's optimistic comments , with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note adding 5 basis points to hit 2.915 percent.\n\nA sharp rise in yields earlier this month sparked a widespread sell-off in equities, sending the Dow and S&P 500 into correction territory before partially recovering. The yield on the 10-year note notched a four-year high of 2.95 percent last week, just below the key psychological level of 3 percent.\nDespite the recent market volatility, Powell's prepared comments and question-and-answer testimony appeared to downplay the significance of the turbulence. \n\"He's very optimistic about the economy and he's optimistic they can hit the inflation target,\" said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \"He's going to continue to raise rates and the balance sheet's going to continue to shrink … a measly 1,500 point decline in the Dow is not going to dissuade him.\"\nMichael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Monday, Aug. 21, 2017.
