Bilateral relations remain strained due to the shared past in which Japan colonised South Korea from 1910-1945.\n“The sight of two of you embracing each other after the race and congratulating each other was really wonderful,” Abe told her on Monday during a phone call to congratulate Kodaira on her first Olympic win.\nJapanese viewers tweeted that the scene brought them to tears, while Quote: : “The scene of the two embracing is something all humanity has been waiting for.”\nNewspaper headlines in Japan also lauded the gesture, saying “Embrace for Rival Lee” and commenting on their bond.\nIn South Korea, photos of the two were prominently carried in major newspapers with headlines such as “A borderless friendship” and “Lee’s tears and Kodaira’s consolation -- The rivals’ beautiful finale.”\nSpeed Skating - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's 500m competition finals - Gangneung Oval - Gangneung, South Korea - February 18, 2018 - Nao Kodaira of Japan and Lee Sang-Hwa of South Korea celebrate.

She’s my friend,” Kodaira said.\nLee, for her turn, spoke of the two visiting each other’s homeland and how Kodaira would send her “lots of Japanese food” because she likes it.\n“One time we were at the World Cup and waiting for the bus and were taking a picture together,” Lee told reporters. “Nao said, ‘Next Olympics you can win and I’ll take second place’. I told her: ‘No, you can take first place and I’ll take second place’.”\n“We’ve shared a lot of good memories together.”\nReporting by Soyoung Kim and Simon Jennings in GANGNEUNG, South Korea and Kiyoshi Takenaka in TOKYO, Writing by Elaine Lies; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:25:05.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
