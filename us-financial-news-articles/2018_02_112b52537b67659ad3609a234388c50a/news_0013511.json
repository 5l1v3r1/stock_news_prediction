Across the three academies, reports of sexual assault increased 30 percent in the past school year.\nThe report also said that late in the academic year, the military found significant evidence of mismanagement and unprofessionalism at the sexual assault prevention office at the Air Force Academy.\nReporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T02:51:47.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
