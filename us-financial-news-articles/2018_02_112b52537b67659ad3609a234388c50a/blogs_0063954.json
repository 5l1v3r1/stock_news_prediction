The paycheck includes multi-year variable compensation and compares with a 15.6 million euro payout a year earlier. Carmaker Daimler’s Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche by comparison took home 13 million euros for 2017, likely making him the second-best paid German blue-chip manager. Many German companies have not yet published their compensation reports.
