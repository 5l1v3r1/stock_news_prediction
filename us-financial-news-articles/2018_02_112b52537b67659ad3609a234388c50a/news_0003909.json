Point guard Jevon Carter dished out 11 assists to mitigate his own 2-of-8 shooting.\nDean Wade scored 17 points for Kansas State (16-7, 5-5), which shot only 29.8 percent. Xavier Sneed added 16 points, while making 5 of 10 from 3.\nBarry Brown, the Big 12’s second-leashing scorer at 17 points per game, endured a frustrating day. The Wildcats guard scored his only point on a second-half free throw and struggled to find shots in a 0-of-3 performance.\nBrown had suffered a career-worst seven turnovers when the teams met on New Year’s Day in Manhattan and committed six more in this contest. Whistled for a second-half technical after committing a pushoff foul, he went to the bench and punched a Gatorade cooler.\nKonate grabbed nine rebounds as West Virginia won for the fourth consecutive time in the series.\nWildcats guard Kamau Stokes had two points and four assists in his return from a seven-game absence with a foot injury.\nDespite coach Bob Huggins’ concerns over flu sweeping through his team this week, every West Virginia player dressed and 12 saw action.\nAfter starting 8-of-11 from the floor, K-State missed nine straight shots before Levi Stockard’s putback cut West Virginia’s halftime lead to 39-30.\nThe Wildcats didn’t have much chance of rallying when they shot 22 percent in the second half.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:40:26.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
