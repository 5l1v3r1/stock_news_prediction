REUTERS/Costas Baltas \n“But I just feel it’s time to explore the world in a different way now,” he said. \nIn Phantom Thread, which if he stays true to his word will be his swan song, Day-Lewis plays a self-centred fashion designer whose world is turned upside down when his muse falls in love with him. He studied with designers for months to immerse himself into the character.

The role earned Oldman the award for best actor at the Golden Globes. \nDoes thinking about winning take up much of Day-Lewis’ time? “Take a guess,” he quipped. \n“I‘m perfectly happy to do the rounds and applaud Gary at every event I go to,” he said. “Gary has done very fine work for many years and he’s been recognised for it now so I‘m delighted for it. I don’t have to worry about it now just sit back and relax.” Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:03:26.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
