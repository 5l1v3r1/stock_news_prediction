The Japanese yen weakened 0.30 percent versus the greenback at 109.53 per dollar.\nGerman 10-year bond yields hit two-year highs as yields firmed across the euro zone after Federal Reserve policy-makers on Wednesday flagged a potential uptick in inflation.\nGermany’s 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, hit a two-year high of 0.738 percent..\nU.S. Treasury yields climbed further as a private report on domestic factory activity in January showed prices manufacturers paid rose to their highest level in nearly seven years, suggesting inflation is gaining traction.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.7482 percent, up from 2.72 percent late on Wednesday.\nOil rose after a survey showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ commitment to its supply cuts remains in place, even as U.S. production topped 10 million barrels per day for the first time since 1970.\nU.S. crude rose 0.9 percent to $65.31 per barrel and Brent was last at $69.15, up 0.38 percent on the day.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:23:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
