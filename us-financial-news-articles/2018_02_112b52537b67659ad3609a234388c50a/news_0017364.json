The last such parade in Washington was held in 1991 to celebrate the end of a U.S. Gulf War victory under Republican President George H.W. Bush. \nMayors are not alone in resisting Trump’s idea: A poll of recent war veterans by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America showed 57 percent of 4,615 respondents strongly opposed, with 15 percent strongly supporting. Half that group’s members voted for Trump, according to a member survey. \nThey worry about the military being used as a tool for political gain, said Paul Rieckhoff, an Iraq War veteran and founder of the group. \n“It doesn’t seem like they would support the idea anywhere, but it would definitely feel less political if it were outside of D.C.,” Rieckhoff said. \nHe added that there were nonpolitical reasons to oppose the idea: “The logistics of running an M1 Abrams tank down Pennsylvania Avenue are tricky. You’ll want to have a paving machine behind it because the street’s going to be destroyed.” Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Additional reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin, TexasEditing by Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T20:17:06.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
