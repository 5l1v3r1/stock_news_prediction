Smaller STX France is the only one big enough in France to build aircraft carriers and other large warships.\nIndustry Minister Carlo Calenda said on Thursday that Italian Leonardo, which supplies land and naval defence electronics and is one of the world’s 10 biggest players in the defence industry, would be part of the talks.\nState-controlled Fincantieri made a bid for STX France, which specialises in building cruise ships, after the demise of South Korea’s STX shipbuilding group.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the French state will hold 34.34 percent of STX, Naval Group 10 percent, STX employees up to 2.4 percent and local suppliers up to 3.26 percent.\nIn order for Fincantieri to take effective control, the French state will lend the group a 1 percent stake. Fincantieri will nominate four members of STX’s eight person board.\nReporting by Giulia Segreti; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-03T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:21:59.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
