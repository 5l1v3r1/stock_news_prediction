It also saw nonferrous metals output surge 32.2 percent year-on-year, according to official data.\nEnvironmental group Greenpeace said the increase in emissions in both the Yangtze and Pearl river deltas was caused by a rebound in polluting industries beginning in 2016. But it also suggested that unfavorable weather conditions were partially to blame, with the wind that helped cut smog in northern regions responsible for delivering pollution to the eastern coast.\nLiu said at the Tuesday briefing that favourable weather was responsible for 30 percent of the improvements in air quality in northern China, but it was \"irresponsible\" to blame smog on wind â€” or on other regions.\n\"The (local) government should do its own job well and not focus on blaming other people,\" he said. \"Otherwise they will miss the best chance to improve their own air quality.\"\nLiu also said China was preparing to introduce even tougher air quality targets to cover the 2018 to 2020 period, without giving specific figures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T09:22:39.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
