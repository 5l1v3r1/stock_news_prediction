The paper also says Weinstein was treated at a sex addiction clinic located roughly an hour outside of Phoenix.\nWeinstein’s run-ins with the public haven’t been especially low key, either. In November, he was photographed wearing a blond wig while dining with an acquaintance. In January, he was slapped in the face by a stranger at a restaurant that’s located in a resort that charges as much as $3,900 per night.\nThe bills are big, but Weinstein isn’t exactly destitute. He recently sold a property in the Hamptons for $10 million, and earlier this month sold two other Connecticutt holdings for $16 million.", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-harvey-weinstein-arizona-20180223-story.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T20:28:16.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
