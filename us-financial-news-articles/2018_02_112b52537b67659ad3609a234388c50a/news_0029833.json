Organisers of the exhibition match said they hoped it would follow the path of beach volleyball which has been an Olympic sport since the 1996 Summer Games. Rego was joined by volleyball players from Brazil, Serbia, China, South Korea and Austria. The first Snow Volleyball European Championships will be held in Austria in March with 24 men’s and 24 women’s teams competing.
