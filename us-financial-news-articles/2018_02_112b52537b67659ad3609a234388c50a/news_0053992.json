But she also underscored the need to find solutions quickly for the affected cities.\nGreens lawmaker Matthias Gastel said the federal government now appeared to view limited driving bans as unavoidable, but was still leaving the issue up to cities and communities.\n“It’s good to clear up the legal situation, but there’s a danger of a patchwork of widely differing regulations,” he said.\nGermany’s highest federal administrative court is due to rule on Tuesday on an appeal brought by German states against bans imposed by local courts in Stuttgart and Duesseldorf over poor air quality.\nThere has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests, meant to limit emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx), known to cause respiratory disease.\nWhile other countries are also considering restrictions on diesel cars, bans in Germany would be a new blow for the car industry, and an embarrassment for Merkel’s government, which has long backed the industry.\nGermany for many years promoted diesel to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and meet climate change goals, but the Volkswagen (VW) scandal has pushed its car-makers to step up spending on electric cars, as well as investments into making diesel engines cleaner.\nMerkel’s government has previously lobbied against bans, fearing they could anger millions of drivers and disrupt traffic.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T23:45:01.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
