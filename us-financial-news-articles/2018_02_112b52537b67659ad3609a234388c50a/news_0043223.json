In an increasingly challenging financial environment, Newport’s ability to optimize the provider revenue cycle through enrollment automation is a much-needed solution that immediately impacts the bottom line of physician practices, hospitals, and health systems.”\nSince its founding in 2009, Newport has focused on helping providers take control of their credentialing lifecycle, thereby generating more income in less time. Newport views credentialing as an integral part of the revenue cycle, as providers who are not enrolled correctly will not be paid correctly. Newport’s clients include some of the largest academic medical centers, health systems, and multi-specialty group practices in the United States.\n“We’re excited to join forces with TractManager,” said Scott Friesen, founder and CEO of Newport Credentialing Solutions. “Enrolling a provider and then maintaining that provider’s enrollment status is challenging. We developed the industry’s first cloud-based workflow, analytics, and business intelligence credentialing platform to overcome that challenge, and I can’t think of a better home for us to continue to evolve our solutions and accelerate our growth and market penetration than TractManager.”\nNewport’s customized professional and support services wrap around the proprietary software and maximize the value of the credentialing platform. Donald A. Deieso, Ph.D., Chairman of TractManager’s Board of Directors, and Operating Partner for Arsenal Capital Partners, noted that, “With the addition of Newport to the TractManager family, we continue to advance our mission of building an exceptional organization that can truly transform our healthcare system for the benefit of all.”\nAbout Newport Credentialing Solutions\nNewport Credentialing Solutions is the nation’s premier provider of cloud-based, workflow and analytics software, and cloud-enabled services dedicated to the credentialing lifecycle.
