But an ANC spokesman said they would not participate in those events due to “other pressing matters”.\nAn ANC official in the Western Cape province said the schedule changes related to the party’s push to force Zuma to stand down.\n“We all know and anticipate that they are dealing with the current issue that is facing our country,” Faiez Jacobs, the party’s provincial secretary, told eNCA television.\nRamaphosa has been lobbying for Zuma to resign and has said he hopes to conclude talks with him over a transition of power “in coming days...in the interests of the country.”\nSouth African President Jacob Zuma and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, are seen attending Cabinet Committee meetings in this government handout picture in Cape Town, South Africa, February 7, 2018. GCIS/Handout via REUTERS A spokesman for Ramaphosa, who also serves as South Africa’s deputy president, said the ANC leader no longer had any public engagements on Friday or Saturday. He said Ramaphosa had returned Gauteng province, where the ANC’s headquarters is located in the country’s commercial capital Johannesburg.\nZuma’s spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment.\nThe rand, which has tended to strengthen on signs that Zuma could step down before his second term as president ends next year, rose on Friday as investors increased bets that Ramaphosa would be able to unseat the embattled Zuma.\nRamaphosa is due to give a speech on Sunday as part of year-long celebrations to mark 100 years since the birth of liberation hero Nelson Mandela.\nZuma had been due to officiate at a diplomatic awards ceremony in Cape Town on Saturday, according to his office, but that event has been postponed.\nZuma has been South Africa’s most controversial president since the end of white-minority rule in 1994, overseeing a tumultuous nine years marked by economic decline and numerous allegations of corruption.\nReporting by Ed Stoddard in Cape Town and Alexander Winning in Johannesburg; Editing by James Macharia, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T09:24:03.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
