That means viewers will get to watch more programming during those shows. \nThe reduction in number of commercials doesn’t exactly match up to the reduction in ad time because the company is also introducing a new feature for marketers. NBCU announced a new 60-second commercial pod in the first or last break of a show that will be dedicated to up to two advertisers. The goal is to create a “stronger impact with viewers,” NBC said in a statement.\n“The industry knows that television is already the most effective advertising medium there is, but we need to make the experience better for viewers,” said Linda Yaccarino, chairman of advertising and client partnerships at NBCUniversal, in the statement. “We’re reimagining the advertising experience for consumers, marketers, and the entire industry.”\nThe company announced the changes just months ahead of the annual upfront period -- a weeklong event during which networks pitch their new and existing programming for the upcoming season to rooms full of ad buyers and marketers. \nAdvertisers continue to pay up for TV ad inventory and its broad reach, but the networks have grappled with new competition from digital media giants like Facebook and Google. Consumers are also increasingly accustomed to skipping or avoiding ads, and many are cutting the cord in favor of streaming services like Hulu, YouTube TV and Netflix, which don’t carry ads or allow consumers to opt out of seeing most commercials. \nTV networks for the last few years have been experimenting with new ad formats and reducing ad loads . Fox introduced six-second TV ads this summer. Two years ago, NBC said it would reduce ads on “Saturday Night Live” by 30% . Around that time, Time Warner Inc.’s Turner also said it would like to cut advertising by 50% in a few dramas. \nStill, the networks acknowledge they need to take further action.\nMs. Yaccarino in November hosted an event that brought together some of the biggest names in the advertising and media businesses to try to tackle the many issues plaguing the industry. Fox is hosting a similar event on Thursday. \nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T22:04:43.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
