Moon had replied, “Let’s create the environment for that to be able to happen,” according to the presidential Blue House.\nSuch a meeting, if it came about, would mark the first inter-Korea summit since 2007.\nThe two Koreas are still technically at war after the 1950-53 conflict on the Korean peninsula ended in a ceasefire and not a truce.\nThe Unification Ministry said steps regarding the improvement of ties would be led by the two Koreas, but also in cooperation with related countries and the support of the international community.\n“We will fully cooperate with international efforts regarding sanctions against North Korea based on our stance for a denuclearised Korean peninsula and a peaceful solution (to the North Korea nuclear issue),” the statement said.\n“If there is certain progress to set the conditions for denuclearisation, a full-fledged progress in inter-Korean relations will become possible,” it said, without elaborating.\nIn previous years, North and South Korea have held reunions to bring together family members who have been separated by the war.\nSeoul made a standing offer to North Korea last year regarding another such reunion, details of which have yet to be hammered out between North and South Korea.\nKim Yo Jong and her delegation spent three days dining with top government officials, including Moon, watching the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and cheering for the united women’s ice hockey team the two Koreas have fielded at this Olympics.
