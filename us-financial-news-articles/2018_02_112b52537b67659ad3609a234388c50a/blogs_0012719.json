He added the defense would come into force in 2020 and include new software, as well as what he called administrative actions. \nIn December 2015, a first-of-its-kind cyber attack cut the lights to 225,000 people in western Ukraine, with hackers also sabotaging power distribution equipment, complicating attempts to restore power. \nA year later, a cyber attack caused a power blackout in Ukraine’s capital Kiev. In June 2017 Ukrenergo appeared to be an early victim of a cyber attack that began in Ukraine and spread around the world, knocking out thousands of machines, shutting down ports, factories and offices in around 60 countries.
