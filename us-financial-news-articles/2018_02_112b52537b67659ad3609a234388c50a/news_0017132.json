Reuters had previously reported plans for the deal in December, citing a source. \nIn the filing, YPF said it was “in advanced negotiations” with a potential third partner to purchase a 24.5 percent stake in the subsidiary on similar terms to the GE deal, though it did not name the company. A YPF spokesman declined to comment on the identity of the third potential partner on Wednesday. \nReuters reported in December that YPF was in discussions with U.S. asset manager Blackstone Group LP for a stake in the unit. \nYPF launched the subsidiary in 2013 after acquiring assets from Argentina-based oil and gas company Pluspetrol, which spun off its electric generation business. At the time, the value of the spun-off assets amounted to $485 million, according to a YPF filing.
