The bank denies these allegations as it seeks funds to offset a sharp outflow in deposits caused by fears of U.S. sanctions.\nLatvian Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis speaks to Reuters during an interview in Brussels, Belgium, February 23, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman “The present target (of foreign deposits) is half,” he said. “It has to be carried out in several stages both by strengthening supervision and by setting new targets so that there are no unnecessary shocks.”\nThe bank’s troubles this week have coincided with a probe into corruption allegations against the governor of Latvia’s central bank, which the government says are unrelated to ABLV.\nKucinskis said his message to fellow EU leaders later in the day would be: ”The banking sector is stable. Everything is under control. Please don’t mix everything together.\n“We will continue fighting fiercely against any case of corruption or financial crime.”\nReporting by John O'Donnell and Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:31:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
