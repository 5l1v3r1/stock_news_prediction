That corresponded to 75 percent of profit, in line with the bank’s financial target.\nNet interest income, which includes revenue from mortgages and loans to companies, rose to 6.33 billion crowns from 6.00 billion crowns a year earlier and higher than the 6.24 billion crowns forecast.\nCommission income rose to 3.29 billion crowns from 3.06 billion crowns a year earlier, beating the 3.13 billion crowns estimated by analysts.\nLosses from loans fell to 311 million crowns from 593 million crowns a year ago, better than the 400 million crowns loss expected by analysts.\n$1= 7.9801 Swedish crowns Reporting by Johan Ahlander; editing by Niklas Pollard and Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:58:02.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
