It’s not strange that half-bad players get even worse,” one user posted.\n“I think one can demand more of all the players and coach Groenberg,” wrote another. “I feel a terrible emptiness over a loss like this. It’s a FIASCO for Swedish hockey.”\nSweden goaltender Viktor Fasth had a similarly angry reaction to the result, smashing his stick in the player’s tunnel as he left the ice.\n“It feels terrible, we created copious chances but it didn’t work,” winger Oscar Moeller told reporters before hitting back at criticism of the team.\n“Newspapers and the media can write what they like, we did our best,” he said.
