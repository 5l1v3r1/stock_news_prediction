The banks are selling stock in the company as part of the listing although they will remain majority shareholders. \nBBVA, Santander, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are acting as the joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the offer, while Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale are acting as additional joint bookrunners.
