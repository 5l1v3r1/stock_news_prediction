You could suggest he is a pay driver, I would not do such a thing,” she added.\n“The vocabulary used around pay drivers is wrong, it’s inappropriate and it’s unnecessary. it puts a negativity around a driver that we just should not be doing in this sport anymore.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:58:53.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
