I was disappointed. I believed that it must have been sugar water coming from it.” \nJoAnne Bland was eleven years old when she marched over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. in a now-famous march for voting rights that has come to be known as Bloody Sunday. She was a busy member of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, so March 7, 1965, was shaping up to be just another day in the movement. “All the kids marched. We loved it. We sang songs, we felt important.” They were also prepared. “We’d always been told if we were threatened to drop to our knees and start to pray. But that day, something went wrong.” \nI had interviewed Bland in the months after the attacks on September 11, 2001, as part of an extended road trip/ writing project about Americans and their stories. At the time, she was the lone steward of Selma’s tiny Voting Rights Museum, a small but sincere assemblage of exhibits that aimed to keep the Selma stories alive, in a world before Ava DuVernay . (Back then, some of the exhibit labels were just post-it notes. The museum seems to have grown substantially.) But sitting with her, just steps away from the famous bridge, was the first time that I fully understood how integral kids and teens have been to the success of important social movements. \nThe Washington Post’s Steven Levingston reminds us of the Children’s Crusade , a public protest against segregation held in May 1963, in Birmingham. Like the Selma march two years later, law enforcement brought the pain. “Birmingham’s brutal public safety commissioner, Eugene ‘Bull’ Connor, was waiting. His police moved in, herding the children into squad cars, paddy wagons and school buses for the trip to jail,” he writes. \nAnd then the world saw this: \nWhen the students kept coming, Connor turned fire hoses on them, knocking the children to the ground and spinning them down the street. To fight the high-powered blasts, some children joined hands trying to keep their balance in a human chain. But the torrents were too fierce; hit by the rocket-bursts of water the kids whirled one way, then the other, dragging down their comrades. \nDecades later, the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., filmed their own horrific attack at the hands of a heavily armed former student. And the Florida students are now facing down trolls on social platforms, the full court press of media attention, and unspeakable grief to deliver their own call to action. \nStoneman Douglas High student Cameron Kasky is one of the organizers of “ March For Our Lives ,” a movement for gun control that prioritizes the lives of students and teachers. (It’s one of three student-led protests planned in the wake of the Florida school shooting.) From their mission statement: “March For Our Lives is created by, inspired by, and led by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar.” One of their tactics is very specific: To stop politicians from taking money from the National Rifle Association , and to unseat any candidate who does in the upcoming mid-term elections. \nThe Florida students are showing the kind of courage that would resonate with JoAnne Bland. Students, let’s join our voices in a fight against gun violence in our schools. Students, let’s join our voices to rise above the petty politics of Congress. Students, let us join voices to tell our government to DO SOMETHING. Students, let’s march. #NeverAgain ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T23:14:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
