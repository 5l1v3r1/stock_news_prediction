We start good, we drive clean and yeah, we can go sleep good tonight I think,” the 27-year-old Friedrich told reporters.\nGermany’s Nico Walther sits in third, 0.35 seconds behind his compatriot and just 0.06 adrift of the South Koreans.\nEric Franke, a member of Walther’s team, said he thought they could still get to the top of the podium, especially if they received some help from the leaders.\nBobsleigh - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's 4-man Competition - Olympic Sliding Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 24, 2018 - Francesco Friedrich, Candy Bauer, Martin Grothkopp and Thorsten Margis of Germany react at the finish area.

I think here it can happen,” he said. “It’s all on that track. We must be good tomorrow and then we’ll see.”\nReporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly/John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T06:43:56.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
