Competitiveness was driven into me, especially by my father.”\nIt wasn’t until Graham was 12 that he made the sole commitment to skiing.\n“My dream originally as a kid was to go to the summer Olympics for sailing and then come to the winter Olympics for skiing, but I realised that was too bloody hard,” Graham said.\nThe world number three who hails from Australia’s Gold Coast just wanted to follow in the footsteps of his older sibling.\n“He chose skiing and as a younger brother you just wanted to be like your older brother,“ he said. ”He pushed me at an early age. I chased him around the mountain, trying to do what he was doing.”\nReporting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:50:28.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
