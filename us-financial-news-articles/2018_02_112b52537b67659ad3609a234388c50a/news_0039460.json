Freshman forward Luka Garza added 17 points and sophomore guard Jordan Bohannon contributed 10 points and seven assists.\nIndiana scored the winning basket with 46.6 seconds left when Green threaded a pass through traffic to senior forward Freddie McSwain Jr., who converted the layup.\nIowa had a chance to win or force overtime in the final seconds, but Bohannon was off the mark with a 3-pointer from the left corner with 3.5 seconds left and Cook badly missed the putback.\nCook helped the Hawkeyes possess a 33-19 rebounding edge but the squad also committed 17 turnovers. Indiana shot 56.1 percent from the field, including 14 of 24 from 3-point range, while the Hawkeyes shot 55.1 percent from the field and 9 of 21 from 3-point range.\nIndiana took its first lead of the game at 53-52 when Smith split two free throws with 16:19 remaining.

He added another one 21 seconds later and buried his eight of the game with 11:06 left to make it 72-59.\nIowa answered with a 14-2 run that featured two 3-pointers from Bohannon -- his first points of the game -- to get back within 74-73 with 5:23 left.\nJohnson connected on his ninth 3-pointer to give Indiana an 82-78 lead with 2:43 left.
