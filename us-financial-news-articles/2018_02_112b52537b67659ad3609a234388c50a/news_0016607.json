The Yoruba people, whose homeland is in the southwest, were mostly on the opposing side in the war. \nEnwonwu painted three versions of the portrait. The other two remain lost, although prints first made in the 1970s have been in circulation ever since and the images are familiar to many Nigerians. Enwonwu died in 1994. \nOliver Enwonwu, the artist’s son, is president of the Society of Nigerian Artists.

I’ve been in the market for 12 years and it’s as strong as I’ve ever known it,” Peppiatt told Reuters. \nOne of the challenges in organising a live auction connecting London and Lagos could be the Nigerian city’s unreliable power supplies. Despite the widespread use of back-up generators, electricity blackouts are a frequent feature of Lagos life, often affecting internet connections. \n“It’s the first time anyone has done it so that will be rather exciting,” said Peppiatt. “Assuming the IT works.” Writing by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Stephen Addison", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T16:32:39.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
