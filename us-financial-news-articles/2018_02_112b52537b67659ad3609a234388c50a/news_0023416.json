KCNA/via REUTERS The two-stage, liquid-fuel Hwasong-15 made its parade debut, with four of the large missiles carried on nine-axle transporter-erector-launchers (TELs). The ICBM was successfully tested last November and analysts believe it to be capable of reaching the continental United States.\nThe Hwasong-14 ICBM, successfully tested twice last year, also made its first appearance at the parade.\nThe event unveiled a new short-range missile, which is based on the Russian Iskander ballistic missile but also shares many features of South Korea’s Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missile, according to Michael Elleman, a missile expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\nNorth Korea’s latest display of its military hardware focused on missiles and less on tanks and artillery, suggesting it was trying to project the image of a country with advanced capabilities in warfare.\nA Reuters analysis shows there has been a gradual decline in conventional weapons on display since 2012, Kim Jong Un’s first parade as leader, and a move to showcase more sophisticated weapons such as ballistic missiles.\nReporting by Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Lincoln Feast\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T09:34:06.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
