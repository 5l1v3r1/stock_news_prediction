Our distribution network was totally unaffected by this attack.”\nA denial of service attack occurs when hackers flood a target with incoming messages, overwhelming its systems and making it difficult or impossible for legitimate customers to do business.\nHershberg estimated that a majority of Fortune 500 companies use Business Wire, citing an internal analysis.\nHe said Business Wire hopes to resolve the security issues in the “near future,” with help from outside firms it has hired. Hershberg said he was unaware of involvement by law enforcement.\nBerkshire did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment. It bought Business Wire, which is based in New York and San Francisco, in 2006.\nThe attack is not the first time that Business Wire has been targeted by hackers.\nIn 2015, U.S. authorities brought criminal or civil charges against more than 40 defendants over the theft of roughly 150,000 news releases from Business Wire and rivals Marketwire and PR Newswire in a 5-1/2-year period.\nAuthorities said traders would give hackers “shopping lists” of releases they wanted, and generated more than $100 million of illegal profit through insider trading on nonpublic information contained in the releases.\nAt least five criminal defendants have pleaded guilty in that case.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; editing by Anil D'Silva\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:11:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
