But even if the experimental drug lives up to the claim, it likely won’t be available in the U.S. until next year at the earliest. \nA late-stage trial on Japanese and American flu patients found that for the people who took the Shionogi & Co. 4507, -3.04% compound, the median time taken to wipe out the virus was 24 hours. That is much quicker than any other flu drug on the market, including Roche AG’s RHHBY, -0.07% Tamiflu, which the trial showed took three times longer to achieve the same result. Quickly killing the virus could reduce its contagious effects, Shionogi said. \nAlso, Shionogi’s experimental drug requires only a single dose, while patients need to take two doses of Tamiflu a day, for five days. \nBoth Shionogi’s compound and Tamiflu take roughly the same amount of time to entirely contain flu symptoms, but Shionogi says its compound provides immediate relief faster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T08:14:18.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
