His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The charge of wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years.\nProsecutors said Desper, using the alias “Mordokwan,” from November 2016 to January 2017 offered the paintings for sale to foreign buyers using Craigslist and directed those interested to use encrypted email accounts to communicate with him.\nFILE PHOTO: United States Attorney Carmen Ortiz speaks during a press conference at the FBI's Boston Field Office held to appeal to the public for help in returning artwork stolen in 1990 from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., March 18, 2013. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi/File Photo The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the museum received tips about the paintings from people interested in helping recover the artwork and who were seeking a multi-million dollar award the museum was offering, prosecutors said.\nAt the direction of law enforcement, the museum’s security director engaged in communications with Desper, who told him to send a cashier’s check for $5 million to a location in West Virginia, prosecutors said.\nBut they said Desper, in fact, did not have the paintings and was instead engaged in a fraudulent scheme targeting foreign art buyers. Authorities arrested Desper on May 22, 2017, at his home in Beckley, West Virginia.\nThe Gardner heist was carried out by two men dressed in police uniforms who apparently overpowered a night security guard who had buzzed them in. The combined value of the 13 works of art is estimated at $500 million.\nDue to a quirk in Gardner’s will, the empty frames that held the paintings remain on the walls of the museum she built to house the collection she amassed with her husband.\nThe art must be displayed the way it was during her lifetime, preventing curators from hanging new works, and leaving a constant reminder of the theft.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T02:07:26.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
