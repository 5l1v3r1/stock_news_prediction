It said investors had injected $16.5 billion into emerging debt markets and $13.5 billion into emerging equities, the latter an 18-month high. \n“Strong demand for U.S. dollar-funded carry trades, still attractive EM valuations and still-abundant global liquidity have been supportive for EM portfolio flows, though market turbulence late in the month prompted some pullback,” the IIF, one of the more authoritative trackers of global capital flows, said. \nEmerging Asia attracted $19.9 billion and Latin America $7.3 billion.
