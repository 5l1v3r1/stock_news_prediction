The bank will improve its operational infrastructure by leveraging the blockchain technology on offer.\nA Bank with History and Infrastructure\nPacific Private Bank was founded in 1997 and has over 21 years of experience , specializing in asset and wealth management services for private clients. Hard work and a favorable geographical, economical, tax and legal environment built the core foundation of this successful enterprise.\nThroughout the years, the Pacific Private Bank has developed an advanced IT infrastructure to support complex banking operations as well as a solid client base. The bank is also notable for its manpower, which represents some of the brightest minds in the banking and finance sector.\nPacific Private Bank and Bankera teams will focus on different goals: the bank will continue working with fiat-based banking solutions and Bankera will keep its focus on providing both crypto and fiat services around the globe. Current bank managers Mantas Staliūnas and Algirdas Purkėnas will continue to work as Managing Director and Treasurer, respectively, while Audrius Žiugžda and Martin St-Hilaire will continue as the bank's Directors.\nAs members of Bankera's advisory board, they will also share their expertise and insights with Bankera's team. Žiugžda and St-Hilaire have been publicly acknowledged for their extensive knowledge and professional insights in the M&A sector, banking operations, also international experience in fields of auditing, accounting, banking, taxes, and risk management.\nBankera: A Building Block\nBankera is building a fully digital bank, without costly bricks and mortar branches which will eventually become a one-stop store for all financial services. As an operational fork of SpectroCoin, an all in one solution for cryptocurrencies, with over 740,000 clients and 5 years in cryptocurrency markets, Bankera are poised to innovate and provide a crucial stepping stone to worldwide adoption of the Crypto sphere.\nBankera's team will empower the Pacific Private Bank with bank-level blockchain technology. In order to do so, one of the first steps to be done is to connect the Pacific Private Bank to the Ripple network. This move, which aims to facilitate cross-border transactions, has already attracted interest from leading global banks such as Santander, UniCredit, UBS and Standard Chartered . Also, blockchain-based identity management and KYC (Know Your Client) solutions will be implemented at the Pacific Private bank to improve client onboarding and make efforts toward a more secure, regulated market.\nAn ICO that Stands Out\nOn November 27th Bankera launched an ICO sale which has attracted over 65,000 contributors , making it the biggest ICO by contributor number so far. This is not the only record Bankera has under its belt – during its pre-ICO alone, Bankera collected over 25 million Euros , making it one of the biggest publicly open pre-ICOs in the world. Thus far, the company has already raised 80 million euros and is determined to meet the hard cap of 177 million euros.\nBankera's ICO is taking place on the SpectroCoin platform where ICO contributors can choose from more than 20 payment methods when purchasing their BNK tokens. These include a variety of cryptocurrencies, such as ETH, BTC, DASH, XEM and others.\nTo learn more or participate in the ICO, visit the Website: https://bankera.com\nChat with us: https://chat.bankera.com/channel/community\nRead the Whitepaper: https://bankera.com/papers/Bankera_whitepaper.pdf\nBitcoinTalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2091093.0\nMedia Contact\nContact Name: Ruta\nContact Email: r.cizinauskaite@bankera.com\nBankera is the source of this content.
