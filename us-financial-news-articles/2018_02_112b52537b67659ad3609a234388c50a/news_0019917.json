But so far nothing of a grand nature has been obtained,” Thomas said.\nHe said the militants could be intentionally providing incorrect information or were not up to date on the latest information, so a thorough analysis was underway.\nA U.S.-led coalition has pushed Islamic State out of most of the territory it controlled in Iraq and Syria but its leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, who proclaimed the self-styled caliphate in 2014, remains at large.\nThe U.S. State Department sanctioned Kotey in January 2017, saying he was a guard for the “Beatles” and “likely engaged in the group’s executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods, including electronic shock and waterboarding.”\nKotey had also acted as a recruiter and was responsible for recruiting several British nationals to join the militant group, the State Department said.\nThe State Department sanctioned Elsheikh in March 2017, saying he was “said to have earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions while serving as an ISIS jailer.”\nThe most notorious of the four was Mohammed Emwazi, known as “Jihadi John,” an executioner of hostages made famous by Islamic State videos of beheadings.\nA U.S.-British missile strike believed to have killed Emwazi, a British citizen of Arab origin, was months in preparation but came together at lightning speed in 2015 in the Syrian town of Raqqa, according to U.S. officials.\nEmwazi became the public face of Islamic State and a symbol of its brutality after appearing in videos showing the murders of U.S. journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley, U.S. aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, Japanese journalist Kenji Goto and other hostages.\nReporting by Mark Hosenball and Idrees Ali.; Writing by Yara Bayoumy; Editing by Mary Milliken, James Dalgleish and Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T03:19:16.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
