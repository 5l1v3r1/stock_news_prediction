Through the integration of the three organizations, StarterStudio (a 501c3) will serve as a community resource empowering and propelling innovative tech-enabled entrepreneurs, creatives and visionaries through growth and expansion in Florida and beyond.\nStarterStudio brings together proven programs to support the Florida tech community and is among the few nonprofit, end-to-end ecosystems for startup ventures. StarterStudio provides early-stage business strategies and tactics, community entrepreneurial education, engaging lunch-and-learn sessions, workshops, meetups, founder talks and startup classes. StarterStudio gives innovators access to effective tools and resources with the convergence of these three organizations, including two business accelerators, three collaborative working spaces, educational programming, and startup funding.\n“Our goal in reimagining the new StarterStudio was to strengthen Central Florida’s support for entrepreneurs and make it easier for innovators in Central Florida to start a new business,” said Thad Seymour, chairman of the board of StarterStudio.\nSeymour, who also serves as the vice provost for the new downtown campus that the University of Central Florida will share with Valencia College , says that the future of the region depends on expanding the education pipeline and the number of promising new tech-enabled businesses, building a thriving innovation district where entrepreneurs can succeed.\n“Integrating Canvs, Starter Studio and FireSpring Fund under a single organization allows us to streamline and enhance our operational efficiency, as well as the management and nonprofit governance required to deliver exceptional resources to entrepreneurs,” said Donna Mackenzie, executive director of StarterStudio. “As a nonprofit, the support of committed sponsors and partners like Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s recent involvement and investment, have allowed us to expand our reach within Central Florida as we build strong momentum and engage with visionaries and startups across the state.”\nIn the next few weeks, StarterStudio will launch its new online home at starterstudio.org . In the meantime, information is available about all offerings at the existing websites: canvs.org , firespringfund.org , and starterstudio.com . The three Canvs collaborative working spaces, located in Downtown Orlando, Parramore and Winter Park, will still exist and be assimilated under the umbrella of the new brand name, StarterStudio.\nAbout StarterStudio\nStarterStudio is a nonprofit (501c3) organization serving startups in Florida by providing places, programs, and funding to help tech-enabled and innovative entrepreneurs to grow and flourish. In February 2018, StarterStudio became the organizational name for a family of entrepreneur resources already established in Central Florida, including the collaborative working spaces Canvs , the accelerator program Starter Studio , and the advanced accelerator and nonprofit FireSpring Fund . Each of the organizations was created by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs to fill a need in the local community. Today, under a unified leadership team and board, StarterStudio continues its mission to help entrepreneurs to start here, stay here, and grow here.\nMedia Contact:\nUproar PR for StarterStudio\nPaige Wagner\nPwagner@uproarpr.com\n321.236.0102 x230\nSource: StarterStudio", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=COdL1oQW4ZF7OUcO4jGjc0lITrGC0viyHUkZnDVHIABElouPVdeoGVDKADh1jxTmRXcTrquIDUQskhKAZN0_I5Nd-3vHMFSMegfFiWFmrn7BovKSnWtzI9rKXy6dl3Vh4o-pVUTMOOMqx58I1hEOoE1_Ne1dy_nH8SExfY-xZCo=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BgyDyqa06sBrtV-nSKppcV8M3I-5c50FsPbQ86dRepjRsZ_wRZFp_qS9I5YqEidRYB99Tg8ehG3HVJaLer8yWw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=v0RYfnbMs7AmcazYm4pHHZOUeDyk9eSwIrSslz2oT6oLM2rFmRrOe8ATd1m_q9s_z5HsKT5mUwVoMPBzr-JZtKFC_EtH5_3GTNHxHOqR9nQ=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kMOP0A41_SK0BhechqvIHqciqutHO-ZLq5aUXz9pNRJgm71pjMaYLqt9EWGudsc0QeKspJV27itss4jjTUWGgQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BgyDyqa06sBrtV-nSKppcSwwCd-9WnBehnWNfKCzCqbhlxHa42ROurGMNLRNyUttVzbKa1pLrDqjgXW3F9BaGA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8hGLY7mCnqNkI-a4CHH9QCGveBDplkFKHZ60bU3gEtbnI_6xtc6Da0qFSGK0d0zQ", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ncxt1qPBZhfkXyR4iiLeaji5kD32eSHZGEpNJCFSZEI7mikaHu4NR5-Bv5OhPwNCL0Q41gBFKgLEJFedZ1oHDnu_QF1cjDH_YzvqACZT0XA=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uPEvNkfL0PX0i7i_Bx4wovAN-3XkcGkevWFH0spcM2as3ixVMIFDGh4cFvQMO3XK32ByNlP5phX5pCqke_eqkA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/94126dc8-12f0-448a-a0c8-4ced1e776fae", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=p5FPtFcmiN-t1TwfOHCq3GcFzh6iwwS0bm9HNG4GCgJVYrVcopRvll_5fI0sSqn4L7TrR5EkY9ErsM8UQVhsPr_H5twrJNpmWeqnLtebrSU=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kMOP0A41_SK0BhechqvIHoV4hUMrhk74xKzbqTELTKeN87LugTUtgTzrlbnoKQtWxAgdenzBW9FYwvGjkmmkzg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uPEvNkfL0PX0i7i_Bx4wou5_WYbK7yNvhZv4cqG7N9bsKByM5lZTCpoEMKv51jsIejLczzT6EoIIlj-YdIh9Sg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3EtTwv64j5neTxVCs5OSu4Gh8VL4NOYSvfx5udGl_6J-GgyYEYvPKGorYSJ-xcnIaEi3nrkrhT8izS040Bqy-g==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8hGLY7mCnqNkI-a4CHH9QK-uG2Vc-u_fsyzqGLTNbb2hjljQJ7DER9YcE3OiLYeW"], "published": "2018-02-22T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:08:56.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
