His ultimate goal, though, will be a place at Euro 2020. \nKoeman, who won 78 caps for the Netherlands, brings a wealth of experience to the job, having coached club sides Vitesse Arnhem, Ajax Amsterdam, Benfica, PSV Eindhoven, Valencia, AZ Alkmaar, Feyenoord, Southampton and Everton. \nDutch media said Everton goalkeeping coach Patrick Lodewijks and former Dutch international Kees van Wonderen would be Koeman’s assistants, leaving no place for Ruud Gullit who had served as assistant to Advocaat.
