Aldi’s sales increased by 16.2 percent and Lidl’s by 16.3 percent, boosting their respective market shares to 6.9 percent and 5 percent. \nTesco has tightened its hold on the nation’s food market after the competition regulator last month cleared its 3.7 billion pound ($4.95 billion) takeover of wholesaler Booker. \nFollowing an accounting scandal in 2014, Chief Executive Dave Lewis’s strategy to rebuild the supermarket group has been based on increasing food sales.
