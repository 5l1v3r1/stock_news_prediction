In addition, a federal population-based, per-state annual cap on the issuance of certain types of PABs would be lifted.\nSandy MacLennan, president of the National Association of Bond Lawyers, said while the proposal appears to look good for the U.S. municipal bond market, public-private and local financings may be restricted under state laws.\n“Further, while the financing options may be welcomed, the total proposed dollar investment seems small in comparison to reported needs,” MacLennan said in a statement.\nReporting By Karen Pierog; Editing by Daniel Bases and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T07:49:39.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
