The latest seven-year issue was sold at a yield of 2.839 percent, which was the highest yield in almost seven years, Treasury data showed.\nThere will be a pullback in supply next week. The government will auction $51 billion of three-month bills, $45 billion in six-month bills and $22 billion in one-year bills.\nThe Treasury is scheduled to announce the size of the one-month bill auction on Monday.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:51:09.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
