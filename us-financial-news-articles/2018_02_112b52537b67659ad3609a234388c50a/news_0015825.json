Oil output, however, came in slightly below analysts’ mean estimate.\n“The numbers were good. In Total’s case, they’ve got enough cash to increase capex and do a share buyback, so it all looks reasonably positive,” said Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu, who owns Total shares.\nPouyanne said Total planned some $2 billion of acquisitions in 2018, and the company would return to normal staff hiring patterns after a three-year freeze.\nIt will maintain its cost-cutting strategy with a target of $4 billion in savings in 2018, and production costs of $5.5 per barrel of oil equivalent for the year. Investments are seen at around $14 billion, in line with the target of $13-15 billion.\nTotal’s “cost reduction plans have paid off and will continue in 2018 at a sustained pace”, Gregoire Laverne of Roche-Brune asset management said.\n“Total is sending a good signal in terms of the financial recovery of the sector, but it will have to be vigilant on the rate of the decline of investments, almost down by 20 percent compared with 2016,” Laverne said.\n“Less investment could mean fewer opportunities for value creation for years to come,” he added.\nRival BP ( BP.L ) said this week its 2017 profit more than doubled to $6.2 billion on the back of higher oil prices and output, allowing the British firm to resume share buybacks, as it too recovers from a three-year oil downturn.\nHowever, U.S. groups Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) and Chevron ( CVX.N ) posted rare quarterly earnings misses this month, hit by weakness in international refining operations.\nTotal’s market value of around 115 billion euros ($140.7 billion) puts it roughly on a par with BP, but below Exxon, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ), Thomson Reuters data shows.\n($1 = 0.8171 euros)\nReporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Dale Hudson, Sudip Kar-Gupta and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T11:01:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
