It remained above the decade low of 40 basis points reached on Feb. 1, Tradeweb data showed.\nSome analysts have been concerned the yield curve may eventually invert where shorter-dated yields are higher than longer-dated ones, which has often preceded previous U.S. recessions.\nIn his House testimony, Powell, when asked, downplayed concerns about a curve inversion.\nOn the data front, domestic durable goods orders fell 3.7 percent in January, more than what analysts had forecast.\nOn the other hand, the Conference Board’s gauge on U.S. consumer confidence rose more than expected in February to its strongest level since Nov. 2000.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:03:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
