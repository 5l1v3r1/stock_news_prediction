Revenues increased 2% when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues increased 7% to $2.9 billion in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. International revenues increased 1%. When adjusted for foreign exchange impact, international revenues decreased 3%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased from 73.6% to 69.3% in the quarter primarily due to product mix. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 11% to $1.3 billion in the quarter. Research and development expenses increased 37% to $1.9 billion in the quarter primarily due to license and asset acquisition charges of $377 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate increased to 434% in the quarter from 17% in the fourth quarter last year primarily due to a one-time $2.9 billion charge resulting from U.S. tax reform. The company reported net loss attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb of $2.3 billion, or $1.42 per share, in the fourth quarter compared to net earnings of $894 million, or $0.53 per share, for the same period in 2016. The results in the current quarter include the significant transitional impact from U.S. tax reform. The company reported non-GAAP net earnings attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb of $1.1 billion, or $0.68 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to $1.1 billion, or $0.63 per share, for the same period in 2016.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $9.3 billion, with a net cash position of $1.3 billion, as of December 31, 2017.\nFOURTH QUARTER PRODUCT AND PIPELINE UPDATE\nProduct Sales/Business Highlights\nThe increase in global revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, was driven by:\nProduct\nGrowth %\nEliquis 44% Opdivo\n4% Orencia 6% Sprycel\n7% Yervoy\n2% Opdivo\nRegulatory\nIn December, the company announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted its supplemental Biologics License Application for priority review of Opdivo plus Yervoy to treat intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The application has an action date of April 16, 2018. In December, the company announced the FDA approved Opdivo injection for intravenous use for the adjuvant treatment of patients with melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection. In November, the company announced the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated its type II variation application, which seeks to expand the current indications for Opdivo plus Yervoy to include the treatment of intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced RCC. In October, the company announced the EMA validated its type II variation application, which seeks to expand the current indications for Opdivo to include the treatment of patients with melanoma who are at high risk of disease recurrence following complete surgical resection. Validation of the application confirms the submission is complete and begins the EMA’s centralized review process.\nClinical\nIn February, the company announced that the pivotal Phase 3 Checkmate -227 study demonstrated superior progression-free survival with the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy versus chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with high tumor mutation burden, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The company also announced that the trial will continue as planned to assess the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination for the co-primary endpoint of overall survival in patients who express PD-L1. ( link ) In January, the company announced new data from a cohort of the Phase 2 CheckMate -142 trial evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy for the treatment of patients with DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). ( link ) In December, at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, the company and Seattle Genetics announced updated data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating Adcetris ® (brentuximab vedotin) in combination with Opdivo in relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma. ( link ) In December, the FDA lifted partial clinical holds placed on CA209 -039 and CA204142, the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials investigating Opdivo-based combinations in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, respectively. In November, the Phase 3 study CheckMate -078, evaluating Opdivo versus docetaxel in previously treated advanced or metastatic NSCLC, was stopped early because the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival (OS) in patients receiving Opdivo compared with the control arm. CheckMate -078 is a multinational Phase 3 study with predominantly Chinese patients. ( link ) In November, at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting, the company announced results from CheckMate -214, a Phase 3 trial evaluating the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC, as well as results from an exploratory analysis of PD-L1 expression across subgroups. ( link ) In November, at the International Kidney Cancer Symposium, the company announced a three-year OS update from its Phase 3 CheckMate -025 study, evaluating patients treated with Opdivo versus everolimus in previously treated advanced RCC. ( link )\nSprycel\nRegulatory\nIn November, the company announced the FDA has expanded the indication for Sprycel tablets to include the treatment of children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase.\nClinical\nIn December, at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, the company announced data from the Phase 2 CA180-372 study in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with Sprycel added to a chemotherapy regimen modelled on a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster high-risk backbone. ( link )\nYervoy\nRegulatory\nIn January, the company announced that the European Commission expanded the indication of Yervoy to include treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.\nInvestigational Compound Highlights\nOncology\nIn November, at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting, the company announced results from studies evaluating BMS-986205, an investigational IDO1 inhibitor, and cabiralizumab (FPA008), an investigational anti-CSF-1 receptor antibody, in combination with Opdivo. CA017-003: Data from a Phase 1/2a dose escalation and expansion study of BMS-986205 in combination with Opdivo in heavily pre-treated bladder and cervical cancer patients. ( link ) NCT02526017: Results from a Phase 1a/1b dose escalation and expansion study with Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cabiralizumab in combination with Opdivo in patients with advanced solid tumors. ( link )\nFOURTH QUARTER BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT UPDATE\nIn December, the company and TARIS Biomedical LLC announced that the companies entered into a clinical trial collaboration to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of TARIS’ investigational product, TAR-200 (GemRIS™), in combination with Opdivo in patients with Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer who are scheduled for radical cystectomy. In December, the company and Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. announced an agreement that grants Bristol-Myers Squibb an exclusive license for the development and commercialization of ONO-4578, Ono’s selective Prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 antagonist.\nAdcetris ® is a trademark of Seattle Genetics, Inc.\nGemRIS™ is a trademark of TARIS Biomedical LLC.\n2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nBristol-Myers Squibb is setting its 2018 GAAP EPS guidance range at $3.00 to $3.15 and non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $3.15 to $3.30. Key 2018 GAAP and non-GAAP guidance assumptions include:\nWorldwide revenues increasing in the low- to mid-single digits. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 70% for both GAAP and non-GAAP. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreasing in the low- to mid-single digit range for both GAAP and non-GAAP. Research and development expenses decreasing in the low-double digits for GAAP and increasing in the high-single digits for non-GAAP. An effective tax rate between 20% to 21% for both GAAP and non-GAAP.\nThe financial guidance for 2018 excludes the impact of any potential future strategic acquisitions and divestitures, and any specified items that have not yet been identified and quantified. The non-GAAP 2018 guidance also excludes other specified items as discussed under “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.” Details reconciling adjusted non-GAAP amounts with the amounts reflecting specified items are provided in supplemental materials available on the company’s website.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, that are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project,unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, R&D charges in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third party intellectual property rights, divestiture gains or losses, upfront payments from out-licensed assets, pension charges, legal and other contractual settlements and debt redemption gains or losses, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility, jurisdictional tax rates and the transitional impact of U.S. tax reform. Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nStatement on Cautionary Factors\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding, among other things, statements relating to goals, plans and projections regarding the company’s current and future financial position, results of operations, market position, product development and business strategy.
