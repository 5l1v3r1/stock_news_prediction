He is also serving a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions.\nThe senators’ announcement comes two days before the House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to receive written explanations of the handling of sexual misconduct cases by USA Gymnastics (USAG) and other governing bodies of organized sports.\n“There’s now significant bipartisan support for establishing a special committee charged with the sole focus of investigating the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics,” said Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who announced the resolution with Republican Senator Joni Ernst as co-sponsor.\nVictims and their advocates have criticized the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) and USAG for not acting on the complaints against Nassar, including a 2015 investigation. USAG’s board resigned under pressure from the USOC.\n“There are many disturbing questions that remain unanswered as to how Larry Nassar was able to freely abuse young girls for decades,” Shaheen told reporters.\nSix Republicans and 12 Democrats have also signed onto the resolution to investigate the USOC, which operates under a federal charter. The Senate must vote on the resolution before a committee can be formed to hold an investigation.\nWhile the House investigation is focused on sexual abuse in organized sport, the Senate investigation will look into the extent USAG and U.S. Olympics were complicit in the criminal or negligent behavior of their employees relative to sexual abuse.\nA spokesman for Senator John Thune, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee that has been investigating Olympic sex abuse claims, said a select committee was unnecessary.\nThe initial results from the House investigation are scheduled to be delivered on Friday.\nReporting by Katanga Johnson and David Shepardson; Editing by Ben Klayman and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:59:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
