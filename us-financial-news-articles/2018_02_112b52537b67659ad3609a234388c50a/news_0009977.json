North America accounts for around 16 percent of Mitsubishi’s sales, whereas Suzuki no longer sells vehicles in the United States, the world’s second-largest auto market. That compares with 30 to 40 percent of sales at Toyota, Nissan and Honda. \nLast week, Honda raised its full-year operating profit forecast, but the upgrade still represents a 7.8 percent slide from a year prior. While the automaker is seeing explosive growth in China, it has been saddled by stagnant sales in the United States. \nToyota, which reports earnings on Tuesday, has said it expects annual profit to be largely flat compared with a year earlier, whereas Nissan - which owns 34 percent of Mitsubishi - has forecast a 13 percent decline.
