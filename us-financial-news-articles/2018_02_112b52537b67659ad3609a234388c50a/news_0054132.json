We remain committed to our gender target and closing the pay gap,” a spokeswoman for the bank said. \nRoyal Bank of Scotland on Friday disclosed a gender pay gap of 37 percent. Barclays ( BARC.L ) this week disclosed a gap in its investment bank of 50 percent, drawing criticism from lawmakers. \nReporting by Lawrence White; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:24:26.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
