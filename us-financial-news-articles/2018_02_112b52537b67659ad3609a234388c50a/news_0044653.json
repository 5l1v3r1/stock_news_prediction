The Netherlands became Germany’s second-biggest trading partner.\nFrance’s bilateral trade with Germany totaled 169.4 billion euros last year, but it remained the second-most important export destination for German goods with purchases of 105.2 billion euros, the data showed.\nChina was the third biggest market with 86.2 billion euros.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T18:56:47.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
