[ECILT/IN] \nBut strong global growth is tipped to keep foreign demand intact, a factor duly reflected in the PMI survey which showed new export orders rose at their fastest pace in almost 1-1/2 years. \nWhile firms continued to absorb the increase in cost pressures, they did pass on some of that to consumers in January, suggesting a recent trend of inflation above the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) medium-term target of 4 percent could be here to stay. \nRetail inflation rose to a 17-month high of 5.21 percent in December, the latest official reading showed, possibly pressuring the central bank to tighten monetary policy. \nThe RBI is scheduled to meet for the first time in 2018 on February 6-7, which will come after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presents his annual budget due later on Thursday.
