It had been estimated to sell for $150,000 to $250,000, Christie's said Wednesday.\nIt is rare for several reasons. Only about 2 percent of all meteorites are made largely of iron. Further, very few of those are regarded as aesthetically impressive enough to be considered natural sculpture, Pitt said.\n\"Think of it as the quintessential American meteorite,\" Pitt told CNBC. \"This one was really unusual. Most of them are highly angular, but this one has a gently curved surface that is evocative of a sculpture by Henry Moore.\"\nOn display at the auction was a specimen that resulted from the fireball seen over Michigan in January . That meteorite will be auctioned off at another Christie's auction, based out of London April 10-17.\nThe market in meteorites is young but is growing fast, Pitt said.\nFor example, 82 percent of the auction's 44 lots sold and more than a dozen sold for more than their high estimate.\nTen years ago, the same Canyon Diablo iron meteorite would have sold for one-tenth of the price it sold for on Wednesday, Pitt said.\n\"A few years from now, it's going to be worth twice as much,\" he said.\nCORRECTION: Ten years ago, the same Canyon Diablo iron meteorite would have sold for one-tenth of the price it sold for on Wednesday, the meteorite's former owner says.
