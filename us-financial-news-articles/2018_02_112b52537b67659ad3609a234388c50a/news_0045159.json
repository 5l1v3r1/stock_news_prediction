We saw a return to positive organic growth in the Company overall. We focused on the full integration of MWH while also positioning our platform for future expansion and growth into global markets. While the full integration efforts of MWH and some legacy project issues affected our results, particularly in the fourth quarter, we are optimistic about 2018. We focus on continuing to execute our strategic plan as we look to expand into new regions, and we see positive momentum in our end markets into 2018.”\nFinancial Summary\nYear ended December 31\nQuarter ended December 31\n2017\n$\n2016\n$\n% Increase\n(Decrease)\n2017\n$\n2016\n$\n% Increase\n(Decrease)\n(In millions of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts and\npercentages)\nGross revenue\n5,140.1\n4,300.1\n19.5%\n1,246.0\n1,240.8\n0.4%\nNet revenue\n3,417.3\n3,098.4\n10.3%\n805.0\n820.2\n(1.9%)\nEBITDA (note)\n424.1\n336.3\n26.1%\n69.4\n82.9\n(16.3%)\nAdjusted EBITDA (note)\n363.4\n352.3\n3.2%\n63.1\n83.8\n(24.7%)\nNet income\n97.0\n130.5\n(25.7%)\n11.2\n29.4\n(61.9%)\nAdjusted net income (note)\n202.0\n181.1\n11.5%\n37.2\n40.4\n(7.9%)\nDiluted earnings per share\n0.85\n1.22\n(30.3%)\n0.10\n0.26\n(61.5%)\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (note)\n1.77\n1.69\n4.7%\n0.32\n0.35\n(8.6%)\nCash dividends declared per common share\n0.50\n0.45\n11.1%\n0.1250\n0.1125\n11.1%\nnote: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-IFRS measures and are discussed in the Definition of Non-IFRS Measures subsection of Stantec's 2017 Annual Report.\nFollowing is a summary of Stantec’s results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, and the Company’s outlook for 2018:\nQ4 2017 Summary of Results:\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2017\nConsulting\nConstruction\nTotal\n(In millions of Canadian dollars, except percentages)\n$\n% of NR\n$\n% of NR\n$\n% of NR\nGross revenue 977.4\n130.4%\n268.6\n487.5%\n1,246.0\n154.8%\nNet revenue 749.9\n100.0%\n55.1\n100.0%\n805.0\n100.0%\nGross margin\n419.0\n55.9%\n6.5\n11.8%\n425.5\n52.9%\nAdministrative, marketing, and other expenses\n348.6\n46.5%\n13.8\n25.2%\n362.4\n45.0%\nAdjusted EBITDA (note)\n70.4\n9.4%\n(7.3)\n(13.2%)\n63.1\n7.8%\nLoss on sale of property and equipment\n0.4\n0.0%\nRebalancing of investments held for self-insured liabilities\n(6.7)\n(0.8%)\nTotal EBITDA (note)\n69.4\n8.6%\nnote: Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are non-IFRS measures and are discussed in the Definition of Non-IFRS Measures subsection of Stantec's 2017 Annual Report.\nStantec’s gross and net revenues were $1,246 million and $805 million in the quarter, up 0.4% and retracting 1.9%, respectively; net revenue was lower because some legacy projects experienced challenges (described further below), which also negatively impacted organic growth and gross margins. Stantec achieved organic gross revenue growth of 4.1% and organic net revenue growth of 2.2%, mainly from growth in Energy & Resources. Organic growth was partly offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of Innovyze. Gross margin decreased in the quarter—from 54.5% to 52.9%—mostly due to $26 million in revenue and cost provisions for legacy projects that had challenges in the quarter. This includes recording revenue adjustments and cost provisions of $5 million on a major design-build project due to additional costs, design, and project scope issues in the US Water business. Construction Services also incurred $5 million in cost increases related to certain UK-based waste-to-energy projects where delays and certain asserted performance issues resulted in increases in costs to complete. In addition, approximately $16 million in cost escalations were incurred due to site conditions, client delays, and productivity issues in legacy US-based water hard-bid projects. Claims against parties believed to be responsible for causing much of these added costs have been or will be asserted, and any recoveries obtained may benefit future quarters as the claims are resolved. Administrative and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased—from 44.3% in Q4 16 to 44.9% in Q4 17—mainly due to a $6.2 million increase in our provision for self-insurance, and a $3 million increase in marketing and administrative labor due to lower utilization. These were partly offset by a $5.3 million decrease in our share-based compensation. Other income increased $6.6 million mainly due to the realization of a $6.7 million gain on the sale of equities on investments held for self-insured liabilities. EBITDA decreased 16.3% in the quarter—from $82.9 million to $69.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 24.7%—from $83.8 million to $63.1 million—due to project impacts on gross margin and administrative and marketing cost increases (described above). The reported tax rate in Q4 17 was 64.8% or $20.6 million, primarily impacted by the US tax reform, as described below. The impact of the US transition tax increased tax expense by $31.2 million, partly offset by a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities of $12.6 million, resulting in a net impact from US tax reform of $18.6 million. The effective annual tax rate was 24.0% in Q4 17 and 27.0% in Q3 17. The change resulted in an effective tax rate of 7.6% in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS decreased from $0.35 to $0.32, or 8.6%, in the quarter, due primarily to project impacts on gross margin and administrative and marketing cost increases, offset by a lower effective tax rate.\nFull Year 2017 Summary of Results:\n2017\nConsulting Construction Total (In millions of Canadian dollars, except percentages) $ % of NR $ % of NR $ % of NR Gross revenue 4,028.7\n126.9%\n1,111.4\n456.4%\n5,140.1\n150.4%\nNet revenue 3,173.8\n100.0%\n243.5\n100.0% 3,417.3\n100.0%\nGross margin 1,761.9\n55.5%\n66.0\n27.1%\n1,827.9\n53.5%\nAdministrative, marketing, and other expenses 1,400.3\n44.1%\n64.2\n26.4%\n1,464.5\n42.9%\nAdjusted EBITDA (note) 361.6\n11.4%\n1.8\n0.7%\n363.4\n10.6%\nAcquisition related costs\n0.4\n0.0%\nLoss on sale of property and equipment 0.2\n0.0% Rebalancing of investments held for self-insured liabilities (6.7) (0.2%)\nGain on disposition of subsidiary\n(54.6)\n(1.6%)\nTotal EBITDA (note) 424.1\n12.4%\nnote: Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are non-IFRS measures and are discussed in the Definition of Non-IFRS Measures subsection of Stantec's 2017 Annual Report.\nStantec achieved gross revenue of $5,140.1 million—up 19.5%—and net revenue of $3,417.3 million—up 10.3% from 2016. Organic gross revenue growth of 3.6%, net revenue growth of 0.1%, and acquisition growth were partly offset by foreign exchange impacts. Net revenue was lower than anticipated because of legacy projects primarily in Construction Services; the impacts were incurred mostly in the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 53.5% in 2017 compared to 54.1% in 2016, mostly due to Construction Services: higher costs incurred mostly in the fourth quarter on certain US-based hard-bid projects and UK-based waste-to-energy projects. Administrative and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased from 43.1% to 42.8%. Excluding acquisition-related costs of $14.5 million in 2016, administrative and marketing expenses was 42.6% in 2016. Increased administrative and marketing expenses in 2017 were due partly to a $12 million increase in IT costs related to adopting cloud-based software and developing the Company’s global platform and core network infrastructure. In addition, a $13.3 million increase in the actuarial estimates associated with the provision for self-insurance with the addition of MWH was incurred. Stantec recorded a $3.9 million increase in professional and audit fees related to items such as first-year SOX compliance for legacy MWH, US tax reform, and out-from-under tax planning. The Company also incurred $3.5 million in costs related to integration activities for MWH. These higher costs were partly offset by an $11.3 million decrease in occupancy and lease exit costs and a $3.5 million decrease in severance payments. EBITDA increased 26.1%—from $336.3 million to $424.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.2%—from $352.3 million to $363.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the Consulting Services business remained constant year over year, with gross margin as a percentage of net revenue improving over 2016, offset by higher administrative and marketing expenses (noted above). Construction Services EBITDA was negatively impacted primarily by legacy project issues (described above). The reported annual tax rate of 63.2%, or $166.5 million, was impacted by certain transactions in 2017 and US tax reform (noted below). The Innovyze sale increased tax expense by $94.5 million and a corporate reorganization increased tax expense by $3.2 million. The impact of the US transition tax increased tax expense by $31.2 million; this was offset by a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities of $12.6 million for a net tax increase from US tax reform of $18.6 million. The annual effective tax rate, adjusted for all the foregoing items, was 24.0%. Adjusted diluted EPS was up from $1.69 to $1.77, and full-year diluted EPS was down from $1.22 to $0.85 mainly due to $26 million in gross margin project impacts incurred in the fourth quarter and an increase in administrative and marketing expenses of approximately $20 million (described above).\nOUTLOOK: Positive; Refined Targets Established For 2018\nDan Lefaivre, executive vice president and CFO, says:\n“In 2018, we expect to generate organic gross revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits in line with global GDP growth. We continue to target a long-term average compound gross revenue growth rate of 15% through a combination of organic and acquisition growth.\n“While there were several impacts specific to the last quarter of 2017, we don’t anticipate similar issues in future quarters. The challenged projects are nearing completion. We recorded a one-time tax charge stemming from the recent US tax reform, and we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27% in 2018.”\nThe Company also established and refined its targets for 2018 to provide greater transparency into the difference in the nature of work between Consulting Services and Construction Services. These targets are outlined in the table below:\nMeasure\n2018 Target Range\nConsulting Services\nGross margin as % of net revenue\nBetween 53% and 55%\nAdministrative and marketing expenses as % of net revenue\nBetween 41% and 43%\nEBITDA as % of net revenue (note)\nBetween 11% and 13%\nConstruction Services\nGross margin as % of net revenue\nBetween 30% and 33%\nAdministrative and marketing expenses as % of net revenue\nBetween 25% and 27%\nEBITDA as % of net revenue (note)\nBetween 7% and 9%\nConsolidated\nGross margin as % of net revenue\nBetween 52% and 54%\nAdministrative and marketing expenses as % of net revenue\nBetween 41% and 43%\nEBITDA as % of net revenue (note)\nBetween 10% and 12%\nNet income as % of net revenue\nAt or above 5%\nnote: EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure and is discussed in the Definition of Non-IFRS Measures subsection of Stantec's 2017 Annual Report.\nIn addition, the Company expects the gross to net revenue ratio for Consulting Services and Construction Services to be in the following ranges for 2018:\n2018 Guidance\nGross to Net Revenue Ratio\nConsulting Services\nBetween 1.25 and 1.30\nConstruction Services\nBetween 4.50 and 5.00\nConsolidated\nBetween 1.45 and 1.50\nThe outlook is based on various expectations, including continued economic growth in North America, increased infrastructure spending, global economic growth, and the ability to capitalize on strategic initiatives and expand the global footprint.\nContinued Overall Organic Growth – Many End Markets Well Positioned into 2018\nStantec’s Canadian Consulting Services business had organic gross revenue growth of 5.4% and organic net revenue growth of 6.1% in the quarter. Growth was from continued strong housing demand in Ontario, southern Alberta, and Quebec; several larger pipeline projects; and a large mining project. Stantec also continued work on large healthcare projects in Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia.\nIn the United States, Consulting Services organic gross revenue retracted 0.6% and organic net revenue retracted 1.1% in the quarter. Water was negatively impacted by certain water programs coming to completion or slowing and a $5 million downward revenue adjustment on a major design-build project.\nThe Company’s Global Consulting Services business had organic gross revenue growth of 6.7% and organic net revenue growth of 8.3% in the quarter due to strong project activity in the UK through the Water Asset Management Programme 6 (AMP6) cycle and improving market conditions in the Latin America Mining sector and Middle East Water business operating unit.\nConstruction Services operations had organic gross revenue growth of 11.2% and organic net revenue retraction of 1.3% related to cost escalations in legacy MWH US-based water hard-bid projects and certain UK-based waste-to-energy projects (noted above).\nFor further information regarding revenue, refer to the Gross Revenue and Net Revenue by Reportable Segments and Gross Revenue and Net Revenue by Consulting Services – Business Operating Units subsections in Stantec’s 2017 Annual Report.\nSynergy Targets Achieved, Exceeded\nAs of the end of Q4 17, Stantec had exceeded the anticipated synergy target of US$25 million outlined at announcement of the MWH acquisition ($15 million in cost synergies; $10 million in revenue synergies). Cost synergies were due primarily to reduced labor, eliminated corporate costs, reduced accounting fees, and savings from consolidating real estate. Savings were also realized by realigning the combined insurance and employee benefit plans. Revenue synergies are ongoing as Stantec continues to win work that would not have been possible if MWH and Stantec were separate companies.\nIntegration Update\nThe Company completed several initiatives to increase collaboration between integrated teams and offices. As part of the full integration of MWH, as of January 1, 2018, the Company completed efforts to brand as “Stantec” globally, a significant milestone. Stantec rolled out collaboration tools such as common email, skype, and calendar access to help management pair the right employees with the right projects around the world. In 2018, the Company will continue to invest in streamlined common enterprise systems to drive efficiencies through its operating structure.\nSignificant Project Wins and Growth Opportunities in Q4 17\nStantec continued to secure significant project awards in the fourth quarter. These wins include appointment as the lead designer for the Long Island Rail Road Third Track Expansion Project; the award of the first Asset Management Programme 7 (AMP7) contract for Yorkshire Water in the United Kingdom; a contract for design-build services for Phase One of the Royal Columbian Hospital Redevelopment Project in New Westminster, British Columbia; a contract to design upgrades to State Highway 58 in New Zealand; and a contract to provide engineering design and reserve estimation for a platinum mine in South Africa.\nSubsequent Events\nOn February 21, 2018, Stantec’s board added a new director: Richard Bradeen of Montreal, Quebec, a former senior vice president (Strategy, Mergers & Acquisitions, Pension Investments, Corporate Audit Services, and Risk Assessment) for Bombardier Inc. Before that, Mr. Bradeen worked at Ernst & Young for 19 years, holding increasingly senior roles including partner and president of the Corporate Finance Group in Toronto, Ontario. Mr. Bradeen will also serve on the board’s Audit and Risk Committee.\nDividend\nOn February 21, 2018, Stantec declared a cash dividend of $0.1375 per share, payable on April 12, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 29, 2018, an increase of 10.0% over last year.\nConference Call and Company Information\nOn Thursday, February 22, at 7:00 AM MST (9:00 AM EST), Stantec’s fourth quarter and year end 2017 conference call and slideshow presentation will be broadcast live and archived in their entirety in the Investors section of stantec.com .
