However, election officials have hinted that polls may not even be possible then because of financial and logistical constraints.\n“Our people no longer believe in the political will of our current leaders to ensure a peaceful transition of power,” one of the main organising groups wrote in a statement ahead of the march.\nChurch groups have become the main opposing force to Kabila as political opposition parties have been hobbled by in-fighting or have seen their leaders forced into exile.\nAs with previous protest marches, internet, mobile data and phone messaging were all cut across Congo early on Sunday.\nSecurity forces killed about a dozen civilians during two previous marches in the past two months organised by Catholic activists in crackdowns that stoked fears Congo could be sliding back toward the wars of the turn of the century in which millions died.\nKinshasa police commissioner General Sylvano Kasongo had announced a goal of “zero deaths” during a review of police on Saturday.\n“It’s our population, our countrymen that we are protecting. I told the policemen not to fire on the population, which is a civilian population that isn’t armed,” he said.\nReporting by Patient Ligodi; Writing by Joe Bavier; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:52:53.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
