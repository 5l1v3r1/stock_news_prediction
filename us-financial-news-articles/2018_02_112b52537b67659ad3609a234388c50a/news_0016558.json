But South Korea has said the agreement failed to meet victims’ needs, calling for more steps.\nAbe, whose decision to attend the Games opening ceremony angered some of his conservative backers, has rejected those calls, saying the agreement will not be altered “by even one millimetre”.\nReporting by Linda Sieg and Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Chris Gallagher and Lincoln Feast\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T03:49:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
