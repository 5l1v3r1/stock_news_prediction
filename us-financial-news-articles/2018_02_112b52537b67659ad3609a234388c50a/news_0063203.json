[nL8N1QA61S]\nIn the wake of the #MeToo movement by women against sexual harassment and abuse, 21 global charities were asked to disclose sexual harassment and abuse by staff and any job losses, with some quick to give figures while others needed several prompts.\nSave the Children and Oxfam gave figures in November. Others such as ActionAid, Plan International and the ICRC provided data last week, while the International Rescue Committee (IRC) sent numbers on Tuesday as they raced to meet a government deadline.\nThe IRC said it had nine cases of sexual harassment and nine cases of sexual abuse or exploitation in 2017. The charity took disciplinary action in each instance, with most offenders fired.\nOf the charities surveyed, Islamic Relief and Action Against Hunger did not provide numbers, while Compassion International, Catholic Relief Services and Caritas Internationalis said they had received no reports of serious violations last year.\nBritain’s aid minister said on Monday the “grotesque” sex abuse scandal was a “wake up call” for aid agencies, and warned the government would not fund those that failed to respond.[nL8N1QG1TY]\nReporting By Heba Kanso, Writing by Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Katy Migiro.
