Food cost 24 percent less in 2017 than at its 2011 peak, but strong demand may support prices this year, a FAO economist said last month. \nFAO forecast an all-time record global cereal harvest, raising its forecast in 2017 to 2.64 billion tonnes, largely due to expectations of higher maize output in China, Mexico and the European Union. \nDespite ample supplies, a weaker U.S. dollar helped to prop up international prices for wheat and maize, which are priced in dollars and therefore became cheaper to buy in other currencies.
