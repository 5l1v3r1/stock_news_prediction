We can then choose to bring inflation up to target over a longer horizon, particularly if interest rates are already low and there are signs that financial imbalances are building up.”\nA Norwegian rate hike would follow recent tightening in the United States, Britain and Canada, although a sharp rise in global rates remains unlikely, Olsen said.\n“As conditions normalise, interest rates will likely remain lower than they were a few decades ago. The structural conditions that have depressed the global neutral interest rate will not reverse overnight,” he added.\nTRILLION-DOLLAR WEALTH FUND\nThe central bank, which manages Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, also reiterated earlier warnings that the fund’s value may vary significantly over time.\nWith close to 70 percent of assets invested in stocks, and the remaining held in bonds and real estate, the fund’s value is now almost three times larger than Norway’s annual economic output outside of the oil industry.\nThe fund, saved up from revenues from Norway’s oil and gas industry, pays for about 15 percent of government spending.\n“Looking ahead, movements in global capital markets will be the main source of variation in the value of the fund, and at times in a negative direction. The actual stance of fiscal policy must allow for this uncertainty,” Olsen said.\n“The fund had several good years following the euro crisis. Markets turned around, and quickly the loss was more than reversed. We cannot take for granted that this will always be the case.” (Editing by Toby Chopra)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:06:18.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
