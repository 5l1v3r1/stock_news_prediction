The firm did not comment on the future of the model in its statement on Wednesday.\nA Toyota spokesman later declined to comment or speculate on the Avensis.\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:08:30.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
