(NYSE American: RLGT), a third-party logistics and multi-modal transportation services company, today reported financial results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017.\nSecond Fiscal Quarter Financial Highlights (Quarter Ended December 31, 2017)\nRevenues were $206.7 million for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, up $7.8 million or 3.9% compared to revenues of $198.9 million for the comparable prior year period. Sequentially, revenues were up $8.7 million or 4.4% compared to revenues of $198.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nNet revenues were $47.9 million for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, down $2.2 million, or 4.4% compared to net revenues of $50.1 million for the comparable prior year period. Sequentially, net revenues were up $1.8 million or 3.9% compared to net revenues of $46.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $3.3 million, or $0.07 per basic and fully diluted share, compared to a net income of $2.1 million, or $0.04 per basic and fully diluted share for the comparable prior year period, including a one-time benefit of $2.3 million related to a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Sequentially, net income improved up $3.0 million or 1000.0% compared to net income of $0.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nAdjusted net income attributable to common stockholders was $3.6 million, or $0.07 per basic and fully diluted share for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to adjusted net income of $5.4 million, or $0.11 per basic and fully diluted share for the comparable prior year period. Sequentially, adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders was up $0.7 million or 24.1% compared to adjusted net income of $2.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Periods are calculated by applying a normalized tax rate of 31% and excluding other items not considered part of regular operating activities.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $7.1 million for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, down $1.8 million or 20.2% compared to adjusted EBITDA of $8.9 million for the comparable prior year period. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA was up $0.6 million or 9.2% compared to adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nCEO Comments\n\"We are pleased to report improving results for the quarter led by progress in our Canadian operations,\" said Bohn Crain, Founder and CEO. \"We posted Adjusted EBITDA of $7.1 million on revenues of $206.7 million and net revenues of $47.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. On a sequential quarterly comparison, revenues of $206.7 million, up $8.7 million or 4.4%; net revenues of $47.9 million, up $1.8 million or 3.9%; adjusted net income of $3.6 million, up $0.7 million or 24.1%; and adjusted EBITDA of $7.1 million, up $0.6 million or 9.2%, over the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Although margin pressures felt across our industry as a result of extreme capacity and pricing swings over the past twelve months have led to less favorable year over year comparisons, we believe we are well positioned and beginning to benefit from a more favorable market environment given the healthy economy, high freight demand and tight capacity. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for our Canada-based materials management and distribution solutions offering and believe our strategic decision to bundle value added logistics solutions with our core transportation service offering will continue to gain momentum moving forward.\"\n\"We are also a beneficiary of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"). The primary impact of the Act in fiscal year 2018 is a reduction of the Company's federal statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 28.1% which is the average of our rate of 35.0% for the first half of fiscal 2018 and 21.0% for the second half of fiscal 2018. Given that we have historically been a full cash tax payer, these reduced tax rates will positively impact both our after tax free cashflow as well as our earnings per share. Commencing with quarter ending September 30, 2018 we will begin to recognize the full benefit of the new federal tax rate of 21.0%. When we overlay the impact of state and other taxes, we have historically had an all-in effective tax rate of 36%. We are estimating an all-in average effective rate of rate of 31.0% through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 and an estimated all-in effective rate of 25.0% commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2018.\nCrain Continued: \"We also continue to make meaningful progress on the technology front and have expanded the pilot of our new SAP-based transportation management system to four of our company-owned operating locations: Phoenix, Detroit, Los Angeles and Minneapolis. With four of our company-owned locations now providing domestic forwarding services using SAP-TM we are excited to get user feedback and continue to refine the system in anticipation of beginning to roll the system out to our agency locations later this year. As we have previously discussed, we believe our ongoing investment in technology provides us with a unique opportunity to deliver a state-of-the-art technology platform for our strategic operating partners and the end customers that we serve. At the same time, our new technology set will enable a number of productivity initiatives to stream-line our back-office processes and accelerate the realization of back-office cost synergies associated with existing and future acquisitions and can ultimately help facilitate revenue synergies across the platform.\"\nSecond Fiscal Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 – Financial Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Radiant reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $3.3 million on $206.7 million of revenues, or $0.07 per basic and fully diluted share, including a one-time benefit of $2.3 million related to a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, Radiant reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $2.1 million on $198.9 million of revenues, or $0.04 per basic and fully diluted share.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Radiant reported adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders of $3.6 million, or $0.07 per basic and fully diluted share.

Normalizing these results to exclude non-recurring transition costs associated with the interim operation of Service by Air's back-office operations, Adjusted EBITDA would have been $7.1 million and $9.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSix Months Ended December 31, 2017 – Financial Results\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, Radiant reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $3.6 million on $404.7 million of revenues, or $0.07 per basic and fully diluted share, including a one-time benefit of $2.3 million related to a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For the six months ended December 31, 2016, Radiant reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $3.4 million on $394.0 million of revenues, or $0.07 per basic and fully diluted share.\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, Radiant reported adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders of $6.5 million or $0.13 per basic and fully diluted share. For the six months ended December 31, 2016, Radiant reported adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders of $9.8 million or $0.20 per basic and fully diluted share.\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, Radiant reported Adjusted EBITDA of $13.6 million, compared to $16.2 million for the comparable prior year period. Normalizing these results to exclude non-recurring transition costs associated with the interim operation of Service by Air's back-office operations, Adjusted EBITDA would have been $13.6 million and $17.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEarnings Call and Webcast Access Information\nRadiant Logistics, Inc. will host a conference call on Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 4:30 PM Eastern to discuss the contents of this release.

Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Adjusted EBITDA are presented herein because they are important metrics used by management to evaluate and understand the performance of the ongoing operations of Radiant's business. For Adjusted Net Income, management uses a 31% tax rate for calculating the provision for income taxes before preferred dividend requirement to normalize Radiant's tax rate to that of its competitors and to compare Radiant's reporting periods with different effective tax rates. In addition, in arriving at Adjusted Net Income, the Company adjusts for certain non-cash charges and significant items that are not part of regular operating activities. These adjustments include depreciation and amortization, change in contingent consideration, amortization of loan fees, write-off of loan fees, impairment of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related costs, transition costs, lease termination costs, legal costs and non-recurring costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA means earnings before preferred stock dividends, interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is then further adjusted for changes in contingent consideration, expenses specifically attributable to acquisitions, lease termination costs, extraordinary items, share-based compensation expense, legal costs, non-recurring costs, material management and distribution (\"MM&D\") start-up costs, write off of loan fees, impairment of acquired intangible assets and foreign exchange losses or gains. Normalized Adjusted EBITDA represents the Adjusted EBITDA but also adds back transition costs associated with the SBA back-office that is projected to be eliminated.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, represent a useful method of assessing the performance of our operating activities, as they reflect our earnings trends without the impact of certain non-cash charges and other non-recurring charges. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the GAAP financial information by providing additional insight regarding results of operations to allow a comparison to other companies, many of whom use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures will not be defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other companies. Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any of the consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as an indication of Radiant's operating performance or liquidity.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nSix Months Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of net income to adjusted net income:\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n3,330\n$\n2,099\n$\n3,646\n$\n3,449\nAdjustments to net income (loss):\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(1,840)\n1,489\n(1,214)\n2,741\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,567\n3,028\n7,142\n6,034\nChange in contingent consideration\n190\n806\n(110)\n1,056\nLease termination costs\n—\n22\n107\n25\nAcquisition related costs\n20\n71\n98\n216\nLitigation costs\n54\n77\n79\n113\nNon-recurring costs\n—\n8\n—\n14\nAmortization of loan fees\n61\n79\n123\n159\nTransition costs associated with acquisitions\n—\n363\n—\n818\nAdjusted net income before income taxes\n5,382\n8,042\n9,871\n14,625\nProvision for income taxes at 31% before preferred dividend\nrequirement\n(1,827)\n(2,651)\n(3,377)\n(4,851)\nAdjusted net income\n$\n3,555\n$\n5,391\n$\n6,494\n$\n9,774\nAdjusted net income per common share - basic and diluted\n$\n0.07\n$\n0.11\n$\n0.13\n$\n0.20\nWeighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic shares\n49,174,789\n48,789,684\n49,130,167\n48,825,598\nDiluted shares\n50,711,153\n49,799,686\n50,677,053\n49,667,041\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nSix Months Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of net income to normalized adjusted EBITDA\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n3,330\n$\n2,099\n$\n3,646\n$\n3,449\nPreferred stock dividends\n511\n511\n1,023\n1,023\nNet income attributable to Radiant Logistics, Inc.\n3,841\n2,610\n4,669\n4,472\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(1,840)\n1,489\n(1,214)\n2,741\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,567\n3,028\n7,142\n6,034\nNet interest expense\n802\n614\n1,566\n1,248\nEBITDA\n6,370\n7,741\n12,163\n14,495\nShare-based compensation\n380\n329\n730\n660\nChange in contingent consideration\n190\n806\n(110)\n1,056\nAcquisition related costs\n20\n71\n98\n216\nLitigation costs\n54\n77\n79\n113\nNon-recurring costs\n—\n8\n—\n14\nLease termination costs\n—\n22\n107\n25\nMM&D start-up costs\n63\n—\n410\n—\nForeign exchange loss (gain)\n55\n(188)\n139\n(388)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n7,132\n8,866\n13,616\n16,191\nTransition costs\n—\n363\n—\n818\nNormalized adjusted EBITDA\n$\n7,132\n$\n9,229\n$\n13,616\n$\n17,009\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Net Revenues\n14.9\n%\n17.7\n%\n14.5\n%\n16.3\n%\nNormalized Adjusted EBITDA as a % of Net Revenues\n14.9\n%\n18.4\n%\n14.5\n%\n17.2\n%\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/radiant-logistics-announces-results-for-the-second-fiscal-quarter-ended-december-31-2017-300596045.html\nSOURCE Radiant Logistics, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/radiant-logistics-announces-results-for-the-second-fiscal-quarter-ended-december-31-2017-300596045.html", "http://radiantdelivers.com/?page_id=32", "http://www.investorcalendar.com/"], "published": "2018-02-09T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T02:03:30.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
