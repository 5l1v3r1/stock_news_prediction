The company had 15 days to respond.\nAirbnb said it would appeal the fine, adding that the site, which connects home owners with holiday makers, helps families who want to take advantage of the visitors flowing to the Mediterranean islands.\nThe flat-sharing site offered some 24,000 homes on the Balearic Islands according to 2016 figures, the most recent available.\nRental prices in Palma de Mallorca, the Balearic capital, have risen by double digits over the past few years as the popularity of shared homes via sites such as San Francisco-based Airbnb have sky-rocketed.\nOther Spanish cities, including Madrid, Barcelona, Malaga, Seville and Valencia, have passed laws, or are examining regulation, to curb tourism rentals via the sites because of their effects on local rental prices.\nReporting by Robert Hetz, writing by Paul Day, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:17:58.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
