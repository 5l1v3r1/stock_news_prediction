In 2018, it would produce 476 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas, compared to 471 in 2017, Gazprom said.\n($1 = 57.0745 rubles)\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin, Oksana Kobzeva in Moscow and Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York; Writing by Polina Ivanova and Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:48:14.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
