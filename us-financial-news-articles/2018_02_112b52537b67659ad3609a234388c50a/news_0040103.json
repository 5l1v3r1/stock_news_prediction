The yield, which moves inverse to the bond’s price, climbed to 0.85 percent.\nABLV Bank, Latvia third biggest lender, was ordered by the European Central Bank -- its supervisor -- to stop all payments on Monday as its “liquidity position” had deteriorated sharply since the U.S. Treasury accused it last week of money laundering.\nIn a separate development, Latvia’s government increased pressure on central bank boss Ilmars Rimsevics, an ECB policymaker, to quit after he was detained by police over the weekend in an anti-corruption probe.\nThe Latvian Anti-Corruption Authority said on Monday Rimsevics’ detention was related to a solicitation for a bribe.\nReporting by Marc Jones, Editing by Abhinav Ramnarayan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:30:43.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
