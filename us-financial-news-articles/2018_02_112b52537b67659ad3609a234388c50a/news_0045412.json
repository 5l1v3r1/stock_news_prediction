A company spokesman said the review was launched in the past few weeks after Ford received a report of inappropriate behavior. \nFord said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that under the terms of his separation agreement, Nair is entitled to retirement and healthcare benefits but will not receive a bonus for 2017 or 2018 and some equity-based awards will be canceled. \nNair has agreed to waive claims against Ford and to cooperate with any future investigations or litigation. \nGalhotra, who has also served as Ford’s chief marketing officer since last year, takes charge of a business that generates about 90 percent of Ford’s global profits. \nThe company also made a handful of other changes to its senior management team on Thursday, appointing Joy Falotico to replace Galhotra as group vice president for Lincoln and chief marketing officer. \nDavid McClelland was made vice president of Ford and CEO of Ford Motor Credit Co, Stuart Rowley was named vice president and chief operating officer for Ford North America and John Lawler was appointed vice president, strategy of Ford. \nCathy O’Callaghan was named vice president and corporate controller, and chief financial officer, global markets. \nIn morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Ford shares were up 3 cents at $10.63. \nReporting by Sanjana Shivdas and Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham and Bill Rigby\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T16:43:19.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
