China’s gross domestic product per person is $8,123 according to the World Bank.\nChina brought 12.89 million rural people out of poverty in 2017.\nHundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in the past few years in violence between Uighurs, a mostly Muslim people who speak a Turkic language, and ethnic majority Han Chinese, especially in the heavily Uighur southern part of Xinjiang.\n$1 = 6.3438 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:48:03.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
