The fourth member of the squad Brent Laing is a three-time world champion. \nTheir coach John Dunn is sport psychologist and at a time when top teams are starting to use data analytics to develop game plans and shot selection Team Koe remains old school - make 90 percent of your shots and you usually win. \n”This sport it usually comes down to last rock, last end,“ Dunn told Reuters. ”That’s the advantage we have because collectively as a team we have been in that last rock, last end situation so many time. \n”We’ll never fall off the cliff, we’ll have bad games don’t get me wrong, but when it’s on the line we won’t fall off the cliff because we have climbed the cliff so many times. \n”It’s the people who haven’t been up the cliff and all of a sudden they go, ‘oh my God, there’s an Olympic medal on the line’ and they get flooded with those emotions and struggle. \n“If we lose it won’t be because of that choke, that’s not going to happen with this team.” Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T12:28:50.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
