(NasdaqGM: OBLN) have filed a class action complaint against the company's officers and directors for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 between October 5, 2016 and January 23, 2018. Obalon develops and commercializes medical devices to treat obese and overweight people by facilitating weight loss.\nView this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog:\nwww.robbinsarroyo.com/obalon-therapeutics-inc-feb-2018\nObalon Accused of Implementing Inadequate Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nAccording to the complaint, Obalon repeatedly attested in its public filings and press releases that its financial statements were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Obalon emphasized substantial revenue growth and improvements in its gross margin in its financial reports throughout the class period. It therefore came as a surprise when Obalon revealed on January 23, 2018, that a whistleblower contacted KPMG LLP, the company's independent auditors, to allege that Obalon had improperly recognized revenue during the company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2017. As a result, Obalon canceled its previously announced offering of 5,454,545 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.50 per share and said that its Audit Committee would investigate the allegations. On this news, Obalon's stock fell nearly 77% from its IPO price of $15.00 per share to close at only $3.46 per share on January 23, 2018.\nObalon Shareholders Have Legal Options\nIf you would like more information about your rights and potential remedies, contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
