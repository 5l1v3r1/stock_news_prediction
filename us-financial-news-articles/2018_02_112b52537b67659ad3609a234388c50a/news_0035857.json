We believe this merger will offer customers and employees of both banks even greater strength and resources while maintaining our commitments to the communities we serve.”\n“The combination of two storied, historic community banks in Northern California is an absolute natural union,” said Craig Van Selow, President and CEO of Scott Valley Bank. “Mechanics Bank offers our clients and our employees deeper resources and broader opportunities to continue the legacy of service to our communities and to reinforce our growth.
