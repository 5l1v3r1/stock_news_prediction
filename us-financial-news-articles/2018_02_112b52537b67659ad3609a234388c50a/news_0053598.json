As adjusted, fourth quarter 2017 core earnings were $357 million, or $1.10 per share, compared to core earnings of $316 million, or $0.97 per share, in the fourth quarter 2016.\nSouthern California Edison's (SCE) fourth quarter 2017 earnings decreased by $437 million, or $1.34 per share, from the fourth quarter 2016, consisting of $44 million, or $0.14 per share, of higher core earnings, offset by $481 million, or $1.48 per share, of higher non-core losses. The $44 million increase in core earnings was due to higher revenue from the escalation mechanism set forth in the 2015 General Rate Case (GRC) decision. Fourth quarter 2017 SCE core earnings excluded non-core losses of $481 million, or $1.48 per share, which is primarily related to the $448 million, or $1.38 per share, after-tax impairment and other charges related to the Revised San Onofre Settlement Agreement. There were no SCE non-core items in the fourth quarter 2016 results.\nEdison International Parent and Other’s fourth quarter 2017 losses from continuing operations increased by $424 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2016, consisting of $3 million, or $0.01 per share, of higher core losses and $421 million, or $1.29 per share, of higher non-core losses. The increase in core losses was primarily related to lower tax benefits related to stock based compensation, partially offset by higher operating revenue. Edison International Parent and Other's fourth quarter 2017 core losses excluded non-core losses of $421 million, or $1.29 per share, primarily related to a $433 million, or $1.33 per share, write-down from the re-measurement of deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. There were no Edison International Parent and Other non-core items in the fourth quarter 2016 results.\nAdditionally, Edison International recorded $13 million of income, or $0.04 per share, from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter 2016.\n“Edison International delivered excellent fourth quarter and full-year results which were largely driven by strong operating performance and tax benefits at SCE and better-than-expected cost performance at the parent company,” said Pedro Pizarro, Edison International president and chief executive officer. “However, this year also had its challenges with the effects of wildfires and concerns over the associated legal and regulatory framework. In 2018, we will focus on addressing the risks and issues surrounding wildfires and other climate change impacts. Our strategy is rooted in enabling California’s ambitious environmental policies, which in turn will require strong, healthy utilities.”\nFull-Year Earnings\nFor 2017, Edison International reported net income of $565 million, or $1.73 per share, compared to $1.3 billion, or $4.02 per share, during 2016. As adjusted, Edison International’s core earnings were $1.5 billion, or $4.50 per share, compared to $1.3 billion, or $3.97 per share, in 2016.\nSCE’s 2017 net income decreased $364 million, or $1.12 per share, from 2016, consisting of $481 million, or $1.48 per share, of higher non-core losses, partially offset by $117 million, or $0.36 per share, of higher core earnings. The increase in core earnings was due to higher revenue from the escalation mechanism set forth in the 2015 GRC decision and lower operations and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher net financing costs. SCE 2017 core earnings excluded non-core losses of $481 million, or $1.48 per share, which is primarily related to the $448 million, or $1.38 per share, after-tax impairment and other charges related to the Revised San Onofre Settlement Agreement. There were no SCE non-core items in 2016.\nEdison International Parent and Other’s losses from continuing operations for 2017 increased by $370 million, or $1.14 per share, compared to 2016, consisting of $55 million, or $0.17 per share, of lower core losses, offset by $425 million, or $1.31 per share, of higher non-core losses. The decrease in core losses in 2017 was primarily related to higher Edison Energy Group operating revenue and higher income tax benefits resulting from: stock option exercises, net operating loss carrybacks from the filing of the 2016 tax returns in 2017, and the 2017 settlement of federal income tax audits for 2007 - 2012. Edison International Parent and Other's 2017 core losses exclude non-core losses of $420 million, or $1.29 per share, primarily related to a $433 million, or $1.33 per share, write-down from the re-measurement of deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Non-core items in 2017 also included income of $13 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to $5 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2016 related to losses (net of distributions) allocated to tax equity investors under the hypothetical liquidation at book value (HLBV) accounting method.\nAdditionally, Edison International recorded $12 million of income, or $0.03 per share, from discontinued operations for 2016.\nEdison International uses core earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts for significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Edison International management believes that core earnings provide more meaningful comparisons of performance from period to period. Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of core earnings to basic GAAP earnings.\n2018 Earnings Guidance\nEdison International will provide 2018 earnings guidance after a final decision has been issued by the CPUC on the Southern California Edison 2018 GRC. This is consistent with the company's practice of not providing earnings guidance prior to a decision on its GRC. See the presentation accompanying the company’s conference call for further information.\nEdison International and Southern California Edison Declare Dividends\nToday, the Board of Directors of Edison International declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.605 per share, payable on April 30, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 29, 2018. Additionally, the Board of Directors of Southern California Edison Company today declared dividends on preference and preferred stock. For more information, please see the related press release at www.edisoninvestor.com .\nA Note on 2016 Results\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard for employee share-based payments. Edison International adopted this accounting standard during the fourth quarter of 2016, effective January 1, 2016. Under this new standard, share-based payments may create a permanent difference between the amount of compensation expense recognized for book and tax purposes. The tax impact of this permanent difference is recognized in earnings in the period it is created. 2016 earnings were updated to reflect the implementation of the accounting standard for share-based payments effective January 1, 2016. See the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Reconciliation tables below and the presentation accompanying the company’s conference call for further information.\nAbout Edison International\nEdison International (NYSE:EIX), through its subsidiaries, is a generator and distributor of electric power, as well as a provider of energy services and technologies, including renewable energy. Headquartered in Rosemead, California, Edison International is the parent company of Southern California Edison, one of the nation’s largest electric utilities. Edison International is also the parent company of Edison Energy Group, a portfolio of competitive businesses that provide commercial and industrial customers with energy management and procurement services and distributed solar generation. Edison Energy Group companies are independent from Southern California Edison.\nAppendix\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEdison International’s earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company’s earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (EPS) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance of Edison International and Southern California Edison. We also use core earnings and core EPS when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company’s performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to as net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also apply to the description of earnings or earnings per share.\nCore earnings and core EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as basic earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Basic earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders. Core earnings are reconciled to basic earnings in the attached tables. The impact of participating securities (vested awards that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for the principal operating subsidiary is not material to the principal operating subsidiary’s EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which is included in Edison International Parent and Other.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nStatements contained in this release about future performance, including, without limitation, operating results, rate base growth, financial outlook, and other statements that are not purely historical, are These reflect our current expectations; however, such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results include, but are not limited to the:\nability of SCE to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates, including costs related to San Onofre, uninsured wildfire-related liabilities, and spending on grid modernization; ability to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost, including insurance relating to SCE's nuclear facilities and wildfire-related exposure, and to recover the costs of such insurance or, in the absence of insurance, the ability to recover uninsured losses; decisions and other actions by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC and other regulatory authorities, including determinations of authorized rates of return or return on equity, the 2018 GRC and the recoverability of wildfire-related costs, and delays in regulatory actions; risks associated with the decommissioning of San Onofre, including those related to public opposition, permitting, governmental approvals, on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, and cost overruns; extreme weather-related incidents and other natural disasters, including earthquakes and events caused, or exacerbated, by climate change, such as wildfires; risks associated with higher rates for utility bundled service customers because of possible customer bypass or departure due to Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs); and risks inherent in SCE’s transmission and distribution infrastructure investment program, including those related to project site identification, public opposition, environmental mitigation, construction, permitting, power curtailment costs (payments due under power contracts in the event there is insufficient transmission to enable acceptance of power delivery), changes in the CAISO’s transmission plans, and governmental approvals.\nOther important factors are discussed under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” in Edison International’s Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our website: www.edisoninvestor.com . These filings also provide additional information on historical and other factual data contained in this news release.
