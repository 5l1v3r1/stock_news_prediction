At least 10 fighters are still missing. We fear Daesh might execute them.” said Abbas al-Jabouri, a local PMF commander, referring to Islamic State by an Arabic acronym.\nIraqi forces launched an operation this month to consolidate control of a mountain area near the oil city of Kirkuk to be used for the transit of Iraqi oil, highlighting concern about mountainous terrain where two armed groups are active.\nIraq declared victory in December over Islamic State militants who seized control of nearly a third of the country in 2014. However, the group continues to carry out attacks and bombings in Baghdad and different parts of the country.
