A lack of social engagement can trigger mental health problems and chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, in this population, Reinhard’s team writes. \n“I think this study is the first step forward to the development of more effective treatments and the reduction of loneliness in the elderly,” Dr. Stephanie Cacioppo, director of the brain dynamics laboratory at University of Chicago’s Pritzker School of Medicine, told Reuters Health in a phone interview. \n“This won’t be achieved easily, however. Giving free passes is not enough to help people interact with one another. Sharing good times and providing and receiving mutual aid and assistance are more important,” said Cacioppo, who was not involved in the study. “If you put lonely people together they won’t be happy.” \nReinhard and colleagues examined data collected on 18,453 people residing in England (age 50 or older) who were surveyed one or more times between 2002 and 2014 for a long-term study. \nIn 2006, free local bus travel for people 60 or older was implemented in England, and in 2008 the program was extended to free bus travel nationwide. This “natural experiment” allowed the researchers to follow changes in mental health symptoms before and after people became eligible for free travel. \nOverall, 8.9 percent of the study group used public transportation “a lot” or nearly every day during the study period. Another 11.3 percent used it “quite often,” or two to three times per week; 17.2 percent used it “sometimes,” or two to five times per month. About 30 percent used it rarely or less than once a month, and 32 percent never used public transportation. \nWhen researchers investigated the impact of eligibility for free bus travel, they found that it was associated with a 51 percent increased odds of people using public transportation. After adjustment for factors like age, gender, disability and employment and pension status, increased use of public transportation was linked to an average 1-point decrease in scores on an 8-point scale for measuring depression symptoms. \nIncreased transportation use was not linked to any change in measures of social isolation or membership in groups, however. \nThe findings “suggest that benefits from increased transport use likely stem from reduced loneliness, increased participation in volunteering activities and increased contact with children and friends,” Reinhard said. \nA key limitation of the study, she acknowledged, is that they did not have information on whether study participants lived in urban, suburban, or rural areas. \n“Since public transport infrastructure varies between urban and rural areas, it is plausible that the free bus passes may have different impacts based on where people live and the quality of public transportation available. This is something we would like to examine in future research,” she said. \nSOURCE: bit.ly/2BMD3vI Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, online January 19, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T23:33:28.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
