Tillerson ends his trip in Jamaica, a growing drug trafficking hub.\nThe U.S. is the world’s largest market for cocaine.\nTrump has threatened to cut aid around the world, questioning what the United States gets in return for its support. Earlier this year, he promised to end assistance for Pakistan.\nAdditional reporting by Luc Cohen, Frank Jack Daniel and Helen Murphy, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T04:34:10.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
