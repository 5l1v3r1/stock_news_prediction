The bank was one of many companies used by the NRA to promote its membership through discounts and bonus deals. \nThe move comes amid fierce debate on gun control after a lone gunman killed 17 people at a Parkland, Florida, high school last Wednesday using an assault rifle. \nScores of teenage survivors of the deadliest public high school shooting in U.S. history have mobilized to protest a lack of gun control, meeting with lawmakers at both state and national levels to encourage tighter restrictions. \nCEO of the National Rifle Association Wayne LaPierre, however, pushed back on criticism Thursday, saying \"The NRA does care.\" \n\"Our American freedoms could be lost, and our country will be changed forever,\" he said at the gathering at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland. \"And the first to go will be the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T23:27:47.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
