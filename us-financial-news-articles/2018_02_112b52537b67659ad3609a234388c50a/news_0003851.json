He faces murder charges after the army discovered a mass grave of 15 suspected government spies in 2006 who were killed in the central Philippines. \nIn November, Duterte ended intermittent peace talks with Maoist-led rebels, declaring them “terrorists” because hostilities had continued during the talks, and ordering security forces to hunt guerrilla leaders.
