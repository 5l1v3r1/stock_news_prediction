The trial was fully enrolled two quarters ahead of schedule.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operational Highlights\nEntered into clinical trial collaboration with AstraZeneca in NSCLC: G1 entered into a non-exclusive clinical trial collaboration with AstraZeneca to evaluate its epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor Tagrisso® in combination with G1T38 for the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). G1 filed and has an open Investigational New Drug (IND) application to support this Phase 1b/2 trial.\nFiled an IND for oral SERD G1T48: G1 filed an IND to support a Phase 1/2a trial of its oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), G1T48, in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative (ER+, HER2-) breast cancer. The IND opened in the first quarter of 2018.\nPreclinical trilaciclib data published: G1 data was published in the Cancer Discovery article, “CDK4/6 Inhibition Augments Anti-Tumor Immunity by Enhancing T Cell Activation.”\nStrengthened corporate leadership: Barclay (Buck) Phillips joined G1 as Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Corporate Development.
