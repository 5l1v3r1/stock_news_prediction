Yes, maybe he can have mine too.”\nMayer, 27, has a knack of delivering on the Olympic stage, but he has endured bleak moments too.\nIn December 2015 he suffered a vertebral fracture after crashing horribly during a downhill race in Val Gardena, Italy, and underwent surgery that kept him out of action till the next season.\nHe showed indifferent form in the run-up to the Games, ranking only sixth in super-G on the World Cup circuit. And his Pyeongchang Olympics started badly, with a wipeout in the slalom leg of the Alpine combined, and a disappointing ninth place in the attempted defence of his downhill crown on Thursday.\nThe slalom crash landed him with a sore hip in the run-up to the downhill and super-G.\n“I have to thank my physiotherapist... I wasn’t thinking about the pain on my hip, I just was focused on my skiing,” Mayer said.\nAs one of the later starters, he had the advantage of watching the early runners attempt the steep, winding course. The first two - Italy’s Peter Fill and Switzerland’s Mauro Caviezel - both skiied out after making mistakes on turns.\n“I was pushing hard from the top to the finish. Of course I made some small mistakes, but nobody knows the course. I had bib number 15 so I could watch five, six racers at the start and that was good for me so I could make my own line.”\nEven after his back injury, Mayer said: “I was always thinking about coming back, doing this again and trying my best.”\nWill he come back in four years time for another gold medal shot? “I hope so,” he told reporters.
