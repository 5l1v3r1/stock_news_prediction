Those lawmakers have denied the allegations.\nAs accusations arose, the congressional Office of Compliance revealed that it had paid more than $160,000 in the last decade to settle sexual harassment or discrimination claims against lawmakers. Many congress members and activists criticized the use of public funds for “hush money.”\nOn Tuesday, the House passed a resolution that only governs the payouts and anti-harassment policies in the House, and it does not need Senate approval. A bill amending the workplace law for the entire Congress will now go to the Senate for a vote.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T21:36:52.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
