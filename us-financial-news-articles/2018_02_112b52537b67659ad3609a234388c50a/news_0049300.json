The feature could reduce replacement costs â€” for reference, the U.S. $10 bill is replaced every four and a half years. \nAustralia is continuously innovating with its banknotes, too. Its new A$5 banknote boasts a rolling color effect and, when moved a certain way, you'll even see the image of an eastern spinebill (a native bird) moving its wings and changing colors. \nIn 2015, the Reserve Bank of Australia said it would add a tactile feature to the notes to help the visually challenged know the value. \nAustralia was the first country to introduce polymer banknotes in 1988, which have been adopted by other countries such as Canada and Vietnam. The U.K. began to introduce polymer banknotes in 2016. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T05:20:16.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
