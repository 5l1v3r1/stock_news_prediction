Specifically, the deduction on property taxes is now limited to $10,000. While that does not affect homeowners in the majority of the country, it does hit those in high-cost states like New York, New Jersey and Illinois, and those in higher-priced housing markets like California. Some have claimed that higher rates and the new tax law will put downward pressure on home prices, alleviating some of the current sticker shock, but other factors are fighting that assertion. CLOSE Owning a home is a pipe dream for many. And here is why it is on the decline. USA TODAY \"Tight credit, lack of inventory and high demand are the major factors that tell us there's no housing bubble, despite rapid price increases,\" said Redfin's chief economist, Nela Richardson. \"There are still many more buyers than the current housing supply can support, with no major relief in sight.\" Unlike during the last housing bubble in the mid-2000s, mortgage lenders today are much more strict with regard to the borrower's ability to repay the loan. They are required by new regulations in the industry to be that way. Higher mortgage rates may mean some borrowers on the margins will not qualify for the size of the loan they need or want. Mortgage rates have been quite volatile in recent weeks especially given the wide swings in the stock market. Rates loosely follow the yield of the 10-year Treasury , which moved higher again Monday. Things could change Wednesday, with the release of the monthly read on the consumer price index. \"The most informative and disconcerting reaction would be a weak CPI reading followed by a knee-jerk rally that then gives way to more selling. That would be the worst case scenario in terms of implications for the bigger picture,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily. \"Conversely, an eventual rally that follows stable or stronger CPI would suggest bonds are increasingly ready to hold their ground near current levels.\" Â© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
