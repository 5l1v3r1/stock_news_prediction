But the sector has so far steered clear of sanctions first imposed by Western nations on Russia in 2014 over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \n“While we received significant interest from potential investors, the continued market and economic volatility are not optimal conditions for an initial public offering,” Piotr Galitzine, chairman and chief executive officer of IPSCO, said in a statement. IPSCO did not elaborate further. \nTMK had said it aimed to raise between $465 million and $535 million from IPSCO’s IPO on the New York Stock Exchange by selling 23,255,813 of its shares in total at a price range of $20-$23 per share. \nIPSCO Tubulars is a producer and supplier of seamless and welded oil country tubular goods and other pipe products, with headquarters in Houston, Texas. It has manufacturing facilities in Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Nebraska and in the Canadian province of Alberta.
