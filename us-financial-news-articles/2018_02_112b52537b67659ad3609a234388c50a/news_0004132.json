[OPEC/O]\n“The OPEC compliance for January was elevated but there are real questions going forward given the outsized participation of Venezuela,” John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York, said.\nOil output in Venezuela has been declining amid an economic crisis. The country produced about 1.6 million bpd in January, according to the Reuters survey, putting its output well below what it pledged to cut.\nWhile OPEC complies with its production cut agreement, U.S. crude output surpassed 10 million bpd in November for the first time since 1970, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.\n“We expect U.S. crude oil output to grow in 2018 at nearly a million bpd more than last year. Buckle up, because the United States is on track to become the largest oil producer in the world by the end of this year,” Kessens at Tortoise said.\nAlso supporting Thursday’s crude market was a note from Goldman Sachs boosting their oil price target.\nGoldman Sachs raised its three-month forecast for Brent to $75 from $62 and its six-month forecast to $82.50 from $75.\nOil prices, however, are unlikely to advance much above $70 a barrel in 2018, given the tug of war between OPEC and the U.S. shale industry, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.\nAdditional reporting by Osamu Tsukimori in Tokyo and Amanda Cooper in London; Editing by David Goodman and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T03:51:02.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
