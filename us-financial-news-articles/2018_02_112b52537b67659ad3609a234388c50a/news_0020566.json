Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (defined below) was $.39 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating profit decreased to $22.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $55.6 million in the same period of 2016, largely due to pension settlement charges, higher operating costs as a result of an additional week in the quarter (described further below) and lower print advertising revenues, which were partially offset by higher subscription revenues. Adjusted operating profit (defined below) increased to $108.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $95.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, principally driven by strong digital subscription revenues as well as the impact of the additional week in the quarter, partially offset by higher adjusted operating costs and lower print advertising revenues.\nMark Thompson, president and chief executive officer, The New York Times Company, said, “2017 was a year marked by growth and innovation both in our groundbreaking journalism and in our thriving business. We had our best revenue growth in many years, driven by strong digital subscription revenues, which increased by over $100 million year-over-year. Subscription revenues were over one billion dollars in 2017, or 60 percent of the year’s total revenues, and is a clear sign that our subscription-first business model is proving to be an effective way to support our broad journalistic ambitions.\n“In Q4 we added 99,000 net digital news subscriptions and 157,000 total net digital-only subscriptions, with news, Cooking and Crosswords products all contributing to growth. We’re pleased with the continued rate of growth and particularly pleased to be seeing strong retention from the large group of new subscribers who came to The Times late last year. We believe there remains a large opportunity to continue to extend our subscription reach and will continue to invest in areas of the business that will allow us to achieve that growth.\n“For the full year, we grew digital advertising revenue by double-digits and saw continued challenges in print advertising, though our rate of decline moderated somewhat in the late part of 2017. Advertising now represents just one-third of our total company revenues.\n“We finished the year with more than $600 million in digital revenues, putting us well on track toward our goal of $800 million and we accomplished that just two years into the five-year plan we laid out in our 2015 strategy document, Our Path Forward.”\nComparisons\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons are for the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBecause of the Company’s fiscal calendar, the 2017 fourth quarter and year included an additional week (14 weeks and 53 weeks) compared with the 2016 fourth quarter and year (13 weeks and 52 weeks). A reconciliation of revenues, excluding the estimated effect of the additional week, to revenues including the additional week, is included in the exhibits to this release.\nThis release presents certain non-GAAP financial measures, including diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding severance, non-operating retirement costs and special items (or adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations); operating profit before depreciation, amortization, severance, non-operating retirement costs and special items (or adjusted operating profit); and operating costs before depreciation, amortization, severance and non-operating retirement costs (or adjusted operating costs). The exhibits include a discussion of management’s reasons for the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as an explanation of non-operating retirement costs.\nFourth-quarter 2017 results included the following special items:\n$102.1 million in pension settlement charges ($61.5 million after tax or $.38 per share) in connection with the transfer of certain pension benefit obligations to insurers. A $37.1 million gain ($22.3 million after tax or $.14 per share) in connection with the settlement of contractual funding obligations primarily from a postretirement plan. A $14.8 million loss ($8.3 million or $.05 per share after tax and net of noncontrolling interest) reflecting (i) our proportionate share of the loss recognized by Madison Paper Industries (\"Madison\"), in which the Company has an investment through a subsidiary, resulting from Madison's settlement of pension obligations, and (ii) a loss resulting from the sale of our 49% equity interest in Donahue Malbaie Inc. (\"Malbaie\"), a Canadian newsprint company. A $3.2 million charge ($1.9 million after tax or $.01 per share) in connection with the ongoing redesign and consolidation of space in our headquarters building. A $68.7 million charge ($.42 per share) primarily attributable to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets required as a result of recent tax legislation.\nFourth-quarter 2016 results included the following special items:\nA $21.3 million pension settlement charge ($12.8 million after tax or $.08 per share) in connection with a lump-sum payment offer to certain former employees. A $3.9 million gain ($2.4 million after tax or $.01 per share) related to the sale of assets of a paper mill operated by Madison. A $3.8 million income tax benefit ($.02 per share) primarily due to a reduction in the Company’s reserve for uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company had severance costs of $1.0 million ($0.6 million after tax or $.00 per share) and $0.6 million ($0.3 million after tax or $.00 per share) in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nResults from Continuing Operations\nRevenues\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 10.1 percent to $484.1 million from $439.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Subscription revenues increased 19.2 percent, while advertising revenues decreased 1.3 percent and other revenues increased 12.0 percent. Excluding the additional week, estimated total revenues increased 3.5 percent, with subscription revenues up 11.0 percent and advertising revenues down 6.6 percent.\nSubscription revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 rose primarily due to significant growth in recent quarters in the number of subscriptions to the Company’s digital-only products. Revenue from the Company’s digital-only subscription products (which include our news product, as well as our Crossword and Cooking products) increased 51.2 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, to $96.3 million. Excluding the additional week, estimated revenue from the Company’s digital-only subscription products increased 40.1 percent to $89.2 million.\nDigital-only subscriptions totaled approximately 2,644,000 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, a net increase of 157,000 subscriptions compared with the end of the third quarter of 2017 and a 41.8 percent increase compared with the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. Of the 157,000 additions, 99,000 came from the Company’s digital news products, while the remainder came from the Company’s Cooking and Crossword products.\nFourth-quarter digital advertising revenue increased 8.5 percent, while print advertising revenue decreased 8.4 percent. Digital advertising revenue was $84.2 million, or 46.1 percent of total Company advertising revenues, compared with $77.6 million, or 41.9 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the additional week, estimated digital advertising revenue increased 1.3 percent to $78.6 million, while print advertising revenue decreased 12.3 percent. The increase in digital advertising revenue primarily reflected increases in revenue from smartphone and branded content, partially offset by a continued decrease in traditional website display advertising.\nOther revenues rose 12.0 percent in the fourth quarter largely due to affiliate referral revenue associated with the product review and recommendation website, Wirecutter.\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $393.2 million compared with $362.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, largely due to higher marketing and compensation costs, as well as the impact from the additional week in the quarter, partially offset by lower print production and distribution costs. Adjusted operating costs increased to $375.8 million from $344.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, largely due to the impact from the additional week in the quarter, as well as higher costs from marketing, which were partially offset by lower print production and distribution costs.\nNon-operating retirement costs, which exclude special items, decreased to $1.5 million from $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower multiemployer pension plan withdrawal expense.\nRaw materials costs decreased to $17.8 million compared with $19.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, largely due to volume declines.\nOther Data\nJoint Ventures\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a special item loss of $14.8 million from joint ventures. This included (i) an $8.4 million loss, reflecting our proportionate share of the loss recognized by Madison, resulting from Madison's settlement of pension obligations (the Company’s proportionate share of this loss after tax and adjusted for the allocation of the loss to the noncontrolling interest was $4.5 million), and (ii) a $6.4 million loss resulting from the sale of our 49% equity interest in Malbaie.\nInterest Expense and Other, net\nInterest expense and other, net decreased in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $4.7 million compared with $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the repayment, at maturity, of the Company’s 6.625 percent senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company had income tax expense of $63.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $13.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to a one-time charge of $68.7 million which is primarily attributable to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets required as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, which among other impacts, reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and marketable securities of approximately $732.9 million (excluding restricted cash of approximately $18.0 million, substantially all of which is set aside to collateralize certain workers’ compensation obligations). Included within marketable securities is approximately $63 million of securities used as collateral for letters of credit issued by the Company in connection with the leasing of floors in our headquarters building. Total debt and capital lease obligations were approximately $250.2 million.\nPension Obligations\nAs part of the Company’s continued effort to reduce the overall size and potential volatility of our pension plan obligations, as well as administrative costs, the Company entered into arrangements with insurers to transfer the pension benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain pension plan participants. This transfer of obligations allowed the Company to reduce its qualified pension plan obligations by approximately $263 million. As a result of these arrangements, the Company recorded pension settlement charges of $102.1 million before tax in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company also made discretionary contributions totaling approximately $120 million to certain qualified pension plans.\nIn addition, the Company recorded a gain of $37.1 million in the fourth quarter in connection with the settlement of a funding obligation primarily in one of its other postretirement benefit plans.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the underfunded balance of our qualified pension plans was approximately $69 million, a reduction of approximately $153 million from December 25, 2016.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $104 million for the full year of 2017. The expenditures were primarily related to the ongoing redesign and consolidation of space in our headquarters building and improvements at our College Point printing and distribution facility.\nOutlook\nTotal subscription revenues in the first quarter of 2018 are expected to increase in the mid to high-single digits compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal advertising revenues in the first quarter of 2018 are expected to decrease in the mid to high-single digits compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating costs and adjusted operating costs are expected to increase in the low-single digits in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company expects the following on a pre-tax basis in 2018:\nDepreciation and amortization: $60 million to $65 million, Interest expense, net: $18 million to $21 million, and Capital expenditures: $60 million to $70 million.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company’s fourth-quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call will be held on Thursday, February 8 at 11:00 a.m. E.T.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $3.7 million ($2.3 million after tax) in connection with the same settlement.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nIn this release, the Company has referred to non-GAAP financial information with respect to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding severance, non-operating retirement costs and special items (or adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations); operating profit before depreciation, amortization, severance, non-operating retirement costs and special items (or adjusted operating profit); and operating costs before depreciation, amortization, severance and non-operating retirement costs (or adjusted operating costs). The Company has included these non-GAAP financial measures because management reviews them on a regular basis and uses them to evaluate and manage the performance of the Company’s operations. In addition, because the Company's 2017 fiscal fourth quarter and year included an additional week (14 weeks and 53 weeks) compared with the 2016 fiscal fourth quarter and year (13 weeks and 52 weeks), the Company has disclosed revenues excluding the estimated effect of the additional week in 2017. Management believes that, for the reasons outlined below, these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors as a supplement to reported diluted earnings/(loss) per share from continuing operations, operating profit/(loss) and operating costs. However, these measures should be evaluated only in conjunction with the comparable GAAP financial measures and should not be viewed as alternative or superior measures of GAAP results.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share provides useful information in evaluating the Company’s period-to-period performance because it eliminates items that the Company does not consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. Adjusted operating profit is useful in evaluating the ongoing performance of the Company’s business as it excludes the significant non-cash impact of depreciation and amortization as well as items not indicative of ongoing operating activities. Total operating costs include depreciation, amortization, severance and non-operating retirement costs. Total operating costs excluding these items provide investors with helpful supplemental information on the Company’s underlying operating costs that is used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nManagement considers special items, which may include impairment charges, pension settlement charges and other items that arise from time to time, to be outside the ordinary course of our operations. Management believes that excluding these items provides a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s operating performance and allows more accurate comparisons of the Company’s operating results to historical performance. In addition, management excludes severance costs, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, because it believes these costs do not necessarily reflect expected future operating costs and do not contribute to a meaningful comparison of the Company’s operating results to historical performance.\nNon-operating retirement costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains and loss components of pension expense; interest cost and amortization of actuarial gains and loss components of retiree medical expense; and all expenses associated with multiemployer pension plan withdrawal obligations. These non-operating retirement costs are primarily tied to financial market performance and changes in market interest rates and investment performance. Non-operating retirement costs do not include service costs and amortization of prior service costs for pension and retiree medical benefits, which management believes reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension and retiree medical benefits to its employees. Management considers non-operating retirement costs to be outside the performance of the business and believes that presenting operating results excluding non-operating retirement costs, in addition to the Company’s GAAP operating results, provides increased transparency and a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s operating business performance.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are set out in the tables below.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION (Dollars in thousands,
