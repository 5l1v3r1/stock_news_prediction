Microsoft is fourth, followed by China's Tencent and Facebook , as the six biggest companies by market cap all come from the technology industry.\nAmazon climbed 2.6 percent on Wednesday to $1451.05, while Microsoft rose 1.6 percent to $90.81.\nWith Amazon's 73 percent surge over the past year, CEO Jeff Bezos has become the world's richest person, surpassing — you guessed it — Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Still, Microsoft shares have notched a 41 percent rally in the past 12 months and the software maker remains flush with cash.\nThe two companies come from very different places, with Amazon dominating e-commerce and Microsoft owning the desktop.
