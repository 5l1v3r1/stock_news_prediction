Controversially, they have limited sentencing powers.\n“The first step is understanding and accepting that this is transitional justice and not ordinary justice,” says Mahecha, who represents young people on one of the provincial war victim committees.\n“That’s a necessary step that must be taken for any sort of justice to happen.”\nIf, and how, Colombia delivers justice and holds those responsible for war crimes is a key test for the nation, experts say, and a measure of its ability to move beyond decades of war.\nVictims’ rights groups are among those who have said that delivering justice is essential for peace, reconciliation and a chance to break the cycle of violence.\n“Justice for victims is knowing the truth,” says Mahecha. “We have to know what happened.”\nCOLOSSAL TASK Over the next decade, the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) - the judicial body responsible for the process - will sift through tens of thousands of victim testimonies, and try former rebels, military and civilians accused of rights abuses.\nThe war’s length and the number of armed groups involved means uncovering the truth and apportioning blame is a colossal task, says Mirtha Linares, president of the JEP.\nPrioritizing cases will prove key to the JEP’s success, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Those cases are likely to include forced disappearances and displacement, as well as recruitment of children into armed groups.\nColombia’s high court is currently considering whether thousands of cases of sexual violence, including rape, which all factions committed, will be tried by the JEP or be dealt with by the criminal justice system.\nIn the coming months, the JEP’s judges - more than half of whom are women - will select the cases they consider to be most representative of atrocities committed. They will aim to deliver verdicts speedily.\n“If we don’t achieve this, it not only would imply the failure of the JEP ... but, beyond that, the failure of hope that these conflicts between human beings can be solved in a peaceful way and through negotiation,” says Linares.\nThe process could reveal uncomfortable truths, including the nexus between the political elite and armed groups, she says.\n“(There is) a political class that has very serious stains of corruption, of commitments, including those with illegal armed groups like the paramilitaries and others,” Linares says.\nCRIME AND NO PUNISHMENT? For Linares the JEP is about “restorative justice”. That means an emphasis on finding the truth and providing reparations for victims, including handing back stolen land and property.\nBut many Colombians do not agree with that approach. They fear those responsible will get lenient sentences for serious violations. Human Rights Watch has echoed those concerns.\nUnder the terms of the peace deal, rebel fighters who admit to war crimes will be sentenced to between five and eight years of “alternative punishment”.\nQuite what that will mean in practice is unclear. Options could include community service, restricted freedom or house arrest.\nThose who do not confess and are subsequently found guilty could face up to 20 years in jail.\nAbout 1,750 state security forces and 3,500 demobilized rebel fighters, including former top FARC commanders, are expected to appear before the JEP.\nAmong them is former FARC rebel leader Rodrigo Londono, who heads the group’s political party. The presidential candidate pledged earlier this month that he would tell the truth.\nThe issue of justice continues to dominate heated debate ahead of presidential elections in May.\n“I feel the pressure every day,” says Linares.\nAlthough the terms of the peace deal are controversial, many victims, including Mahecha, say the JEP offers hope.\n“You have to give and take ... it would be naive to think that they (FARC) are going to pay years in jail,” says Mahecha.\nFor victims’ relatives, the JEP offers hope they can finally locate the bodies of their loved ones.\n“It’s a chance to know what happened,” says Teresita Gaviria, whose teenage son disappeared two decades ago.\nShe heads a group of mothers called Madres De La Candelaria - a collective of 1,800 relatives of the missing.\n“Justice is, at the very least, having the perpetrators recognizing and admitting to their crimes,” says Gaviria.\n“Most of us know the names of the people who killed our sons and daughters. What we want to know now is where the bodies are buried.”\nReporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Robert Carmichael.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
