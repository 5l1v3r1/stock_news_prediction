Vegas’ Marc-Andre Fleury made 29 saves to improve to 17-6-2 this season.\nAlex DeBrincat had a goal and an assist and Tommy Wingels also scored for Chicago, which saw lost for the seventh straight game (0-6-1). The Blackhawks are riding their longest losing streak since 2012, when they dropped nine in a row.\nChicago goalie Jeff Glass finished with 32 saves.\nThe Blackhawks, coming in off their most lopsided loss of the season, 6-1 on Monday night at Arizona, jumped out to a 1-0 lead after just 2:10 on Wingels’ power-play goal. With his seventh of the season, Wingels snapped a 20-game goalless drought.\nVegas tied it three minutes later when Carpenter took control of the puck behind the Blackhawks’ net and then snuck it inside the post and just under Glass’ glove.\nThe first penalty shot ever awarded against the expansion Golden Knights occurred at the 2:59 of the second period when Fleury took a loose stick in front of the goal and hurled it toward Patrick Sharp coming in from the right side of the net, sending Sharp sliding into the boards. However, Fleury made amends by stopping Sharp’s penalty shot with his left shoulder.\nThe Blackhawks took a 2-1 lead 3 1/2 minutes later when DeBrincat, stopped by Fleury on his first attempt, one-timed a pass from Sharp, who had picked up the rebound, through Fleury’s pads.\nVegas answered with three goals over a 3:40 span early in the third period. The sequence started at 1:14 with a power-play goal by Hunt, who wristed a shot from the left point that got past Glass. The goalie appeared by be screened by defenseman Connor Murphy.\nSmith then gave Vegas a 3-2 lead at 3:07 when he slapped in a William Karlsson pass from the slot over the glove of Glass. Perron followed 1:47 later with a wrist shot from the slot through Glass’ pads.\nNosek added an empty-netter with 1:16 left. It was the 17th time this season that Chicago allowed four or more goals in a game.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:16:31.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
