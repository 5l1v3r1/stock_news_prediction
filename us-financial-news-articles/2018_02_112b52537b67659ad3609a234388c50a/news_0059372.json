The case is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\nThe complaint alleges that MiMedx failed to disclose that the Company was engaged in a “channel-stuffing” scheme designed to inappropriately recognize revenue that had not yet been realized and, as a result, the Company’s financial statements were inaccurate and misleading.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 24, 2018 .
