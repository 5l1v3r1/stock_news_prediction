Corona, President and Chief Executive Officer, announced revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $1.4 billion, a 9.0% increase, or 7.3% in constant currency, compared to the corresponding quarter of 2016. Revenue for the full year totaled $5.4 billion, a 1.9% increase, or 1.3% in constant currency, compared to the prior year. For the full year, revenue comparisons are unfavorably impacted by the transfer of the APAC staffing operations to the PersolKelly Asia Pacific JV (the \"JV\") in the third quarter of 2016 after which the JV is accounted for as an equity method investment.\nEarnings from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $28.4 million, compared to $19.8 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings from operations for the full year totaled $83.3 million compared to $63.2 million in 2016.\nDiluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.45 compared to $0.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 were unfavorably impacted by $0.35 due to a non-cash, income tax charge resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted in late 2017.\nDiluted earnings per share for the full year of 2017 were $1.81 compared to $3.08 per share in 2016. Full year earnings per share for 2017 were unfavorably impacted by the $0.35 non-cash, tax charge and 2016 full year earnings per share were favorably impacted by $1.62 related to the after-tax gain on APAC JV transaction. The impact of these adjustments are more fully described in our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included on page 11.\nReflecting on the results, Corona stated, “Our fourth quarter performance reinforces that 2017 was a successful year of focus and acceleration for Kelly. We created and carried strong momentum through all four quarters, grew the top line, improved our GP and conversion rate, and increased our earnings from operations by 32% over last year — all while accelerating investments that position Kelly for long-term growth.”\nIn conjunction with its fourth quarter earnings release, Kelly Services has published a financial presentation on the Investor Relations page of our public website and will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. (ET) on February 1 to review the results and answer questions.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED)\nManagement believes that the non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) information excluding the 2016 disposal of APAC businesses, 2017 and 2016 restructuring charges, the effect of the 2017 U.S. tax law change and the 2016 gain on investment of equity affiliate is useful to understand the Company's fiscal 2017 financial performance and increases comparability. Specifically, Management believes that removing the impact of these items allows for a more meaningful comparison of current period operating performance with the operating results of prior periods. These non-GAAP measures may have limitations as analytical tools because they exclude items which can have a material impact on cash flow and earnings per share. As a result, Management considers these measures, along with reported results, when it reviews and evaluates the Company's financial performance. Management believes that these measures provide greater transparency to investors and provide insight into how Management is evaluating the Company's financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n(1) Disposal of APAC businesses represents the 2016 operational results of business contributed to PersolKelly Asia Pacific in the third quarter of 2016.\n(2) Restructuring charges in 2017 represent costs related primarily to optimizing our GTS service delivery models to deliver expected cost savings.
