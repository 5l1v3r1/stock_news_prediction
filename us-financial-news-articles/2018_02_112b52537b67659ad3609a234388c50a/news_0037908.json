Discussing Reckitt’s 2017 results Monday, Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor batted off questions about Pfizer, but delivered a scripted defense of two previous controversial U.S. acquisitions: vitamin specialist Schiff Nutrition and infant-formula producer Mead Johnson.\nReckitt Benckiser products. Photo: stephen hird/Reuters Roughly five years after the Schiff deal closed, he admitted an international expansion plan hadn’t gone as hoped, but insisted that innovations and cost savings had proved successful. It is much earlier days for the integration of Mead Johnson, which Reckitt bought last June for $16.6 billion. But Mr. Kapoor said a turnaround in the all-important Chinese baby-formula market was already under way.\nHe also raised the target for cost savings to $300 million, from $250 million. With its high operating margins and headquarters in Slough, an unflashy commuter town outside of London, Reckitt has a reputation for efficiency. Its largest shareholder is JAB Holdings, the cost-conscious German group behind Keurig Green Mountain’s $18.7 billion offer for Dr Pepper Snapple last month .\nBuying Pfizer’s brands would cement Reckitt’s strategic shift away from kitchen staples toward bathroom ones. It would also generate scale as a buttress against mounting industry pressures , notably e-commerce, which is forcing retailers to get tougher on pricing, and commodity-price inflation. The company said these would squeeze its margins this year, while insisting that consumer health has a bright future.\nInvestors seem unconvinced: Having seesawed for the past two years, the shares fell more than 7% in afternoon trading. The paradox here is that the more structurally challenged the consumer-health industry looks, the more buying Pfizer’s unit makes sense . Investors just need to be sure Reckitt hasn’t lost its touch.\nWrite to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-2330?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://djcs-olympics.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-data-charts/custom-data-chart-wsj-0.8.30.min.js", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2330?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2330?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2330?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2330?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-2330?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-02-19T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T22:55:39.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
