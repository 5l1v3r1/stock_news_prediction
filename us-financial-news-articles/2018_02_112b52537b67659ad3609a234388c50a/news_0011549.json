The companies have already announced 4,000 job cuts as part of the tie-up. \nAlthough not essential to the creation of the planned joint venture, workers’ approval to the labour agreement is seen as key to getting the deal done and shows Thyssenkrupp’s commitment to seek workers’ consent for far-reaching structural changes. \nThe joint venture still needs to be approved by Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board and Chairman Ulrich Lehner could in theory use his casting vote to get the deal through should all labour representatives be against it.
