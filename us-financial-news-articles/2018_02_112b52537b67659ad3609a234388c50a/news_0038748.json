Broadcom's revised $79.00 per share proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm, fails to take into account the strategic and financial benefits of acquiring NXP, and continues to face a long and highly uncertain path to regulatory approvals,\" the company said. \nBroadcom earlier this month upped its offer to $82 a share, or roughly $121 billion, from the initial bid of $105 billion. Wednesday's offer rounds out to approximately $117 billion. \nAny of those price tags would make a merger the most expensive in tech history, but Qualcomm and lead director Tom Horton have said it's \"just not even close to what the value of the company is.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:35:10.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
