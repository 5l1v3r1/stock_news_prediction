Kone, which competes with Thyssenkrupp’s Elevator Technology division, last month said it was looking for acquisitions to further consolidate the elevator sector. Other rivals include U.S.-based Otis and Switzerland’s Schindler. Elevator Technology is Thyssenkrupp’s most profitable unit, and some investors have called for a spin-off of the business, which had first-quarter adjusted operating profit of 220 million euros ($272 million), accounting for about half of the group’s total.
