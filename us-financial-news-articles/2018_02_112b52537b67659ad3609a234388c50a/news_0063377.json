GS -1.59% has come to Main Street.\nIn a glass-walled tower in Utah’s capital, hundreds of Goldman employees are building what amounts to one of the world’s most ambitious consumer-finance startups.\nTheir address, 111 Main St., stands as a symbol of the changes afoot inside the firm, better known as an elite adviser to big companies and billionaires. Struggling to make money in the postcrisis world , Goldman is pushing into businesses it once dismissed as pedestrian and gimmicky, assembling a suite of banking products for the middle class it hopes will power growth.\nGoldman 18 months ago began making online loans of a few thousand dollars under the brand Marcus , named after founder Marcus Goldman. Individuals once needed $10 million to get the attention of Goldman’s elite private bankers. Today, customers can open a Marcus savings account with as little as $1.\nNew initiatives under way include checkout-counter loans for shoppers, wealth management and household-budgeting tools for the masses as well as insurance, mortgages and car loans, according to people familiar with the plans.\nGoldman is scooping up financial-technology startups and pitching its bank accounts to Fortune 500 companies as an employee perk, much as they offer gym memberships or health insurance. Seeking customers, Goldman—so secretive its name doesn’t appear on its headquarters—sent out 178 million pieces of direct mail last year and bought television ads during the NFL playoffs, a first for the firm.\nIn October, it rented a Manhattan lounge and hired an improv-comedy troupe to riff on consumer debt. Guests ate truffle “macaroni and fees” and artisanal doughnuts and took home scented candles bearing Goldman’s logo.\nWallet Share Goldman expects its new consumer-banking business to make $1 billion a year in revenue by 2020. Here's how that would compare with its existing businesses: Consumer banking\n$1.0 billion\nInvesting\nand lending\n$6.2B\nTrading\n$15.2B\nAsset\nmanagement\n$7.9B\nInvestment\nbanking\n$9.0B\nSources: the company; FactSet\nThe consumer-banking push is a high-stakes bet for Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman’s CEO since 2006. A former metals salesman, he rose to power before the financial crisis by pushing Goldman’s traders into ever-riskier territory . During the crisis, the firm’s reputation took a hit when it was cast as a central villain behind the mortgage meltdown. Today, as trading profits dwindle under new regulations and market shifts , Mr. Blankfein’s legacy hinges on the firm’s ability to make money in more mundane ways.\nLast year, he called a few Marcus borrowers to thank them personally for their business. He wades weekly through customer complaints that find their way to his email inbox, forwarding the thorniest to Stephen Scherr, a former investment banker who oversees the consumer push.\n‘Project Cookie’ Marcus has lent $2.5 billion so far and has 350,000 customers across loans and savings accounts. It employs about 700 people in New York, Salt Lake and Dallas reporting to Harit Talwar, who joined in 2015 from Discover Financial Services to run the business.\n“Yes, we have ambitions,” Mr. Talwar said in an interview on the 26th floor of Goldman’s Manhattan headquarters, where a popcorn machine sits in the corner and borrower testimonials hang on the walls. He was sporting Allbirds, a knit woolen sneaker popular in Silicon Valley—the footwear equivalent of a hoodie. A sign on the conference-room door marked it as the meeting spot for “Project Cookie,” one of several code-named initiatives the Marcus team is pursuing.\n“The consumer is at the center of everything we do,” Mr. Talwar said. “If we can ease pain-points in a way that is profitable for the firm, then we will consider it.”\nThe epicenter is Salt Lake City. Two blocks from the temple of the Mormon Church, which happens to be the bank’s landlord, headset-clad customer-service representatives answer questions from small-time borrowers.\nFrom its Marcus operations in Salt Lake City, Goldman its pushing into business​​es it once dismissed as pedestrian. Photo: Briana Scroggins for The Wall Street Journal On the firm’s New York trading desks, new employees dream of being named a Goldman partner. On Main Street in Salt Lake City, they vie for “Big Bird” status, a top title on the floor earned through positive customer feedback.\nBanking giants such as Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have balance sheets and customer rolls that Goldman can’t match. Online startups face less regulation. Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have an edge in recruiting top talent and leeway from investors to enter new businesses at will.\n“We don’t take them lightly,” Discover CFO Mark Graf said of Goldman at a recent industry conference. “But we’re not tossing and turning in our beds at night.”\nRetail banking may be a simple corner of financial services, but it has tripped up firms with longer track records than Goldman. Plus, the bank is getting into consumer credit at a time when loan losses are on the rise at competitors.\nGoldman has sunk $500 million into the consumer business as it slashes costs elsewhere and struggles to boost profitability. And even if Marcus works, it will be a blip on the bottom line for years: The company projects the business will generate about $450 million in pretax income over the next three years, just 1% of what analysts expect from the firm overall.\nStill, consumer lending is more profitable than many of Goldman’s other activities, particularly trading, which can no longer rely on vast borrowings to boost returns. Goldman estimates Marcus loans will produce a return on equity in the high teens, compared with Goldman’s firmwide figure of 9.2% over the past three years. And retail deposits give Goldman more-stable funding at a lower cost than relying on loans secured by its holdings of securities.\nGoldman must learn softer skills as it works to cover crisis-era reputational bruises and put on a friendly face, or at least a friendly voice on the phone. “This is new territory,” said Darin Cline, a former Navy pilot who runs operations in Salt Lake City.\nWalking the floor in Western boots and helicopter cuff links, he ensures that calls are answered by a live person within 30 seconds. “We know we have to get this right,” he said.\nHatching a strategy The consumer business was born in the summer of 2014 in the Hamptons, according to people who were there, when a half-dozen executives gathered for a strategy session at the weekend home of Gary Cohn, Goldman’s then-No. 2 executive who later left the firm to join the Trump administration. Goldman’s revenues had been flat. New regulations and uncooperative markets had quieted its once-profitable trading operation.\nGrowing Pains Goldman is going into consumer banking in search of growth. Trading revenues have declined sharply since the financial crisis. $50\n billion\nTotal\nTrading\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n’17\n’11\n’12\n’13\n’14\n’16\n’15\n’10\n2009\nSource: the company\nAt a picnic table in the yard, the group asked: Where could Goldman grow? They landed on consumer lending.\nGoldman dominated the institutional end of finance, as an adviser to corporate CEOs and trading partner to hedge-fund managers. It ignored retail banking, which executives deemed small-time. Longtime finance chief David Viniar for years kept a toaster in his office as a reminder of Main Street gimmicks to avoid.\nBut without expensive branch networks and legacy systems, Goldman executives believed they could outmaneuver large commercial banks. Meanwhile, the firm’s $900 billion balance sheet would be an advantage over online lending startups. Those firms rely on investors to buy their loans, leaving them vulnerable when markets clam up.\nMarcus launched in 2016, offering personal loans of a few thousand dollars, primarily to refinance credit-card debt. Goldman considered names including eQuipt and Clarifi, trademarking both, before one of its executives passed by a portrait, hanging outside Mr. Blankfein’s office, of the firm’s founder, a German immigrant who in 1869 opened a one-room office on Manhattan’s Pine Street.\nNew products are coming. First up, according to people familiar with them, is “point-of-sale” credit, small loans offered to retail customers at checkout in stores and online. Shoppers borrowed $226 billion for purchases last year, charging the vast majority of it to their credit cards, according to consulting firm First Annapolis. About one-third went toward big-ticket items such as flat-screen TVs and vacations that can take months to pay off, racking up interest and other fees.\nGoldman aims to siphon off some of that business by striking partnerships with big retailers to offer Marcus loans, which charge on average about 5 percentage points less than plastic.\nA Marcus credit analyst discusses a new client's account with a fraud specialist. Photo: Briana Scroggins for The Wall Street Journal In October, the firm hired Citigroup Inc.’s head of store credit cards, who had won deals for the bank with Costco Wholesale Corp. and American Airlines Group Inc. He was given the task of finding similar partnerships for Goldman.\nThe bank is in talks with Apple Inc. to finance iPhone sales , The Wall Street Journal reported this month. It has reached out to large retailers including Amazon about extending credit for consumer purchases, and is looking for ways to lend for vacations, home furnishings and elective medical procedures, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nGoldman has also explored a mass home-mortgage business and auto lending, though it remains wary of the potential public-relations pitfalls in both markets, the people said.\nIn perhaps its most dramatic foray, Goldman is building a digital wealth-management platform that it plans to roll out this year, the people familiar with the matter said. Known as robo advisers, these tools use computer algorithms to buy and sell stocks and bonds for ultralow fees, though Goldman is likely to supplement its digital advice with human brokers, the people said.\nOn the other side of the ledger, Goldman is expanding an online savings-account business it acquired from General Electric Co. in 2016. Paying some of the highest interest rates available, it has added $8 billion to the roughly $9 billion in deposits that came over from GE. Goldman has said the business will begin offering savings accounts in the U.K. this year.\nBuilding products is one thing. Finding customers is another. Goldman sent out about as many pieces of direct mail in 2017 as Bank of America, according to Mintel Comperemedia, a research firm. It has joined with Fidelity Investments and Intuit Inc., a maker of tax-preparation and accounting software for small-business owners, to pitch loans to their users.\nAyco, a financial-planning service Goldman acquired in 2003, since last fall has built websites for 70 companies including International Business Machines Corp. and General Motors Co. that help rank-and-file employees understand and manage their finances, executives said. The goal is eventually to plug in Goldman’s wealth-management services, 401(k) offerings and other Marcus offerings, pitching them to hundreds of thousands of potential customers.\nTo build these new products, Goldman has made a flood of outside hires, many of whom don’t fit the mold of its blue-blooded bankers and traders. Marcus’s head of marketing, Dustin Cohn, spent a decade at PepsiCo Inc.’s Gatorade division and underwear retailer Jockey International Inc. The division’s chief systems architect, ex-PayPal Holdings Inc. executive Greg Berry, has a nose ring. When advised to wear a suit to a Goldman orientation session, he showed up in a purple jacket, silver bow tie and Converse tennis shoes.\nGoldman is on a shopping spree in Silicon Valley, breaking with its longstanding aversion to acquisitions. It spent around $20 million to acquire Honest Dollar, a nine-month-old 401(k) startup, in 2016, according people familiar with the deal. It is in talks to acquire Clarity Money, a personal-budgeting app, ​​for ​a price in the high eight figures, according to people familiar with the matter—an eyebrow-raising valuation for a startup that had 500,000 users as of September.\nA Marcus specialist in Salt Lake City talks with a loan applicant on Monday. Photo: Briana Scroggins for The Wall Street Journal Some engineering hires have privately grumbled about Goldman’s stuffy culture and technology limitations. When coders hired last year from a lending startup asked to use Slack, a group-messaging app popular in Silicon Valley, Goldman’s compliance team rejected the request, pointing them to a stodgier alternative, Microsoft Corp.’s Lync. Honest Dollar’s founder left last year.\nMeanwhile, some of Goldman’s investment banking clients in Silicon Valley are bristling as a trusted adviser turns into a rival. The then-CEO of LendingClub Corp. phoned Mr. Cohn—Goldman’s then-No. 2—to complain after he learned about Marcus, according to people familiar with the episode. His gripe: Goldman had taken LendingClub public—a plum assignment that gave it access to the lender’s strategies—without mentioning it was building a competitor.\nA few months after that phone call, to help build Marcus from scratch, Goldman hired a top LendingClub operations executive: Mr. Cline.\nWrite to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com and Peter Rudegeair at Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T02:36:39.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
