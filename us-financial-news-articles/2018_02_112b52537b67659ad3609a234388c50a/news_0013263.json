We can’t guarantee an end-state until it has been agreed by both sides,” Clark told BBC radio. \nBritain has agreed in principle with the EU to have an implementation period, which is expected to be finalised in March. \nBut the EU wants the power to restrict British access to the single market during the transition period as a way to punish London if it violates agreed rules, a European Commission document showed. \nThe British Chambers of Commerce said that while it would welcome a transition period, continued ambiguity as to where the relationship with the EU was headed would hinder firms as they make investment and hiring decisions. \n“Clear UK negotiating objectives are crucial to both business and public confidence,” the BCC said in an open letter to government. \n“While the BCC has campaigned strongly in favor of a status-quo transition period, to give businesses time to plan for change, this transition must lead to a clear endpoint.” \nMany businesses fear Britain could face a disorderly Brexit that would weaken the West, disrupt the peace in Northern Ireland, imperil Britain’s $2.7 trillion economy and undermine London’s position as the only financial center to rival New York.
