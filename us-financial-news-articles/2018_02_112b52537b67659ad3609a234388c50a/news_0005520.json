The Golden Eagles caught a bit of a break when Cartwright split a pair of free throws to put the Friars up three, keeping it a one-possession game with 1:02 left.\nThe Friars still led by five with 36 seconds left.\nTwo free throws from Hauser put Marquette back within three but Elliott was whistled for a foul trying to guard on the press and Cartwright made two more.\nHoward made it a two-point game when he knocked down a jumper with six seconds left and the Golden Eagles had one last chance to tie or win it when Maliek White missed two free-throw attempts.\nMarquette got the ball to Howard on the inbounds play, but Cartwright knocked it away and Providence held on for the victory.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:41:16.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
