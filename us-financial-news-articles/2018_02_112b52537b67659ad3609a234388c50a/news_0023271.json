If it is an opportunity we have to try to take it as well, but the priority remains the Premier League.” \nArsenal struggled to create real openings against Spurs at Wembley, mustering one shot on target all match, and Wenger pointed to their poor record of 15 goals on the road this season as an area of concern. \n“Today was a game we couldn’t afford to lose” Wenger added. “It makes it much more difficult now (finishing in top four), but we have to fight. There was more at stake in this game than just the derby, that’s why it is so disappointing. “(Our away record) is very poor. Football is about scoring goals, and if you look at the numbers, compared to the top six, we do not score enough goals away from home.” Editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T19:01:40.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
