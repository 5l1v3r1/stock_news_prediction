After a period of stabilization, it is then expected to climb to C$1.230 in a year.\n“Higher interest rates in Canada and good economic data should help the loonie,” said Hendrix Vachon, senior economist at Desjardins. “A reduction of recent volatility in the stock market should also help.”\nThe loonie CAD= has retreated more than 2 percent since stocks began to head sharply lower on Friday. Last week, the currency hit its strongest in more than four months at C$1.225.\nCommodity-linked currencies tend to underperform when stocks fall, because of the signal that it sends on prospects for global economic growth. Oil is one of Canada’s major exports.\nThe Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent in January, its third hike since July, judging that the economy is operating at close to capacity.\nMoney markets expect two further hikes this year but economic data will likely need to stay robust to support additional policy tightening. BOCWATCH[CA/POLL]\n“The currency will be vulnerable to any disappointment on the data front in the months ahead,” said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “Add to that the risks that linger around the next two rounds of NAFTA negotiations.”\nHe projects the loonie will fall to C$1.27 in one month but then rebound to C$1.23 in a year.\nThe United States, Canada and Mexico plan to meet in Mexico City on Feb. 26 to start the seventh round of talks to renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement. Talks are supposed to culminate in Washington in March with the final round.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if he cannot rework it in favor of the United States. The outcome is important to Canada as it sends about 75 percent of its exports south of the border.\nOther potential challenges for Canada’s economy could include the uncertain impact of tighter mortgage rules, which took effect at the start of January on a once red-hot housing market, and past rate hikes on highly indebted consumers.\nStill, the expectation the U.S. dollar .DXY will extend its 2017 losses is a major reason why some strategists are bullish on the loonie.\nThey say potential tightening of monetary policy by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan and U.S. structural headwinds - such as fiscal and current account deficits - could weigh on the greenback.\n“A weak U.S. dollar environment is positive for commodities priced in U.S. dollars,” said Eric Theoret, a currency strategist at Scotiabank. “It will be a terms of trade benefit for Canada where the price of our exports rise relative to the price of our imports.”\n(Other stories from the February Reuters global foreign exchange poll:)\nPolling by Sarmista Sen and Khushboo Mittal; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:46:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
