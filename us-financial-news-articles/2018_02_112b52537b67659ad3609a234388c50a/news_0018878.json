He did not say what that would be.\n“What are you doing to my countrymen? And if I were to do it to your citizens here, would you be happy?,” he asked.\nThe Kuwait government could not immediately be reached for comment.\nDeputy Foreign Minister Khaled al-Jarallah was last month Quote: d by Kuwait’s state news agency KUNA as saying that legal proceedings had been taken in the cases of four domestic workers mentioned by the president.\nMore than 250,000 Filipinos work in Kuwait, the Philippine foreign ministry estimates, most of them as domestic helpers. There are also large numbers in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n“Those who want to be repatriated, with or without money I will ask PAL (Philippine Airlines) and Cebu Pacific to provide the transportation,” Duterte said.\n“I want them out of the country, those who want to go out, in 72 hours. We will count our lives by the hours because apparently every hour there is suffering and agony,” Duterte said.\nHe has repeatedly expressed anger about alleged abuse in Kuwait, where he said low-paid Filipinos were made to endure rape and starvation.\nMore than 2.3 million Filipinos are documented as working abroad.\nCollectively they remit more than $2 billion of their income back to the Philippines every month, money that fuels consumer spending in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.\nReporting by Karen Lema; Editing by Martin Petty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:24:33.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
