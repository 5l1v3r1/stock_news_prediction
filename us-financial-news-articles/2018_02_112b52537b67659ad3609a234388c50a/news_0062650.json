And so we feel that by making the decision, by donating the PDR, we are essentially taking away any barrier which has been put in place,” Stephen King, a partner at Omidyar Network, said in a teleconference with the media.\nDuterte has accused Rappler of being American-owned, and suggested several times that it was a tool of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, without saying how. Rappler rejects that.\nThough the Rappler complaint was brought to the SEC last year by the solicitor-general, a Duterte ally, the government denies it is going after Rappler or trying to stifle freedom of the media.\nDuterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, said the move by Omidyar Network and Rappler was an acknowledgement that they had breached the constitution.\n“Hence, they should not have cried infringement of freedom of the press,” he said in a text message to reporters.\nRappler has challenged Duterte by questioning the accuracy of his public statements and in its reporting of his government’s deadly war on drugs and ties to bloggers who have influenced online hate campaigns against his opponents and journalists.\nRappler chief Maria Ressa insisted the transfer of the PDRs did not amount to an admission by Rappler that it had violated the law.\n“Definitely, Rappler is not giving in, and definitely we are not conceding that the SEC is right,” Ressa said in the same call, insisting Rappler is 100 percent Filipino-owned.\n“This truly gives the government a chance to prove that its actions are not politically motivated.”\nSEC chairwoman Teresita Herbosa in a text message told Reuters it was up to the appeals court to decide how, or if, the transfer of the PDRs would have any bearing on the case.\nEditing by Martin Petty and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:36:30.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
