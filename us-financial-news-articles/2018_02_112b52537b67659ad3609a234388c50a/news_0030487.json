The Wildcats shot 54.9 percent after shooting just 36.8 percent and averaging 55.4 points in their previous five games.\nOklahoma State (15-11, 5-8) fell for the fifth time in seven games, even though the two victories during that stretch were against ranked opponents, Kansas and West Virginia, on the road. The Cowboys shot just 41.5 percent and were outscored 24-15 off the bench.\nBrown, who averaged just 7.4 points in the previous five games, had a layup with 10:22 to go to put Kansas State up 59-42. Junior guard Kamau Stokes canned a 3-pointer with 9:01 remaining to complete a 7-for-9 outburst for the Wildcats and match their largest lead, 65-45. Their crisp offensive execution resulted in just eight turnovers, while they went 18-of-21 from the free throw line.\nSophomore forward Xavier Sneed added 13 points and six rebounds, while junior forward Dean Wade chipped in 12 points for the Wildcats, who came in as a Big 12 team on the bubble for the NCAA Tournament after squeaking in as a First Four participant last season.\nSenior guard Kendall Smith led Oklahoma State with 16 points. Sophomore forward Cameron McGriff, who netted a career-high 20 points in two of the Cowboysâ€™ previous three games, added 13. Senior guard Jeffrey Carroll also scored 13 and added a team-high nine boards.\nKansas State made its last eight shots of the first half when 55.6 percent shooting contributed to a 37-20 halftime bulge. Sneed led the balanced Wildcats with eight first-half points. Sneed contributed three baskets during a 19-4 surge to close the half.\nOklahoma State countered by shooting just 23.5 percent, going 8-of-34. Carroll had five points and five rebounds, both team-highs. The Cowboys had trimmed an early seven-point lead for the Wildcats to 18-16 on a bucket by Smith with 6:12 remaining.\nAfter that, Oklahoma State scored on two of its last nine possessions in spite of 10-0 rebounding advantage on the offensive glass.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:53:00.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
