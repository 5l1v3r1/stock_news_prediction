(NASDAQ:AEY), today announced its financial results for the three month period ended December 31, 2017.\n“Revenues for the first fiscal quarter of 2018 were relatively flat compared with the same period in the prior year as declines in the Cable TV segment offset improved Telco segment sales,” commented David Humphrey, President and CEO of ADDvantage Technologies. “On the Telco side, we are pleased with Triton’s performance, which generated improved revenues and gross margins year-over-year. We are also starting to see improved results from Nave Communications in recent weeks, driven by the improved sales strategy and sales organization restructuring implemented in late fiscal 2017. Looking ahead, we expect the sales and operational improvements we are making at Nave will generate higher sales and improved bottom-line results as its growth strategy continues to take effect. Although there is still more work to be done, we have confidence in Nave’s business model.\n“Sales and gross profit from the Cable TV segment were down in the first fiscal quarter of 2018, resulting from lower equipment sales as well as the loss of one significant customer in our repair business. In addition, our gross profit eroded this quarter due to a high volume of equipment sales at lower than usual margins to a single customer. Therefore, we have consolidated some of our repair facilities and are making further operational enhancements that we believe will support the efficient running of the business over the longer term.”\nMr. Humphrey concluded, “While the Cable TV segment continues to face market challenges, we are encouraged by the strengthening results from our Telco segment and believe we will be able to deliver on our overall growth strategy.”\nResults for the three months ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated sales increased 2% to $12.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $12.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales was in the Telco segment of $1.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Cable TV segment of $0.8 million.\nConsolidated operating, selling, general and administrative expenses remained flat at $3.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the same period in the prior year. This was due to higher Telco segment expenses of $0.1 million and was offset by lower expenses in the Cable TV segment.\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.1 million for the same period of 2016. The increase in the tax provision was due primarily to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. One of the provisions of this legislation was to reduce the corporate income tax rates effective beginning January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduced corporate income tax rate, the Company remeasured its deferred tax balances at the reduced corporate income tax rate, which resulted in income tax expense of $0.4 million. The Company estimates that its effective income tax rate for the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2018 will be approximately 27% as a result of the legislation.\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $0.7 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared with net income of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the same period of 2016.\nConsolidated EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $0.1 million compared with $0.8 million for the same period ended December 31, 2016.\nCash and cash equivalents were $0.4 million as of December 31, 2017, compared with $4.0 million as of September 30, 2017. The decrease in cash was due primarily to the extinguishment of one of the Company’s term loans in December 2017 by paying the outstanding balance of $2.7 million and the first annual guaranteed payment of $0.7 million related to the acquisition of Triton Miami, Inc. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had inventory of $22.4 million compared with $22.3 million as of September 30, 2017.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call today, Tuesday, February 13th, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time featuring remarks by David Humphrey, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dave Chymiak, Chief Technology Officer, Scott Francis, Chief Financial Officer, and Don Kinison, Vice President of Sales.\nThe conference call will be available via webcast and can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of ADDvantage's website, www.addvantagetechnologies.com .

EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in the table below, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
