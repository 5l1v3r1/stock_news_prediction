A bout of rain earlier in the month caused many trees to blossom, but now regular rainfall is needed for the flowers to survive and small pods to develop.\nIn the western region of Soubre, in the heart of the cocoa belt, farmers said the heat was sapping soil moisture. Data collected by Reuters last week saw just 2.3 mm of rain, 4.8 mm below average.\n“The mid-crop will yield small beans if it doesn’t rain a lot over the next few weeks,” said Lazare Ake, who farms in the outskirts of Soubre.\nHowever, in the southern region of Divo, farmers said light showers last week would still help crops resist the hot weather.\n“For the moment there have not been many losses. Trees are loaded with small pods and we hope the mid-crop will be as abundant as last year,” said Amadou Diallo, who farms near Divo.\nData collected by Reuters showed rainfall in Divo was at 4.9 mm last week, 4.7 mm below average.\nFarmers in the southern regions of Adzope, Agboville and Tiassale also remained optimistic.\nSimilar growing conditions were reported in the center-western region of Daloa, producing a quarter of Ivory Coast’s national output, where data showed 1.2 mm of rain last week, 7.9 mm below the average.\nTemperatures last week ranged between 28.35 and 32 degrees Celsius, compared to 27.9 and 31.7 degrees the previous week.\nReporting by Loucoumane Coulibaly; Editing by Sofia Christensen and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:15:12.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
