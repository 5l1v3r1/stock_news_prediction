About $500 million of that will be spend on pipelines through Alpine High.[nL4N1QC3P3]\nCowen said the E&Ps it tracks planned to spend about $66.1 billion on drilling and completions in the lower 48 U.S. states in 2017, about 53 percent over what they planned to spend in 2016.\nAnalysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week kept their forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count nearly unchanged to an average of 1,015 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019. Last week, they forecast 1,014 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019.\nThere were 978 oil and natural gas rigs active on Feb. 23. On average, there were 876 rigs available for service in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.\nReporting by Vijaykumar Vedala in BengaluruEditing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:34:19.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
