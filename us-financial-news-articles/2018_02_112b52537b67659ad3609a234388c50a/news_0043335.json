The bond was secured by a 49-percent stake in Russian Standard Bank.\nAccording to a document inviting note holders to a meeting in London, Russian Standard Ltd proposes to swap the notes for either 25 percent of the principal amount in cash, or 20 percent in cash plus a “contingent value rights option”. That option would entitle holders for five years to a cash payment linked to dividend payouts and book value.\n“(The) indicated proposal is unacceptable - no base for negotiations,” the ad-hoc group, which holds 27.5 percent of the notes, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n“(The) group will continue with the acceleration process and the enforcement of the pledged shares.”\nThe ad-hoc group consists of five parties from the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States and Switzerland. The bond has $451 million outstanding and was last bid at 20 cents in the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nEarlier in February, the creditor group had said it planned to start court proceedings and request an audit of Russian Standard Bank.
