Dortmund are second on 34 points, ahead of Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke 04 on goal difference. \nBatshuayi arrived on Wednesday on loan from Chelsea to plug the gap left by the departure of last season’s Bundesliga top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Arsenal in the Premier League. \nDortmund coach Peter Stoeger, returning to Cologne only 61 days after his sacking, gave the 20-year-old Belgium international his first start and the player paid him back when he scored in the 35th minute for the lead. Slideshow (5 Images) \nHe thought he scored again on the stroke of halftime but his effort was ruled off side after the use of the video assistant referee. \nCologne levelled on the hour when Roman Buerki cleared a shot and Simon Zoller nodded in on the rebound but Batshuayi responded only two minute later, pouncing on a defensive error to slot in. \nBottom club Cologne refused to give up and thought they had done enough to earn a point with Jorge Mere’s 70th minute header before Schuerrle unleashed an unstoppable shot into the top corner six minutes from time to earn Dortmund their first three points of 2018. \nLeaders Bayern Munich, 16 points clear at the top, travel to Mainz 05 on Saturday. Leverkusen face Freiburg while Schalke host Werder Bremen.
