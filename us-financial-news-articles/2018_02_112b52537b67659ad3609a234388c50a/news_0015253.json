You have to manage yourself.”\nMiller’s six medals, including gold in the super combined at the 2010 Vancouver Games, make him the most successful American Olympic skier in history, but the 22-year-old Shiffrin, who already has a gold of her own, could easily eclipse him.\nMILLER TIME What set her apart was not just her technique, but her physical power, according to Miller.\n“I mean, the reality is that she doesn’t beat girls by much at the top of the course... it’s really at the bottom of the course that she tends to excel and move away from everyone else,” he said.\n”I think what separates her from everyone else is her fitness, she’s able to stay at that high level all the way through to the finish, with no drop-off at all.\n“I’ve seen it a lot -- she’s good at the top, she’s good in the middle and then she crushes everybody on the bottom.”\nHaving officially retired last October, Miller is enjoying the switch from skier to broadcaster, as well as building his business interests outside of sport and taking care of his growing family.\nHis horse-breeding business is starting to mature, and with his Aztec clothing and Bomber skis, the one-time free spirit of the slopes seems to be becoming more comfortable in the boardroom.\n“I do all the normal stuff, board meetings and budgeting, marketing and manufacturing, and distribution,” he said.\n“I have four kids and I try to play golf every once in a while. It’s busy, but this is actually kind of a break, to come to the Olympics.”\nAn avid hockey fan, Miller says he expects the Americans to top the medals table, led by his former Alpine skiing team mates.\n“I think the women will have to carry us -- certainly, Lindsey (Vonn) and Mikaela are two powerhouses there. They’re capable of winning five, six, seven medals between them,” he said.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:16:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
