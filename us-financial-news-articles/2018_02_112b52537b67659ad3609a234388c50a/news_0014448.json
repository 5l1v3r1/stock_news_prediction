A report Friday showing hourly wages grew at 2.9 percent in January, a smart increase from prior readings, was a welcome confirmation of a strong economy, he said.\n\"I do not see this as a sign inflation is moving faster than I expected,\" Williams said, adding that in a healthy economy with 2-percent inflation, wages could be expected to grow at between 3 percent and 3.5 percent a year.\nWilliams, who is said to be under consideration for the position of vice chair under incoming Fed Chair Jerome Powell , said the goal of Fed restrictions announced Friday on asset growth at Wells Fargo was to make the point that \"we want the banks in the United States to be following the law and regulations, and we want to make sure that the leadership of the organizations are managing the organizations well and consistent with fulfilling their obligations.\"\nHe declined to comment further.\nWells is not allowed to grow beyond the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of last year \"until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls,\" the Fed said Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T16:57:02.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
