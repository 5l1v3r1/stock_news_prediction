Before Tuesday, Sateri had never won an NHL game. Now, the 28-year-old has won two in a row for a 2-3-0 record.\nThe Panthers got two power-play goals in a game for the first time in two months. They scored three first-period goals, tying a season best.\nBuffalo got a power-play goal from Ryan O‘Reilly and a short-handed score from Zemgus Girgensons.\nSabres backup goalie Chad Johnson (28 saves) took the loss and is 2-9-3 this season.\nBuffalo All-Star Jack Eichel did not score a goal. The Panthers are one of five teams Eichel has yet to score against in his three years in the NHL.\nPanthers All-Star Aleksander Barkov, playing career game No. 300, had no goals but one assist.\nSabres center Jacob Josefson (lower-body injury) returned after missing seven games during his third stint on the disabled list this season. Buffalo defenseman Nathan Beaulieu, who sustained a concussion on Jan. 22, remains out.\nThe Panthers’ top two goalies, Roberto Luongo and James Reimer, are set to begin practicing next week. Both are recovering from right-leg injuries.\nBuffalo opened the scoring with O‘Reilly’s power-play goal with 12:58 left in the first period. After Jared McCann was called for tripping Eichel, the Sabres went to work. Kyle Okposo centered the puck to Sam Reinhart, whose back-pass found O‘Reilly in the slot.\nFour minutes later, Florida tied the score on Yandle’s one-timer from the right circle as the Panthers took advantage of a five-on-three power play. Barkov’s assist ended a four-game points drought.\nWith 5:31 left in the first, Florida’s Nick Bjugstad won a faceoff and got the puck behind him to Matheson, whose wrist shot through traffic beat Johnson for a 2-1 Panthers lead.\nFlorida took a 3-1 lead with 1:49 left in the first. Malgin darted horizontally to the front of the net, taking a pass from Yandle and beating Johnson with a backhander.\nIn first periods this season, Buffalo has been outscored 48-23.\nBuffalo got off to a great start in the second, scoring just 32 seconds into the period. Playing on its penalty kill, Buffalo’s Johan Larsson made a centering pass from behind the Panthers goal, and Girgensons scored on a wrist shot from the deep slot.\nThe Sabres had a great chance to tie the score later in the second period, possessing the puck for four minutes, including half that time on a power play.\nHowever, the Panthers held them off, and Sceviour gave Florida insurance, providing a goal with 2:24 left in the third.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:26:08.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
