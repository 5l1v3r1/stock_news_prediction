It is not possible to have it both ways.”\n“We must not lose sight of the ultimate aim here — to build a new comprehensive partnership between the UK and the EU that sees us stay as the closest of friends and allies.”\nOn Thursday, Davis accused the EU of being “discourteous” for publishing a document that shows it has the power to restrict British access to the single market during a transition period.\nReporting By Andrew MacAskill; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T04:02:59.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
