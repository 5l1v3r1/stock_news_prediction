And we will go to court to ensure that the American people receive the compensation they deserve,” Sessions added. Sessions also said he had appointed a federal prosecutor to lead the government’s battle against the crisis and had created a task force to help. In 2016, the last year with publicly available data, 42,000 people died from overdoses for the class of drugs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Consequently, hundreds of U.S. states, counties and cities have filed lawsuits against drug manufacturers and wholesale distributors, accusing them of promoting the addictive painkillers with misleading marketing and failing to report suspicious orders.
