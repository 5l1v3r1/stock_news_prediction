Of the 131 state retirement systems covered in the report, 16 had equity allocations of 75 percent or higher, while 11 were below 50 percent. \nAs a result, the funding status of public pensions is “very reliant” on the performance of the stock market, said Yimeng Yin, a research analyst at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. And if the funds’ assumed rate of investment return, which average around 7.25 percent to 7.5 percent, is not met, state and local government budgets will be hit, he said. \n“If there’s a sustained low-return market, the government contribution will eventually rise and crowd out some other public services,” Yin said. \nPublic funds had median gains of 15.17 percent in calendar year 2017 and 9.08 percent over the past five years, Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service reported on Tuesday. \nState and local pension assets totaled $4.16 trillion in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 8.6 percent over the same quarter in 2016, according to Federal Reserve data. \nState unfunded pension liabilities hit $1.3 trillion in fiscal 2016, according to Moody’s Investors Service, and totaled $456 billion for the 50 largest local governments Moody’s rates.
