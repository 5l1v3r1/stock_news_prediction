As a result, we have seen new starts collapse, with many companies postponing or halting apprenticeships.”\nWriting by William Schomberg, editing by Andy Bruce\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T02:57:46.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
