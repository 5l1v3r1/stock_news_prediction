Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.\n“The Weinstein Company has been engaged in an active sale process in the hopes of preserving assets and jobs,” the board said in a statement, reported by newspapers including the San Francisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times. “Today, those discussions concluded without a signed agreement.”\nThe board had “no choice but to pursue its only viable option to maximize the Company’s remaining value: an orderly bankruptcy process.”\nThere was no immediate confirmation of the plan on the company’s website or Twitter feed.\nediting by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T12:28:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
