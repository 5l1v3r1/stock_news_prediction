Congo’s government denies any systematic abuses.\nRamazani’s predecessor as interior minister, Evariste Boshab, was also hit with both EU and U.S. sanctions for alleged human rights abuses by Congolese forces.\nReporting by Amedee Mwarabu; writing by Aaron Ross; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T23:08:49.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
