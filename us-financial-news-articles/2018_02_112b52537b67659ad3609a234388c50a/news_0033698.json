We will remain alert to any developing risks to financial stability.”\nPowell officially took over last week, but on Tuesday a ceremonial swearing-in was held and attended by family and friends.\nThe oath was administered by Randall Quarles, the Fed’s vice chair for financial regulation and a longtime colleague and acquaintance of the new central bank chief.\nPowell takes over the Fed after a period of relative calm in financial markets was disrupted by jitters over rising interest rates and U.S. budget deficits.\nHe did not explicitly speak about those issues in his prepared remarks or mention the monetary policy outlook for monetary policy.\nReporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:24:45.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
