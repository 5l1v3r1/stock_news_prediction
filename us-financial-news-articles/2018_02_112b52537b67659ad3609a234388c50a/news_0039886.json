(OTCQB:AERO) (\"AeroGrow\" or the \"Company\"), which is the manufacturer and distributor of the world’s leading indoor gardening systems – the AeroGarden line of Smart Countertop Gardens – announced results for the third quarter of its fiscal year, ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017 the Company recorded net revenue of $17.4 million, an increase of 31% over the same period in the prior year. Year-to-date, net revenue increased by 45% to $25.6 million. Income from operations for the quarter was $406 thousand, a slight decline from $622 thousand in the prior year period due to increased marketing expenditures. For the 9 month period, loss from operations improved to ($452) thousand from ($658) thousand in the prior year.\n“Our third quarter results continued the strong momentum we’ve been generating for the past several years,” said AeroGrow President & CEO J. Michael Wolfe. “The key takeaway from our third quarter – which included the critical holiday selling season – was that we had exceptional sell-thru results at all of our key retailers, driving our 31% overall top line growth year-over-year. Distribution successes included double-digit sell-thru increases at established accounts including Amazon.com and Bed, Bath & Beyond. We also achieved successful first year results at Kohl’s, Macy’s, Canadian Tire and Target, and solid results from established partners like Sur La Table, Walmart.com and others. Our Direct-to-Consumer business continued to show good results and we generated 200%+ growth on our Amazon platforms in Europe, albeit off of a relatively small base.\n“In addition to our strong sell-thru, our new products were very well received – particularly the AeroGarden Farm, which is our most advanced indoor garden ever with 24 pods, automatically-adjustable 120 watt LED grow lights, and 24 inches of growing height that offer our biggest and best growing experience yet. The Farm experienced exceptional sales results on our Direct-to-Consumer platform – encouraging at its greater than $500 price point. We also launched our all new Harvest Wi-Fi AeroGarden on Amazon’s Cyber Monday Deal of the Day event – and were completely sold out within just hours.\n“To help drive our double digit sales growth and build the brand for the long-term, we increased some of our marketing investments which caused a slight decline in our operating income vs. last year. Margins also declined slightly due to significantly increased sales to Brick and Mortar accounts, which are sold at lower margins. However, both our operating income and our margins were in-line with our internal plans. We had no debt as of December 31 st along with a cash balance of $2.2 million, and $9.7 million of healthy receivables.\n“There is one other matter, related to Board governance, that I would like to report. Effective March 31, 2018, Mr. Jack J. Walker and Mr. Wayne Harding will be stepping down from the AeroGrow Board of Directors. I know I speak for the entire Board and the employees of AeroGrow in expressing my deep gratitude for Jack and Wayne’s steady guidance, wisdom and support during their time on our Board. Both of these gentlemen have been instrumental in helping build AeroGrow into the company that it has become. To both Jack and Wayne: A truly heartfelt “thank you.” Nominated to take their place as independent directors on our Board will be Mr. H. MacGregor Clarke and Mr. David B. Kent. Greg Clarke formerly served as AeroGrow’s Chief Financial Officer and now holds the post of Senior Vice President & CFO for Johns Manville, a Berkshire Hathaway company. Dave Kent has an extensive background in growing consumer product companies through his experience with Proctor & Gamble Co., E. & J. Gallo Winery, and The Wine Group LLC. I’m looking forward to working with both Greg and Dave, along with the other members of our Board, in continuing to build AeroGrow in the years to come.\n“We had a terrific holiday selling season, and I believe it sets us up for continued strong growth through increased distribution, exciting new products and strong innovation. I look forward to updating you with our continued progress.”\nThird Quarter Details\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, we generated $17.4 million of total net revenue, an increase of 31.4%, or $4.1 million, relative to the same period in the prior year. Retail sales increased 37.1% to $13.4 million based upon further expansion into the housewares channel and increases in some existing and newly acquired retail accounts, including Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy’s, Home Depot and Kohl’s. Our Direct-to-Consumer sales were flat in the period due to increased competition caused by our presence at numerous other retailers and retail web sites.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, total gross dollar sales of AeroGarden units increased by 42.8% from the prior year period. Seed pod kit and accessory sales increased by 5.8% over the prior year period, as our established base of AeroGardeners continues to grow. AeroGarden sales net of allowances represented 87.8% of total revenue, as compared to 84.9% in the prior year period. This percentage increase, on a product line basis, was attributable to increased retail sales, which tends initially to favor garden sales over seed pod kit or accessory sales, especially during the high demand holiday season. Seed pod kit and accessory sales decreased as a percent of the total to 12.2% from 15.1% due to the increased sales of AeroGardens this quarter. However, as noted above, total dollar sales increased $116,000.\nThe Company continues to spend advertising dollars in order to strategically build market awareness and enhance initiatives implemented in the prior year. For Fiscal 2018, we intend to expand consumer awareness of the AeroGrow brand and product line. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we spent $3.6 million in advertising expenditures, a $982,000, or 37.4% year-over-year increase compared to the same period ended December 31, 2016.\nOur gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 34.1%, down from 36.6% in the prior year period. This decrease was attributable to the following factors, each of which carry lower margins: (1) shift in retailer mix and product mix which both have different margins and are also dependent on whether we are selling online or in stores; (2) an increase in retail sales, relative to our direct-to-consumer sales; (3) and the introduction of new retail accounts, as compared to existing retail accounts; and; (4) expansion into the European market, which entails certain supply chain and logistical challenges. This decrease was partially offset by the introduction of new products with higher margins.\nIn aggregate, our total operating expenses increased 30.9%, or $1.3 million, year-over-year, principally to support general advertising and media in order to further develop the brand and in anticipation of current and future revenue growth.\nBecause the increase in sales was offset by the increase in general advertising and media, our operating profit was $406,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to an operating profit of $622,000 in the prior year period.\nForward-Looking Statements\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements by J.
