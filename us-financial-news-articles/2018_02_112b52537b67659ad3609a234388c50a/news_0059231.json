That followed a 0.8 percent bounce last week.\nIt also retreated on the yen to reach 106.61, failing to hold an early 107.28 top.\nThe euro was hovering at $1.2305 and just above last week’s trough at $1.2258, with bulls cautious ahead of the outcome of the Italian general election on March 4.\nA German Social Democrats’ poll of its members on joining another coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives is also due that day, two big political risk events for markets.\nIn commodities, the lapse in the dollar helped spot gold bounce 0.5 percent to $1,335.36 per ounce.\nOil prices were underpinned by the shutdown of the El Feel oilfield in Libya and upbeat comments from Saudi Arabia that an OPEC-led effort to cut stockpiles is working.\nU.S. crude futures added 8 cents to $63.63 a barrel, while Brent futures eased 2 cents to $67.29.\nEditing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T12:26:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
