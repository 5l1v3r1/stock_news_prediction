A recent strengthening in inflation data have helped convince many in financial markets that the Fed will need at least three rate hikes in 2018 to prevent the economy from overheating.\nIn his prepared remarks, Harker made no mention of the recent inflation data, nor of the tax cuts that some view as fueling faster price rises.\nSticking closely to a view he laid out earlier this year, Harker said he expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.5 percent this year before slowing to 2-percent growth next year and to below 2 percent in 2020.\nUnemployment, he forecast, will fall from 4.1 percent now to 3.6 percent by the middle of next year before rising back up a few tenths of a percentage point, while job growth will remain strong.\nAnd inflation, while still below the Fed’s 2-percent goal, should meet or exceed that objective by the end of 2019, he forecast.\n“The Fed’s mantra is data dependent, and for now, the data continue to tell me two (rate hikes) is the likely appropriate path,” said Harker, who does not have a vote on the Fed’s policy-setting committee this year but who takes part in the panel’s regular meetings.
