This is justified in the United States... but it is less justified in the euro zone, where interest rate levels seem excessive,” Natixis strategists said.\n“This correction is a buying opportunity,” they added.\nAfter a strong 2017, European shares rallied in January to reach their highest level in around 2 years on expectations that economic growth would boost company profits. February’s pull back has pushed the STOXX 600 7 percent below the January peak.\nAmong the top fallers on Tuesday were Ocado ( OCDO.L ), down 6.6 percent, after the British online supermarket missed forecasts with flat full-year core earnings, while Babcock ( BAB.L ) declined 2 percent after lowering its revenue forecasts.\nAmong the biggest sectoral fallers were banks .Sx7P and auto .SXAP stocks which had benefited the most from the rally seen at the start of the year.\nAmong the few stocks in positive territory, AMS ( AMS.S ) jumped 12.2 percent after the chipmaker reported a surge in fourth-quarter profit as the Austria-based group benefited from rising demand for the sensors it makes for smartphone producers such as Apple ( AAPL.O ).\nIntesa Sanpaolo ( ISP.MI ) rose 1.7 percent after Italy’s biggest retail bank pledged to halve its soured loans and grow revenue strongly while cutting costs under a new four-year plan. Traders said the market welcomed Intesa’s dividend plans.\nElsewhere, BP ( BP.L ) and BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) were lower after their earning updates.\nRelated Coverage Europe's stocks volatility sees biggest spike since September 11 attacks Reporting by Danilo Masoni; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T10:57:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
