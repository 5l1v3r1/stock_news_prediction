(NASDAQ: POWL), a leading supplier of custom engineered solutions for the management, control and distribution of electrical energy, today announced results for the fiscal 2018 first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $90.2 million compared to revenues of $110.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company reported a net loss for the first quarter of $5.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nBrett A. Cope, Powell's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Our first quarter 2018 results reflect backlog challenges that carried over from fiscal 2017, both in terms of reduced volumes and poor price quality. The quarter was supported by emergency response work that we completed following Hurricane Harvey, utilizing resources across the U.S. and Canada to help customers restore damaged facilities.\n\"Customer sentiment in some of our end markets continues to show signs of improvement. Although smaller in size and scope, we are seeing an increase in the number of opportunities for facility upgrade projects. Planning around larger projects continues, but the timing remains uncertain.\"\nNew orders placed during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $100 million compared to $112 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and compared to $91 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company's backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $260 million compared to $250 million as of September 30, 2017 and compared to $271 million at the end of last year's first quarter.\nOUTLOOK\nAs previously reported, Powell expects to report a net loss in fiscal 2018. However, the Company estimates its second half fiscal 2018 performance to show an improvement over the first half provided that new customer orders continue to improve as anticipated.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nPowell Industries has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, February 7, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
