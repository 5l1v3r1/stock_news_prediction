Ottawa will release its specifications next year, at which point firms can bid.\nBoeing did let Canada know it was interested, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The decision does not mean the firm will necessarily put forward its F-18 Super Hornet.\nBoeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFILE PHOTO: The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the \"What's Next?\" conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo The U.S. aerospace company infuriated the Canadian government last year by launching a trade challenge against planemaker Bombardier Inc <BBDb.TO, accusing it of dumping airliners in the American market.\nAlthough a U.S. trade commission dismissed the complaint on Jan. 26, Boeing can still appeal the decision or launch another complaint against the Canadian firm.\nWell-informed sources said last week Ottawa has made clear to Boeing that its chances of winning the 88-jet deal would be harmed if it pursued the Bombardier case.\nDefense experts say Lockheed Martin Corp’s ( LMT.N ) new F-35 stealth fighter is likely the front runner. Dassault Aviation SA ( AVMD.PA ) and Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ) also are expected to compete, but with planes that first flew in the 1990s.\nOttawa says bids will be evaluated in part on the basis of “past and recent economic behavior of potential bidders leading up to the procurement.”\nThat test is months away from being finalised, meaning Boeing has no idea whether Ottawa would be satisfied if it did drop the challenge, the sources said.\nAdditional reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T21:45:59.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
