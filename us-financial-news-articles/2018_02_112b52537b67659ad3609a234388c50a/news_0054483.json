This is indicative of great confidence.”\nBrazil’s Finance Ministry said in a statement the government remains committed to its macro and microeconomic reform agenda, although it did not mention pension reform.\nThe country’s sovereign debt currently has a healthy composition with low exposure to foreign exchange risk, a low concentration of maturities in the near term and a diverse investor base that reduces inherent risks, the ministry said.\nBrazil lost its investment-grade rating in 2015 just as the country was heading into a two-year recession with the government of then-President Dilma Rousseff failing to rein in a ballooning budget deficit.
