Alternatively, if the Fed fails to act fast enough and falls behind the curve on policy, it could end up pushing up long-term bond yields. In either scenario, traders worry that U.S. economic growth could be hampered.\nThere were some indications such fears are beginning to subside, with the MSCI’s all-country world index rising 1.2 percent.\n“I think markets will remain shaky until (Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome) Powell’s congressional testimony on Feb. 28. Markets will try to test him until they hear his thinking,” said a trader at a U.S. bank.\nThe South African rand gained 0.1 percent to trade at 11.91 rand to the dollar after reports the ruling African National Congress party executive committee had decided to remove President Jacob Zuma as head of state.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets\nAdditional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in TOKYO; editing by John Stonestreet\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T20:36:07.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
