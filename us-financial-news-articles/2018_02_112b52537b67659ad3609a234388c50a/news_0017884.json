Kerimov has denied the prosecutors’ allegations, Russian media have reported. \nKerimov was arrested at Nice airport in the south of France in November last year. A judge said he could be released while his case is being investigated, but he would have to seek permission to travel outside the Nice region. \nJean-Michel Pretre, the Nice prosecutor, told Reuters that Kerimov has asked to go back to Russia for personal reasons. The prosecutor did not specify the dates or whether Kerimov had already left France but said prosecutors had no objections for the trip. \nA representative for Kerimov in Russia’s upper house of parliament, where Kerimov is a lawmaker, did not reply to a Reuters request for a comment. Both Dmitry and Alexei Ananyev declined to comment on the talks. \nThe two sources, and a third banking source, said that Russian pension fund Blagosostoyanie was another contender to buy Vozrozhdenie. \nLast week, Vozrozhdenie published a list of candidates for its board of directors that included the name of Yury Novozhilov, executive director of Blagosostoyanie. The list was later withdrawn. \nBoth Blagosostoyanie and Vozrozhdenie did not reply to a Reuters request seeking a comment. VTB, Russia’s No.2 bank, last month publicly expressed its interest in buying Vozrozhdenie.
