She was most recently its chief business affairs and legal officer.\nJohnson’s responsibilities will include overseeing Airbnb’s legal, policy and communications teams, Chesky said. Her appointment follows the addition of Airbnb’s first independent board director, outgoing American Express CEO Ken Chenault, announced last week.\nAlthough such changes are consistent with startups preparing to go public, Chesky said that Airbnb is “not going public in 2018.”\nHe said the company is profitable and has a $5.5-billion balance sheet.\nFounded in 2008, Airbnb is in close to 200 countries and valued at $31 billion. It has clashed with hoteliers and authorities in cities including New York, Amsterdam, Berlin and Paris, and has been criticized for exacerbating housing shortages in already tight markets.\nAirbnb also said on Thursday its chief financial officer, Laurence Tosi, would leave the company to work full-time at his investment fund, Weston Capital Partners. Airbnb has enlisted a search firm to find his replacement. Airbnb’s head of financial planning, Ellie Mertz, will fill in as interim head of finance.
