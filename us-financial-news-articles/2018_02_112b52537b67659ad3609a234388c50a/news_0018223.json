That, however, was still well below a peak of 1.83 million in 2011.\n“Kenya grew stronger in 2017 as a destination brand following positive visibility... This was achieved despite a busy electioneering season that threatened to slow down tourism activities,” Balala said.\nThe Supreme Court nullified the results of the Aug. 8 presidential election, forcing a repeat poll on Oct. 26 that was boycotted by the opposition.\nReduced attacks by the Somali militant group al-Shabaab has helped boost tourism. Visitor numbers and tourism earnings fell between 2012 and 2015 following a spate of attacks claimed by al-Shabaab.\nBalala said the sector is expected to improve further this year, helped by bigger investment and marketing of key attractions.\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta’s government wants to bring in 3 million visitors a year, according to a manifesto published when Kenyatta was first elected in early 2013.
