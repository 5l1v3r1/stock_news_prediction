The FTSE 100 company has British and U.S. defense contracts and employs more than 56,000 people worldwide, including about 6,000 in Britain.\nGKN, which makes parts for the Boeing 737 jet, Black Hawk helicopter and components for Volkswagen and Ford cars, said its plan to separate its aerospace and automotive divisions is expected to deliver a 340 million pound recurring annual cash benefit from the end of 2020.\nAll of that benefit would be passed on to GKN shareholders, Turner added in the letter.\nGKN pledged on Wednesday to return 2.5 billion pounds to investors over the next three years, stepping up its efforts to fend off the hostile bid.\nMelrose made a firm offer to buy GKN on Jan. 17, valued at 430.1 pence per share or 7.4 billion pounds, which GKN swiftly rejected. The offer consists of 1.49 new Melrose shares and 81 pence in cash for each GKN share.\n‘ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT’\nLater on Thursday Melrose said that Turner’s letter to GKN’s shareholders did not change Melrose’s stance on the offer.\n“Today’s document from GKN is another attempt to distract from the real issue,” Melrose Chairman Christopher Miller said in a market announcement, adding that Melrose would not cut corners in making necessary investment into GKN businesses.\nMelrose said it would respond to GKN shareholders in detail in due course.\nMelrose -- the business model of which is to buy engineering companies, improve their margins and resell them -- already owns diversified manufacturer Nortek and the Brush electricity generating equipment business.\nIt has some experience of aerospace after buying McKechnie, a manufacturer of aerospace components, and Dynacast, which makes small precision components, in 2005. It sold its aerospace and aftermarket businesses in 2007.\nHitting back at Melrose, Turner said GKN is six times the size of Melrose’s largest previous acquisition, adding that the Melrose board lacks relevant experience at board level in several critical areas.\nTurner reiterated GKN’s recommendation to shareholder to take no action in relation to the Melrose offer, saying the bidder is more focused on financial engineering than real engineering.\nGKN shares were up 1.9 percent at 419 pence by 1302 GMT.\n($1 = 0.7117 pounds)\nReporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Ben Martin; Editing by David Holmes and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T10:22:57.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
