It is a bigger version of the A350-900,” Jaime Bautista, president of the airline’s operator, PAL Holdings Inc, told reporters before an A350-1000 test flight in the capital Manila.\nThere is commonality in spare parts between the A350-900 and the A350-1000 and Philippine Airlines’ pilots can fly both aircraft, Bautista added.\nIn 2016, Philippine Airlines ordered six wide-body A350-900 jets worth about $1.8 billion at list prices to help the company expand its lucrative international network. The flag carrier expects to take delivery of 15 planes this year, including four Airbus A350s.\nThe A350-1000 is the largest version of the A350 series, and was launched to compete against Boeing’s 777s in the up to 400-seat market. Airbus will deliver this month the first A350-1000 jet to an airline, Qatar Airways.\nPhilippine Airlines expects to carry about 16.5 million passengers this year, up from last year’s total of almost 15 million.\nReporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T14:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T10:34:43.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
