Nurettin Canikli, in a briefing to reporters in Brussels after meeting with the U.S. Defence Secretary, also said he disputed Mattis’s characterization of the SDF as dominated by Arabs, saying the militia was completely controlled by the YPG. His comments were broadcast live on television in Turkey.
