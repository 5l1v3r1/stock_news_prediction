Live cattle exports had grown to be worth more than $1.5 billion, the ministry said in its statement, without giving a timeframe for that figure.\nSunday’s shipment had left port and was headed to Turkey, according to a spokesman for Minerva SA, the Brazilian meatpacker that sold the animals to an unnamed client in that country. The journey generally takes 16 days.\nOriginally 27,000 head were supposed to be shipped on Feb. 1, but the delay led to some being left behind, the Minerva spokesman said.\nReporting by José Roberto Gomes and Ana Mano; Writing by Ana Mano; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T23:27:53.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
