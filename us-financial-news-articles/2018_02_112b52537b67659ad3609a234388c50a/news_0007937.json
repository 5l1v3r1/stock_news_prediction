The four largest banks were the biggest weights on the index, pulling it down by 21 to 37 points. \nMirroring the benchmark index, the financial index clocked its biggest intraday percentage drop since November 2016. \nMacquarie Group, the country’s largest investment bank, fell to a more than one-month low despite forecasting a record profit for fiscal 2018. \nMaterials were also lower, with the Australian metals and mining index losing about 2.3 percent. Global miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto weighed the index down a total of 56 points. \nMetal prices rose slightly, with a few gold miners such as Gold Road Resources and Beadell Resources rising tracking the precious metal. \nConsumer stocks were also down. Data showed Australian retail sales in December dropped 0.5 percent month-on-month, more than the 0.2 percent decline forecast in a Reuters poll. \nIn New Zealand, markets were closed for a public holiday.
