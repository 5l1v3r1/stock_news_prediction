By the end of this year, it might also overtake Russia to become the global leader.\"\nU.S. crude output could reach 11 million bpd by the end of this year, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with other exporters such as Russia, have agreed to maintain a joint restriction on crude supply for a second year running in 2018, to force inventories to drain and support prices.\nOil inventories across the world's richest nations fell by 55.6 million barrels in December to 2.851 billion barrels, their steepest one-month drop since February 2011, the IEA said.\nFor 2017 as a whole, inventories fell by 154 million barrels, or at a rate of 420,000 bpd. By the year-end they were only 52 million barrels above the five-year average, with stocks of oil products below that benchmark, the IEA said.\n\"With the surplus having shrunk so dramatically, the success of the output agreement might be close to hand. This, however, is not necessarily the case: oil price rises have come to a halt and gone into reverse, and, according to our supply/demand balance, so might the decline in oil stocks, at least in the early part of this year.\"\nOil production outside OPEC nations fell by 175,000 bpd in January to 58.6 million bpd, but was still 1.3 million bpd higher than January last year, predominantly because of the 1.3-million-bpd year-on-year increase in U.S. output.\nOPEC output was largely steady at 32.16 million bpd in January and compliance with the supply deal reached 137 percent, due in part to declines in Venezuela, where economic crisis has paralysed much of the country's oil production capacity.\nThe IEA estimates demand for OPEC's crude in 2018 will average 32.3 million bpd, after dropping to 32.0 million in the first quarter of the year.\nThe IEA said oil prices, which briefly touched a high of $71 a barrel in January, could be supported even if U.S. production rises, provided global growth remains strong, or if unplanned supply outages persist.\n\"If so, most producers will be happy, but if not, history might be repeating itself,\" the IEA said.\n(Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Dale Hudson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T11:13:22.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
