Organic sales, which exclude the impact of the company’s ongoing efforts to refranchise its bottling operations, rose 6 percent, helped by demand for products such as Georgia Coffee and Glaceau vitamin water. Net operating revenue fell to $7.51 billion from $9.41 billion a year earlier, but beat the average analyst estimate of $7.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global volume growth remained unchanged even as North America volumes increased 1 percent. The Fanta and Diet Coke maker reported a net loss of $2.75 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to a $3.6 billion charge related to the new tax law. A year earlier the company had posted a profit of $550 million, or 13 cents per share. ( bit.ly/2Eyyffi ) The company’s margins improved by 3.15 percentage points, largely due to divestitures of lower-margin bottling businesses. On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings per share of 39 cents, beating analysts’ average estimate of 38 cents.
