The Celtics had won four straight and five of six following a season-worst, four-game skid.\n“I think both of (these) franchises have been focused on winning championships, so a game in February is not going to make or break anybody’s season,” Toronto’s Fred VanVleet said after the pregame shootaround. “But obviously when you get a 1-2 matchup, you want to go out there and put your best foot forward.”\nVanVleet finished with 10 points and a team-high eight assists. Lowry grabbed eight rebounds while DeMar DeRozan added 15 points and Delon Wright had 14 for the Raptors.\nIrving had missed three games with a right quad contusion. Terry Rozier, who had started in place of Irving, paced the Celtics with 18 points and Marcus Morris had 12 in his return from a hip injury.\nAl Horford, the Celtics’ second All-Star alongside Irving, was held to two points on 1-of-5 shooting. He pulled down six boards.\nBoston hung around early and trailed 22-18 after one quarter, but the Celtics were outscored 36-19 in a pivotal second quarter. The Raptors led by as many as 29 points in the contest.\nBoston’s Aron Baynes left the game with a head injury but passed the NBA’s concussion protocol to become eligible to return in the second half. Baynes finished with six points and eight boards.\nToronto caps a four-game homestand Thursday against New York. Boston wraps up a quick two-game trip Thursday in Washington.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:54:07.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
