The transaction, at $932.4 million, is the second largest CRE CLO to be issued post crisis.\nThe transaction will initially be collateralized by 26 commercial mortgage loans, comprised of 25 non-controlling participations (96.1%) and one whole loan (3.9%), secured by a total of 63 properties. Together, these assets (along with the related non-trust companion participations) represent a total committed balance of $2.1 billion. In aggregate, the non-trust companion participations consist of $883.9 million of funded participations in 23 loans (89.0%), and $275.1 million of unfunded future funding commitments that relate to 19 loans (80.5%). Throughout the life of the securitization, the transaction’s principal proceeds can be used to purchase eligible funded companion participations.\nKBRA’s analysis of the transaction involved a detailed evaluation of the underlying cash flows using our CMBS Property Evaluation Methodology and the application of our US CMBS Multi-Borrower Rating Methodology. The results of the analysis yielded KNCF for the underlying collateral properties that were, on average, 11.8% and 21.0% less than the issuer as-is and stabilized net cash flow, and KBRA property values that were 40.6% and 52.0% lower, on average, than the as-is and stabilized third party appraisal value. The resulting KBRA in-trust Loan to Value (KLTV) was 124.9%.\nFor complete details on the analysis, please see our pre-sale report, TRTX 2018-FL1 at www.kbra.com .\nRatings Assigned: TRTX 2018-FL1\nClass of Notes Balance Subordination PIKable\nExpected KBRA\nRating\nStated Maturity Date A $491,831,000 47.250% No AAA (sf) February 2035 A-S $72,259,000 39.500% No AAA (sf) February 2035 B $55,943,000 33.500% No AA- (sf) February 2035 C $52,446,000 27.875% Yes A- (sf) February 2035 D $73,425,000 20.000% Yes BBB- (sf) February 2035 E $37,295,000 16.000% Yes BB- (sf) February 2035 F $37,296,000 12.000% Yes B- (sf) February 2035 Preferred Shares $111,885,182 0.000% N/A NR\nNAP\nAll Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are required, pursuant to SEC Rule 17g-7, to provide a description of a transaction’s asset level representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms that are set forth in the offering document when issuing credit ratings.
