Emaar Malls, another unit, reported a 27 percent rise in fourth quarter profit to 574 million dirhams.\nEmaar Properties is part of a joint-venture building The Tower in Dubai, which it has said would be the world’s tallest tower, outdoing the more than 160-storey Burj Khalifa, built by the developer.\nThe Tower at Dubai Creek Harbour is scheduled to be completed in 2020.
