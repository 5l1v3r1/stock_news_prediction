Investors should pay attention to the price of admission.\nThe unit of China’s largest search engine Baidu has filed to list on the Nasdaq in what could become one of the biggest technology IPOs this year. Analysts have valued the company at up to $17 billion, and iQiyi says it is looking to raise up to $1.5 billion.\nThat looks a punchy price tag considering iQiyi hasn’t yet turned an annual profit. Analysts are instead valuing the company based on revenue, with Jefferies, for example, using a multiple of four times iQiyi’s expected sales this year. It is also much higher than its $2.8 billion valuation less than two years ago, when Baidu tried to unload iQiyi to a group led by its Chairman Robin Li. That sale was scrapped after Baidu investors complained the sale price was too low.\nTo justify the higher valuation now, iQiyi will need to convince investors it can keep growing fast and more profitably. Neither is a given.\nSure, iQiyi has demonstrated impressive subscriber growth in the past year. Having started off as something like YouTube, the company has ramped up its original content in the past couple of years to become more like Netflix. It now has 50.8 million subscribers—a 68% rise from 2016 although still less than half of Netflix’s 118 million.\nOne problem is that iQiyi earns much less per subscriber than its U.S. counterpart: Its subscription revenue in 2017 was only $1 billion, less than a 10th of Netflix’s, with more than half of iQiyi’s sales coming from advertising. Moreover, iQiyi has had to spend a lot on producing the content to draw in those new subscribers—it reported an operating loss of $608 million in 2017, 42% deeper than the previous year.\nAnd while iQiyi might seem to have plenty of room to grow its subscriber base in a country of more than 1 billion people, it faces tough competition from rival services run by Chinese technology giants Alibaba and Tencent. Currently iQiyi is competing neck-and-neck with Tencent while Alibaba’s Youku Tudou isn’t far behind in terms of monthly active users.\nTech-plus-China often appears a blockbuster for investors. In the case of iQiyi, closer viewing is advised.\nWrite to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T16:58:17.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
