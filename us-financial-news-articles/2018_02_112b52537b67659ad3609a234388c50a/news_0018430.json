We do not fix the path of interest rates in advance. What is fixed is our remit and rates change with the economy.” \nBritain’s economy slowed after the 2016 Brexit vote but has fared better than many investors expected at the time of the referendum, thanks largely to a strong rebound in the United States, Germany and other key trading partners. \nBroadbent said he thought the surge in stock market volatility this week reflected the fact that investors had not properly priced in the possibility that stronger economic growth can also generate inflation pressures. \nOn the outlook for Britain’s economy, Broadbent said he thought income growth in real terms would return in the current quarter and that inflation was now pretty close to its peak. \n“My guess is what’s happening right now in the first quarter, I think (household real incomes) are starting to rise,” he said. \n“The pass-through from higher import prices is probably at its peak right now and we are starting to see wage growth improve.” Reporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by Kim Coghill", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T09:13:58.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
