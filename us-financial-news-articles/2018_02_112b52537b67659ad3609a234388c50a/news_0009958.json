Under its terms, judges will no longer be granted special privileges if they are facing arrest.\n“Certain rights will be restricted (but) general movements, services and businesses will not be affected,” the president’s office said in a statement about the emergency.\n“The government of Maldives wishes to also assure all Maldivians and the international community that the safety of all Maldivians and foreigners living in and visiting the Maldives, will be ensured,” it said.\nEva Abdulla, an opposition legislator said the latest declaration of State of Emergency “is an indication of President Yameen’s desperation”.\n“It only serves to show an isolated man who no longer has the confidence of the Maldivian people and independent institutions. He has no democratic mandate to govern and must resign immediately,” she said in a statement.\nReporting by Mohamed Junayd; Writing by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T18:17:02.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
