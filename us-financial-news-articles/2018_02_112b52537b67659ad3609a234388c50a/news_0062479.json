REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/Files BASF, which last month reported a 2017 operating profit up 32 percent, issued divisional results on Tuesday which showed that specialty products, something the company is looking to for growth, underperformed.\nMorgan Stanley analysts said its performance in specialty products was “a little disappointing”.\nHelping, however, were profit margins at its commodity chemicals unit which rose to close to 26 percent of sales in 2017, almost double their average over the previous five years, mirroring similar developments at rivals such as Covestro.\nBASF and its rivals are ramping up output capacity, most notably for chemicals used in building insulation or furniture, which will likely ease supply shortages.\nBASF also aims to overcome the weakness at its advanced and customised products, such as food nutrients, ingredients for household products or engineering plastics.\n“The downstream segments in 2018 clearly need to improve their performance,” said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz.\nBASF also said its Wintershall oil and gas division, which it is seeking to merge with Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s DEA, should help raise profits this year helped by a strong oil price.\nEditing by Maria Sheahan and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T11:00:52.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
