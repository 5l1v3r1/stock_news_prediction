The country’s securities regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), did not respond to a request for comment.\nAsia has become the world’s biggest oil consumer, and China hopes its own derivative crude contract will better reflect market conditions in the region.\nMost oil trades are priced off two crude derivatives, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and London’s Brent, and executed mainly on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group and the Intercontinental Exchange .\nThe creation of the yuan-denominated contract, which will be open to Chinese and overseas investors, was originally expected about six years ago, but has run into delays as turmoil in China’s stock markets and other commodity futures raised concerns about its capacity to handle financial turbulence.\nThe proposal was put on the backburner early last year. Potential international participants worried they would not be able to freely exchange the yuan currency given a Chinese clampdown on capital outflows, and were concerned at Beijing’s heavy handed intervention in its commodity markets.
