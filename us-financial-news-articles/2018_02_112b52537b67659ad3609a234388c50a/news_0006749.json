We have to think game by game, we are playing well and improving.” Slideshow (11 Images) \nRamos, making his first league appearance since Dec. 23 when Madrid were crushed by Barcelona in the Clasico, opened the scoring with a header which earned him the individual record of being the first defender to score in 14 consecutive seasons. \nHowever his day soon soured when he was booked for an elbow on Boateng and then played Morales onside for Levante’s equaliser.

It paid dividends when Karim Benzema set up the Spaniard to fire home, before Pazzini put Levante level again.
