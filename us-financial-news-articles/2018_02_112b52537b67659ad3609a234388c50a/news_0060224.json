We can’t remain silent. Silence is complicity,” she said.\nThe laureates called for those responsible to be brought before the International Criminal Court.\n“With over a million Rohingya displaced, countless dead or missing, and rape and sexual violence being used as a weapon of war, it is well past the time for the international community to act,” said Iranian lawyer Shirin Ebadi, who in 2003 became the first Muslim woman to win the peace prize.\nReplying to a question, Karman said the three planned to visit Myanmar and they had sent several messages to their friend Suu Kyi but she had not replied.\n“We need to see what’s happening there.”\nReporting by Ruma Paul\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T14:42:58.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
