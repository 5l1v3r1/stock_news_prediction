If we can get a bounce off that area, that would suggest to us we have the possibility to work higher, but it would suggest the sideways consolidation period could continue,\" said Brian LaRose, technical analyst at United-ICA.\nThe monthly U.S. jobs report on Friday showing the fastest wage growth in nearly nine years exacerbated a broader market selloff that was already under way as European stocks backed off record highs and a rising dollar dented commodities prices.\nWall Street's three major indexes logged their biggest weekly losses in two years on Friday after the strong payrolls report.
