The group ended their night at Playroom, a nightclub in Inwood, where Jay ordered 40 bottles of Ace of Spades champagne. \nAlthough Jay-Z owns the brand , he paid full price for the bottles, racking up a bar tab of $80,035. With an included 15 percent gratuity of $11,100, his total came to $91,135. \nA representative for Jay-Z did not immediately return CNBC Make It's requests for comment.

So when they come up to the table, I say, 'The quicker I get my order, the bigger your tip will be.' And then the food will come fast. Then, when we're getting ready to leave, I'll ask them: 'How much do you want?'\" \nVenture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya tips well too. He leaves 100 percent unless he had bad service, he tells CNBC on \" Squawk Box .\" \n\"If it's bad service, no, but most of the time [I tip 100 percent]. Because they just have such joy on their face and it's wonderful,\" says the sharp investor, whose early investments include Slack, Box and SurveyMonkey. \"Look, I got lucky, so I feel like I should just pay it forward.\" \nDon't miss: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T23:27:55.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
