REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser/File Photo “The bridge is starting to reverse,” Khatib said, referring to the causeway linking Saudi Arabia with more liberal Bahrain where many Saudis flock for weekend getaways.\n“And I promise you that we will reverse this migration, and people from Dubai, Kuwait and Bahrain will come to Saudi.”\nThe entertainment plans are largely motivated by economics, part of a reform program to diversify the economy from oil and create new sectors to employ young Saudis.\nThe Vision 2030 plan aims to increase household spending on cultural and entertainment events inside the kingdom to 6 percent by 2030 from 2.9 percent.\n“We are bringing the most exciting and famous events to Saudi Arabia this year,” Khatib told Reuters in an interview, adding that state-sponsored entertainment events would be staged in 56 cities.\n“We are creating new local events with local content,” he said. “Almost 80 percent of the calendar (events) are for families.”\nSaudi Arabia lifted a 35-year-old ban on cinemas late last year, with plans for regional and global chains to open more than 300 movie theaters by 2030. The first cinemas are expected to start showing films from March.\nLast year the country announced plans to develop resorts on some 50 islands off the Red Sea coast and an entertainment city south of Riyadh featuring golf courses, car racing tracks and a Six Flags theme park.\nAdditional reporting by Marwa Rashad Writing by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:55:56.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
