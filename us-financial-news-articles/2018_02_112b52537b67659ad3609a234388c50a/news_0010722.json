His administration has said it had some concerns in implementing the court ruling issued on Thursday but has yet to spell them out.\nThe attorney general had said earlier on Sunday the Supreme Court was seeking to impeach President Yameen, citing information received by the government. The Supreme Court’s statement on Sunday made no mention of efforts to impeach the president.\nThe Court also annulled a police arrest against a top supreme court administrator who was to register a corruption case against President Yameen, calling the warrant “against established legal procedure”.\nReporting by Mohamed Junayd; Writing by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Rafael Nam\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:13:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
