Citigroup is the fourth biggest U.S. bank by assets. \nThe change in Corbat’s pay compares with annual raises of 5 to 20 percent for some other Wall Street executives. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co, ( JPM.N ) the biggest U.S. bank, was paid $29.5 million, a 5.4 percent increase. Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) CEO James Gorman’s compensation was raised 20 percent to $27 million. \nLloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) received a 9 percent raise to $22 million, the company said on Friday. Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) CEO Brian Moynihan was paid $23 million, up 15 percent. \nCitigroup made additional disclosures on Friday which indicate that other senior executives received approximately these amounts of compensation in 2017: \nJames Forese, president and chief executive of Citi’s Institutional Clients Group received $20 million, up 31 percent from 2016. \nJohn Gerspach, chief financial officer, got $11 million, up 22 percent. \nStephen Bird, chief executive of global consumer banking, received $10.5 million, up 17 percent. \nJane Fraser, chief executive for Latin America, received $8.5 million, up 8 percent. \nReporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T15:39:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
