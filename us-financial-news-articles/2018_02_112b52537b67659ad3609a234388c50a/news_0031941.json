Founded in 1989 by Stig Anderson, publisher and manager of the Swedish band ABBA, the Polar Music Prize has become a coveted accolade in both classical and popular music. “Receiving the Polar Music Prize is an incredible thing,” said Metallica’s drummer and co-founder Lars Ulrich in a statement on the band’s website. “It puts us in very distinguished company. It’s a great validation of everything Metallica has done over the last 35 years. At the same time, we feel like we’re in our prime with a lot of good years ahead of us.” Previous winners of the Polar Music Prize include Yo-Yo Ma, Paul Simon, the Kronos Quartet, Patti Smith and Björk.
