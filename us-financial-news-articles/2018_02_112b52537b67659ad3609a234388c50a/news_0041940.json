The government, which has only a one-seat majority, now trails the main opposition Labor Party by a margin of 53-47 percent on a two-party basis.\nThe government must call an election by May 2019.\nWith mounting public pressure, Joyce sought to turn the tide of public opinion, giving a rare interview on Monday with the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, where he blamed public life for the breakdown of his marriage.\nJoyce has began a highly unusual week-long leave of absence at the urging of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who will this week travel to Washington, which would have typically seen Joyce installed as acting prime minister. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann will now be acting leader.\nAs well as alienating voters, the scandal has fractured the ruling conservative government, with Joyce last week publicly criticising Turnbull for “causing further harm” through comments about his affair.\nThe scandal has prompted Turnbull to ban sexual relationships between ministers and their staff.\nTurnbull and Joyce held urgent talks on Saturday. “We’ve put whatever tensions there were behind us,” Turnbull told a radio station in Melbourne on Monday.\nHowever, Turnbull said there was no guarantee that Joyce would continue as deputy prime minister with the leadership decision in the hands of National Party lawmakers.\nOn Sunday, Australian media reported that senior National Party figures were openly canvassing constituents with a view to removing Joyce from the party leadership.\nReporting by Colin Packham; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T05:45:55.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
