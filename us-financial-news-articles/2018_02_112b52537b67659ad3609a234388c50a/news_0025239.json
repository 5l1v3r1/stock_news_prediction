And that's what he expects now. \n\"I'm still bullish on this year,\" he said, noting that January had a \"trifecta\" of bullish trends. \nFor one, the January Barometer was up, he said. That means if January saw gains, the rest of the year should follow suit. There was also a Santa Claus rally, he said, which is a jump in shares that occurs in the last week of December through the first two trading days of January. Finally, he pointed out that the first five trading days of the year were also higher, which tends to be an early indicator for how stocks will perform the rest of the year. \n\"We could even get back up towards the upper end of this trend by March, April,\" he said. \nHeading into the back half of the year, Hirsch expects another correction, which he said is typical around mid-term elections. \nHowever, he's sticking with his 2018 forecast , which predicts a 47.5 percent chance the Dow Jones industrial average will hit 29,000. \n— CNBC's Arielle Berger contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T22:17:43.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
