But even without Pelosi’s support, some Democrats may back it because it includes funding increases that their party has sought on programs such as disaster-relief, infrastructure and healthcare. \nSpeaker Paul Ryan, a Republican who has backed the budget deal, predicted the chamber would pass it. \n“I think we will,” Ryan told radio host Hugh Hewitt. “This is a bipartisan bill. It’s going to need bipartisan support. We are going to deliver our share of support.” \nA Senate vote could take place as early as Thursday afternoon. The House debate could go on well into the night. \nThe rare bipartisan deal reached by congressional leaders on Wednesday would stave off a government shutdown before a Thursday night deadline and extend the federal government’s debt ceiling until March 2019. \nThe deal, backed by President Donald Trump, raises spending on military and domestic programs by almost $300 billion over the next two years. \nA two-year budget bill would end the fiscal uncertainty that followed Congress’ passage of four stopgap funding measures this fiscal year and led to a three-day partial shutdown last month. \nThe measure fails to end uncertainty, however, for 700,000 young immigrants brought into the United States illegally as children. \nDemocrats had sought to pass legislation ensuring protections for young illegal immigrants known as Dreamers as part of any budget measure but Republicans refused. Instead, they have pledged to hold a separate immigration debate in Senate this month.

I don’t know how I‘m going to vote,” he said. LIBERAL OPPOSITION \nLiberal Democrats oppose the deal over the immigration issue. Related Coverage Senate vote on pending budget deal delayed: Senator Cornyn \nPelosi, who called for protecting the Dreamers in an eight-hour speech on the House floor this week, reminded Democrats in a letter on Thursday that she will vote against the spending bill because she wants the party to maintain leverage in the immigration fight. \nIn an appeal to Democrats to vote for the budget deal, Ryan repeatedly said during a news conference that he would bring an immigration bill to the House floor after the spending measures are enacted. But he fell short of the unconditional guarantee that many Democrats demand. \nRepresentative Luis Gutierrez, one of the leading advocates in Congress for immigrants, urged colleagues to reject the deal. “Don’t collude with this administration,” he said. “Vote against the budget.” \nA number of lawmakers who supported the bill acknowledged the deal was not perfect. “It’s not pretty,” Republican U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger said on CNN.
