The report comes after a similar 2014 sting operation in which an undercover investigator brought weapons and drugs through six Rikers entrances. \n“Three years after a DOI undercover investigation demonstrated serious flaws in DOC security screening, the problems remain,” DOI Commissioner Mark Peters said in a statement, referring to the city Department of Correction. \nThe DOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. \nSince 2014, more than two dozen corrections employees have been charged with smuggling contraband into city jails, according to the DOI. U.S. prosecutors said the two officers charged on Thursday accepted thousands of dollars in payments from inmates in exchange for bringing marijuana into the Manhattan Detention Complex, known colloquially as “The Tombs.” \nRikers Island, which has been plagued by pervasive violence and smuggling for years, has received most of the attention, prompting Mayor Bill de Blasio to call for sweeping reforms at one of the United States’ largest jail complexes. \nBut Peters said Thursday’s report shows the problems are also present at other city facilities. \nDOI officials recommended that the DOC screen corrections officers at staff entrances with drug-sniffing dogs, eliminate unnecessary pockets on their uniforms and place their personal lockers outside the front-gate entrances, among other measures. The DOC has agreed to adopt those improvements, according to the report.
