But people were happy to see the demand coming in finally ahead of the Lunar New Year. There was solid demand for restocking from jewellers,” said Stephen Innes, APAC head of trading at Oanda.\n“Jewellers were reporting good sales from Valentines Day and it stayed on for the New Year,” he said.\nPremiums in China eased to $3-$4 an ounce from about $7-$8 at beginning of the week.\nGold prices edged higher on Friday, heading for their biggest weekly percentage gain in nearly two years.\nTraders expected demand to be low going forward as a week-long Lunar New Year holiday started on Thursday.\nIn Japan, gold was sold in a range of par with the benchmark and a 10 cent premium as demand rose after yen strengthened in the week, a Tokyo-based trader said.
