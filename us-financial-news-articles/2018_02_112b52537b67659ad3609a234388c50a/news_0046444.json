In the film, Hasan Kasmai, a filmmaker, starts to panic after being blacklisted and losing the actress he made a star who now wants to make a film with a rival director. He is further eaten up with jealousy when a serial killer targeting famous filmmakers in Tehran ignores him. He asks his mother when he will be killed and she assures him that the killer has spared the best for last - only for him to be then falsely named as the killer on social media.

Slideshow (12 Images) Film directors in Iran face censorship, and even jail, if they overstep accepted norms on subjects such as sex and politics. However, Haghighi, who plans to showing his film in Iran, said he was tired of journalists’ constant questions about his political views and censorship in Iran. “How many times do we need to hear this? Yes, there is censorship in Iran. Yes, it’s difficult to live with it and yes we are dealing with it. But there is so much more to discuss,” he said. “Khook - Pig” is one of 19 films competing for the Berlin International Film Festival’s Golden Bear, to be awarded on Feb. 24.
