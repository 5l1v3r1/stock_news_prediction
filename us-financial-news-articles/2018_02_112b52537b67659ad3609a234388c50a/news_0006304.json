Her lawyer provided a copy to the media.\n“This notwithstanding, it is our sacred duty to report events the public has the right to know.”\nKeng, president of a mining firm, said the Rappler story included “malicious imputations of crimes, vices and defects, which tarnish my good and clean reputation with the public.”\nRappler posted a copy of Keng’s complaint in a January article.\nRessa argued the statute of limitations on libel, which should also apply to cyber libel, had already expired so the NBI had no basis to investigate and charge her.\nThe Rappler story, she added, was published before the country’s cyber crime law took effect, so, “There was yet no crime of cyber libel to be committed.”\nReuters could not immediately reach Keng’s lawyer to seek comment.\nRappler has invoked freedom of the press in its appeal to the Court of Appeals in the Philippines, challenging a decision of the Securities and Exchange Commission to revoke its license for violations of foreign equity curbs on domestic media.\nReporting by Karen Lema; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T11:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T11:51:17.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
