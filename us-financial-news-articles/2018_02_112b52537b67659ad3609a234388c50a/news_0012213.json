A subpoena could trigger a court fight that might ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.\nJohn Dowd and Jay Sekulow, who lead a team of lawyers advising Trump, want the president to refuse an interview request, the Times said.\nThe lawyers and some Trump aides believe Mueller might be unwilling to subpoena the president and set off a showdown with the White House that the special counsel could lose in court, the Times reported.\nTrump’s longtime personal attorney Marc Kasowitz has also cautioned against a free-wheeling interview with Mueller, according to the Times.\nTy Cobb, a lawyer who was hired in July to handle the White House’s response to the Russia probe, has argued for cooperating with Mueller, the newspaper reported.\nIn response to requests for comment from Reuters, Dowd and Cobb sent a statement that said the discussions between the president’s personal lawyers and the special counsel’s office “regarding how and under what terms information will be exchanged are understandably private.”\nReporting by Eric Beech; Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T05:44:53.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
