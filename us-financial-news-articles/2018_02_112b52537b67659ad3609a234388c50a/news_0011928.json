Rail operators also had to develop and deploy a new radio system and back-office infrastructure, the Association of American Railroads said. \nAllan Rutter, a railroad infrastructure specialist at Texas A&M University’s Transportation Institute, said the system has to be compatible across dozens of different railroads to be effective, another hurdle to be crossed. \n“The simple answer is, it’s really, really hard,” Rutter said. “It’s not like you can go down to Best Buy and buy this stuff.” \nPTC is designed to prevent derailments or crashes caused by excessive speed. The National Transportation Safety Board says at least 81 fatal accidents since 1969 could have been prevented with PTC. \nThe Association of American Railroads did not respond to a request for comment, but on its website it called PTC “an unprecedented technological challenge.” It said the biggest U.S. railroads “are on track to meet all statutory deadlines to install and implement PTC.” \nAmtrak, the government-owned passenger rail carrier, has PTC on about two-thirds of its own tracks, but many of its trains travel on tracks owned by other operators, the Federal Railroad Administration says. By comparison, CSX Corp, the third largest U.S. railroad, has 45 percent of its 9,600 miles (15,400 km) of track under PTC operation. \nThe pace at which railroads have installed PTC has come under increasing scrutiny after a series of crashes involving U.S. passenger trains in recent years. \nIn the latest deadly accident, the fourth involving an Amtrak train since early December, the passenger train struck a parked CSX freight train on a siding in South Carolina, killing two people. Safety officials say a padlocked switch on the CSX-operated tracks sent the Amtrak train down the siding. \nThe three-year extension granted by Congress followed lobbying by major railroads. The Transportation Department can extend the deadline again to 2020. \nSenator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, which oversees rail safety, told Reuters last month that railroads needed to meet the deadline. \n“We pushed it now a couple different times and they need to get there,” Thune said. \nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao last month sent a letter to railroads and transit agencies urging them to meet the PTC deadline.
