The statewide rise is down from 2.3 percent a year earlier and was restrained by Atlantic City, which overhauled property taxes for casinos as part of a plan to arrest a financial crisis.\nSchool costs drove more than half the 2017 increase, while county costs were the second biggest driver.\nFormer Republican Governor Chris Christie in his first term enacted a 2 percent cap on annual property-tax increases, excluding coverage for debt payments and other liabilities. Phil Murphy, the Democrat who replaced him on Jan. 16, hasn’t supported renewing a limit on interest arbitration awards to police and firefighters, a Christie initiative that’s been credited with saving taxpayers almost $3 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T14:48:34.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
