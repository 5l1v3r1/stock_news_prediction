Miniat as Chairman of the Board. His father, Ronald Miniat, served as Chairman of the Board for 47 years, and assumes the role of Chairman Emeritus.\nDuring Ron’s leadership as Chairman of the Board, the company has experienced exponential growth through new business opportunities, processes, and organic growth that led to multi-site expansions. During this time, the Board evolved to include an advisory board, allowing for best practice in governance and protocols to support the family’s desire and commitment to perpetuate the business to the fifth generation and beyond.\nThe seamless transition of the Chairman’s role from Ron to David is a testament to each generation’s commitment to improving and growing the business.\n“Over the years each generation of the Miniat family has made a lasting impact on the business. David is beginning his tenure as Chairman of the Board with a strong Board and company leadership team in place, and I anticipate even greater success as we continue to serve our customers and stakeholders,” said Ron.\nDavid, CEO and a fourth generation family member, joined the company in 1982 and has served as a Board member for over 25 years. He will serve as CEO and Chairman of the Board concurrently.\nUnder David’s leadership since 1996, the companies have seen continued growth and their largest capital investments and expansions at each of the businesses.\n“Our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and I’m committed to serving our customers, shareholders, employees, and communities with the innovation and continued growth they’ve come to expect from the Miniat Companies during Ron’s tenure,” David said. “It’s truly and honor to assume this role and continue the long-standing legacy of growth and service for which our companies are known.”\nAbout The Miniat Companies, Inc.\nThe Miniat Companies, Inc. employs over 700 employees and consists of three operating entities: Miniat Holdings LLC, headquartered in South Holland, IL; Ed Miniat LLC, a value-added, cooked meat manufacturer, located in South Holland, IL; and South Chicago Packing LLC, a food oil and shortening manufacturer located in Chicago, IL.
