In that time, TCU went on a key 7-2 surge to retake control of the contest.\nGuard Alex Robinson, who led TCU with 22 points, made two free throws to put the Horned Frogs ahead 75-65 with 1:17 left. Guard Desmond Bane scored 16, forward Vladimir Brodziansky added 14 and forward Kouat Noi had 11 to join Robinson in double figures for TCU.\nForward Jo Lual-Acuil scored 22 to lead Baylor (17-12, 7-9), forward Tristan Clark had 14 and forward Mark Vital contributed 12.\nTCU held Baylor leading scorer point guard Manu Lecomte to five points.\nBaylor took its first lead since early in the first half when Lual-Acuil hit a pair of free throws to put the Bears in front 57-56 with 9:02 left, but the Horned Frogs responded with a 9-2 run sparked by forward Kouat Noi’s 3-pointer at the 8:53 mark.\nTCU went on a 9-2 run midway through the first half to take a double-digit lead.\nNoi made a layup on an assist from Robinson to cap the spurt and put the Horned Frogs ahead 25-14 with 8:31 left until halftime.\nBut Baylor kept TCU from running away. Lual-Acuil muscled his way into the paint for a close-range basket that completed a 12-4 run and cut the Horned Frogs’ lead to three.\nBrodziansky scored nine points in the first half to lead TCU and help the Horned Frogs take a 33-28 lead to the break.\nTCU will stay at home to face Kansas State on Tuesday and then finish the Big 12 regular season at Texas Tech next Saturday.\nBaylor hosts Oklahoma on Tuesday before going on the road for its final conference game at Kansas State on Saturday.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:02:11.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
