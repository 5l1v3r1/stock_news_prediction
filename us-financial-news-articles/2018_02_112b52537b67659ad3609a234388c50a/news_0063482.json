( Nasdaq: ATRC ), a leading innovator in treatments for atrial fibrillation (Afib) and left atrial appendage (LAA) management, today announced fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\n“We realized several accomplishments in 2017 underpinned by our continued focus on education, clinical science and innovation. We begin 2018 with a platform in place to continue expanding our minimally invasive presence through our DEEP trial restart, CONVERGE trial enrollment efforts and growth in the AtriClip franchise,” said Mike Carrel, President and Chief Executive Officer of AtriCure. “We are well positioned to continue executing on our strategy to deliver solid financial and operational results while progressing forward with our strategic initiatives and positively impacting patient lives.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $46.1 million, an increase of $4.9 million or 11.9% (10.7% on a constant currency basis), compared to fourth quarter 2016 revenue. U.S. revenue increased 10.8% to $36.2 million, driven by increased sales of ablation-related open-heart products and AtriClip ® products. International revenue was $9.9 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 16.3% (10.3% on a constant currency basis), compared to fourth quarter 2016 revenue.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $32.7 million compared to $28.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to 71.0% compared to 70.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 4.8%, or $1.8 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in operating expenses was driven primarily by a decrease in research and development project-related expenses.\nLoss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.1 million, compared to $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss per share was $0.08 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.27 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a loss of $0.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 (see reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results in the table accompanying this release).\n2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for 2017 was $174.7 million, an increase of $19.6 million or 12.6% (12.4% on a constant currency basis), compared to 2016 revenue. U.S. revenue increased 13.1% to $138.4 million, driven by growth across our key ablation and AtriClip® products. International revenue was $36.3 million, an increase of $3.6 million or 11.0% (9.6% on a constant currency basis). International revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in product sales in Japan, Australia, Germany, France, Turkey, Austria and the Benelux region.\nGross profit for 2017 was $126.2 million compared to $111.1 million for 2016. Gross margin for 2017 increased to 72.2% compared to 71.6% for 2016.\nLoss from operations for 2017 was $25.0 million, compared to $31.1 million for 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a loss of $5.3 million for 2017, compared to a $9.2 million loss for 2016 (see reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results in the table accompanying this release). Net loss per share was $0.83 for 2017 compared to $1.05 for 2016.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nManagement projects 2018 revenue of approximately $190 million to $196 million. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is projected to be positive for 2018.\nConference Call\nAtriCure will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday, February 26, 2018 to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.

For details on the uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements, visit http://www.atricure.com/fls as well as our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q which contain risk factors. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements. This document also includes forward-looking projected financial information that is based on current estimates and forecasts. Actual results could differ materially.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement AtriCure’s condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, AtriCure uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release as supplemental financial metrics.\nRevenue reported on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated by applying previous period foreign currency exchange rates to each of the comparable periods. Management analyzes revenue on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on revenue, the Company believes that evaluating growth in revenue on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of revenue to both management and the company’s investors.\nAdjusted EBITDA provides an indication of performance excluding certain items. Management believes that in order to properly understand short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of these excluded items in addition to GAAP measures. The excluded items vary in frequency and/or impact on our continuing operations and management believes that the excluded items are typically not reflective of our ongoing core business operations. Further, management uses adjusted EBITDA for its strategic planning. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA reported in this release to the most comparable GAAP measure for the respective periods can be found in a table later in this release.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used by AtriCure may not be the same or calculated the same as those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for AtriCure’s financial results prepared and reported in accordance with GAAP.\nATRICURE, INC.
