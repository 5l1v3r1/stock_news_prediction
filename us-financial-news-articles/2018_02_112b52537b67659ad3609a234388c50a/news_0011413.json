It would step in to provide liquidity to commercial banks in order to meet import demand, he said.\nThe central bank has not specified the current level of foreign reserves.\nHard currency remains scarce in the formal banking system, forcing importers to resort to an increasingly expensive black market.\nSudan’s economy has been struggling since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of its oil output. But the United States lifted 20-year-old sanctions in October, and the IMF has advised it to embark on sweeping reforms.\nStreet protests broke out last month after bread prices doubled, following a government decision to eliminate subsidies in its 2018 budget as part of austerity measures.\nReporting by Khalid Abdelaziz, writing by John Davison in Cairo; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T15:22:28.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
