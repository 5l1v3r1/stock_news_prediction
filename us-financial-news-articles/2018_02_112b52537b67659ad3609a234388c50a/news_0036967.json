The Bugcrowd team and Board are committed to this mission, and I am extremely excited to be part of this dynamic and growing company.\"\nWith more than 20 years experience in enterprise sales, Rick Beattie brings a deep understanding of the cybersecurity landscape and strong understanding of the needs of today’s CISO.

Prior to Bugcrowd, he served as vice president of sales at Carbon Black and has held sales leadership roles at Q1 Labs and F5 Networks.\n“The crowdsourced security landscape is one of the most dynamic in the industry today and Bugcrowd is the innovator in the space,” said Jonathan Gohstand, VP of product, Bugcrowd. “The combination of a great team and a great approach to the challenge of cybersecurity made joining Bugcrowd a no-brainer. I’m thrilled to join an organization that is driving the direction of the industry and the future of cybersecurity.”\nJonathan Gohstand brings 20 years of experience driving product roadmap and strategy to his role as vice president of product for Bugcrowd.
