In some parts, cars have resumed moving, but only to be caught in a standstill again,” the official said.\nThe snowfall in Fukui is expected to continue at least until Wednesday morning, the local observatory said.\nReporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T09:23:57.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
