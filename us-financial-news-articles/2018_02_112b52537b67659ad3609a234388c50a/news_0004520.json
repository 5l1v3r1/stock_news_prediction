REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer GPE aims to raise $3.1 billion over the next two years to ensure access to classrooms for 870 million children in 65 developing countries.\nAbout 264 million children worldwide are missing out on school, according to the partnership. But the share of global aid going to education has been shrinking for over a decade, said the ONE campaign, a global advocacy organization.\n“Dakar should be a turning point for access to quality education,” said ONE’s president Gayle Smith in a statement.\nThe presidents of seven African nations also attended the conference and emphasized the importance of improving education on a continent where the youth population is exploding.\n“We have the youngest population on the planet, on the richest continent with the worst living conditions,” Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo told the conference.\n“That paradox can only be broken by education.”\nReporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.
