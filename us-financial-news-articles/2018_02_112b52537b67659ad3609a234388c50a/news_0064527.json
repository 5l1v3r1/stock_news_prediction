It entered Sunday with a total of 14 goals scored and 14 goals against.\nThe Russians, by contrast, had just one loss in Pyeongchang and a 23-6 goal advantage.\nThe game itself proved to be a see-saw battle between the two sides.\nRussia dominated the shot count in the first period and got on the board with a slapshot from Vyacheslav Voinov with less than a second on the clock in the first period.\nVoinov, who won two Stanley Cups with the Los Angeles Kings, said after the game that the feeling of victory at the Olympics was “a little bit different.”\nGermany tied the game halfway through the second period with a goal that had to be reviewed by referees before being credited to forward Felix Schutz.\nThere then followed a 24-minute stretch of scoreless action before the levee burst in the 53rd minute.\nGusev kicked off the frenzy with a wide-angle shot that caromed in off the facemask of German goaltender Danny Aus Den Birken.\nJust 10 seconds later, Germany answered with a centering pass from Frank Mauer to Dominik Kahun, who was waiting in the slot to beat Russian netminder Vasili Koshechkin.\nGermany’s Jonas Mueller scored the go-ahead goal three minutes later to take a 3-2 lead that silenced the mostly Russian crowd.\nWith two minutes and 11 seconds left in the third, the Russians were dinged with a two-minute tripping penalty to Sergei Kalinin, forcing Team OAR to pull its goalie just to keep five skaters on the ice.\nThe bet paid off with 56 seconds left in the game, as Gusev again played the hero, lunging at a loose puck in front of the German net and flicking it past Aus Den Birken with a two-handed backhand.\nIn overtime, the Germans kept up until forward Patrick Reimer was hit with a high-sticking penalty nine minutes into sudden death.\nThe Russians wasted no time, laying siege to the German goaltender. Just 29 seconds into the power play, Gusev fed a cross-ice pass to Kaprizov, who was waiting with a one-timed slapshot that flew past Aus Den Birken.\nGerman captain Marcel Goc, a former NHL journeyman, struggled to hide his disappointment.\n“There were a lot of momentum swings,” he said after the game. “We were this close.”\nWrite to Andrew Jeong at andrew.jeong@wsj.com and Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T03:03:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
