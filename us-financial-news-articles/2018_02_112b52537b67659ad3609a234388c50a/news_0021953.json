In 2014, Wang rejected a Mayhoola bid for Lanvin of around 400 million euros.\nThe privately owned firm does not publish earnings. It made an 18.3 million euro loss in 2016, sources with knowledge of the situation had previously told Reuters. Losses had been forecast to deepen to at least 27 million euros in 2017 as sales continued to fall, they said.\nLanvin has twice changed artistic director since Elbaz’s departure. Founded in 1889 and named after French “couturiere” Jeanne Lanvin, the luxury label has long been synonymous with Parisian chic.\nChinese-born Wang, a media magnate based in Taiwan, acquired a holding in Lanvin from L‘Oreal ( OREP.PA ) in 2001 and bought out other investors in 2003, reaching 75 percent control of the firm. The rest is owned by Swiss businessman Ralph Bartel.\nReporting by Pascale Denis; writing by Sarah White; editing by Geert De Clercq and Clelia Oziel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T16:21:31.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
