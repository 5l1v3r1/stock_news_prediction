They say the pair used funds from secret offshore accounts to enjoy a life of luxury.\nNone of the charges against the pair make reference to alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election nor accusations of collusion between Moscow and Trump’s campaign.\nMueller, appointed by the Department of Justice last year to investigate Russia’s role in the election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign, has a broad mandate that allows him to look into any wrongdoing he uncovers in the probe.\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow sought to meddle in the campaign to tilt the vote in favor of Trump, the Republican candidate, including by hacking the emails of leading Democrats and distributing disinformation and propaganda online.\nFormer Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort departs from U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas Russia has denied the accusations of interference. Trump has said there was no collusion and denied any attempt to obstruct Mueller’s probe.\nManafort was Trump’s campaign manager for five months in 2016. He was originally indicted last year with Gates, Trump’s former deputy campaign manager.\nA court filing on Friday charged that between 2008 and 2017, Gates and Manafort devised a scheme to obtain money and property by making false representations to banks and other financial institutions. Toward the end of that period they worked for Trump’s campaign.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Manafort is facing two separate indictments - one filed in the federal court in Washington, D.C., and a second in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.\nThe Washington one charges him with conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States, making false statements, and charges in connection with failing to register as a foreign agent for Ukraine.\nThe Virginia indictment charges him with bank fraud, filing false tax returns and failing to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government.\nManafort is expected to appear for a second hearing in the Alexandria court on Friday, where he will also plead not guilty to the charges.\nThe two separate indictments against him in the District of Columbia and Virginia are seen as unusual.\nNormally such charges would be consolidated in one court, but Manafort has refused to allow this, which might be a legal tactic meant to make Mueller’s case more difficult.\nThe two parallel cases could complicate matters for both sides, since each indictment to a large extent relies on the same underlying evidence.\nJudge Jackson on Wednesday fretted about this, saying dueling cases could lead to a “duplicative” amount of work, particularly for the defense, and potentially “inconsistent rulings” by the two judges.\nGates made a plea deal last week to charges that he lied to investigators and conspired against the United States. The move added to pressure on Manafort to cut a deal himself but he has maintained his innocence.\nReporting by Sarah N.
