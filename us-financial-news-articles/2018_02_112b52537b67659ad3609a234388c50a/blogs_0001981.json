Previously, state-run Petrobras needed to have at least a 30 percent stake in any oil operation, but President Michel Temer is pushing to increase privatization and attract more international investment. \nOn Wednesday. Temer signed the concession agreements from the October auctions that netted Brazil 6.15 billion reals, or about $1.8 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T00:21:31.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
