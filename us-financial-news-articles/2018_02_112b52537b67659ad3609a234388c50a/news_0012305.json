The seas, themselves polluted, engulf the remains of countless shipwrecked victims of forced migration,” he said. \nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated that 2,832 migrants died last year trying to reach Italy from North Africa, down from 4,581 in 2016. Some 119,310 people made it alive to Italy in 2017, against 181,436 the year before. \nFrancis has made many appeals for disarmament and as the war of words between the United States and North Korea has heated up, he called for a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons. \nThis year, Lent starts on Ash Wednesday, Feb. 14 and runs to Easter, April 1. \nReporting by Philip Pullella; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T15:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T15:14:42.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
