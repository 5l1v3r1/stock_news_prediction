The vessels were still available for sale and the company has started discussions with interested third parties, it added.\nThe proposed disposal of the vessels is a part of the company’s debt reduction plans. This week, Noble proposed a deal under which existing shareholders’ equity would be nearly wiped out, while the restructured company would have much lower debt.\nReporting by Aradhana Aravindan; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:48:17.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
