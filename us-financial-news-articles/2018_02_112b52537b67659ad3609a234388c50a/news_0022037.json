Friday’s asteroid was not expected to enter Earth’s atmosphere. \nOn Tuesday, another asteroid, estimated at between 50 and 100 feet (15 and 30 meters) in size, passed within 114,000 miles (184,000 km) of the planet. \nBoth asteroids were discovered this month by astronomers at the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey near Tucson, Arizona, the space agency said.
