It is out of control because of him and because of the centre-left.” \nOpinion polls say Berlusconi and his far-right partners -- the League and the Brothers of Italy -- will win the most votes at the March election, but will probably fall short of an absolute majority. \nSaturday’s gunman, Luca Traini, stood for the League in a local election last year, but did not receive any votes. Police found a copy of Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf at his house and he has a neo-Nazi symbol tattooed above his eyebrow. \nLeftist politicians accuse League leader Matteo Salvini of whipping up hostility to migrants with his often fierce rhetoric against the newcomers -- a charge he denies. \nBerlusconi has sought to allay fears over the sometimes extremist tones of his allies by promising to be a moderating force should they govern together. However, his comments on Sunday showed he had bought into their tough line on migration. \nHe doubled down on his message on Monday, urging Italians to signal to the police the whereabouts of illegal migrants and promising mass repatriations by boat and plane. \n“In order to find them, everyone can point out their presence and these people will be picked up,” he told Rai state television.
