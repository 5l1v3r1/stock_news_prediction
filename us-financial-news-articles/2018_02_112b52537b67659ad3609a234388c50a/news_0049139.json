It’s a shared political project,” the advisor said.\nFrance will also push for the system of “rebates” to EU members’ budget contributions, inherited from Margaret Thatcher’s call to get her “money back” for Britain, to be reviewed. While Britain receives by far the largest rebate of its EU dues, other countries have been given smaller rebates. France is the biggest contributor to them, the aide said.\nReporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T18:20:14.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
