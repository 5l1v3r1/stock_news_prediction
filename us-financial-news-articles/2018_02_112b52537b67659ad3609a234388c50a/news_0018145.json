Sounds wonderful? But it’s fake,” Zen said.\n”They are not going to make good choices for the Church ... surely they choose the one they prefer, which means the one who always obeys the government. So how (could) the Holy Father approve such a choice?”\n“Okay, he can veto. How many times? It takes courage to veto the second time, the third time, five times,” Zen said.\nCatholics in China are split between the state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association, where bishops are appointed by the government, and the “underground” Church that remains loyal to the pope while being systematically persecuted by Chinese authorities for years.\nZen, who has fiercely criticised the Vatican for attempting to force two “underground” bishops to give way to government-backed “illegitimate” bishops in order to foster the deal, was rebuked by the Vatican last Wednesday for “fostering confusion and controversy”.\nZen said that under the status quo, which he described as “the lesser evil,” the Vatican secretly approves candidates who are acceptable to both sides before the state-controlled Church makes them bishop.\nBut under the new agreement, where candidates would be selected via a “so-called democratic election” inside the Chinese Catholic community and endorsed by a state-controlled bishops’ conference before being submitted to the pope, the choice lies entirely in the hands of the government, Zen said.\n“A church enslaved by the government is no real Catholic Church,” he said.\nZen said he was not criticizing the pope, whom he believed might not be briefed on “reality” because bureaucrats in the Holy See are eager to strike a deal.\n“What they (Vatican negotiators) are doing is unfaithful,” Zen said. “I am not judging their conscience but ... it’s a surrender and they have no right to surrender.”\nReporting by Venus Wu; Additional reporting by Greg Torode, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:56:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
