Lipa was named best female solo artist and breakthrough act at the British Record Industry Trust (BRIT) awards, held in London on Wednesday, while rapper Stormzy won the British male solo artist prize and British album of the year for “Gang Signs & Prayer.” Ed Sheeran took the global success award but lost in the three other categories in which he was nominated, while One Direction star Harry Styles won for video of the year by a British artist. Foo Fighters took the prize for international group. U.S. rapper Kendrick Lamar was named best international male artist, with New Zealand singer Lorde taking the female solo artist honours. The event featured performances from the likes of Sheeran, Lipa and Lamar, who rapped on top of a glass cube containing a luxury car that was smashed up by a man wielding a bat. Stormzy accepts the award for British album at the Brit Awards at the O2 Arena in London, Britain, February 21, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay Lamar’s act appeared to suffer from technical difficulties that muted periods of his performance, leading fans on social media to express their frustration. Other artists went for grand scale. Justin Timberlake opened the show with a rendition of “Say Something” accompanied by a scores-strong choir dotted throughout the audience, while Dua Lipa was accompanied by dozens of dancers, also scattered throughout the arena.

British media outlets reported that Gallagher had been added to the line-up at the last minute, to replace a planned tribute performance by Grande, who dropped out due to illness.
