REUTERS/Charles Platiau On Friday Le Pen senior won in court the right to remain honorary president of the party, although the court upheld the FN’s decision to bar him from being a full-fledged party member.\n“My role as honorary president obliges me to follow what the National Front does and the congress is at the heart of the party’s activities,” he said.\nHis daughter did not react immediately to the court decision but the FN published a statement saying only full-fledged members who have paid their membership dues would be allowed to attend the congress. “Jean-Marie Le Pen will therefore not be allowed in at the Lille congress,” it said.\nOpinion polls over the past months have shown Marine Le Pen’s popularity has taken a hit even among party members and that it is the far-left France Insoumise, not the FN, that voters now see as the strongest opponent of President Emmanuel Macron and his centrist government.\nMarine Le Pen has said the party needs to learn from its errors and rebrand itself.\nHer willingness to water down her opposition to the euro led to the eviction in September of Florian Philippot, who had been her closest aide since she took over the party in 2011.\nReporting by Ingrid Melander, Simon Carraud, Emmanuel Jarry; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T20:36:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
