The move sparked outrage by patients and U.S. lawmakers.\nHis criminal convictions are unrelated to Daraprim, stemming instead from securities fraud charges brought in December 2015.\nIn addition to the stock manipulation charge, Shkreli stands convicted of lying to investors in two hedge funds he controlled, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Matsumoto did not rule on the key issue at Friday’s hearing - the amount of financial loss for which Shkreli was responsible, which could play a key role in his March 9 sentencing.\nProsecutors do not dispute that Shkreli’s investors eventually came out ahead after Shkreli paid them in shares of Retrophin, which he founded in 2011.\nThe jury found Shkreli not guilty of a separate charge that he conspired to defraud Retrophin when he used the company to pay back the investors.\nBenjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, argued at Friday’s hearing that Shkreli should get credit for paying the investors back. Shkreli’s lawyers had argued in court filings that Shkreli’s conduct had caused no financial loss at all, which could bolster an argument for a light sentence.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith, a prosecutor, said it was Shkreli’s intent that mattered.\n“He did, in fact, take that money to perpetuate a fraud,” she said. “What mattered to him was his reputation as a hedge fund manager.”\nProsecutors have argued for a loss amount of as much as $20 million, which could result in a much harsher sentence under federal guidelines. Though judges must consider the guidelines, they are not mandatory.\nShkreli’s lawyers and prosecutors have not yet submitted filings on what the sentence should be.\nReporting by Brendan Pierson, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T18:01:20.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
