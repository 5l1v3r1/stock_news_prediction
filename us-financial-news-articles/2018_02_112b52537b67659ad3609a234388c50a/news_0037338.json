Tamimi and her mother, Nariman, were arrested a few days later.\nOn Tuesday morning Tamimi, wearing prison uniform and with her hands and feet in restraints, was led into the courtroom at the Ofer military prison near Ramallah for preliminary trial hearings. Her father Bassem, the only member of her family in the courtroom, said to her: “How are you? Stay strong.”\nPalestinian teen Ahed Tamimi enters a military courtroom escorted by Israeli security personnel as her lawyer Gaby Lasky (L) stands near, at Ofer Prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Ammar Awad The teenager faces 12 charges, including aggravated assault. An adult could be jailed for up to 10 years, but such an outcome is considered unlikely for a minor who was 16 when the incident happened.\nThe case has polarized opinion. Some Israelis have accused her of courting publicity and being a troublemaker. Palestinians say she was protesting against Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. On the eve of her latest appearance the human rights group Amnesty International called for her immediate release.\nPalestinian teen Ahed Tamimi enters a military courtroom escorted by Israeli security personnel at Ofer Prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Ammar Awad Outside court, Tamimi’s lawyer Gaby Lasky said her family wanted the case to be heard in public, but the judge had ordered the numerous journalists present to be removed from the courtroom for the proceedings because she was a minor.\n“I think the decision of the court is because the court decided what is good for the court, and not what is good for Ahed,” Lasky said. “They understand that people outside Ofer military court are interested in Ahed’s case.”\nThe case was adjourned until March, and could go on for months. Tamimi remains in custody.\nReporting by Ali Sawafta and Stephen Farrell; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T17:36:46.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
