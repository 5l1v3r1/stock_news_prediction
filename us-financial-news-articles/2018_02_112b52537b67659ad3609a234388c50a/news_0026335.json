The four major lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, National Australia Bank, and Westpac Banking Corp - hold about 80 percent of the country’s A$1.7 trillion mortgage market. \n“The commission will hear evidence of events involving certain financial services entities in the context of home lending that suggest that consumers have not always enjoyed the right to be treated honestly and fairly when it comes to home loans,” Rowena Orr, a barrister who is assisting the commission, said at the start of the inquiry in Melbourne. \n“Some of these events may have involved breaches of the law while others may have involved departures from community standards and expectations.” \nA Royal Commission has the power to compel witnesses, recommend criminal charges and propose legislative changes. While Australia’s finance sector has been subjected to numerous probes in the past, it is the first time the whole industry has faced such scrutiny. \nAfter years of refusing to order such a far-reaching inquiry, the center-right federal government relented to public pressure late last year in the wake of money-laundering allegations against CBA. \nThe banks also gave up on campaigns to avoid an inquiry and published a joint letter in November saying that it was now in the national interest to have one. \nThe commission also will examine the scandal-hit wealth management and financial advice industries.

REUTERS/Steven Saphore/File Photo NOWHERE TO HIDE \nAustralia’s big banks are among the most profitable in the world, earning net profit margins of 36.4 percent in the June quarter of 2017, according to a paper published by the commission on Feb. 9. \nBut they are under mounting regulatory pressure to boost capital and rein in lending to speculative investors amid fears of a downturn in the Sydney and Melbourne property markets. \nCBA last week posted a surprise drop in first-half cash profit, weighed down by A$575 million ($454 million) in provisions related to the money laundering allegations. Outgoing Chief Executive Ian Narev warned that the industry would be affected for some time by regulatory charges “in one shape or form”.
