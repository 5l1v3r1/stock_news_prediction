We’ve still got lots of tough hockey ahead of us.”\nCanada would usually be the main attraction packing the largest venue but on Thursday the gold medalists were relegated to the smaller arena used primarily for women’s hockey while the host South Koreans took on the Czech Republic across town at the main arena.\nIce Hockey – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men Preliminary Round Match - Switzerland v Canada - Kwandong Hockey Centre, Gangneung, South Korea – February 15, 2018 - Rene Bourque (R) and goalkeeper Ben Scrivens of Canada celebrate after defeating Switzerland. REUTERS/Grigory Dukor Large swathes of empty seats and just 2,802 spectators added up to a flat atmosphere inside the arena that a day earlier had been rattling with excitement for a women’s hockey game between a united Korean team and Japan.\nThe Canadian team that stepped on to the Kwandong Hockey Centre ice on Thursday could not have been more different than the one that claimed gold four years ago in Sochi.\nSlideshow (7 Images) That was a team of future Hockey Hall of Famers, NHL most valuable players and scoring champions like Sidney Crosby and Jonathan Toews.\nThe roster that opened defense of that gold was one cobbled together from NHL spare parts and castoffs. A team of mostly unknowns earning a pay cheque playing in remote hockey outposts.\n“You try to just treat it like any other game as cliche as that sounds, if you start focusing on magnitude you kind of get lost in the forest,” said Canada netminder Ben Scrivens, who plays in the Russian KHL for Salavat Yulaev Ufa. “You take one game at a time.”\nFans or no fans Canada got their bid for a third consecutive gold off to an inspired start with Rene Bourque redirecting Chris Lee’s shot from the blueline past Leonardo Genoni to open the scoring and Maxim Noreau adding a powerplay tally for a 2-0 first period lead.\nBourque found the back of the net again in the second which was followed 52 seconds later with another powerplay goal from Wojtek Wolski that pushed the lead out to 4-0.\nSimon Moser’s third period powerplay goal accounted for all the Swiss scoring and Wolski answered with an empty netter for Canada.\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T16:46:41.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
