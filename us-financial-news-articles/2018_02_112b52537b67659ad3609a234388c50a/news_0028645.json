It had 180 million francs in one-time costs, compared to 107 million francs in 2016.\nClariant abandoned a planned merger with U.S. company Huntsman last year after activist investors built up a large stake and criticised the deal as “value-destructive.”\nIn January, Saudi Basic Industries Corp bought a 25 percent stake in Clariant from the activist investors. SABIC, the world’s number four chemical firm, said it had no current plans to launch a full takeover.\n$1 = 0.9327 Swiss francs Reporting by John Miller; Editing by Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T08:58:45.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
