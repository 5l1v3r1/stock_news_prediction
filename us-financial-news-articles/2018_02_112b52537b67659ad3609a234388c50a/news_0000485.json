In the end, I let my heart decide. As I always said, I feel at home here and I‘m highly motivated to achieve big things in the next few years. Once a Gunner, always a Gunner.” \nBritish media reported that the new deal is worth up to 350,000 pounds a week, making the World Cup winner the highest-paid player at the club. \nOzil joined Arsenal from Real Madrid in 2013 for a then club-record of about 42.5 million pounds. \nThe playmaker has made 182 appearances for Arsenal in all competitions, scoring 36 goals and providing 61 assists. \nThe announcement came a day after Arsenal bolstered their attacking line-up with the signing of striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund for a club-record fee.
