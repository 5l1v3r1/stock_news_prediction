YoY quarterly results benefited mostly from lower provision charges for expected credit losses (\"ECL\") totaling $0.8 million in 4Q17 compared to $17.7 million in 4Q16, together with increased fees from letters of credit and syndication activities (+37%), which more than compensated lower NII (-25%) on lower average loan portfolio and margins. 2017 annual results were 23% lower, impacted by lower average loan volumes and margins, as the Bank de-risked and diversified its portfolio mix, and shortened its average loan tenors. This decline was partly compensated by a 45% increase in Net Other income on seven closed syndication transactions, increased letters of credit activity, the absence of non-core trading losses, and a decline of $25.7 million in provision charges for ECL.. Total Operating expenses were up 2% for the year. Recurring operating expenses were actually down 4% YoY, as personnel changes non-recurring expenses resulted in $3.2 million in charges for 2017.\nKey performance metrics:\n2017 Return on Average Equity (\"ROAE\") stood at 8.0%, compared to 8.8% a year ago, as the result of lower profits for 2017 and strong levels of capitalization. Annualized ROAE was 7.9% in 4Q17, unchanged from the 3Q17 and up from 5.3% in 4Q16, on YoY higher profits. The Efficiency Ratio reached 38% in 4Q17 (+6 pt. QoQ, +10 pts. YoY), and 34% for FY17 (+7 pts. YoY), mainly due to non-recurring operating expenses which surpassed total income improvement QoQ, and lower total income generation YoY both on a quarterly and annual basis. The Tier 1 Basel III Capital Ratio increased to 21.1% at Y/E17, compared to 20.3% in 3Q17 and 17.9% at Y/E16, reflecting higher levels of capitalization with risk-weighted assets flat QoQ and down 13% YoY.\nCommercial Portfolio & Quality:\nCommercial Portfolio resumed growth in 4Q17 with EoP balances reaching $6.0 billion at Y/E17 (+5% QoQ, -7% YoY), and 4Q17 average balances totaling $5.8 billion (+3% QoQ, -12% YoY) as credit demand recovered lately across the Region with higher volume of origination, while still down YoY on the Bank's focus of de-risking throughout 2017. FY17 average balances reached $5.9 billion (-14% YoY). Credit quality improved to 1.07% of Loan Portfolio balances at Y/E17, vs. 1.20% in 3Q17 and 1.09% at Y/E16, as non-performing loans (\"NPL\") decreased to $58.8 million at Y/E17, as the net result of write-offs against existing individually allocated reserves, a NPL collection and a credit exposure migration to NPL from underperforming.\nCEO's Comments\nMr. Rubens V. Amaral Jr., Bladex's Chief Executive Officer, stated the following regarding the Bank's 4Q17 and FY17 results: \"2017 proved yet another challenging year for Bladex. Nevertheless, the fourth quarter has confirmed the positive trends of our business as alluded to in the third quarter's earnings release. We increased the end-of-period portfolio balances reversing a stretch of declining activity in previous quarters. Fee income increased in 2017, and we delivered a ROE of 8.0% for the year. The projections for 2018 for economic growth in Latin America have been revised up by the World Bank and the IMF which bodes well for our business this year.\nOur credit quality remains resilient, with NPL levels reduced to 1.07% of total loans at the end of the year, as the Bank continued to finalize agreements on a limited number of exposures that have been closely monitored and had undergone restructuring negotiations for several quarters. During the fourth quarter, the Bank successfully collected a remaining deteriorated exposure in Panama, and wrote off certain non-performing exposures against existing specific provisions.\nOn the other hand, we have adjusted the size of the Bank to reflect the reality of our business, and our determination to improve productivity and efficiency across the organization. This organizational restructuring produced a non-recurring impact on our operating expenses in the fourth quarter related to severance costs. We are confident that with a leaner organization and more efficient processes we have positioned the Bank to achieve our target of excellence throughout the organization, setting the basis to return to higher levels of profitability.\nOur Board of Directors approved to maintain a dividend of US$ 0.385 for the fourth quarter confirming their favorable view of our financial strength and our ability to resume portfolio growth with sustainable double-digit ROEs moving forward. The Bank has a cleaner and stronger balance sheet and has left behind a negative credit cycle which impacted our financial performance in the last two years, and it is ready to resume growth on a sustainable basis.\" Mr. Amaral concluded.\nRECENT EVENTS\nQuarterly dividend payment: At a meeting held January 16, 2018, the Bank's Board of Directors approved a quarterly common dividend of $0.385 per share corresponding to the fourth quarter 2017.
