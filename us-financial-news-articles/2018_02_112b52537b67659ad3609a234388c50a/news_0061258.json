Nick Ward contributed 14 points and six rebounds and Jaren Jackson Jr. chipped in 11 points and six rebounds.\nSpartans star forward Miles Bridges had 10 points but shot 3 of 15 from the field. Bridges was implicated in the FBI probe involving impermissible benefits to college players but was cleared to play by the NCAA on Saturday.\nFreshman Brad Davison scored a career-high 30 points for the Badgers (14-17, 7-11). Ethan Happ added 13 points and six rebounds.\nWith the Spartans up 17-15, Winston made a trio of 3-pointers in a four-minute span as part of a 15-7 run to push the lead to 32-22. Michigan State scored just two more points during the last 3 1/2 minutes but still led 34-27 at halftime.\nThe Spartans remained cold at the start of the second half, going scoreless for nearly 4 1/2 minutes. But they still managed to retain the lead as Wisconsin only scored four points during that span. Ward ended the Spartans’ drought with a runner in the lane.\nThe Badgers tied it at 36-all on two Davison free throws after Ward was called for a technical foul for elbowing Happ. Nick Goins’ three-point play put Michigan State back in front.\nDavison’s long two with 11:32 left tied it again at 42-all. Wisconsin finally took its first lead with 9:55 remaining at 47-45 on a Happ layup.\nWinston’s fifth 3-pointer with 7:09 left gave Michigan State the advantage at 50-49. His next long ball upped the lead to seven at 58-51. That finished off an 11-2 Spartans run.\nThe Badgers crept within two until Bridges made a jumper with 3:35 remaining. Michigan State eventually built the lead up to eight but Davison’s three cut it to 66-63 with five seconds left. Bridges clinched the victory with two free throws.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:59:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
