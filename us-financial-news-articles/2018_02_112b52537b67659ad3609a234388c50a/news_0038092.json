(34 g), providing long range, reliable HD video transmission.\nThe MicroLite 2 provides enhanced performance and video quality, perfect for broadcast applications where high-quality live streaming video is needed. The MicroLite 2 transmitter features HD/SD-SDI and HDMI inputs with COFDM transmission in a small, lightweight chassis. It delivers up to 200mW of power, providing long range, reliable HD video transmission.\nThe Marshall CV502 (HD-SDI) and CV505 (HD-SDI/HDMI) miniature cameras deliver up to 1920x1080p resolution at 60/59.94/50 frame rates. With a very low 0.2 lux (color) rating, the cameras capture accurate, sharp color images even under low-light conditions.
