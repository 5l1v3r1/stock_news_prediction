But here everyone is here for the same reason, which is to have a blast,” she said.\n“It’s really cool to see that camaraderie in snowboarding.”\nMarino, who only switched from skiing at the relatively advanced age of 12, has taken the snowboarding world by storm since making her professional debut and despite this being her first Olympics, she is no stranger to success.\nIn 2016, she became the first woman to land a cab double underflip in slopestyle competition and was a surprise winner of the World Cup big air event at Fenway Park the same year.\nShe followed that up by winning a gold in slopestyle and a bronze in big air at last year’s Aspen X Games.\nTaking a broader view, Marino hopes the success and attention devoted to female American athletes, including skiers Mikaela Shiffrin and Lindsey Vonn, and snowboard sensation Chloe Kim, sent a positive message about the strength of women in sport.\n”It is really good to see women kicking butt in general,“ she said. ”Two years ago, people were thinking we’re not going to be as good as guys or that we are not the best athletes.\n“Just how far we’ve come is insane -- with girls throwing doubles consistently in their runs and linking up difficult tricks -- is really cool for promoting women’s snowboarding and women’s athletic potential in general.”\nReporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T19:14:17.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
