This has never been an inexpensive endeavor, but the need for further sophistication and computing power has the bills growing larger each year and there are no signs of a slowdown on the horizon.\nTake, for example, the largest three U.S.-based operators of cloud computing services. Amazon.com , AMZN -0.81% Microsoft MSFT 3.73% and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL 3.83% Google had a combined $41.6 billion in capital expenditures and capital lease deals in 2017. That is up 33% from the previous year and represents an acceleration from the 23% growth in spending seen in 2016. Not all of this goes to data-center construction, though all three have identified network expansion as a major area of focus for their capital spending plans.\nA broader group of companies shows a similar trend. Nineteen cloud service operators tracked by RBC Capital Markets spent a total of $63.8 billion in 2017, up 22% from the previous year. RBC analyst Amit Daryanani projected on Thursday that this total will rise 27% this year to a little over $81 billion. Analysts for KeyBanc Capital Markets also have projected 27% growth in cloud capital expenditures this year.\nWhy the jump? Demand for cloud-computing services remains hot and shows no signs of slowing down. Amazon’s AWS division saw revenue surge 43% for the year to $17.5 billion. Microsoft’s Azure service nearly doubled its revenue to about $5.3 billion, estimates J.P. Morgan. Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company, said that its Google Cloud Platform service is now generating about $1 billion in revenue per quarter, though the company doesn’t report detailed results for that business.\nThat bodes well for companies supplying the weapons for this particular arms race. Nvidia , NVDA 6.69% whose chips are used to enhance artificial intelligence in cloud networks, posted its seventh consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth for its data-center business on Thursday. Intel Corp. INTC 2.81% surprised investors last month with a 20% jump in revenue for its own data-center segment. Arista Networks , which sells specialized networking gear to all of the major cloud providers, is expected to post a 41% jump in fourth-quarter revenue when it reports quarterly results on Thursday.\nThis level of investment is justified by the large growth opportunity ahead. Spending on cloud services is still a relatively small portion of total corporate information technology spending. KeyBanc analysts project that total cloud revenue will hit $314 billion by 2022—triple the current level. For the companies already ahead in this race, there is little incentive to tap on the brakes now.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T19:50:48.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
