There is no cap on the number of sports machines, which allow players to bet on the results of soccer games or horse races.\nReporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T14:34:39.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
