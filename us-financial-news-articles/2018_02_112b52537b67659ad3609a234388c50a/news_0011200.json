Net income was $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share and includes a one-time non-cash charge of $0.5 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) as discussed later in this release. For the fourth quarter 2016, net income was $1.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Gross profit margin was 75.5 percent, compared to 78.2 percent for the fourth quarter 2016. Domestic sales were 79.4 percent of total revenue, compared to 85.5 percent for the fourth quarter 2016. Revenue from sales of our patient vital signs monitor was $0.9 million for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $0.1 million for the fourth quarter 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income was $1.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which excludes stock compensation expense, net of tax of $0.5 million and a one-time non-cash charge of $0.5 million resulting from the TCJA that is discussed later in this release. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $1.3 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.10, compared to $0.11 for the fourth quarter 2016. Free cash flow was $1.3 million, compared to $2.0 million for the fourth quarter 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenue of $23.1 million compared to $32.5 million for the same period in 2016. Net income was $0.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share and includes a one-time non-cash charge of $0.5 million related to the TCJA as discussed later in this release. For the full year 2016, net income was $7.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. Gross profit margin was 75.9 percent, compared to 81.1 percent for the same period in 2016. Domestic sales were 84.5 percent of total revenue, compared to 88.9 percent for the same period in 2016. Revenue from sales of our patient vital signs monitor was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.1 million for the full year 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income was $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which excludes stock compensation expense, net of tax of $1.6 million and a one-time non-cash charge of $0.5 million resulting from the TCJA that is discussed later in this release. Non-GAAP net income for the full year 2016 was $8.4 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.22 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.70 for the same period in 2016. Free cash flow was $2.6 million for the full year 2017, compared to $8.6 million for the same period in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had combined cash and investments of $26.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased $1.8 million of its common stock.\n“I am very pleased with the strong finish to 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 revenue was nearly 12% higher than in the fourth quarter last year and nearly 18% higher than in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, I am pleased with our accomplishments this year, especially in the areas of engineering and regulatory affairs. Working together, our engineering and regulatory affairs teams obtained FDA 510(k) clearance of our new MRI compatible patient vital signs monitor in October 2017. Additionally, the regulatory affairs team secured quality certifications that are required to sell our products in various markets including the European Union and Japan,” said Roger Susi, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\n“From a sales viewpoint, our sales team has made solid progress executing on our critical care strategy as shown by higher volumes of multi-pump orders placed by our customers during 2017. With the highly positive initial response to our revolutionary new patient monitor and momentum building in IV pump bookings, we look forward to an exciting 2018 and expect accelerated revenue growth from our current product offerings through 2019,” said Susi.\nImpact of Tax Reform\nNet income for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 was negatively impacted as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) enacted on December 22, 2017. As a result of the TCJA, IRADIMED is required to revalue its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates on these deferred amounts. The reduction in the U.S. Federal corporate tax rate negatively impacted IRADIMED’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings but is expected to positively impact IRADIMED’s future earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2017, IRADIMED performed a preliminary analysis to determine the impact of the revaluation of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Based on this analysis, IRADIMED recorded a one-time non-cash charge to income tax expense of $0.5 million. The impact of the TCJA on fourth quarter and full year earnings was excluded for purposes of calculating non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nFinancial Guidance\nOn January 22, 2018, the Company provided revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings guidance for the full year and first quarter 2018.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects to report revenue of $29.3 million to $30.0 million, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22 to $0.27 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.33 to $0.38.\nFor the first quarter 2018, the Company expects to report revenue of $6.8 million to $6.9 million, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.04 to $0.05 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.06 to $0.07.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP earnings per share guidance excludes stock-based compensation expense, net of tax, which the Company expects to be approximately $1.3 million and $0.3 million for the full year and first quarter 2018, respectively.\nUse of non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company believes the use of non-GAAP net income, free cash flow and infrequent income tax items are helpful to our investors. These measures, which we refer to as our non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We calculate non-GAAP net income as net income excluding stock-based compensation expense, net of tax. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash expenses, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows for meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to our shareholders via share repurchases. Infrequent tax items are considered based on their nature and are excluded from the provision for income taxes as these costs or benefits are not indicative of our normal or future provision for income taxes. All of our non-GAAP financial measures are important tools for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our operating results.\nA reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the respective periods can be found in the table later in this release immediately following the condensed statements of cash flows. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of the Company’s operating performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are not indicative of net income or cash provided by operating activities.\nConference Call\nIRADIMED has scheduled a conference call to discuss this announcement beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today, February 6, 2018.

We are the only known provider of a non-magnetic intravenous (“IV”) infusion pump system that is specifically designed to be safe for use during MRI procedures. We were the first to develop an infusion delivery system that largely eliminates many of the dangers and problems present during MRI procedures. Standard infusion pumps contain magnetic and electronic components which can create radio frequency interference and are dangerous to operate in the presence of the powerful magnet that drives an MRI system. Our patented MRidium® MRI compatible IV infusion pump system has been designed with a non-magnetic ultrasonic motor, uniquely-designed non-ferrous parts and other special features in order to safely and predictably deliver anesthesia and other IV fluids during various MRI procedures. Our pump solution provides a seamless approach that enables accurate, safe and dependable fluid delivery before, during and after an MRI scan, which is important to critically-ill patients who cannot be removed from their vital medications, and children and infants who must generally be sedated in order to remain immobile during an MRI scan.\nOur 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system has been designed with non-magnetic components and other special features in order to safely and accurately monitor a patient’s vital signs during various MRI procedures. The IRADIMED 3880 system operates dependably in magnetic fields up to 30,000 gauss, which means it can operate virtually anywhere in the MRI scanner room. The IRADIMED 3880 has a compact, lightweight design allowing it to travel with the patient from their critical care unit, to the MRI and back, resulting in increased patient safety through uninterrupted vital signs monitoring and decreasing the amount of time critically ill patients are away from critical care units. The features of the IRADIMED 3880 include: wireless ECG with dynamic gradient filtering; wireless SpO2 using Masimo® algorithms; non-magnetic respiratory CO2; non-invasive blood pressure; patient temperature, and; optional advanced multi-gas anesthetic agent unit featuring continuous Minimum Alveolar Concentration measurements. The IRADIMED 3880 MRI compatible patient vital signs monitoring system has an easy-to-use design and allows for the effective communication of patient vital signs information to clinicians.\nFor more information please visit www.iradimed.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995, particularly statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, plans, intentions, future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategies.
