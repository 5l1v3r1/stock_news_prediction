That was up 48 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement.\nThe firmer prices came after crude registered its biggest loss in two years last week as stock markets slumped.\nBut with U.S. stock markets rebounding on Friday and Asian markets seemingly steadying on Monday, analysts said crude was also supported.\n“The bounce in U.S. stocks means some catch-up is possible (for oil),” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.\nMcKenna said markets on Monday were quiet as “the incentive for traders in Australia or Asia to do anything without the lead of the U.S. is likely to be lacking,” referring to recent U.S. stock market volatility.\nIt is also a holiday in Japan.\nBut oil markets still face soaring U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has risen above 10 million barrels per day (bpd), overtaking top exporter Saudi Arabia and coming within reach of top producer Russia.\nThere is a strong indication that output will rise further.\nU.S. energy companies added 26 oil rigs looking for new production this week, boosting the count to 791, the highest since April 2015, General Electric’s <GE.N Baker> Hughes energy services said on Friday.\nThe soaring U.S. ouput is undermining efforts led by OPEC and Russia to withhold production in order to push up prices.\nThe cuts started in 2017 and are set to last through 2018.\nReporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:43:11.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
