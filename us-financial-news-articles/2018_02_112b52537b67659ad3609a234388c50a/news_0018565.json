(Nasdaq:CORI), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of specialty transdermal products, today announced unaudited financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, and reported on recent corporate developments. Corium's fiscal year ends on September 30.\nCorporate Highlights\nDosing commenced in final treatment period of Corplex™ Donepezil pivotal trial — In January, Corium commenced the second and final treatment period of its Corplex Donepezil pivotal bioequivalence (BE) study, which compares the company’s once-weekly transdermal patch to daily oral Aricept ® (donepezil hydrochloride). The pivotal BE study design is a streamlined version of the successful pilot BE trial, and is a single center, randomized, multiple dose, two-way crossover study in healthy volunteers, conducted at the same clinical site as the pilot BE trial. The dosing in the second treatment period is scheduled to be completed in February; top-line results are expected in the second quarter of calendar 2018. Ancillary studies underway in preparation for NDA — Corium is conducting ancillary studies that are required in the New Drug Application (NDA) data package for Corplex Donepezil, including standard skin tolerability and alternative patch application site studies, which are underway, and a heat effects study planned to commence in February. Corium is targeting submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA in the fourth quarter of calendar 2018. Corium joined NASDAQ Biotechnology Index — In December, Corium was added to the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (NBI) as part of the NBI’s annual re-ranking. Companies in the NBI must meet certain requirements, including minimum market capitalization and average daily trading volume, among other criteria. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index forms the basis for a number of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), including the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF.\n\"During the quarter, we continued to build on the momentum created in fiscal 2017,” said Peter D. Staple, President and Chief Executive Officer of Corium. “Our proprietary Corplex Donepezil program has moved forward at a rapid pace; we generated our first human data in 2016 and are actively working towards filing an NDA by the end of this year. In parallel, we have been conducting formulation and feasibility work on preclinical candidates that represent substantial market opportunities, most of which could also benefit from a similar bioequivalence development path. In our partner-based business, we are working with Agile Therapeutics to address questions from the FDA relating to Twirla ® , Agile’s once-weekly contraceptive patch, which we believe represents a significant upside opportunity. We are also in the process of expanding manufacturing capacity for Procter & Gamble’s Crest ® Whitestrips, as global demand for these products increases.”\nFinancial Results for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nCorium reported total revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $9.3 million, compared with $7.0 million in the same period of fiscal 2017. Product revenues increased for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to same period of fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in revenues from Procter & Gamble for Crest ® Whitestrips and an increase in revenues from Mayne Pharma for our Fentanyl transdermal delivery system (TDS), partially offset by a reduction in demand from Mayne Pharma for Clonidine TDS. Contract research and development revenues increased for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period of fiscal 2017, primarily resulting from increased activities supporting Agile’s development program for Twirla.\nTotal research and development (R&D) expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $13.8 million compared with $8.1 million in the same period of fiscal 2017. The increase in total R&D expenses was driven by Corium’s investment in its proprietary product programs, primarily the advancement of Corplex Donepezil into its pivotal BE trial.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $3.3 million compared with $3.0 million for the same period of fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation costs.\nCorium reported a net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $13.3 million, or $0.37 per share, compared with a net loss of $10.4 million, or $0.46 per share, in the same period of fiscal 2017. As of December 31, 2017, there were 36,117,913 shares of Corium common stock outstanding, and as of December 31, 2016, there were 22,557,450 shares of Corium common stock outstanding, so comparisons of per share losses between periods may not be useful to investors.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 were $45.2 million.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nCorium will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET (2:00 p.m. PT) to discuss the financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.
