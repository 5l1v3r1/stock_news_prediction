We’re looking for a wider margin of safety at this point,” Kon said in a telephone interview.\nA BUYING OPPORTUNITY? Wells Fargo stock has risen 12 percent in the last 12 months, lagging the S&P Financials Sector’s 26 percent increase as litigation expenses related to the scandal helped inflate its costs.\nFor all of 2017, the bank had costs of $58.5 billion, which translated into an efficiency ratio of 66.2 cents in costs per dollar of revenue, higher than its own target range of 55 to 59 cents.\nThe bank expects to spend less this year, estimating non-interest costs at up to $54.5 billion, but growing revenue would help it meet its efficiency ratio more easily.\nAfter the Fed dropped its bombshell on Friday, Wells shares fell 6 percent in after hours trading.\nFor some investors, that presents a buying opportunity.\n“Wells will get it right,” said Christopher C. Grisanti of Grisanti Capital Management LLC in New York. “They have strategically assembled a terrific set of assets in and after the financial crisis, including the largest mortgage portfolio in the United States.”\n“We would be long term buyers in weakness.”\nThe bank reached a $190 million settlement with U.S. authorities in 2016 over its employees opening accounts in customers’ names without their permission to hit sales targets. The tally of fake accounts has since risen to potentially as many as 3.5 million. Separately, thousands of auto-loan and mortgage customers were potentially overcharged.\nSince the 2016 settlement, Wells has taken steps to enhance oversight at the board level, centralize risk-management functions and install new executives to oversee key businesses and control functions. Its board chair, Betsy Duke, is a former Fed governor, and it recently hired Sarah Dahlgren, a former New York Fed official, as its head of regulatory relations.\nThe Fed said on Friday that the bank will replace three current board members by April and a fourth by the end of 2018. Wells had previously said it would add new directors this year, with three expected to retire before its April shareholder meeting.\nThe bank must submit a plan to the Fed within 60 days detailing how it has enhanced oversight from its board of directors and improved compliance and risk management functions, and how it plans to improve further.\nOnce the Fed approves those plans, Wells will hire third-party consultants to review them and monitor its progress until the regulator is satisfied.\nAnalysts do not expect the Fed to ease up under the leadership of its new chair, Jerome Powell.\n“The bank will continue to face tough oversight,” said John Heinlein, CEO of Horan Capital Management, in Maryland, which has about 316,000 Wells Fargo shares.\n“Wells Fargo has its work cut out for it over the next few years.”\nWriting by Carmel Crimmins; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T08:35:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
