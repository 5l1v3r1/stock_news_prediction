It does get us away from trillion-dollar deficits,\" Mulvaney said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\"Just because this deal was signed does not mean the future is written in stone. We do have a chance still to change the trajectory. And that is what the budget will show tomorrow,\" he said.\n \nBut critics are likely to say this year's Trump plan, which promises 3 percent growth, continuing low inflation, and low interest yields on U.S. Treasury bills despite a flood of new borrowing, underestimates the mounting cost of financing the government's $20 trillion-plus debt.\nThe White House is putting focus this year on Trump's long-overdue plan to boost spending on the nation's crumbling infrastructure. The  \nPresidential budgets tend to reprise many of the same elements year after year. While details aren't out yet, Trump's budget is likely to curb crop insurance costs, cut student loan subsidies, reduce pension benefits for federal workers and cut food stamps, among other proposals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T16:45:09.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
