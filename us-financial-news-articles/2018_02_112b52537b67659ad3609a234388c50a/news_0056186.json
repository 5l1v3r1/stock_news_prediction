In other words, major European stock markets' relative underperformance could be the weakness showing its head before other markets follow suit.\n• Broadening global participation has been central to Oppenheimer's positive outlook, given the evidence that around major market tops, typically at least one major market average begins to break down ahead of the others.\n• In early February, the Europe Stoxx 50 index broke through its 200-day moving average and hasn't been able to recapture that level in the following weeks.\n\n• If this weakness continues, it would put the firm's overall bullish view in question. Wald and his firm believe it's too early to make such a call, because typically these divergences could take months to develop. At the least this weakness confirms Oppenheimer's recommendation to go overweight U.S. equities versus European equities from a portfolio standpoint.\nBottom line: European stocks are set to underperform U.S. equity markets, according to Oppenheimer, and could point to broad global equity market trouble. \nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
