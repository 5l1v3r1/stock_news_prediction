He is the most senior government official to confirm the appeal publicly.\n“It won’t be easy,” he added.\nMilan lost its bid for the authority in November, when a tied vote among European Union ministers forced the winner to be chosen by drawing lots from a fishbowl. The agency must leave its current home in London when Britain leaves the EU.
