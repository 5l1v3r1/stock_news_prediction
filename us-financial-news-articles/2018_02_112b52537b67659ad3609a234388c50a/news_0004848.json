Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal -- come to 265 million pounds, representing 62 percent of total gross spending. \nThis contrasted against last season’s trend where half of gross expenditure came from the bottom-six clubs in a bid to retain their Premier League status. \n“Such is the level of competition for a coveted top-four position in the Premier League, as well as ongoing European battles, that top clubs have been willing to break with more traditional summer investment strategies to steal a march on their rivals mid-season,” Jones added.
