Most analysts expect no change for the rest of 2018, though some predict a rate increase in the second half of this year.\nThe core inflation rate, which strips out energy and fresh food prices, was seen at 0.60 percent in February, also little changed from January’s 0.58 percent, the poll showed.\nThailand’s manufacturing production index (MPI) in January may have increased 3.0 percent from a year earlier after rising 2.35 percent in the previous month.\nReporting by Orathai Sriring and Chinthathip Nanthavong; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:53:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
