REUTERS/Jorge Duenes \nThe border wall was a signature issue for Trump in his 2016 presidential election campaign. He pledged that Mexico would pay for the wall, which the Mexican government has insisted it will not do. \nDemocrats sharply oppose the wall, which Trump has said is aimed at keeping out illegal immigrants and drug smugglers. \nThe new fencing would be constructed in areas known to be used by migrants crossing into the United States, the official said. \nWall funding has been caught up in a debate over how to protect young “Dreamers,” people who were brought to the country illegally as children. \nTrump has offered to give the Dreamers protection from deportation and a pathway to citizenship over 10 to 12 years, in exchange for $25 billion in wall funding and tightened restrictions on legal immigration, but Democrats have balked at the terms.
