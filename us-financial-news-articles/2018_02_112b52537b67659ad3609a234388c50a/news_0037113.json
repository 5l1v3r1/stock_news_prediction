Asked on local television whether it was more likely NAFTA would survive or die, Videgaray said there were reasons to be reasonably optimistic, but that Mexico should be prepared for all eventualities. “We should be prepared for a future with, or without NAFTA,” he said. The three countries are renegotiating the 1994 pact, but talks have stalled as Canada and Mexico deal with demands from the United States, which has threatened to withdraw.
