They are, however, holding up relatively well compared to the more than 4 percent slumps on Wall Street yesterday. The STOXX 600 is set for its worst day since the Brexit vote and its worst seven-day fall in two years. Cyclical sectors are leading the plunge, with oil & gas, autos, and basic resources stocks the worst-performing. Financials, the stars of the New Year rally, are the biggest weight on the STOXX with Credit Suisse among the worst fallers, down 5 percent. Some $4 trillion has been wiped off global equities in this sell-off, and counting: UNWIND OF SHORT VOLATILITY PLAYS SHAKES MARKET (0739 GMT) With the VIX shooting up in U.S. trading, its biggest one-day jump in more than two years, investors are rushing to unwind big positions in ETF products shorting the VIX and take out options protecting themselves against a further slide in stocks. Our colleagues in New York reported overall VIX options volume hit 3.6 million contracts, or about three times the daily average. The VelocityShares Inverse VIX short-term ETN sank 86 percent and the ProShares Short VIX short-term futures ETF fell nearly 80 percent. Investors said the inverse ETF products may be liquidated after suffering these heavy losses. Credit Suisse, the issuer of the VelocityShares inverse ETF, is seen down as much as 10 percent at the open, according to a trader. The UBS VelocityShares VSTOXX inverse ETF, which shorts the European volatility gauge, plunged 21 percent yesterday in New York. (Helen Reid) \"WE'RE IN UNCHARTED WATERS\" (0729 GMT) As we've seen European stock futures are pointing to heavy losses at the open and investors are trying to make sense about what could come next, as inflation worries have pushed Wall Street's volatility index to its highest since August 2015. \"Price action is clearly driven by technical factors, tied to a brutal awakening of stock volatility,\" said Alessandro Balsotti, head of asset management at JCI Capital Ltd. \"We are undoubtedly in uncharted waters,\" he adds. \"The first instinct as an asset allocator is to take advantage of this dip to add equity exposure. Also to exploit the decline in yields to further reduce duration... Ultimately I think the robust economic phase will be able to withstand the bloodshed on volatility. The real danger for 2018 remains that the transition from a deflationary mentality to an inflationary one will... not be simple at all for the market and investors,\" he said. (Danilo Masoni) EUROPEAN STOCK FUTURES PLUMMET (0710 GMT) European equity index futures have opened down sharply confirming earlier indications from financial spreadbetters for declines of around 4 percent. Here's your snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) EARLY MORNING EUROPEAN HEADLINE ROUND-UP (0644 GMT) Corporate news is unlikely to have much impact today as investors prepare for broad sell-off at the open that could see top European stock benchmarks fall as much as 5 percent.
