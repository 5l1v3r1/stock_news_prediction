The policy by former President Barack Obama's administration aimed to push states to adopt cleaner forms of energy such as natural gas, wind and solar power.\nHowever, because of regulatory procedures, it could take years for the administration to repeal the plan, and expected lawsuits and other legal challenges could delay that further.\nCalifornia, known for tough anti-smog laws, has firmly lined up in support of the plan and is expected to exceed the required reductions. It is expected to get a third of its power from renewable energy sources by 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T21:04:39.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
