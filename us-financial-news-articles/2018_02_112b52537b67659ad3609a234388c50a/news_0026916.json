A single bitcoin is worth more than $8000, compared with $1000 a year ago.\nDespite the surge it remains unclear how many Americans hold cryptocurrencies as these are bought and sold on online platforms, sometimes anonymously or using pseudonyms. US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase says it has 10 million users, although it is unclear how many of these are in the U.S.\nJagjit Chawla, general manager for Credit Karma Tax said the company was not too surprised that few people had reported cryptocurrency gains as Americans with more complex tax situations tend to file closer to the deadline.\n“However, given the popularity of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2017, we’d expect more people to be reporting,” Chawla said in a statement.\nThe deadline for filing taxes this is year is April 17.\nThe IRS projects that around 156 million individuals will file this year.\nAround 1 million people filed their taxes with Credit Karma’s service last year.\nReporting by Anna Irrera\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T10:37:57.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
