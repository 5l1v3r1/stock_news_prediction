Danuta Hubner, who is steering it through parliament, said in a report on Friday that it needed amending, but she stopped short of ditching outright the controversial forced relocation element.\nThe ability to deny recognition to a foreign clearing house is a last resort tool that should remain in place as an insurance mechanism to protect the financial stability of the EU, the report said.\n“However, the process of denying recognition should be made more fact-based and evidence-based and offer more certainty to market actors,” the report said.\nA decision to deny recognition should be based on “a prior impact analysis and consider clear criteria”.\nSuch reports help lawmakers reach an agreed position before thrashing out a final version with EU states, with many changes likely along the way.\nThe report said the definition of what would constitute a “systemic” foreign clearing house should be made far more granular by including its network of direct and indirect clients.\nHow easy or difficult it would be for a customer to find an alternative clearing house should also be taken into account, the report said.\nEU regulators would have to study the “potential consequences, in terms of costs and benefits” of forcing a foreign clearing house to seek authorisation to operate in the bloc, it added.\nWhere a decision is taken to require relocation of clearing, there should be an “appropriate adaptation period” during which temporary recognition could continue, the report said.\nForeign clearing houses should also get 10 working days to respond to a request from EU regulators for information rather than the 72 hours proposed in the European Commission’s draft law.
