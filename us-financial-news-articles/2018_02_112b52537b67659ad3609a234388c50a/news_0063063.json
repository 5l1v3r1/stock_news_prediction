Flowers for around 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), people close to the matter said.\nThe HSH HoldCo combines the stakes of the German regional states of Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg, which own 89 percent in HSH Nordbank, with the holdings local savings banks hold 5.9 percent.\nJ.C. Flowers separately holds a 5.1 percent stake in HSH Nordbank.\nA separate HSH shareholder meeting of the HSH HoldCo was expected to approve the sale later on Tuesday with the final decision to be presented to the public on Wednesday.\nWhile the headline price for the core bank is higher than originally expected, non-performing assets were sold at steep discounts, blurring the bottom line outcome for the sellers.\nFollowing EU demands, the privatisation of HSH needed to be finalised by the end of February.\nHSH’s owners declined to comment.
