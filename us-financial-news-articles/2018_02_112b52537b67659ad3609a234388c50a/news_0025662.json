Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said at Sochi that he would decide the criteria for committee members and select about 50 people from government, opposition and independent groups.\nThe main opposition negotiating group, which boycotted the Sochi meeting, said afterwards that it would cooperate with the formation of a constitutional committee so long as it would be under U.N. auspices.\nSyria’s government said at the time that it welcomed the results of the Sochi meeting, but it made no mention then of the constitutional committee or call for democratic elections.\n“De Mistura is a facilitator and not a mediator or a stand-in for other parties,” Soussan said on Tuesday.\nNine rounds of U.N.-sponsored peace talks, most of them in Geneva, have failed to bring Syria’s warring sides together after seven years of a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes.\nRussia has pushed a parallel diplomatic process that is regarded with suspicion by much of the Syrian opposition.\nPresident Bashar al-Assad’s government in 2012 announced voters had overwhelmingly approved a new constitution in a referendum, conducted amid civil war bloodshed, that was derided as a sham by Assad’s critics at home and abroad.\nThe new basic law maintained real power in the presidency but dropped a clause that in effect granted Assad’s Baath Party a monopoly on power.\n(This version of the story has been refiled to change dateline to Damascus)\nReporting by Kinda Makieh in Damascus, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T14:43:12.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
