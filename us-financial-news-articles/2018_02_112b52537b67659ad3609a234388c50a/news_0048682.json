We talked about it before the third period. We were down one goal and let’s be historic here, I mean the first time Norway’s in the quarter-final, and it’s been 24 years since we won a game in the Olympics.”\nIce Hockey - - Men's Playoff Match - Slovenia v Norway - Gangneung Hockey Centre, Gangneung, South Korea - February 20, 2018 - Players of Norway's team celebrate their win. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Norway last notched an Olympic ice hockey victory at their own games in Lillehammer in 1994, beating Austria 3-1 in the final consolation game to avoid the wooden spoon.\nSlovenia, which has had three of its four Olympic games go into overtime, was the first on the board, with Jan Urbas scoring on a first-period powerplay on an assist from captain Jan Mursak while Norway’s Ludvig Hoff was off for hooking.\nSlideshow (9 Images) The lead lasted into the third period, when Norway, winless in three group-stage games, leveled it. Martin Roymark sent a pass across the goal crease and Tommy Kristiansen tapped it past Kroselj.\n“I got a great pass, and I see the goalie was going home to the post and I tried to get it in the other side and it was going in so it was really nice,” Kristiansen said.\nBefore his goal, Norway had scored only twice in the tournament, and heading into the game were the second-lowest scoring team after South Korea, who have just one.\nThe game started right after the Court of Arbitration for Sport announced Slovenian forward Ziga Jeglic had tested positive for a banned substance and would be suspended for the rest of the Games.\nJeglic had netted the game-winning shootout goal for Slovenia in their final group-stage game against Slovakia on Saturday and was a major presence on the ice for the Slovenians. Several of his team mates said after the game they did not know what was behind his sudden absence.\nIn a statement issued by the Slovenian’s Olympic committee, Jeglic said he had been taking an asthma medication that contained the banned substance Fenoterol and he had neglected to declare it and seek an exception.\nAsked if the loss of Jeglic had affected his team, Slovenia coach Kari Savolainen said: “Of course, of course. Still I‘m proud of the team. They showed great energy on the ice.”\nReporting By Dan Burns; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T12:55:35.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
