I grew up doing gymnastics and basically every other sport imaginable so depending what it involved it could be cool.”\nDIFFERENT FOCUS The circus life, however, is not for everyone. The transition from athlete competitor to performer can be awkward and jarring.\nWhile the skills and discipline required to become a high-performance athlete translate nicely into the show business environment, the single-minded focus needed to peak for one moment every four years is very different from the mindset needed for a 10-show working week.\n”The main difference is when you are an athlete you really focus on one event,“ explained Becker. ”If it is the Olympics you have that goal once every four years so it is a very different mentality having to perform night after night.\n”It is almost like if you had a competition every night or twice a night because the public are your judges.\n“You might not be at your peak level every night like when you are doing the Olympics or a world championships but you have to find a way to sustain an effort.”\nFor Suzannah Bianco, who won a gold medal for the United States in synchronized swimming at the 1996 Olympic Games, career options were limited after she left the pool.\nA mermaid in a Florida amusement park or coaching were two options before Cirque knocked on her door offering her a chance to perform in their show “O” in Las Vegas.\n“The toughest transition was the rewiring of the mind,” Bianco told Reuters. “In athletic performance it is not the same -- you are looking for perfection, pushing through, the performance is the most important thing.”\n“Giving up that sense of perfection for a sense of continual progress was a big transition.”\nBecker said Cirque and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) looked at athletes and sporting trends through the same lens, understanding there was a constant need to stay fresh and appeal to a constantly evolving audience.\nThat is why Cirque is paying particular attention to events such as Big Air and slopestyle.\nLast year, Cirque held a research and development workshop bringing in athletes from these sports and asking them to try Cirque equipment using their specific acrobatic technique.\n“Cirque has a mandate to renew ourselves in terms of content and we have a mandate to wow people and surprise them,” said Becker.\n”We have been looking at people coming from snowboarding, from halfpipe, from non-traditional acrobatic movements, because gymnasts have a very specific way of doing acrobatics, people coming from those new alternative sports are flipping completely differently.\n“It is very teasing and exciting because it offers new possibilities.”\nAdditional reporting Jack Tarrant; Editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T06:31:20.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
