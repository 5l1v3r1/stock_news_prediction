As a result, we are currently forecasting that our first quarter 2018 revenue will be lower than the $131.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017.\"\nFor the first quarter ending on March 31, 2018, FormFactor is providing the following guidance*:\nU.S. GAAP Reconciling Items** Non-GAAP Revenue $112 million to $120 million $112 million to $120 million Gross Margin 34% to 37% $7 million 40% to 43% Net income per diluted share -$0.05 to $0.01 $0.12 to $0.18 *This guidance assumes consistent foreign currency rates.\n**Reconciling items are stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and integration expenses.\n“We remain confident in FormFactor’s customer diversification and secular growth trends in our end markets, opportunities to expand margins and grow our top and bottom line in 2018 and beyond. Our structurally profitable financial model continues to deliver strong earnings growth and cash flow. We reiterate our target model of revenue of $650 million and $1.50 in earnings per share, supported by semiconductor growth trends that should favorably benefit FormFactor, particularly in advanced packaging, mobile data and automotive applications” concluded Dr. Slessor.\nWe have posted our revenue breakdown by region and market segment on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.formfactor.com .

Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per fully-diluted share are among the primary indicators used by management as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods, and by management and our board of directors to determine whether our operating performance has met certain targets and thresholds. Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per fully-diluted share when evaluating operating performance because it believes that the exclusion of the items indicated herein, for which the amounts or timing may vary significantly depending upon our activities and other factors, facilitates comparability of our operating performance from period to period. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business as an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Many investors also prefer to track free cash flow, as opposed to only GAAP earnings. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, and therefore it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. We have chosen to provide this non-GAAP information to investors so they can analyze our operating results closer to the way that management does, and use this information in their assessment of our business and the valuation of our company. We compute non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP fully-diluted earnings per share by adjusting GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per fully-diluted share to remove the impact of certain items and the tax effect of those adjustments. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and may be materially different from other non-GAAP measures, including similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, net income or earnings per fully-diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. We may expect to continue to incur expenses of a nature similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per fully-diluted share should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. For more information on the non-GAAP adjustments, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of non-GAAP Net Income” and “Reconciliation of Cash Provided By Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow” included in this press release.\nSource: FormFactor, Inc.\nFORM-F\nInvestor Contact:\nStan Finkelstein\nInvestor Relations\n(925) 290-4321\nir@formfactor.com\nSource:FormFactor, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/908af6da-784e-49e1-b688-6af044fd9c72"], "published": "2018-02-08T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T02:14:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
