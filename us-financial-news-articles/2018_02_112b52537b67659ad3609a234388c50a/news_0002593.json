He started yesterday, was still not completely well. I have to assess with the medical department how fit he can be.” \nWenger revealed that he would take a late call on midfielder Jack Wilshere, who is also unwell. \n“We hope he is capable of being in the squad, he is better. He will practice with the team today and we will see how he feels,” Wenger added. \nThe manager said Armenia midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan, another of Arsenal’s recruits in the January transfer window, is in line to start against ninth-placed Everton. \nWenger, however, kept his cards close to his chest when asked if the attacking quartet of Aubameyang, Mkhitaryan, Mesut Ozil and Alexandre Lacazette could play together on Saturday. \n“It’s always possible. Will I do it? Maybe, I don’t know. But it is possible, yes,” Wenger added. \n“We can play two up (front) as well. One up or two up. You need at least two top strikers to play in the Premier League because if one gets injured you have a problem.” \nArsenal are sixth in the table with 42 points from 25 games.
