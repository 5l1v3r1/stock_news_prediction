The rest of the city has been in the hands of the Syrian army since it drove rebels from other neighbourhoods in late 2016 with the help of Russia and Iran.\nThe witness in the city said government forces and workers for state institutions had entered the al-Halak, Bani Zaid and Bustan al-Basha neighbourhoods in Aleppo. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group, said government forces had started to enter the neighbourhoods in the north of the city held by Kurdish forces.\nYPG spokesman Nouri Mahmoud denied that any government forces or institutions had gone into the zone under their control.\nOn Tuesday, pro-Damascus militias entered the Afrin region in northwest Syria to help the YPG defend against an offensive by Turkey and its allied anti-Assad rebel factions.\nDuring the seven-year-old war, Damascus and the YPG have largely avoided direct conflict and have each allowed each other to hold small enclaves within their territory.\nKurdish leaders say they seek autonomy as part of Syria, while President Bashar al-Assad says he wants to restore state rule over the whole country.\nReporting by Angus McDowall; Editing by Peter Graff and Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T12:13:41.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
