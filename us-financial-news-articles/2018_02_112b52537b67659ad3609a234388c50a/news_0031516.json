Alternatively, if the Fed doesn’t act fast enough and falls behind the curve on policy, it could end up pushing up long-term bond yields. In either scenario, traders worry that U.S. growth could be hampered.\nThere were some indications such fears are beginning to subside, with Wall Street shares rebounding strongly on Monday and MSCI’s all-country world index .MIWD PUS of stock performance rising 1.2 percent.\nStill, market players are not convinced the worst is over.\nThe 10-year U.S. bond yield hit a four-year high of 2.902 percent US10YT=RR while the 30-year yield rose to 11-month high of 3.199 percent US30YT=RR.\n“Rise in long-term bond yields lifts mortgage lending costs and is likely to cool the economy,” said Minori Uchida, chief FX analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\nUchida said the dollar is likely to remain under pressure against the yen.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:39:20.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
