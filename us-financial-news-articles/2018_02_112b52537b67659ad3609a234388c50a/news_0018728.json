The acquisition will combine ISI's management expertise and superior manufacturing processes with RxOil's proprietary technology and high-yield capabilities to create a preeminent global supplier of cannabis extracts.\n\"I've never been so excited in my life to be joining a team like this,\" said Brandon Kidd of RxOil. \"The company has proven itself to be a best-in-class operator within the industry, and the synergy amongst the team members is exceptional.\"\nKidd believes that with ISI's proprietary platform, RxOil will be able to realize its business plan and extend the reach of current products, develop new branded products for niche markets and vastly expand their extraction capabilities well beyond all legal states in the near future.\nISI Labs, Inc. is focused on becoming the largest extraction company in the world through the creation and management of numerous facilities and brands, including the newly acquired RxOil.
