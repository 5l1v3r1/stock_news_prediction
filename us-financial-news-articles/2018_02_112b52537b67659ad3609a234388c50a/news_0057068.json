It features improved cameras, an artificial intelligence-powered voice tool, and social media functions that are easier to deploy than previous offerings.\nNew features include an automatic super-slow motion camera setting that looks primed to show up on Instagram feeds soon, and software that turns selfies into instant emojis.\nSamsung’s AI-powered Bixby service allows S9 users to point its camera to translate a foreign-language sign, without having to swipe through menus or choose settings every time.\nSamsung also plans to boost smartphone accessories such as wireless chargers and mobile docking station that allows smartphone features on desktop, a senior Samsung executive said.\nYounghee Lee, head of Samsung’s Marketing for the Mobile Business, declined to provide a sales forecast for the S9.\nResearch firm Counterpoint forecasts it will sell 43 million sets in 2018, 23 percent more than the 35 million S8 models shipped last year.\nGlobal smartphone sales saw an unprecedented decline of 9 percent in the fourth quarter, averaging 2017 growth to just 1 percent, a far cry from growth of about 40 percent between 2011 and 2015, according to research provider Strategy Analytics.\nWhile Samsung kept its supremacy over Apple Inc with about 21 percent of market share, Counterpoint says, it faces tough competition after it lost ground in markets like India, China and Western Europe in the fourth quarter. Chinese rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Xiaomi Inc are making major inroads in such markets, aided by strong sales of affordable products that boast many high-end features and sturdy design.\nLee said Samsung’s huge scale and its “agility to listen and learn” ensured it would continue to grow in China and India.\nThe two versions of the Galaxy S9 have 6.2-inch (15.8 cm) and 5.8-inch wrap-around screens, and will go on sale on March 16 in most countries.
