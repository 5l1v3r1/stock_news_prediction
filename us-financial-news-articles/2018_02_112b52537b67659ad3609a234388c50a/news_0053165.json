The amount of speculative net bearish, or short, positions in Eurodollar futures rose a record high of 3.65 million contracts in the week ended Feb. 20, according to the CFTC's Commitments of Traders data. Last week, the U.S. consumer price index, the government's broadest inflation gauge, rose 0.5 percent in January, exceeding forecasts. The CPI core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, grew 0.3 percent, the biggest monthly increase in a year. On the other hand, speculators dialed back net shorts in federal funds futures, a much smaller market than their Eurodollar counterparts. Net shorts in fed funds fell by 60,514 contracts to 19,245 on Tuesday. Late Friday, fed funds futures implied traders expected the U.S. central bank would raise interest rates three times in 2018 with the next increase likely at its March 20-21 policy meeting , CME Group's FedWatch program showed. Among Treasury futures, speculators reduced net short positions in 10-year T-notes to 214,480 contracts on Tuesday, the lowest in a month. A week ago, net shorts in 10-year T-notes were 296,935 , according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data . Benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.866 percent late Friday after reaching a four-year peak of 2.957 percent on Wednesday.
