They have now agreed to its closure, officials said. \n”We would like dry conditions, so if it’s dry conditions outside there’s no need to close the roof, if it’s not, then let’s close the roof and have a really good game,” Scotland coach Gregor Townsend has said. \nWales coach Warren Gatland has said: “My opinion of the roof is it’s our stadium and we should decide whether it’s open or closed.” \nSaturday’s match marks the start of this year’s championship and sees Scotland, on the back of strong form in their November internationals, travel in hope of a first win since 2002 in Cardiff. \nThey are up against a Wales team who have an extensive list of players unavailable because of injury.
