Oil output was at 2,613 kboed compared with analysts’ average forecast of 2,649 kboed.\nTotal rewarded shareholders with a 10 percent increase in dividends over the next three years. The 2018 interim dividend will rise 3.2 percent, and it plans to buy back up to $5 billion shares over the 2018-2020 period.\nTotal’s rival BP said earlier this week that its 2017 profits had more than doubled to $6.2 billion on the back of higher prices and output, allowing the company to resume share buy-back as it recovers from a three-year oil downturn.
