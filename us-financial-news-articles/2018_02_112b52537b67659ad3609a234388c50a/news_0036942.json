There’s no impact on how we pay tax or indeed where we pay tax.”\nHe said that as equity markets were much less country specific than they were 25 years ago, there were no significant benefits in continuing with the dual structure.\nThe move will leave Royal Dutch Shell and Unilever in a select group of major companies with a Anglo-Dutch corporate structure.\nRELX was the newest of the three; Royal Dutch Shell was created in a 1907 merger and Unilever was founded in 1930 when Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie combined with British soapmaker Lever Brothers.\nRELX, which has focused on delivering information digitally and on its face-to-face exhibitions business in recent years, reported 4 percent underlying growth in revenue to 7.36 billion pounds ($10.35 billion).\nIt said there had been no change in key business trends since the end of the year, and it expected 2018 to be another year of growth in underlying revenue and adjusted operating profit.\nIts shares were trading 2 percent lower in London and 1.7 percent lower in Amsterdam.
