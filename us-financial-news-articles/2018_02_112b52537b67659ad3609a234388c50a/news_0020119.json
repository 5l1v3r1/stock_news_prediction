The basin boasts reserves of around 180 trillion cubic feet of gas.\nExperts say the reserves are enough to supply energy to Britain, France, Germany and Italy for over 20 years.\nReporting by Manuel Mucari; writing by Mfuneko Toyana; editing by James Macharia and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:55:14.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
