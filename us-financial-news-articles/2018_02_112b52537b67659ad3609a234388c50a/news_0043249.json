It shook buildings in the capital, sent tremors as far south as Guatemala and set off more than 1,520 aftershocks.\nAt least 1,000 homes were damaged in Oaxaca, the state’s governor, Alejandro Murat, told a Mexican television program on Saturday, higher than earlier estimates of damage.\nMedia images showed homes, businesses and schools with cracks in their walls and rubble scattered on the ground.\nA military helicopter surveying the quake damage crashed in Santiago Jamiltepec on Friday night, killing at least 13 people.\nMexico’s Interior Ministry said federal aid would go to towns including Pinotepa Nacional, closest to the epicenter, and Santiago Jamiltepec, which had reported 50 damaged homes along with a church and government building.\nRecovery efforts are still being carried out in Oaxaca as well as Mexico City after strong earthquakes in September killed several hundred people and toppled buildings.\nReporting by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T02:45:53.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
