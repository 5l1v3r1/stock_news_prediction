Weak wage growth has been the biggest obstacle in lifting inflation back to the bank’s target rate of almost 2 percent. \n“It’s a step in the right direction for the ECB... they can be moderately happy about it,” Commerzbank economist Michael Schubert said. “It might create very mild upside risks to projections but certainly not enough for us to change our assessment; the ECB will remain cautious and patient.” \n“They’ll be cautious not because it’s just a first step but also because they look at everything else, like the euro appreciation and the equity market selloff,” Schubert added. \nWhile euro zone employment is at a record high and the jobless rate is coming down fast, many of the new jobs tend to be lower quality and add little to wage pressures. \nImmigration from the east also eases labour market stress and a broader measure of slack - which includes part-time workers seeking more hours and people excluded from the labour market for administrative reasons - may be twice as high as the official projections, ECB data shows. \nCompensation per employee rose by around 1.7 percent last year and the ECB expects that to pick up to 2.1 percent this year. \n“This deal should make the ECB comfortable that its wish for inflation to pick up in the coming years may come true,” ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. “But the emphasis is on may because this deal is not enough for inflation to pick up already.” \n“With this deal, there is hope because all the ingredients are there for wages to rise but it’s too early to expect that this wage settlement will be the catalyst,” Brzeski said. “It’s not a signal of a wage spiral in Europe.” Reporting by Balazs Koranyi; Editing by Susan Fenton", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T12:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:58:55.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
