The Canadian alternative asset manager owns a 51 percent stake in TerraForm.\nSaeta operates solar thermal plants in Spain and wind farms in Spain, Uruguay and Portugal. Last year, its installed capacity surpassed 1 gigawatts (GW).\nSaeta’s shares have gained 25 percent since the beginning of the year, and were 6.2 percent higher at 1030 GMT.\n($1 = 0.8083 euros)\nReporting by Katarzyna Zajaczkowska; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T11:11:04.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
