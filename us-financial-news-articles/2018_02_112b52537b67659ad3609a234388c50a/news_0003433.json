On Tuesday, the index rose as high as 50.3, its highest since August 24, 2015, before pulling back to 24.44. \nExchange traded products (ETPs) that bet on low volatility succumbed to the surge higher in the VIX. Credit Suisse said on Tuesday it will shutter the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN, likely leaving holders of XIV with pennies on the dollar. \nNomura Securities will redeem its Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed S&P 500 Vix Inverse ETN after a sharp equity selloff since late last week triggered a massive loss in the product. \nProshares says its short VIX short-term futures ETF will be open for trading on Tuesday and it expects normal operations going forward. \nThe VIX index has more than tripled since last week as a rise in bond yields, on fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve will need to adopt a more aggressive rate hike policy as inflation picks up, roiled stocks. \nThe sharp rise in stock market gyrations after an extended period of calm also threatened to derail one of the most successful trading strategies over the last few years - the selling of volatility. \nMonths of extended calm in the stock market has made selling volatility a lucrative affair, with ETPs such as the XIV and the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, attracting about $3 billion in investment. \nWhen the VIX futures prices spike these ETPs lose value, at which time the issuers of these products could liquidate the shares. \nBoth of these ETPs slumped about 80 percent in after-hours trading on Monday and were halted from trading on Tuesday. \nEarlier, Credit Suisse Group said it faced no material impact from the plunge overnight in the XIV product which it issued and in which it has a 32 percent stake.
