People familiar with the matter said the lawsuit put sale negotiations on hold.\nSchneiderman said he wants the “facts of our complaint factored into whatever deal is structured going forward.” The lawsuit does not block the sale but creates liabilities that make it difficult to finalize. A sale to Contreras-Sweet is now unlikely to advance, sources told Reuters.\nThe Weinstein Company did not immediately return a request for comment. A representative for Contreras-Sweet declined to comment.\nThe Weinstein Company has been seeking a deal that would spare it from bankruptcy after more than 70 women accused Harvey Weinstein, once one of Hollywood’s most influential men, of sexual misconduct including rape. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.\nSchneiderman said at a press conference on Monday that he wanted to ensure a dedicated victim's compensation fund that would not be gobbled up by legal fees and other expenses. Contreras-Sweet had proposed about $30 million for victims in her initial bid made late last year, Reuters reported. ( reut.rs/2iAmw2O )\nSlideshow (2 Images) A sale should also not reward executives including Chief Operating Officer David Glasser, who supervised the human resources department and was in charge of handling dozens of complaints, Schneiderman said. Contreras-Sweet’s offer called for Glasser to be the CEO of the new company, Schneiderman said.\nThe company never launched an investigation into any of the complaints, he said. The lawsuit says that the Weinstein Company’s board and executives failed to take action after receiving complaints about harassment and discrimination from employees.\n“The Weinstein Company repeatedly broke the law,” Schneiderman said on Monday. “It is clear to us that the company’s management was complicit. Not only did they fail to stop it, they enabled it and covered it up.”\nOther bidders for The Weinstein Company have included Lions Gate Entertainment Corp ( LGFa.N ) and production company Killer Content Inc. Killer Content said in January that bankruptcy may be the best option for The Weinstein Company.\nThe New York Times first reported in October on multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.\nSince then, similar allegations have been leveled against many powerful men in business, politics and entertainment, and the #MeToo movement has emerged of victims using social media to share their stories of harassment and abuse.\nReporting by Karen Freifeld and Jessica DiNapoli; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T01:23:51.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
