Analysts at Jefferies had estimated earnings of $7,279. \nThe company reported a net profit of $195.4 million, compared to a loss of $78.1 million a year earlier, benefiting from a nearly $227 million gain from new U.S. tax laws. \nExcluding one-time items, Patterson reported a loss of 10 cents per share, bigger than analysts’ average estimate of an 8-cent loss, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nExpenses jumped to $809 million from $360.1 million. \nRevenue climbed to $787.3 million from $246.9 million a year ago, helped by higher drilling activity. Analysts had expected revenue of $764.5 million.
