The selling continued throughout 2016 with some $58.8 billion of outflows. \nBut with oil prices rising in 2017 to trade at around $65 a barrel by year-end, the level of redemptions has slowed. \nFourth quarter redemptions were down from a revised $5.5 billion in the third quarter, and from $7.6 billion in the second quarter. \nHowever Peter Laurelli, global head of research at eVestment, noted that 66 percent of investment products still experienced net outflows, with only a third registering inflows. \nAmong those with net inflows were passively-managed non-U.S. equity strategies, which pulled in $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, and passive U.S. equity, with $823.5 million. \nGlobal equity markets rallied hard in 2017, with the MSCI World Index gaining around 20 percent and U.S. equities 19 percent. \nActively-managed strategies continued to suffer sizeable outflows, with non-U.S. equity products losing $2.2 billion. \nLow-yielding bond products also remained out of favor, with non-U.S. fixed income losing $1.7 billion. \nSince the global financial crisis, the $6 trillion SWF sector has cut its allocation to government bonds and ramped up its exposure to unlisted assets such as private equity, property and infrastructure in pursuit of higher returns.
