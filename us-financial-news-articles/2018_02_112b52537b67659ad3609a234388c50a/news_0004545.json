In November, the company had forecast that earnings would be at least in line with the consensus forecast of 116 pence.\nSSE also said it expects to spend about 1.6 billion pounds ($2.27 billion) in the full year 2017-2018, lower than its previous estimate of 1.7 billion pounds.\nThe company, however, maintained its capital expenditure estimate of about 6 billion pounds over four-years to March 2020.\nWind energy production rose to 4 terawatt-hours (TWh) in the nine months ended Dec. 31, from 3 TWh in the same period last year. Hydro energy output also rose to 2.5 TWh from 2.1 TWh a year ago.\nThe company lost 40,000 customer accounts during the three months to end-December, compared with the 50,000 it lost in the previous quarter. It ended the latest quarter with a total of 7.68 million customers.\nSSE also said its plans to merge its UK power and gas retail operations with those of npower, owned by Germany’s Innogy , was on course to be completed by the last quarter of 2018 or the first quarter of 2019.\nPower suppliers in Britain have been under pressure from the emergence of small and aggressive rivals as well as being threatened by a price cap on retail prices proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government.\nBritain’s “big six” energy suppliers, Centrica’s British Gas, Iberdrola’s Scottish Power, E.ON , EDF Energy, SSE and npower, are all currently struggling.
