The government is now trying to sell Alitalia, which has turned a profit only a few times in its more than 70-year history. Several foreign buyers have expressed interest in the troubled airline, but the government has missed its self-imposed deadline of mid-January to start exclusive sale talks. Alitalia has played a central role in previous Italian election campaigns, including that led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi in 2008. Berlusconi, who said at the time that he would favour an Italian buyer for the loss-making firm, is running in coalition with Salvini in the upcoming vote.
