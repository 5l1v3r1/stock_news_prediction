The subindex of gold producers eked out a small gain of 0.1 percent as investors searched for safety.\n* Shares of Bombardier Inc declined 2.1 percent to C$3.20 after the plane and train maker missed out on a contract to provide rail cars for one of the world’s biggest light rail systems in Montreal.\n* Canada Goose Holdings Inc declined 16.1 percent to C$40.15 after releasing its quarterly results.\n* Volume on the TSX index was 256.44 million shares.
