At Sochi I was more a madame and I had a huge goal and I messed up. And now I came to Pyeongchang just to enjoy the Olympics because I hadn’t done before. - Switzerland’s Fanny Smith after winning a bronze medal in the ski cross event. “I thought of today as my Dancing with the Stars audition, that’s what Adam Rippon told me to do. So I tried to smile as much as I could even though I popped the triple Axel.” - American Mirai Nagasu after her free skate programme. Slideshow (3 Images) “Skis were running. Everything felt dialled. We woke up this morning at 5am. Brit (Brittany Phelan) and I are morning people, so the alarm goes off and we’re like, ‘Good morning, let’s go, we’re at the Olympics, we’re here to race’.” - Canada’s Kelsey Serwa after winning the ski cross gold medal ahead of second-placed compatriot Phelan. “I’d much rather do this than aerials... I guess it’s all a matter of what you’re comfortable with. There are consequences, especially on the big stage when everyone is going hard, but that’s what it is.” - Australia’s Anton Grimus on the risks involved in ski cross. “I won. Honestly, my hands are shaking, because I haven’t understood yet that I am an Olympic champion.” - Russian figure skating gold medallist Alina Zagitova. “I think it’s more the six-month journey that has made me tired rather than the 50-second race. It hasn’t really been a struggle, it’s just been a long season.” - Australian bobsledder Lucas Mata after the final training runs for the four-man event.
