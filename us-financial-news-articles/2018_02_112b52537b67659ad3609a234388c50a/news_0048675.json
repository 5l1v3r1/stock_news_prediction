(together with its affiliates, \"Engine\"), a shareholder of Navigant Consulting, Inc. (\"NCI\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: NCI), with an ownership of approximately 4.4% of the Company, today announced that it has delivered to the Company a formal notice of nomination of four highly qualified director candidates, Arnaud Ajdler, Brian Delle Donne, Paul Evans and Dominick Schiano, for election to the board of directors of Navigant (the \"Board\") at the Company's upcoming 2018 annual meeting of shareholders (the \"Annual Meeting\").\nOn January 24, 2018, Engine sent the Board a detailed letter urging immediate and decisive action to improve Navigant's performance or evaluate value-maximizing strategic alternatives. 1 The letter expressed disappointment with the Board's choice to rebuff Engine's efforts at cooperative engagement and went on to recommend that NCI improve its margins, reduce working capital and capital expenditures, optimize its balance sheet and capital allocation, recalibrate executive compensation and strengthen its corporate governance and Board composition. Alternatively, the letter noted, the Company could explore what buyers would be willing to pay for NCI given the robust M&A market.\nAs highlighted in the letter, NCI's total shareholder return (\"TSR\") has lagged its peers as well as every relevant index over the last one, three and five-year timeframe. Additionally, during the tenure of eight of the current Board members, Navigant's TSR has dramatically lagged the corresponding Russell 2000's TSR 2 , with an average relative underperformance of a staggering 115%.\nAppointment\nLength of\nNCI TSR since\nRussell 2000 TSR since\nRelative performance\nAge\nDirector\ndate\ntenure (years)\nappointment (%)\nappointment (%)\nsince appointment (%)\n81\nGov.

Given the current Board members' track record of underperformance, we expected they would have been more willing to work collaboratively with us towards meaningful shareholder-driven change. While we remain open to engaging in a constructive dialogue in order to avoid a proxy contest, given the current Board's unwillingness to discuss a framework to achieve that objective, we are left with no choice but to nominate a slate of four highly qualified director candidates at the upcoming Annual Meeting. We strongly believe that our nominees will bring a renewed focus on operational excellence and financial rigor to the Company. Our nominees are experienced business leaders with relevant industry experience as well as deep capital allocation and M&A experience.\"\nEngine's nominees are:\nArnaud Ajdler is currently Managing Partner of Engine Capital, L.P., a value-oriented special situations fund that invests both actively and passively in companies undergoing change.
