Micra soft expanded upon to competing to apply the animals decide to create a ... new term device that the ... the Getty computing got funded and they decided to keep control quantum computer and now you know a lot of approaches ... and now for supremacy appears to be just around the corner ... it's the tipping point where one of these machines does something impossible for any other computer ... in part one in this two-part series we look at how experiments in some of the world's best-known Companies in fields as far flung as health financial services and automotive or bring us closer to the quantum H ... this ... is the future ... every ... from the Wall Street Journal ... the ... from the news been in New York and Jennifer strong and this is the future of everything ... I and sandcastle in the new word for it to the NCC and turn on a camera imaging nineteenth that includes quantum computing which she describes this way when for example and can ask me why quantum computing ... I how to think about it and started the next-generation computer ... today's computers carry information in units called bits which are either zeros are ones that quantum bits or a key bits can represent and store information and those zeros and ones at the same time and the nymph and a fast at a more offense and completely new way and computing ... yes that harnesses the power of quantum physics and on sale all as quantum physics Microsoft founder Bill Gates recently told the Wall Street Journal it's the one part of the company he truly doesn't understand saying quote I know a lot of physics and a lot of math but the one place pretty perhaps clients in its hair going fix its quantum as my people start talking about and means Serena and smart companies can down and talk about the experiment in quantum computing in umpteen a little that more or sensible bank in the science itself is very dense it helps to start with a little thought experiment called TROW dinners ... the story goes something like this he put a cap in the box with a bottle of poison ... the place in the bottle could be opened with a cat that ... and the place and could be closed ... a lot ... and they say ... crazy as it sounds somewhat disapprove and ... this can exist in two states at once it's called super position and it means a single particle can be in two places at the same time ... the poison bottle is linked to the caps Halcon symbolizing entanglement ... could allow scientists to compute across quantum bits or cube it's ... and it's the basis of what allows the quantum computer to calculate things much much faster than today's machines or so-called ... classical computers ... the ... and ... it's ok to be confused even Einstein struggled with us ... tech giant across the globe are racing to try to build the so called universal quantum computer ... one gets fully functional and can be scaled to perform a wide range of complications from an Amy's daughter Gail and a vice president of artificial intelligence in quantum computing of IBM ... IBM's T J Watson Research Center is about an hour north of New York City one and a beautiful thing so we can leverage ... with the Clinton machine is now we can have set up to states ... that can have up to two The and that ... way and he's a number of tickets and not limited to Xoom's all spec it's after physicist Richard find in energy use this idea of quantum computing what we learnt for one it's really hard to control kids it's ... cute it's her fragile ... if there's any change in temperature and Elaine's frequency or even motion ... a quantum state will probably collapse when you belive quantum computer that basic Colonel these these creation of the students and the skill it's not perfect ... have errors in ... IBM Google and other companies are borderline error correction algorithms but ... those require additional key and it's to check the work of the ones running the computation it's we only have a window of time which can be reasonably shorting maybe only ninety uh hundred microseconds ... which we too can perform useful compete ... now we are working in our laboratories to extend the window in time in which would come for fungus computations ... and as we keep extending at some point we will get to these universal fall color and quantum computer the longer a kid they can't stand that magical quantum state ... more time you have to do useful things that ... we head into the lab to see one of these machine ... we see a lot of fun to get it looks like ... at first it's hard to tell what were looking for ... a large white cylinder hangs above us all the highest that ... it's connected to a maze of racks and my ears in deep inside the scratch that sits IBM's kind to ... very often we make the analogy that these is like the nineteen forties in computers ... and Ulysses computer that deal in Cairo is that what we're seeing here looks and sounds like it ... was one of the artistic up one of the squad appears that the really beautiful but very very different I would use of the square boxes and a chirping sound that baggage during ... the decompress are working to be able to fall ... these makes him on ... helium ... today ... it was in refrigerator to be able ... to collect ... so at the very bottom of it ... we get to work the steamy Lee Kelvin still very close to our absolute zero it's uh hundred times colder than outer space at the bottom of it ... the system requires extreme cold to work ... my name is Jerry Chow and we are in our quantum being a research lab here in aisle five T J Watson Research but he manages IBM's experimental efforts with quantum computing ... in this lab is where we do a lot of ... work in order to develop better and better Quantum processors ... this is where we explore things like materials and ... the way that we can try systems that we can make improvements to the with new Wii controller devices so they're ready for ... building this quantum processes which and of you know going online are going to fines for people to actually ... make use of or science ... become a quite large beer kegs and a new Sony to the noise which corresponds to these Criteo compressors that keep them running to keep them cold ... he was one of these cry and stats open for us to look at ... inside there's an organized tangle of Tim's and my ears in gold copper and silver it's all very steam ... it goes inside of a bunch of shields which allow us to protect the device from radiation and other additional noise ... there's also a whole suite of electronics and components that sit outside of a refrigerator ... and these are used to control the cube it said that we have in our own processor ... then you get a closer look at actual units under a microscope ... this printed circuit board has a number of inputs and outputs that allow you to try and the chip ... with microwaves ... and any ... guests that it is that my ... dad share so so ... what you see it is this achieved that piece of silicon with ... various super conducting metallic traces better on that ... and those metallic traces to find circuits and some of those circuits in fact ... contain what are known as Tillis's injunctions which formed the basis of our quantum bits or keep it ... IBM recently launched a cue network companies work with researchers to experiment with quantum computing use cases that make sense for their businesses by news bombs OPM and chief technology officer for equities ... JPMorgan's corporate investment bank JP Morgan is looking for ways that technology could be useful to the financial services industry financial modeling pricing of our instruments running risk scenarios valuation or a scenarios there's ... a lot of things that deliver the we do everyday team the investment bank and and and JPMorgan were probably ... all of which if and when the technology develops to a point that it surpasses what you can do the existing computer ... all of which could be much quicker ... and it could allow you to do more risk scenarios that could allow you to model insurance in ways that you can today that's because modern trading and portfolio management require a great deal of computing power so one way in which you tried to determine how something will be in the futures you look at lots of ways that things a bit in the past ... and so you know you run colonists scenarios of its ... volumes were higher or lower prices were higher or lower and ... the price of a stock or were ... trading pattern of something were to pay him one way or another way the need to process all that information ... through the dominant model smoking all these different scenarios and really probabilities associated with them ... it takes an enormous amount of ... computing power ... you know we've moved from what seemed very very theoretical ... to watch what is in some sense Yale prototype almost a toy By ... did the reason that people are starting to get excited and engaged is because we are on the doorstep of the potentially changing ... sometimes people think it's crazy what we do ... that's Volkswagen CIO Martin Hoffman Enbrel and he's referring to the daily use experiments with quantum computers so strong that we ... work with this comic Otway and in Canada and the approach to quantum computing is called quantum and healing this approach is useful for solving optimization and logistics problem it's one thing that comes to mind immediately is traffic optimization because we all know what is in a traffic jam the question is can we ... use a number of quantum processor with no one is infinite compute power to dissolve traffic jams before they even up yet ear and this experiment with data from one of the world's most congested city its ... ageing so we use the available data from Texas to give ditching ... and busy what we did last ... for so predicting the summit did have a traffic terms on happen and then will the door to the quantum computer to that it does all the traffic jam by optimizing every single car ... in that in traffic ... and by doing that they could demonstrate that the problem could be applied successfully to quantum computer using the D which she a calculated the fastest rates to the airport while completely minimizing traffic congestion ... other computers could've taken forty five minutes to complete this task by for a quantum computer and a tap ... on the second though he says it'll still be awhile before we see this applied in real life ... that doesn't mean that you can prevent a traffic jam in the kitchen door open to the sono women wrote when the gnome look honest acknowledged approach because it could use to make traffic much more manageable ... cost and things quantum computing could also improve the batteries in electric cars for that de Dediu is partnering with Google in the idea is to to give up on the roof and the most assimilate the battery behavior because is very close to quantum physics is as as presently no simulation software for the spattering it's so you have to build prototypes With quantum computing ... hospital means he could stimulate their behavior much faster ... and that could lead to reduced charging time that the Getty was also working with Google to explore how AEI and quantum computing could work in tandem if you can call mine the quantum computing and AEI indices are hopeful that combination goes again incredible come to par with the kid that is his Lenovo the eye and sent running costs and required a lot of our growth and development so we could use that approach to help develop Anora NSW's trimming costs in a different way ... he says companies need to get on top of these developments now I mean if you chose to the math and in one of the idea of exponential growth and technology has gotten harder to catch up ... technology is not an excuse anymore you can do anything with technology and the Dodgers another limiting factor ... paninis guided it into reading and science operations manager at the U S over a of the research Institute for advanced computer science we run a program of mass up on the quantum of petition intelligence Laboratory he believes NASA helped spark the now widespread industry interest in quantum computing our group was the first to believe in potential near-term applications to hand to give them all to SunTrust cool the first commercial onto computer which was made by the weight systems that so held a conference in two thousand twelve called the quantum future technologies and the conference ... was the seed for the creation of a research group and then ... for a ... goal to decide to back financially the project and and is set ... pretty gained the attention worldwide ... and shortly after ... our group was founded mobile decided to be the wrong group Micra soft expanded upon to competing GoPro IBM also decided to create the ... near-term device the stock at ... the Getty computing got funded and they decided to create their own quantum computer then now you have ... a lot of our approaches we work with the Getty ... the War Eagle will be more Queen ID and ... the war with the way ... and that we have access to their prototypes and we experimented on heavy by suggesting modification earns improvements and body ... most importantly trying to use them ... for something somewhat useful ... so problems which are ... in optimization and drums guitar ... the design of the banks are also did the signing of Best schedules to design the best circuitry in drug discovery for for it's also in them ... either aspects for example couple eyes are slow or ... fertilizers ... so there are certain chemical compound that could have the command is in fact even the climate change or ... in how we efficient eyes because ... the question is can we do it's it's not an engineering talent is not my ... call to bookmarks we know we can go ... to mind the more we know it's possible ... that ... but we're not hundred percent sure ... that want computing Wu other Nawaz to Seoul but the problems he won ... as possible because we walk and we don't know if that's possible even in principle ... while ... we were earning his journey is much more than ... having a computer which solves the problem fast which is nice but you really learn how the world wars ... and the potential even some ... whys of those widen world ... what's ... the entire industry is still a nice then again the Wall Street Journal's Sarah passed a law next but a few executives from these companies have spoken about the importance of investing in this emerging technology now ... so that their employees and their pessimism be totally ahead of the curve when quantum computers do become scallop online email on one of these is the biotech company by a ten day at completed an experiment last summer and I showed that quantum computers have the potential to speed up tried to scan for it for ... diseases like multiple sclerosis as ... all-time and Sanitec and Sanft Center a partnership with the center and one cube it's by a gem tested how quantum computers to help speed up the process of molecular matching ... this be an important step and early phase tried to sign in discovery ... because it basically the structure mind killed anatomical features can be used to predict positive and negative effects of specific try this on the monotony ... like for example the toxicity of the molecule and the like in their matching is a process that takes classical computers are really long time with many steps ... so I it's been described to me and it's kind of like comparing and trying on a square where the computer would start by comparing one crime there and and and and and and other crime there and so on ... the rotating the molecules unseen counting down to San Quentin can Peters can essentially be aware of all of the different overlap simultaneously and takes a very long time for giants to be discovered and then go from discovering CHIM all and ... eventually into you know the pharmacy and if there's any chance that we can use a computer a new type of computing the Fed ... to help speed that process alliance that can be absolutely revolutionary ...
