Senior forward Tre‘Darius McCallum (12 points, 10 rebounds) contributed his first double-double of the year.\nProvidence (16-9, 7-5) needed a late surge to shoot 33.8 percent from the field.

Strus rewarded Maric with a pass for a dunk before Reed canned a 3-pointer to give the Blue Demons a 35-19 lead with 2:30 left in the half.\nDePaul led by 15 at the break and immediately pushed the margin to 20 as junior guard Eli Cain (14 points, 5 assists) set up sophomore guard Brandon Cyrus for a layup and Strus for a 3-pointer.\nMeanwhile, Providence struggled to find the range from outside.
