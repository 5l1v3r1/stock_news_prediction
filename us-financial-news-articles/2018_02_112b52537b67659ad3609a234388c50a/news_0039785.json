Cech crammed 18 children and four adults into a small closet and locked the door as gunshots rang out.\n“People said to me: ‘What an incredible coincidence that you have such a close friend who could have the same experience’,” Cech told Reuters. “I feel angry that anyone had to experience that horror.”\nHaneski told Reuters on Friday that as soon as she heard the lockdown warning, even before she heard shots had been fired, she shouted at students: “‘Get back in here! Get back in here!'”\nDrawing from her friend’s account five years ago of how she saved lives, Haneski quickly herded 50 students and five adults into a media equipment room in the rear of the library and locked the doors. The radio crackled with news that there was a gunman on the loose.\nSome teachers thought it was simply a drill because school staff had just undergone “active shooter” training and were told a mock incident would take place, Haneski said. One teacher who climbed over the dead and wounded lying in the hallways assumed they were theater students drenched in fake blood, she added.\nCrosses for the victims of yesterday's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School hang on a fence a short distance from the school in Parkland, Florida, U.S., February 15, 2018.

I could see if the bad guy - the shooter - walked past,” she said. “At first it was just lockdown then right away we heard ‘shooting’. We heard his name.”\nNikolas Cruz, the accused 19-year-old gunman, was a student she had known since her previous job at the nearby middle school.\n“He was a troubled child,” she recalled.\nHaneski and Cech, who each have two adult children, said the only way to stop such massacres was for Congress to tighten gun control laws.\n“Unless the laws change, we’re all going to be having this experience at some point,” Cech said.\nHaneski agreed: “We did everything we were trained to do. And still this happened. And still 17 didn’t go home after school.”\nReporting by Barbara Goldberg in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T03:14:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
