It had ended at 7.57 percent on Tuesday.\nThe rupee rose briefly before trimming gains and was trading at 64.13 to the dollar. It had ended at 64.25 on Tuesday.\nThe broader NSE stock index rose briefly after the policy announcement and was little changed by 0920 GMT.\nAs expected, the RBI kept its main repo rate steady at 6.00 percent for a third straight policy meeting and retained its “neutral” stance, seeking to support a slowing economy even as inflation has accelerated to a 17-month high.
