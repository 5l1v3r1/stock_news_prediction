The confirmation hearing ended in January after a bitter valuation battle between Breitburn and its shareholders who argued it undervalued the company.\nIn a filing with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan late Friday, Breitburn said it was not required to “pursue conditional offers thrown across the transom, particularly after the close of a contested Confirmation Hearing.”\nHouston, Texas-based Lime Rock’s $1.8 billion “stalking horse” offer tops a $1.6 billion enterprise valuation by Breitburn’s investment bank.\nBreitburn’s shareholders say Breitburn is worth $3.8 billion following a spike in oil prices since the company filed for bankruptcy in 2016. They argued in court that Breitburn had low-balled its valuation in order to favor creditors who stood to gain control over its assets.\nBreitburn equity holders want the Lime Rock bid to be entered into the record of the bankruptcy case, a move they believe would sway the court to reject the reorganization for undervaluing the company.\nOn Friday, Lime Rock extended a deadline for its proposal until Feb. 14, a day after a hearing for Bernstein to decide on Breitburn equity holders’ request.\nBreitburn said Lime Rock’s offer confirms its valuation and would still leave equity holders “woefully underwater” by more than $1.25 billion.\nBreitburn is organized as a master limited partnership, and equity holders could be stuck with a hefty tax bill unless the company has a higher valuation.\nLime Rock said in its Jan. 31 offer letter that it would bid patiently and aggressively for Breitburn, which owns prized oil reserves in the Permian Basin in Texas as well as California, the Rocky Mountains, the U.S. Midwest and Southeast.\nIf the Lime Rock offer advances, it would open up a bankruptcy auction and could spoil an attempt by a group of unsecured creditors led by Elliott Management Corp and WL Ross & Co to scoop up Breitburn’s assets through a $775 million rights offering.\nElliott last year gained a sizeable stake in the largest U.S. coal miner Peabody Energy Corp through a similar rights offering.\nIt is now Peabody’s largest shareholder with 33.82 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nReporting by Tracy Rucinski in Chicago; Editing by Andrew Hay\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T17:47:39.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
