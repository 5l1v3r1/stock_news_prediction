She didn’t have an Olympic gold medal and she had a respectable number of followers on Twitter, but nothing especially jaw- dropping.\nWhat a difference a day makes.\nOn Monday, Kim, 17, started the day with about 20,000 followers on Twitter . At 9:42 p.m. EST, she won her first Olympic gold medal. NBC commentators mentioned her social media account and the fact that she had tossed out a funny tweet in the midst of the competition. That’s when the floodgates opened.\nWithin 90 minutes, her followers had increased sixfold. As of 9:42 a.m. EST Tuesday morning, she had 175,000 followers on Twitter.\nSo, not only is Kim now a bonafide Olympic sensation, she’s also a social media star. And, for the past few days, at least, she has staked her claim in the food space.\nThe tweet that merited an on-air mention talked about food.\nWish I finished my breakfast sandwich but my stubborn self decided not to and now I'm getting hangry\n— Chloe Kim (@chloekimsnow) February 13, 2018\nShe talked about food earlier that day, too.\nCould be down for some ice cream rn\n— Chloe Kim (@chloekimsnow) February 12, 2018\nHer post-competition press conference also seemed to focus on her love of food:\nAnd she sang songs of praise about the calming qualities of food on Sunday.\nOh and I also had 2 churros today and they were pretty bomb so if you ever get nervous go eat a churro\n— Chloe Kim (@chloekimsnow) February 11, 2018\nA quick scan of recent older tweets also sees mentions of pizza and fast food chain In-N-Out.\nKim’s Instagram followers , meanwhile, have spiked to 409,000. She tends to ignore food and stick to snowboarding there, which, when you think about social media’s obsession with food pictures, is kind of ironic.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/tHZtMdiARAw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "https://twitter.com/chloekimsnow/status/963234868615196673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/chloekimsnow/status/962918340481056770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/chloekimsnow/status/962571848549416960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/chloekimsnow", "https://www.instagram.com/chloekimsnow/?utm_source=ig_embed"], "published": "2018-02-13T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T19:01:04.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
