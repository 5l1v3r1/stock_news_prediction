Activists say the passage of the bill has encouraged a rise in anti-Semitism.\nMore than three million of the 3.2 million Jews who lived in pre-war Poland were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for about half of all Jews killed in the Holocaust.\nJews from across the continent were sent to be killed at death camps built and operated by Germans in occupied Poland - home to Europe’s biggest Jewish community at the time - including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor.\n“JOINT RESPONSIBILITY”\nPoland's President Andrzej Duda speaks during his media announcement about his decision on the Holocaust bill at Presidential Palace in Warsaw, Poland, February 6, 2018. Agencja Gazeta/Dawid Zuchowicz via REUTERS Duda said he would also ask the Constitutional Tribunal for a number of clarifications about the bill. The legislation provides exemptions for academic research and art.\nDuda’s top foreign policy adviser Krzysztof Szczerski told public television TVP that the law should be sent to the Constitutional Tribunal within a week.\nCriticizing Duda’s move, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement: “Enactment of this law adversely affects freedom of speech and academic inquiry.”\nPoland's President Andrzej Duda speaks during his media announcement about his decision on the Holocaust bill at Presidential Palace in Warsaw, Poland, February 6, 2018. Agencja Gazeta/Dawid Zuchowicz via REUTERS Israel said it still hoped Poland would make amendments.\n“We hope that within the allotted time, until the court’s deliberations are concluded, we will manage to agree on changes and corrections. Israel and Poland hold a joint responsibility to research and preserve the history of the Holocaust,” the Israeli government said in a statement on Twitter.\nIsrael’s education minister said on Monday he was “honored” Poland had canceled his visit to Warsaw this week because he refused to retract his condemnation of the bill.\n“The blood of Polish Jews cries from the ground, and no law will silence it,” Bennett later said in a statement.\nRelated Coverage Ukraine says Polish bill on historic crimes could harm ties According to figures from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Nazis, who invaded Poland in 1939, also killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians.\nThe legislation, which comes at a time of electoral gains for anti-immigrant parties like PiS across Europe, has reopened a painful debate in Poland over the Holocaust.\nThousands of Poles risked their lives to protect Jewish neighbors during the war. But research published since the fall of communism in 1989 showed that thousands also killed Jews or denounced those who hid them to the Nazi occupiers, challenging the national narrative that Poland was solely a victim.\nThe bill will also make it illegal to deny the murder of about 100,000 Poles by units of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) during World War Two, a move likely to increase tensions with neighboring Ukraine.\nReporting by Pawel Sobczak, Marcin Goettig and Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk, writing by Justyna Pawlak; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:50:27.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
