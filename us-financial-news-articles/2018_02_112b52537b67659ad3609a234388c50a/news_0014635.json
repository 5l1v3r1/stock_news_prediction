His successor, Jose Mourinho, said in November that it hampers English clubs’ chances in the knockout stages of European competitions.\nThere have also been suggestions that the lack of a break leaves Premier League players tired for international competitions and in particular has been part of the reason behind the England national team’s poor tournament record in recent years.\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate, however, expressed doubt in December about whether a break would significantly enhance the team’s prospects of winning a first major trophy since 1966.
