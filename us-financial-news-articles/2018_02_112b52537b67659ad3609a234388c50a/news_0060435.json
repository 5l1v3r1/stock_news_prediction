The government has not yet decided the contract model for that area as new legislation for the gas industry is needed, Perez said.\nThe mature onshore oilfields include the Cuyabeno, Oso and Vinita-Blanca areas at Ecuador’s Amazon region, Perez said. Those will be added to eight onshore areas in the country’s Northeast, close to the border with Colombia, under the Intracampos bidding round, whose results are expected in August.\nEcuador, which is opening to international markets, tackling tax reform and public-sector austerity measures under the government of President Lenin Moreno, has said it plans to increase crude production by 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year by adding barrels from its ITT block.\nIt is switching to shared profit agreements from service contracts in the areas not operated by Petroamazonas to secure more investments. The new terms will allow producers to be paid in oil and enable them to export or sell the barrels to local refineries.\nThe Andean country’s crude output has fallen to 515,000 bpd, Perez said, below the output ceiling of 520,000 bpd when OPEC agreed to restrain production starting last year.\nPerez recently started talks with OPEC to be allowed to increase Ecuador’s production this year despite the organization’s joint output cut agreement that is slated to run through the end of this year, he added.\n“Ecuador’s production is marginal in the OPEC context. It is a commitment with them to maintain OPEC’s unity. We talked about it during the OPEC secretary general’s visit (earlier this month), they are giving Ecuador flexibility,” he said.\nReporting by Alexandra Valencia, writing by Marianna Parraga; editing by Susan Thomas and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:16:47.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
