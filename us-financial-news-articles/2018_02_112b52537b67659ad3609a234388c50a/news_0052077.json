Another two staff members suspected of sexual misconduct did not have their contracts renewed,” ICRC Director-General Yves Daccord said in a statement published on Friday.\n“I am deeply saddened to report these numbers,” Daccord said in the statement, adding the ICRC was taking action to make sure all incidents would be reported and handled properly.\nThe ICRC, which has more than 17,000 staff worldwide, bans its staff from paying for sexual services even in countries where prostitution is legal, it said.\nThe aid sector has been shaken by a wave of allegations of sexual misconduct. Earlier this week, British charity Oxfam’s country director in Haiti admitted to using prostitutes at his residence during a relief mission.\nThe United Nations’ peacekeeping missions, agencies, funds and programmes as well as implementing partners have also been embroiled in sexual exploitation and abuse allegations, with the deputy head of the U.N. agency for HIV/AIDS becoming the latest official to leave.\nReporting by Silke Koltrowitz, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T19:49:23.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
