Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net \"EXTREMELY WELCOME NEWS FOR ACTIVE\" (0638 GMT) Bernstein's global quantitative analysis team finds a pick-up in performance for active managers and signs they could continue to do well this year, a godsend after years of disappointing returns for the industry. European portfolio managers and global quantitative managers beat benchmarks by 3.3% and 1.9% on average in 2017, Bernstein finds, and this strong performance has continued into 2018. Stock and factor correlations at multiyear lows create optimal conditions for active management and stock picking. \"Even if are unlikely to go lower from here, the current levels suggest a rich opportunity set for stock pickers for the next 12 months,\" write Alla Harmsworth and team. Intra-sector correlations are at 20-year lows on both sides of the Atlantic, and valuation spreads are wider than usual across the whole market and within sectors, they note. \"This suggests a heightened potential ability to identify idiosyncratic 'winners' even amongst peers within narrow market segments,\" says Harmsworth. It'll be interesting to see whether this low correlation environment continues even if the stocks rally starts to peter out.
