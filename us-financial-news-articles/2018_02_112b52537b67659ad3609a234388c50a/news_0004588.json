However, CAS reduced their lifetime Olympic bans to a suspension from this year’s Games.\nThe IOC had previously banned Russia from Pyeongchang as a result of its “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system.\nIndividual Russian athletes are able to compete as neutrals if they can prove their anti-doping credentials but the IOC said on Thursday that the 28 would not necessarily be invited to Pyeongchang. “Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation,” it said.\nThe confirmation of 11 cases “clearly demonstrates once more the existence of the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping system at the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014,” it added.\nThe IOC regretted that CAS “did not take this proven existence of the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping system into consideration for the other 28 cases.”\nMatthieu Reeb, Secretary General of the Court of Arbitration for Sport speaks during a news conference in Pyeongchang, South Korea, February 1, 2018.

REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski Russian sports minister Pavel Kolobkov said the country’s Olympic committee would ask the IOC to allow the 28 to compete in Pyeongchang.\n“We really hope that the IOC make a decision in favor of all clean athletes who earned the right to compete at the Olympics,” he said\nJim Walden, lawyer for Russia’s former anti-doping chief-turned whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, said the ruling provided “a very small measure of punishment for some athletes but a complete ‘get out of jail free card’ for most.”\nRelated Coverage Russia's Putin welcomes ruling to overturn Sochi doping bans Russia to request lifting Olympic bans after CAS decision: minister Russian sports minister: 'Justice has prevailed' after doping bans overturned Walden added that Rodchenkov “testified fully and credibly” at CAS.\nRussia has repeatedly denied any state involvement in the doping which was exposed by an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\nCAS said its role was “not to determine generally whether there was an organized scheme allowing the manipulation of doping control samples” but was limited to dealing with the individual cases.\nAltogether, 43 Russian athletes were banned by the IOC. Three more are still waiting to have their appeals heard and one -- bobsledder Maxim Belugin -- has not appealed.\nAdditional reporting by Karolos Grohmann in Berlin and Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber in Moscow; Editing by Toby Chopra/Mitch Phillips/ William MAclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T10:50:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
