Analysts are divided over whether the Canadian housing market will crash or re-inflate in the months to come. \nThe CMHC report on mortgage issuance by Canada’s five largest banks showed 3.9 percent of mortgages issued in Vancouver were held by non-permanent residents in 2016, up from 3.3 percent in 2014. In Toronto, 2.7 percent of mortgages issued in 2016 were held by non-permanent residents, up from 2.1 percent in 2015 and 2.0 percent in 2014. \nFor the report, non-permanent residents included foreign workers, students, refugee claimants and other non-Canadians living in Canada legally. \nWhile the number is a fraction of overall mortgage issuance, the rapid growth of foreigners aged 18 to 44 is shifting the home-buying demographic in Canada, the CMHC said. \nForeigners tended to buy more expensive properties, according to the report, with the average single detached home purchased by a non-permanent resident valued at C$1.09 million in Toronto and C$1.65 million in Vancouver. \nThat was above the average C$902,000 and C$1.42 million bought by permanent residents in those cities, respectively, according to the report. \nThe report also showed the proportion of mortgages held by non-residents - which includes both Canadians and foreigners not living in Canada - also rose between 2014 and 2016, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto.
