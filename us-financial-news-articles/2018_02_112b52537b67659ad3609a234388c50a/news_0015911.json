Trump has also criticized Time Warner’s CNN news network and, in November, reiterated his opposition to the proposed transaction. \nThe Justice Department has said that the $85 billion deal is illegal because AT&T, if it owned movie and television show maker Time Warner, would have the ability and incentive to raise prices that it charges cable, satellite and streaming rivals for Time Warner’s content. A trial is set for next month.
