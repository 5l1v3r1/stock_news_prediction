Davidson & Co, said.\nThe company has spent heavily to boost its market share in a highly competitive e-commerce industry and has yet to turn a net profit. Managers told a call with analysts that it would favour increasing its market share over boosting its bottom line.\n“In the short and mid-term our focus will be to continue to grow the number of merchants on our platform and our share wallet,” Chief Financial Officer Russ Jones told the post-earnings call.\n“We think creating that bigger piece of pie positions us much better once we want to move more towards achieving longer-term profitability goals.”\nThe company’s U.S.-listed shares had been volatile in premarket trade after the results were released on Thursday but fell steadily following the opening bell on Wall Street. They steadied after the call with management.\nThe company said in its earnings release that its net loss narrowed to nearly $3 million, or 3 cents per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $8.9 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned 15 cents per share in the reported quarter, beating analysts’ estimate by 10 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Shounak Dasgupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T15:25:35.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
