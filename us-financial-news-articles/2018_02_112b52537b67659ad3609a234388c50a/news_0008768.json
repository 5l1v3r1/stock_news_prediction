He also said that the airline was seeking Chinese state investors this year as Beijing encourages closer ties between private and state firms. \nHe added that he expected local government subsidies that have encouraged Chinese airlines to launch numerous new routes from Chinese cities to overseas destinations to begin shrinking this year, saying that the country’s aviation regulator has expressed a lack of support for the practice.
