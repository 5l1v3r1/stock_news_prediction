The trader sees two bullish signs in charts of Amazon that lead him to believe a big bounce is ahead for the stock.\nFirst, Gordon points out that Amazon has outperformed the Nasdaq 100-tracking ETF ( QQQ ).\n\"You can see that the Nasdaq QQQ has not taken out its highs, [and right now] we have done about a three-quarter retracement of what we've lost since Jan. 26,\" he said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"But we can see that Amazon is knocking on the door here for a breakout.\"\nIn addition to outperforming the QQQ, Gordon sees a bullish \"inverse head and shoulders\" pattern that he says could be the \"launching pad\" that could take the stock up to $1,500.\nGiven the high implied volatility, or price of options, for the stock, Gordon wants to sell a put spread. He sold the March 29 weekly 1,440-strike puts and paired them with the purchase of the March 29 weekly 1,430-strike puts for a credit of just under $4. Should Amazon close above $1,440 on March 29 expiration, Gordon would make around $400, which is what he paid for the trade.\nBut should Amazon tank and close below $1,430 on expiration, then Gordon could lose about $600. To prevent such a loss, Gordon recommended putting in a stop on the trade of around $1,440.\nAmazon has surged 26 percent year to date.\nDisclaimer Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
