It will be long until the end, we have to be there, recover our mentality and in football everything can change in two or three weeks.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T11:42:24.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
