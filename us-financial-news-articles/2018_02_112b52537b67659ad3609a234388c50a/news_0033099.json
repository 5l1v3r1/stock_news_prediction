Kenyan skier Sabrina Simader on whether people at home think she is crazy: “Maybe some of them. My grandfather thinks so. Because he says it’s a crazy sport and it’s too risky.” Slideshow (2 Images) “No, I‘m OK, I‘m OK. I asked the photographer if he was OK too and he said he was. I think it’s getting scary to be a photographer on skiing hills.” - Switzerland’s Laura Gut on crashing into a photographer in the first run of the giant slalom at the Yongpyong Alpine Centre. “It’s a good thing that I got good results because I had showed a lot of confidence beforehand.” - South Korean skeleton slider Yun Sung-bin on topping the standings after two heats. “World Cup wins, I’ve been there a few times and know how that feels, but this is different. It’s one of those things where you keep looking up the hill because I want to make sure it’s real, like no one comes and skis faster.” - Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal after his downhill gold. “There’s so much to do. Whereas I would normally take time to rest on my bed, here I went to the gaming hall in the park, playing table tennis, collecting pins. I’ve got a bagful and even twice as much in my room.” - Dutch speed skater Esmee Visser on time spent away from competition at the Olympics.
