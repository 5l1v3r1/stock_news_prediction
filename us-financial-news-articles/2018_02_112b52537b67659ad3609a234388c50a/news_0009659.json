The record Super Bowl audience was set at 114.4 million when the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks in 2015 on NBC. \nThe decline in viewership for the Super Bowl is in line with declines the National Football League experienced during the regular season. The average audience for an NFL game for the 2017 season was 14.9 million viewers, a nearly 10% decline from the 2016 regular season, which was down 8% compared with 2015. Ratings for the playoffs this season were also down. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T00:05:35.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
