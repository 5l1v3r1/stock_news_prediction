After that, Schenn scored the game’s first goal later in the period to reach his milestone.\nHe added a goal in the second period. Schenn leads the team in goals (23) and points (53).\nBlues coach Mike Yeo shook up his lines in the game. Schenn played on the second line with Jaden Schwartz and Patrik Berglund -- and each scored points.\nSchwartz and Berglund each finished with one assist while teammate Vince Dunn led the way with three helpers.\nDunn became the first St. Louis rookie defenseman to post three assists in a game since January 2008.\nCarter Hutton made 23 saves for the Blues in the victory.\nSt. Louis broke the game open with a four-goal second period. After the contest was tied at one early in the middle period, the Blues scored on four of their 11 shots in the period and took a 5-1 lead.\nColorado goalie Jonathan Bernier entered the contest 11-2-1 in his past 14 games but gave up three goals on 20 shots and was pulled at the 5:05 mark of the second period. Semyon Varlamov replaced him but allowed two goals on four shots in the rest of the period. Overall, Varlamov stopped eight of the 11 shots he faced.\nSchenn made it 1-0 with a power-play goal 8:41 into the game, scoring on a rebound. The Avalanche tied it when Gabriel Bourque stole the puck inside the Blues’ zone and scored on a mini-breakaway at 2:50 of the second period.\nThe Blues then took command with four straight goals in just 10:44.\nIvan Barbashev put St. Louis on top 4:17 into the second period before Schenn scored from between the circles only 48 seconds later. That ended Bernier’s night, but the Blues kept rolling, getting goals from Kyle Brodziak and Alex Pietrangelo later in the period for the four-goal edge.\nPaul Stastny (one goal, one assist) added a third-period goal for the 6-1 final.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:29:36.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
