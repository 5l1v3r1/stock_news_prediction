(LS&Co.) announced financial results today for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 26, 2017.\nHighlights include:\nThree Months Ended % Increase\n(Decrease)\nAs Reported\nFiscal Year Ended % Increase\n(Decrease)\nAs Reported\n($ millions) November 26,\n2017\nNovember 27,\n2016\nNovember 26,\n2017\nNovember 27,\n2016\nNet revenues $ 1,466 $ 1,299 13 % $ 4,904 $ 4,553 8 % Net income attributable to LS&Co. $ 116 $ 96 20 % $ 281 $ 291 (3 )% Adjusted EBIT $ 157 $ 146 7 % $ 481 $ 480 — % Net revenues grew 13 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter and grew 11 percent excluding $22 million in favorable currency translation. For the full year, reported revenue grew 8 percent and 7 percent in constant currency, excluding $11 million in favorable currency translation. Direct-to-consumer revenues grew 20 percent for the fourth quarter and 15 percent for the full year on performance and expansion of the retail network, as well as e-commerce growth. The company had 53 more company-operated stores at the end of fiscal 2017 than it did at the end of fiscal 2016. Wholesale reported revenues grew 10 percent for the fourth quarter, reflecting higher revenues from the Americas and Europe, and grew 5 percent for the full year primarily reflecting growth in Europe. Fourth quarter net income of $116 million grew 20 percent primarily reflecting higher EBIT and lower taxes due to additional net foreign tax credits as well as the favorable impact of foreign operations as compared to 2016. Full-year net income declined 3 percent primarily due to a $23 million loss on early extinguishment of debt as a result of debt refinancing activities this year, net losses on foreign exchange contracts, reflecting the appreciation of most foreign currencies against the US dollar during the year, partially offset by lower taxes reflecting additional foreign tax credits and the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries. Adjusted EBIT grew 7 percent in the fourth quarter reflecting higher revenues and gross margins. For the full year, Adjusted EBIT was flat, as higher revenues and gross margins were offset by higher costs related to the expansion of the company's direct-to-consumer business, increased advertising investments and higher compensation expense reflecting stronger company performance. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBIT is provided at the end of this press release.\n\"Our growth and momentum accelerated in Q4 capping the strongest revenue year the company has had in more than a decade,\" said Chip Bergh, president and chief executive officer. \"Our strategies are working and the investments that we’ve made to diversify our business over the past few years are paying off, best demonstrated by the strength of the Levi’s brand globally.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nOn a reported basis, gross margin for the fourth quarter was 53.4 percent of revenues compared with 50.7 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2016, reflecting the margin benefit from revenue growth in the direct-to-consumer channel and international business. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the fourth quarter were $634 million compared with $518 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in costs reflects the expansion of the company's direct-to-consumer business, higher advertising expenses and higher compensation expense reflecting stronger company performance. Operating income of $150 million in the fourth quarter was up from $143 million in the same quarter of 2016, primarily reflecting higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SG&A.\nRegional Overview\nReported regional net revenues and operating income for the quarter were as follows:\nNet Revenues Operating Income* Three Months Ended % Increase\n(Decrease)\nThree Months Ended % Increase\n(Decrease)\n($ millions) November 26,\n2017\nNovember 27,\n2016\nNovember 26,\n2017\nNovember 27,\n2016\nAmericas $ 855 $ 799 7 % $ 181 $ 167 9 % Europe $ 374 $ 292 28 % $ 38 $ 31 24 % Asia $ 237 $ 209 13 % $ 22 $ 17 28 % * Note: Regional operating income is equal to regional adjusted EBIT. Business segment information for the prior-year period has been revised to reflect a change in presentation. Effective in the first quarter of 2017, central costs previously recorded in the Americas region and corporate expenses have been allocated to the regional business segments.\nIn the Americas, net revenues grew 7 percent on a reported and constant currency basis, reflecting higher revenues across both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The increase in operating income reflects higher net revenues partially offset by higher selling and advertising investments. In Europe, excluding favorable currency effects of $18 million, net revenues grew 21 percent reflecting broad-based growth across all markets and channels, including strong growth in the women's and tops business. Operating income growth of 24 percent reflects improved leverage driven by higher net revenues. In Asia, net revenues grew 13 percent on a reported and constant currency basis, reflecting direct-to-consumer expansion and performance. Operating income growth reflects higher revenues and franchisee support provided in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by an increase in selling expenses related to retail expansion.\nFiscal Year 2017 Highlights\nOn a reported basis, gross margin for the fiscal year was 52.3% compared with 51.2% in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting strong growth in international and retail revenues, favorable transaction impact of currency and sourcing savings. SG&A expenses for the fiscal year were $2,096 million compared with $1,867 million in fiscal 2016. Higher costs primarily reflected expansion of the company's retail network and investment in its ecommerce business, increased advertising investments and higher incentive compensation expense reflecting the company's performance. Operating income of $467 million for the fiscal year was up from $462 million in 2016, reflecting global revenue growth and higher gross margins, partially offset by continued investments in the direct-to-consumer business and increased investments in advertising.\nRegional Overview\nReported regional net revenues and operating income for the fiscal year were as follows:\nNet Revenues Operating Income* Year Ended % Increase\n(Decrease)\nYear Ended % Increase\n(Decrease)\n($ millions) November 26,\n2017\nNovember 27,\n2016\nNovember 26,\n2017\nNovember 27,\n2016\nAmericas $ 2,774 $ 2,683 3 % $ 529 $ 508 4 % Europe $ 1,312 $ 1,091 20 % $ 199 $ 155 28 % Asia $ 818 $ 778 5 % $ 78 $ 81 (3 )% * Note: Regional operating income is equal to regional adjusted EBIT. Business segment information for the prior-year period has been revised to reflect a change in presentation. Effective in the first quarter of 2017, central costs previously recorded in the Americas region and corporate expenses have been allocated to the regional business segments.\nIn the Americas, net revenues grew 3 percent on a reported and constant currency basis, primarily reflecting the performance and expansion of our company-operated retail network and strong performance in our Signature ® and Denizen ® brands. This was offset by lower wholesale revenues in the United States in our Dockers ® brand. The increase in operating income reflects higher net revenues and gross margins partially offset by higher selling and advertising expenses. In Europe, excluding favorable currency effects of $13 million, net revenues grew 19 percent reflecting broad-based growth across all markets and channels. Operating income growth of 28 percent reflects higher net revenues and gross margins, partially offset by higher selling expenses to support growth and higher investments in advertising. In Asia, excluding unfavorable currency effects of $2 million, net revenues grew 5 percent, primarily reflecting direct-to-consumer expansion and performance. Operating income declined 3 percent, primarily reflecting higher selling costs to support retail expansion, including ecommerce.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nAt November 26, 2017, cash and cash equivalents of $634 million were complemented by $758 million available under the company's revolving credit facility, resulting in a total liquidity position of approximately $1.4 billion. Net debt at the end of fiscal 2017 was $444 million.\nFree cash flow for fiscal 2017 was $284 million, an increase of $126 million compared to fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by increased payments to vendors reflecting the growth in our company-operated store network and higher investment in advertising. A reconciliation of net debt and free cash flow, non-GAAP financial measures, is provided at the end of this press release.\nSubsequent to the fiscal year end, on January 30, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for $90 million, which is a 29% increase relative to the dividend declared in 2017. The company expects to pay this in two installments in 2018 with the first installment in our first quarter and the second installment in our fourth quarter.\nInvestor Conference Call\nThe company’s fourth quarter 2017 investor conference call will be available through a live audio webcast at https://engage.vevent.com/rt/levistraussao~7178757 on February 7, 2018, at 1 p.m. Pacific / 4 p.m. Eastern or via the following phone numbers: 800-891-4735 in the United States and Canada, or +1-973-200-3066 internationally; I.D.

We have based these forward-looking statements on our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. We use words like “believe,” “will,” “so we can,” “when,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of our senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Investors should consider the information contained in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2017, especially in the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” sections. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results, performance or achievements. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this news release and related conference call may not occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date stated, or if no date is stated, as of the date of this news release and related conference call. We are not under any obligation and do not intend to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained in this news release and related conference call to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this news release and related conference call or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company reports its financial results in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and the rules of the SEC. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Free Cash Flow, Net Debt and Adjusted EBIT, provide users of the company’s financial information with additional useful information. The tables found below include Free Cash Flow, Net Debt and Adjusted EBIT and corresponding reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations, include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities, (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. Additionally, the methods used by the company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies, limiting the usefulness of these measures. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\nThe company presents non-GAAP financial measures, such as Free Cash Flow, Net Debt and Adjusted EBIT, because it believes they provide investors, financial analysts and the public with additional information to measure performance and evaluate the company’s ability to service its debt and may be useful for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures and tax rates. The company further believes these measures may be useful for period-over-period comparisons of underlying business trends and its ongoing operations. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nConstant currency\nConstant-currency comparisons are based on translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign exchange rates for the current year. The company routinely evaluates its financial performance on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons without regard to the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates.\nLEVI STRAUSS & CO.
