In early December, they were a record $19 billion, according to central bank data.\nThe figures indicated that falls in T-bill yields over recent weeks had not caused a big exodus of foreign money out of the bills. The yield on 182-day bills fell to 17.358 percent at an auction this week from 22.278 percent in mid-July.\nInflation has also been coming down after a spike in the months after the currency devaluation; annual urban consumer price inflation eased to 17.1 percent in January from 33.0 percent in July.\n“Inflation is on a good path,” Garhy said when asked about the trend.\nAsked when the government might next cut fuel subsidies in order to strengthen its finances, Garhy declined to discuss a time frame, saying merely that the government was addressing the issue under a long-term reform plan.\nReporting by Andrew Torchia\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T17:13:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
