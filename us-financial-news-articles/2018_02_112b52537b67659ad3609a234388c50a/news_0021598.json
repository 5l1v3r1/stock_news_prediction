REUTERS/Edgar Su As Jamaica’s first Winter Olympians, the men’s sledders were considered the ultimate underdogs at the 1988 Calgary Games and their appearance drew huge media attention.\nFenlator-Victorian and Russell are determined to bring more than novelty value, however, and have made huge strides in recent months, finishing seventh at a World Cup event in Winterberg, Germany, in December.\n“It’s important for us as a women’s team to show people that women can do dangerous, speedy, strong, fast sports as well as,” Fenlator-Victorian said.\n”It’s important for us to show that Jamaica can do it.\n“It doesn’t matter that we’re a small island and that it’s 30 degrees Celsius in here. The other day in training it was minus 30.”\nWriting by Ian Ransom,; Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T13:47:47.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
