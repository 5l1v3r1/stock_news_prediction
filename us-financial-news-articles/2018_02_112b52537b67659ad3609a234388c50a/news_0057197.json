(“Park”) (NYSE:PK) today announced that it closed on the sale of 11 non-core assets, including a portfolio of three Embassy Suites hotels, a portfolio of seven U.K. hotels and one South African hotel for total gross proceeds of $317 million, equating to $136,000 per key across three separate transactions. When adjusted for Park’s anticipated capital expenditures of $123 million for the 11 hotels, the proceeds represent a 5.7% capitalization rate on the portfolio’s projected 2017 net operating income (7.9% excluding capex), or 14.8x the portfolio’s projected 2017 EBITDA (10.7x excluding capex).\n“I am thrilled with our team’s success in executing our stated strategy of recycling capital out of non-core assets with significant expected capex, while dramatically reducing our exposure to international markets,” commented Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Park. “Since the start of the year, we have closed on 12 asset sales totaling nearly $379 million with an average RevPAR of just $106, or 36% lower than Park’s pro-forma RevPAR on a trailing 12-month basis, while saving an estimated $132 million of anticipated capex over the next few years.”\nEmbassy Suites Portfolio\nThe Embassy Suites portfolio sold for total gross proceeds of approximately $95.8 million, equating to $142,000 per key.
