If I go to a night club that is not used to people like me, everything that is different is going to generate resistance.”\nBorn in the Rio favela of Providencia, Carvalho always loved Carnival: after debuting with a small neighborhood group at age 14, she began parading on floats with the Salgueiro samba group in 2008.\nTransgender dancer Kamilla Carvalho performs during the rehearsal of Salgueiro samba school prior the carnival parade in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil January 11, 2018. REUTERS/Pilar Olivares Her big break came last year, when she met the head of Salgueiro, Regina Celi, who invited her to parade in a prominent position.\nTen years after dancing with Salgueiro for the first time, Carvalho will play a queen as part of this year’s “Women of the World’s Womb” theme, which celebrates the strength of black women.\nSlideshow (7 Images) “The story is about ... women warriors ... those who made it possible for women to be empowered today. I think the story is perfect for me,” Carvalho said.\nCeli said Carvalho’s prominent role this year was good for Salgueiro, which will compete against 12 other groups for the coveted title of Rio’s Carnival champions, a hotly contested event that tens of millions of Brazilians watch live on TV.\n“It is only natural for us to have this beautiful transgender woman representing us,” Celi said.\nDespite the danger transgender people face in Brazil, Kamilla sees Carnival as an opportunity to promote tolerance.\n“People should use the street carnival to enjoy themselves peacefully ... without segregating any kind of person, any race, to embrace people,” she said.\nReporting by Maria Clara Pestre; Writing by Alexandra Alper, Editing by Brad Brooks and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T22:20:21.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
