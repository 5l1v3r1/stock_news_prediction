Too often times we see Africa as a place that is wanting, and here it’s a place that you want to go,” she said. \nThe movie, directed by Ryan Coogler and also featuring Michael B. Jordan, Angela Bassett, Forest Whittaker and Daniel Kaluuya, arrives to stellar reviews after years of criticism about the under-representation of movies, actors and filmmakers of color in Hollywood.

You see it with white actors, (like) ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ where it’s Brad Pitt and Matt Damon and George Clooney, and it’s like ‘why does that never happen with us?'” Boseman said.

It’ll make Hollywood stop saying ‘well, your movies don’t travel,” he said. \n“Black Panther” also offers a new type of villain through Jordan’s Killmonger, an empathetic former military black-ops agent, who wants to distribute Wakanda’s wealth to arm the world’s black population and help them rise to power. \nWakanda is depicted as a verdant land with stunning waterfalls where spacecraft designed like tribal masks soar over a modern metropolis. \n“The aesthetic of it is so pleasing, and so black and so Afro-centric and African and modern and worldly and futuristic,” said Bassett. \n“All this brilliance and excellence... It’s extremely important. Especially for our young people,” she said.
