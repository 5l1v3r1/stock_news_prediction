The warrant involved former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page and was renewed three times since October 2016. \n“We have a responsibility ... to ensure Americans that the FISA process is not being abused, and that’s what we did,” Devin Nunes, the panel’s Republican chairman, told Fox News on Monday. \nTrump, in a post on Twitter on Monday, accused Schiff of leaking “confidential” information. \n“Adam (Schiff) leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!” Trump wrote.
