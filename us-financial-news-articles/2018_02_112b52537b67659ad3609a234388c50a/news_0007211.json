Sanofi Pasteur’s mission is to reduce or eliminate suffering for millions around the world through vaccination, including in the Philippines,” a spokesman for Sanofi said in an emailed statement. \n“Dengue fever is one of the most pressing public health issues facing the Philippines today. Sanofi Pasteur remains committed to working with the Philippines government and all organisations to address this urgent public health challenge.” \nThe Philippine Health Ministry halted Dengvaxia immunisations in November. It formed a 10-member panel of experts to determine if the drug was directly connected to the deaths of 14 children after they were given the vaccine. \nIt found it may have been connected to the deaths of three. Dr. Juliet Sio-Aguilar, expert panel head of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), stresses a point during a news conference at the Department of Health (DOH) headquarters in metro Manila, Philippines February 2, 2018.

Two of them may have died because of vaccine failure,” Health Undersecretary Enrique Domingo told a news conference. \n“These findings strengthen the decision of the Department of Health to stop the vaccine. It has failed in some children. Dengvaxia is not ready for mass vaccinations and we would need three to five more years to watch and monitor if there would be other adverse reactions from the vaccine.” \nMosquito-borne dengue is the world’s fastest-growing infectious disease, afflicting up to 100 million people worldwide, causing half a million life-threatening infections and killing about 20,000 people, mostly children, each year. \nDomingo said the panel’s findings would be shared with the justice department, which is considering cases against those responsible for the mass immunisation programme. \nPaediatrician and panel member Juliet Sio-Aguilar, from the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital, said the team was recommending further studies as it was difficult to directly connect the three deaths to Dengvaxia. \nNo vaccine has a 100 percent success rate, she said. The dengue death rate in the Philippines was 60 times higher than global rate, Sio-Aguilar said. \nThe Philippines spent 3.5 billion pesos ($68 million) on the Dengvaxia programme to reduce the 200,000 dengue cases reported every year. \nThe Philippines has already fined Sanofi a symbolic $2,000, citing violations in product registration and marketing.
