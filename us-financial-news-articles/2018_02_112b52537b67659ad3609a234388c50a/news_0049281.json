REUTERS/Marco Bello Evangelical Christianity, with its charismatic preachers and lively ceremonies, has grown rapidly in Latin America, which has been predominantly Catholic for centuries.\nHis followers see him as a divine emissary sent to bring a change in the country, which has been under socialist rule since the late president Hugo Chavez was elected in 1998.\nSlideshow (12 Images) “I do not intend to make myself look like a messiah because I already believe in one: Jesus Christ,” he said.\nHis candidacy is still seen as having little chance of success. He has no known political experience and little name recognition in Venezuela.\nStill, he insists he will capitalize on the social work of his church, which he said has served millions of bowls of soup to the poor during Venezuela’s crippling economic crisis that has made food and medicine unaffordable and scarce.\nMarried for 25 years and with three children plus a recently-adopted child, Bertucci, like many Latin American Evangelicals, ardently opposes abortion and insists adoption should not be available for same-sex couples.\n“I respect and love any person who has a different sexual orientation, but in a legal sense, I would have to tell them categorically that I would never support this (adoption),” he said.\nReporting by Ana Isabel Martinez and Andreina Aponte; Writing by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T03:30:06.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
