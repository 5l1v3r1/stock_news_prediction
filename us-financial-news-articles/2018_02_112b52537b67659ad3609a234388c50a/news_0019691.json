If Wenger turned round and said: ‘Aubameyang, (Mesut) Ozil, Mkhitaryan and Ramsey, you four go and get on with it’, and the other six keep it tight then I would give them a great chance. \n“But the two Arsenal full backs will be playing as wingers after five minutes and you know they’ll be all over the shop defensively.” Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T15:33:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
