By 2045 it expects that figure to rise to 6 billion.\nAs populations around the world grow and more people migrate from rural to urban areas, an estimated $94 trillion of infrastructure investments will be needed by 2040, the G20-backed Global Infrastructure Hub said last year.\nInequality is rampant in many cities, where infrastructure is struggling to keep pace with rapid urbanisation, leaving them ill-equipped to deal with the effects of climate change.\nThe 100RC initiative has spent the last four years bringing together local experts, appointing and training chief resilience officers, and pinpointing challenges and solutions in cities.\nThe Resilience Accelerator will connect urban leaders working on projects with academics and others who can help them find funding, map cities, collect data, test and evaluate different strategies, and “fine-tune” resilience plans.\nAcademics at the newly formed Center for Resilient Cities and Landscapes at Columbia University will use the Accelerator to fast-track eight 100RC projects over the next two years, with the selection process beginning in the spring.\nPrivate-sector and other experts will also be consulted as needed, officials told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, which partners with The Rockefeller Foundation on resilience coverage.\nThe Columbia University centre will run workshops combining global expertise and local knowledge to propel projects forward, said Thaddeus Pawlowski, its managing director.\n\"We hope to have major impact in driving these projects and policies and plans so that they are better attuned to the stresses and challenges of the 21st century,\" he said.
