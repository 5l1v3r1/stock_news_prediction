The Tigers are in sole possession of fourth place in the league standings.\nGeorgia Tech slipped to 11-18, 4-12 with its seventh consecutive loss.

Okogie scored 17 first-half points on 6-of-6 shooting while also grabbing seven rebounds.\nThe Yellow Jackets opened the second half with a 7-0 run to push their lead to 11 and still held an 11-point edge 58-47 with 10 minutes left, but sparked by DeVoe and Mitchell, Clemson went on a 22-3 run over the next nine minutes to take control.\nDeVoe, who had made just 2-of-14 from 3-point range in the Tigers’ last two games, went 4-of-7 from beyond the arc.\nClemson has two regular-season games remaining -- Wednesday against Florida State and Saturday at Syracuse.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:04:19.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
