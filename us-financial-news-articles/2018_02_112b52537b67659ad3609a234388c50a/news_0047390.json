Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nFederal Reserve officials see increased economic growth and creeping inflation, as revealed in the Federal Open Markets Committee's latest minutes. Officials concluded that \"upside risks\" to economic growth had increased thanks to tax cuts, increased consumer spending and confidence.\n\"A majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate,\" the summary stated.\nThe Fed \"talked about paying more attention to asset prices and even though we've had a correction lately, asset growth has been high ... That's something I regard as hawkish,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. \"The other thing and more important thing is that these minutes were from three weeks ago. Since then we've had a higher than expected wage number and higher than expected CPI number.\"\n\"These notes were a little bit on the hawkish side, but if anything, the Fed may be even more inclined to hike now.\"\nFOMC members said they have increased economic projections they made at the previous meeting in December.\nSymbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR ---\n\"We're getting into a big focal point for the bond market here as it faces increased supply, decreased central bank buying and an economy in the ninth year of an expansion,\" Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management said. \"Rates have risen and they've risen quite quickly.

The bid-to-cover ratio, an indicator of demand, was 2.44. Indirect bidders, which include major central banks, were awarded 58 percent. Direct bidders, which includes domestic money managers, bought 12.7 percent.\nFor his part, Neil Sutherland of Schroders argued that the market may have been forecasting something more aggressive from the central bank.\n\"I think the market has got itself in a bit of a frenzy about higher yields. The market perhaps had been extrapolating something a bit more hawkish,\" the portfolio manager said. \"The market has had to absorb a lot of supply over the past week ... I think the narrative of rampant inflation is a bit overblown.\"\nInvestors in the bond space also looked for news in the data space.\nMortgage interest rates jumped again for the week ending Feb. 16 , sending application volume tumbling 6.6 percent on an adjusted basis from the previous week. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances increased to its highest level since January 2014, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\nExisting home sales slumped for a second straight month in January, fettered by a shortage of houses that has prices climbing and keeping new buyers away.\nThe National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday that existing home sales dropped 3.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million units last month.\n— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T12:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T12:24:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
