They also claimed responsibility for two major attacks in Kabul last month that killed or wounded hundreds of civilians and shook public confidence in the Western-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani.\nU.S. officials say the only option for an end to the war is a negotiated settlement between the Taliban and the Afghan government.\nIn an interview this week with Voice of America, Wells said the next meeting in the so-called “Kabul process”, beginning on Wednesday, would aim to make clear that there was the potential for dialogue.\n“I‘m confident that the conference is going to push forward regional efforts to enforce what has been our most important message to the Taliban - that the door is open, there is a path to peace and stability,” she said.\nBut while all sides say they want a peaceful solution and there have been behind-the-scenes contacts, the only major peace talks broke down almost immediately after they started in 2015.\nThe Taliban, fighting to restore their version of strict Islamic law since they were driven from power in Kabul by a U.S.-led campaign in 2001, have in the past insisted that international forces must leave Afghanistan as a precondition for talks.\nReporting by James Mackenzie; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T19:28:38.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
