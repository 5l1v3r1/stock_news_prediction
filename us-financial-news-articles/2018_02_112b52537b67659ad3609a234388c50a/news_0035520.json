I am grateful to the FCC’s Inspector General that he has decided to take up this important investigation,” Pallone said in a statement.\nPallone cited the FCC’s decision in April to reverse a 2016 decision limiting the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy, paving the way for the Sinclair-Tribune deal.\nPallone also said the FCC’s decision to allow the TV industry to transition to a new digital standard “could provide billions of dollars in licensing fees to Sinclair through its patent holdings” and a vote to change existing broadcast media ownership limits removed obstacles “to Sinclair increasing its reach beyond the Tribune merger proposal.”\nPolitical media company Politico, citing unnamed sources, reported in December 2016 that Trump’s campaign made a deal with Sinclair to get favorable coverage in exchange for more access to Trump.\nPai has repeatedly denied he has taken actions aimed at benefiting a single company and Sinclair has denied improper conduct.\nA spokesman for Pai said on Thursday the “accusation that he has shown favoritism toward the company is absurd,” citing the FCC’s $13 million proposed fine of Sinclair over undisclosed paid programming. He said Pai’s actions on media rules “have been consistent with his long-held reviews.”\nThe inspector general’s office has not confirmed the investigation.\nDemocratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said last year “it has reached a point where all our media policy decisions seem to be custom built for this one company.”\nSinclair announced plans in May to acquire Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets as well as cable network WGN America, extending its reach to 72 percent of American households.\nThe FCC’s said last month it was pausing its informal 180-day timetable for completing its review of the transaction to evaluate Sinclair’s offer of divestitures.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T19:55:36.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
