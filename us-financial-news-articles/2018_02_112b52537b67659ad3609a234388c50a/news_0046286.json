We skied them and tested them and... they were fastest so we used them,” Bank said at Czech House, where fans were celebrating the country’s first ever Alpine skiing gold medal.\nLedecka, meanwhile, opted for a quiet night to prepare for her snowboard event next week, a discipline she was better known for prior to Saturday, having become the first Czech to win the parallel giant slalom World Cup in the 2015-16 season.\nFew expected her snowboarding success to translate to the dramatically different sport of Alpine skiing, where Ledecka entered the super-G ranked 43rd in the World Cup standings.\n“Yesterday she was a better snowboarder, but today, maybe she is a better skier,” Bank added.\nEditing by Darren Schuettler/John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:11:03.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
