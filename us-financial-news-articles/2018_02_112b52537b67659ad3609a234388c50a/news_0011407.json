The benchmark rose 0.5 percent on Friday. \nFinancial stocks slipped 1.3 percent, with the ‘Big Four’ banks all losing over 1 percent each. \nMiners fell 2.5 percent to their lowest close since December 29 with gold and copper prices slipping as the U.S. dollar strengthened on unexpectedly strong employment data. \nU.S. job growth surged in January and wages recorded their largest annual gain in more than 8-1/2 years, bolstering expectations that inflation will push higher this year as the U.S. economy reaches full employment. \nIndex heavyweights BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd both shed over 2 percent to close at a five-week low. \nThe Australian gold index lost 2.6 percent, its lowest in more than three weeks. \nThe biggest drag on the main index was Resolute Mining Ltd , slumping 9.5 percent to hit a nearly 7-week closing low. \nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 2.1 percent, or 173.46 points, to a three-week closing low of 8241.83. \nHealthcare, utility and consumer staple stocks weighed the index down, with Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Ltd slipping 3.5 percent to its lowest close since November 24, and Contact Energy Ltd losing 2 percent. \nThe top loser on the main index, however, was Kathmandu Holdings, down 3.8 percent, closing at its lowest in more than two weeks.
