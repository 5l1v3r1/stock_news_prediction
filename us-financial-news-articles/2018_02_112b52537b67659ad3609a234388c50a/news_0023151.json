I mean, you're in oil and gas, you negotiate all the time, constantly, and negotiations, you don't do them publicly.\"\nEveryone needed to take a deep breath when it came to the negotiations, Dudley added. \"There are people that want to report on everything every day. That's not realistic, and in my experience negotiations don't come together until closer to a deadline, so I think it's unrealistic for her to negotiate in public. I think that's not good for the country, actually.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T19:39:12.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
