Turkish Cypriots run a breakaway state recognized only by Ankara in north Cyprus and say resources around the island belong to them too.\nCyprus’s state radio reported senior officials from Eni would hold talks in Nicosia on Monday.\nThe island was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Peace talks collapsed last year.\nTurkey’s ministry of foreign affairs said it would continue to protect Turkey’s own rights and interests on its continental shelf, and those of Turkish Cypriots.\n“We also make use of this opportunity to strongly emphasize our expectation that companies centered in third countries refrain from supporting ... this unconstructive Greek Cypriot attitude which also constitutes a major obstacle to the settlement of the Cyprus issue,” it said.\nReporting By Michele Kambas, additional reporting by Gavin Jones in Rome, Stephen Jewkes in Milan and Orhan Coskun in Ankara; Editing by Andrew Heavens, Susan Fenton and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T06:32:09.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
