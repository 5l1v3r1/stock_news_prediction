We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in those acts. Such statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies, anticipated dividends, and prospects and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated. Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" or other similar words. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. We make no representations or warranties (express or implied) about the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements contained in this press release, and we do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nAny such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors and are based on a number of assumptions involving judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, and market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately. To the extent that our assumptions differ from actual conditions, our ability to accurately anticipate results expressed in such forward-looking statements, including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, make distributions to stockholders, and maintain the value of our real estate properties, may be significantly hindered. See Item 1A in the Company's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, for a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. The risk factors described in our Annual Report are not the only ones we face, but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208005398/en/\nColumbia Property Trust, Inc.\nMedia Contact:\nBud Perrone, 212-843-8068\nbperrone@rubenstein.com\nor\nInvestor Relations:\nMatt Stover, 404-465-2227\nIR@columbia.reit\nSource: Columbia Property Trust, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208005398/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.columbia.reit&esheet=51755454&newsitemid=20180208005398&lan=en-US&anchor=Columbia+Property+Trust%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=2175f26ae468a41bc56ccc960ef5d3d0", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.columbia.reit&esheet=51755454&newsitemid=20180208005398&lan=en-US&anchor=www.columbia.reit&index=2&md5=5e2e98f68114a33477f33fb284aa5749"], "published": "2018-02-08T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:31:00.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
