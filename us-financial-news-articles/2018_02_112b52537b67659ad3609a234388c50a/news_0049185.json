Yes, there is censorship in Iran. Yes, it’s difficult to live with it and yes we are dealing with it. But there is so much more to discuss,” he said. \n“Khook - Pig” is one of 19 films competing for the Berlin International Film Festival’s Golden Bear, to be awarded on Feb. 24. \nReporting by Riham Alkousaa; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T22:43:11.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
