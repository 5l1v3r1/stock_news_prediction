(NYSE: AWK) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2017.\n\"This past year was one of continued solid growth for American Water and outstanding execution by our employees,\" said Susan Story, president and CEO of American Water. \"With a strong fourth quarter finish, our 2017 adjusted EPS increased 7 percent over 2016. To meet the nationally recognized need for significantly more water infrastructure investment, we invested more capital in our water and wastewater systems -$1.4 billion- than in any other previous year. As importantly, we achieved our best ever O&M efficiency ratio in order to make this investment more affordable for our customers.\n\"We will continue to focus on delivering our customers the most reliable and safe water services at an affordable price in 2018 and beyond, and the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will aid us even more in doing so.\n“We plan to invest between $8.0 billion to $8.6 billion over the next five years,\" added Story. \"We are also affirming our 2018 EPS guidance of $3.22 to $3.32, and remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term EPS growth of 7 to 10 percent.\"\nConsolidated Results\nThe company's three months and annual results are included in the table below:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Diluted earnings per share (GAAP): Net income attributable to common stockholders $ (0.01 ) $ 0.57 $ 2.38 $ 2.62 Non-GAAP adjustments: Impact of Freedom Industries settlement activities — — (0.12 ) 0.36 Income tax impact — — 0.05 (0.14 ) Net non-GAAP adjustment — — (0.07 ) 0.22 Early extinguishment of debt at the parent company — — 0.03 — Income tax impact — — (0.01 ) — Net non-GAAP adjustment — — 0.02 — Impact of re-measurement from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 0.70 — 0.70 — Total non-GAAP adjustments 0.70 — 0.65 0.22 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 0.69 $ 0.57 $ 3.03 $ 2.84 In the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP income decreased $0.58 per diluted share compared to the prior year. This included a $0.70 per diluted share charge resulting from the non-cash, after-tax re-measurement charge associated with the impact of the change in the federal tax rate from implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) enacted on December 22, 2017.\nAdjusted earnings were $0.69 per diluted share (a non-GAAP measure) for the fourth quarter 2017, an increase of 12 cents per diluted share, or 21 percent, over the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily associated with continued growth in the Regulated Businesses driven mainly by infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth. The Market-Based Businesses were up a penny with growth in the Homeowner Services Group partially offset by lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group.\nFor the full year 2017, GAAP income decreased $0.24 per diluted share compared to the prior year. 2017 GAAP earnings included a $0.07 per diluted share benefit from an insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, a $0.02 per diluted share charge from early extinguishment of debt at the parent company and a $0.70 per diluted share charge, resulting from the non-cash, after-tax re-measurement charge associated with the enactment of the TCJA. Included in 2016 GAAP earnings was a $0.22 per diluted share charge from the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the Freedom Industries chemical spill.\nAdjusted earnings were $3.03 per diluted share for the full year of 2017, an increase of $0.19 per diluted share, or 7 percent, over the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily associated with continued growth in the Regulated Businesses driven mainly by infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth, combined with growth in the Market-Based Businesses mainly from the Homeowner Services Group and Keystone. These increases were partially offset by warmer weather in 2016 compared to 2017 and two discrete tax adjustments recorded at the parent company associated with legislative changes in New York and Illinois impacting state tax apportionment.\nFor the full year 2017, the company made capital investments of $1.7 billion, a record level of investment, including $1.4 billion dedicated primarily to improving infrastructure in the Regulated Businesses to provide safe, clean and reliable service to its customers, and over $210 million for regulated acquisitions.\nRegulated Businesses Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation (A Non-GAAP, unaudited measure)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (GAAP) $ 113 $ 98 $ 559 $ 472 Non-GAAP adjustment: Impact of Freedom Industries settlement activities — — (22 ) 65 Income tax impact — — 9 (26 ) Net non-GAAP adjustment — — (13 ) 39 Impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 6 — 6 — Total net non-GAAP adjustments 6 — (7 ) 39 Adjusted net income $ 119 $ 98 $ 552 $ 511 For the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted net income was $119 million, compared to $98 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of approximately 21 percent. Regulated revenue increased $16 million driven by a $27 million increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions, and organic growth; partially offset by a $11 million decrease in lower demand of which $3 million is related to warmer weather during the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter net depreciation was favorable $7 million, mainly due to the implementation of new depreciation rates in our Illinois subsidiary. O&M expense was favorable $5 million mainly due to the timing of expenditures last year and the continued focus on cost management.\nFor the full year 2017, adjusted net income was $552 million, compared to $511 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of 8 percent. Regulated revenue increased $87 million driven by a $133 million increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, wastewater services, acquisitions, and organic growth; partially offset by a $48 million decrease in lower demand of which $15 million is related to warmer weather during 2016. This increase was partially offset by higher net depreciation and interest of $34 million associated with infrastructure investment growth partially offset by the implementation of new depreciation rates in our Illinois subsidiary. O&M expense remained relatively flat due to the continued focus on cost management.\nFor the full year 2017, the Company received additional annualized revenues of approximately $43 million from general rate cases and step increases and approximately $33 million in additional annualized revenues from infrastructure surcharges. The company is awaiting final orders for general rate cases in three states and filed for infrastructure surcharges in three states for a total annualized revenue request of approximately $255 million. The extent to which requested rate increases will be granted by the applicable regulatory agencies will vary.\nFor the full year 2017, the adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) improved to 33.8 percent, compared to 34.9 percent for the full year 2016. By reducing O&M expense as a proportion of revenue, American Water is able to make investments in needed capital improvements without significantly impacting customer bills.\nMarket-Based Businesses Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation (A Non-GAAP, unaudited measure)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (GAAP) $ 9 $ 13 $ 38 $ 39 Non-GAAP adjustment: Impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 5 — 5 — Adjusted net income $ 14 $ 13 $ 43 $ 39 For the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted net income was $14 million, compared to $13 million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted net income was up $1 million, driven by growth in the Homeowner Services Group through customer growth and price increases for certain customers, offset by lower capital projects in the Military Services Group.\nFor the full year 2017, adjusted net income was $43 million, compared to $39 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of 10 percent. The increase was driven by growth in the Homeowner Services Group through customer growth and price increases for certain customers and growth at Keystone Clearwater Solutions from improving market conditions, partially offset by lower capital projects in the Military Services Group from lower military budgets and completion of a project at Fort Polk mid-year 2016.\nDividends\nOn Dec. 8, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.415 per share payable on Mar. 1, 2018, to stockholders of record as of Feb. 7, 2018.\n2018 Earnings Guidance\nAmerican Water has affirmed its 2018 earnings guidance to be in the range of $3.22 - $3.32 per diluted share. The company’s earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below and under “Risk Factors” in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes presentations of adjusted net income for the Regulated Businesses and the Market-Based Businesses, as well as consolidated adjusted earnings per diluted share (“Adjusted EPS”). These items constitute “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but are not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EPS is defined as GAAP earnings per diluted common share, excluding (i) the impact in the third quarter of 2017 of the insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill; (ii) a charge incurred in the third quarter of 2017 with respect to the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company; (iii) the non-cash, after-tax re-measurement charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on American Water's deferred income taxes from the enactment of the TCJA; and (iv) the impact in the fourth quarter of 2016 of the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. Adjusted net income for the Regulated Businesses and the Market-Based Businesses is defined as GAAP diluted net income, excluding, as applicable (i) the impact in the third quarter of 2017 of the insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill; (ii) the non-cash, after-tax re-measurement charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on American Water's deferred income taxes from the enactment of the TCJA; and (iii) the impact in the fourth quarter of 2016 of the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement the company’s GAAP disclosures and should not be considered as alternatives to the GAAP measures.\nManagement believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to American Water’s investors because they provide an indication of its baseline performance excluding items that are not considered by management to be reflective of ongoing operating results. Although management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate American Water’s results of operations, management does not intend results excluding the adjustments to represent results as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider them as indicators of performance. These items are derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but are not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company’s definition of adjusted net income or Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures may have significant limitations on their use.\nSet forth in this release is a table that reconciles each of adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nThis press release also includes a presentation of adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio, which excludes from its calculation estimated purchased water revenues and purchased water expenses, the impact of certain activities related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, and the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes. This item constitutes a “non-GAAP financial measure” under SEC rules. This item is derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure supplements and should be read in conjunction with the company’s GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to any GAAP measure.\nManagement believes that the presentation of this measure is useful to investors because it provides a means of evaluating the company’s operating performance without giving effect to items that are not reflective of management’s ability to increase efficiency of the company’s regulated operations. In preparing operating plans, budgets and forecasts, and in assessing historical performance, management relies, in part, on trends in the company’s historical results, exclusive of estimated revenues and expenses related to purchased water, the impact of settlement activities related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill and the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs. The company’s definition of this metric may not be comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure may have significant limitations on its use.\nSet forth in this release is a table that reconciles each of the components used to calculate adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n2017 Year-end and Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call\nThe 2017 and fourth quarter earnings conference call will take place on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2018, at 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
