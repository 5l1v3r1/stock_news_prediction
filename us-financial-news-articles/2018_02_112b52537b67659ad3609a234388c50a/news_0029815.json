(NYSE American:NSPR), a leader in embolic prevention systems (EPS) / thrombus management technologies and neurovascular devices, today announced results for the fourth quarter and year-ending December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 financial highlights:\nSales increase 159% versus the same period last year CGuard™ EPS sales increase 211% versus Q4 2016\nRecent operating highlights:\nCGuard™ EPS prominently featured in two successful live case transmissions at LINC 2018 in Germany, a live case transmission at ENDOGRAFT 2017 in Italy, and a live case transmission at Cracow Vascular Summit 2017 in Poland New distributors announced for CGuard™ EPS in India, Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam Regulatory approval of CGuard™ EPS granted in India Independent imaging study published highlighting the advantages of CGuard™ EPS in reducing stent plaque prolapse compared to another next generation carotid stent CGuard™ EPS demonstrated improved outcomes over carotid endarterectomy in a 50-patient comparative study; preliminary results featured at the 7th Munich Vascular Conference 2017 Follow-up results from the PARADIGM clinical study presented at the 2017 VEITH Symposium in New York and ICI Meeting 2017 in Tel Aviv demonstrating the sustained benefits of CGuard™ out to two years Patient enrollment commenced in a randomized investigator-initiated trial of CGuard™ EPS vs the market leading Acculink™ carotid stent in Russia\nJames Barry, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of InspireMD, commented, “2017 was a transformative year for InspireMD, culminating in a 211% increase in sales of CGuard™ EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017. We are rapidly building a global distribution network, but most importantly, we are growing our market share in countries where we have existing business. In addition, we continue to build strong support among key opinion leaders around the world. CGuard™ EPS has been featured at six major conferences, including live case transmissions at three of these conferences, since the fourth quarter of 2017 alone. CGuard™ EPS continues to be featured in a number of independent studies and third-party publications that further illustrate the enthusiasm for, and clinical benefits of, our technology. As a result, not only do we believe CGuard™ EPS has the potential to become a leading option for patients that undergo carotid artery stenting (CAS), but we also believe CGuard™ EPS may represent a safer alternative to the current gold standard, carotid endarterectomy (CEA), for patients with carotid artery disease, which, we believe, could significantly expand the addressable market for CGuard TM . Overall, we are extremely excited about the outlook for the business and are off to a very strong start to the first quarter of 2018.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $833,000 compared to $322,000 during the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of CGuard™ EPS as we transitioned from our prior exclusive distribution partner for most of Europe to local distributors, expanded into new geographies such as Russia, and continued focus on expanding existing markets such as Italy . In addition to the increase in sales of CGuard™ EPS, sales of MGuard Prime EPS™ also increased primarily from increased geographical coverage in Latin America. Total operating expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $1,660,000, a decrease of 18.4% compared to $2,035,000 for the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in salary expenses primarily due to a salary related accrual as well as a decrease in clinical and development costs related to CGuard™ EPS. Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 totaled $1,500,000, or $7.38 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2,265,000, or $30.59 per basic and diluted share, in the same period in 2016.\nRevenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $2,761,000, representing an increase of 31.4% compared to $1,894,000 during the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of CGuard™ EPS as we transitioned from our prior exclusive distribution partner for most of Europe to local distributors, expanded into new geographies such as Russia, and continued focus on expanding existing markets such as Italy . Total operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $8,817,000, an increase of 13.8% compared to $7,750,000 for the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses (primarily to support the commercialization of CGuard™ EPS). Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $8,438,000, or $34.98 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $8,461,000, or $207.72 per basic and diluted share, in the same period in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $3,710,000, compared to $7,516,000 as of December 31, 2016.
