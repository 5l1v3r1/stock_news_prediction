In 2014 the fund issued a $600 million sukuk and raised a $500 million loan.\n“This year we don’t need to borrow but we’re opportunistic if the conditions are good,” said the chief executive. “We have maturities coming next year and the year after, and we’re always engaging with our advisers.”\nHe said the potential new borrowing will be used to refinance existing debt rather than to add leverage to the fund’s balance sheet.\nEditing by Saeed Azhar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T07:18:10.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
