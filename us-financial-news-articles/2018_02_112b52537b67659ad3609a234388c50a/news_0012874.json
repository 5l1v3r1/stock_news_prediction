If such impressive numbers continue to be seen in coming months, expect policymakers to sound increasingly hawkish.\"\nAlthough inflation is still nowhere near their target ceiling of 2 percent, ECB policymakers halved their monthly asset purchases from January and are expected to end the quantitative easing program completely by the end of the year.\nSo they will be heartened to see an index measuring prices charged leapt to 54.8 from December's 53.2, it's highest since April 2011.\nWilliamson said the PMI data, if maintained, pointed to first quarter GDP growth of 1.0 percent, which would be the best since the second quarter of 2010 and much faster than the 0.6 percent predicted by a Reuters poll last month.\nGrowth is being supported by a booming service industry. Its PMI bounced to 58.0 from 56.6, surpassing the flash estimate of 57.6 and chalking up its highest reading since August 2007.\nThat growth was boosted by new business flooding in at the fastest rate in over a decade. The sub-index was 57.3, up from 56.7 the month before to a level also not seen since August 2007.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T12:37:44.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
