Airbus is increasing production to 60 per month by mid-2019, amid recent strong demand for new aircraft.\nEngine maker CFM, which supplies both Boeing and Airbus, said last month that planemakers had begun asking about its ability to support higher production rates.\nReporting by Tim HepherEditing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T08:17:20.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
