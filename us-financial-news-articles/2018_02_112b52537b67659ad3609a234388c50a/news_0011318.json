User Justin Newman posted: “Well done, and a great commercial,” to which a Ram Trucks representative replied: “Thanks, Justin.”\nAnother Facebook user posted: “Lifelong RAM owner. You’ve made me proud.”\nBut the backlash remarks were in the majority. Lori Borgen posted on the company’s Facebook page: “Martin Luther King DID NOT march in Selma so you could use his speech to sell trucks.”\nRepresentatives from Dodge Ram and its parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles were not immediately available for comment. Neither were representatives of King’s estate or the separate non-profit entity the King Center.\nThe automotive company’s representatives told ABC News, Forbes and other media that it had received all the necessary permissions.\n“Estate representatives were a very important part of the creative process,” a Ram Trucks official told Slate.com.\nThe use of King’s speeches, images and personal papers and items including his Bible and Nobel Peace prize are closely guarded by the estate and the subject of a long-running public feud among King’s surviving children.\nLast April, PepsiCo pulled a commercial featuring model Kendall Jenner using a can of the soft drink to ease tensions between protesters and riot police after the ad prompted outrage and ridicule.
