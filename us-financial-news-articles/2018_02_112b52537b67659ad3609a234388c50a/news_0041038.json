REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo Samsung Display has yet to set a production target for the April-June period, but a further cutback is possible, the Nikkei reported, without citing sources.\nA spokesman for Samsung Display declined to comment.\nApple will halve its iPhone X production target for the first three months of the year to around 20 million units, the Nikkei reported last month, adding to growing concerns about weak sales of the $999 phone.\nThe iPhone X was the first phone to get a major design overhaul since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015, and many expected it to lead to blockbuster sales.\nReporting by Minami Funakoshi in Tokyo; Additional reporting by Ju-Min Park in Seoul; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T07:01:21.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
