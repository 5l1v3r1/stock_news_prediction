Fixed income trading declined by 27.4 percent, although equity and prime services revenue rose 12.1 percent.\nThe French bank outperformed the big five U.S. banks that on average reported fixed income, currencies and commodities revenues down 31 percent, and equities trading 7 percent lower.\nBNP Paribas has said it aims to grab market share from rivals pulling back from investment banking even as its moves ahead with its own cutbacks.\nThe bank has also embarked this year on a 3 billion euros plan to bring in new digital technologies in response to changing customers’ behaviour, with an aim to making it run more efficiently by 2020.($1 = 0.8085 euros)\nReporting by Maya Nikolaeva and Matthieu Protard, Additional reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T12:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:44:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
