In South Africa, we remain on track to substantially complete our role in the projects next year, and we are reducing our expectations for future cash usage associated with South Africa to $25-$30 million.”\nMr. Lowe continued, “Our 2018 guidance reflects our expectations for another year of significant growth in adjusted EPS to a range of $2.03-$2.18. With our strong balance sheet and solid operational and cash flow trends, we are well positioned to increase our level of investment in initiatives to drive sustainable double-digit earnings growth. We are raising our long-term targets for capital available to deploy through 2020 by 50%, to more than $600 million, and are raising our 2020 target for Adjusted EPS to a range of $2.65-$2.90, from $2.25-$2.50 previously.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Overview:\nFor 2017, the company reported revenue of $387.0 million and operating income of $1.7 million, compared with revenue of $395.3 million and operating income of $1.8 million, respectively, in 2016. Net income per share from continuing operations in 2017 was $1.35, compared with a net loss per share of $0.07 in 2016.\nSPX Core revenue* was $395.8 million and adjusted operating income* was $40.3 million, compared with Core revenue* of $377.5 million and adjusted operating income* of $43.6 million in 2016. Adjusted earnings per share* in 2017 were $0.60, compared with $0.69 in 2016.\nFull-Year 2017 Overview:\nFor the full-year 2017, the company reported revenue of $1.4 billion and operating income of $54.8 million, compared with revenue of $1.5 billion and operating income of $55.0 million in 2016. Net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2017 were $1.91, compared with $0.30 in 2016.\nSPX Core revenue* for 2017 was $1.4 billion and adjusted operating income* was $120.8 million, compared with Core revenue* of $1.4 billion and adjusted operating income* of $97.2 million in 2016. Adjusted earnings per share* in 2017 were $1.78, compared with $1.47 in 2016.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year Financial Comparisons:\nGAAP Results:\n($ millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 FY 2017 FY 2016 Revenue $ 387.0 $ 395.3 $ 1,425.8 $ 1,472.3 Segment Income 24.5 54.8 124.9 142.8 Operating Income 1.7 1.8 54.8 55.0 Adjusted Results:\n($ millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 FY 2017 FY 2016 Core Revenue* $ 395.8 $ 377.5 $ 1,396.7 $ 1,389.0 Core Segment Income* 57.3 59.5 182.7 157.3 Adjusted Operating Income* 40.3 43.6 120.8 97.2 * Non-GAAP financial measure. See attached schedules for reconciliation to most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nHVAC\nRevenue for Q4 2017 was $161.2 million, compared with $159.1 million in Q4 2016, an increase of 1.3%. Excluding a 0.8% increase related to currency fluctuation, organic revenue* increased 0.5% primarily reflecting an increase in sales of cooling products, partially offset by a decline in heating products.\nSegment income in Q4 2017 was $26.6 million, or 16.5% of revenue, compared with $31.6 million, or 19.9% of revenue in Q4 2016. The decline in segment income margins of approximately 340 basis points was driven by a less profitable sales mix and lower fixed cost absorption due to lower sales volumes of heating products. A charge associated with legal matters also negatively affected Q4 segment margins, but was a non-recurring item.\nFull-year revenue increased modestly to $511.0 million in 2017, from $509.5 million in 2016, due primarily to stronger HVAC cooling shipments partially offset by a decline in heating product sales. Segment income margins decreased 120 basis points to 14.5% of revenues.\nDetection & Measurement\nRevenue in Q4 2017 was $75.3 million, compared with $58.6 million in Q4 2016, an increase of 28.5%. Excluding a 1.7% increase related to currency fluctuation, organic revenue* increased 26.8% reflecting an increase across all product lines with particular strength in fare collection systems and communication technologies products.\nSegment income in Q4 2017 was $18.4 million, or 24.4% of revenue, compared with $14.4 million, or 24.6% of revenue, in Q4 2016. Higher segment income was driven by the revenue increase noted above.\nFull-year revenue increased 15.0% to $260.3 million in 2017, from $226.4 million in 2016, due primarily to stronger sales of fare collection systems and communication technologies products. Segment income margins increased 440 basis points to 24.4% of revenues.\nEngineered Solutions\nRevenue in Q4 2017 was $150.5 million, compared with $177.6 million in Q4 2016, a decrease of 15.3%.\nThe decrease was driven primarily by a $23.4 million, or 13.2%, reduction in revenue associated with a charge related to the South African projects, which is discussed further below, and a decline in organic revenue* of 2.7% driven primarily by the business model shift the company has been executing in process cooling, partially offset by higher transformer revenues.\nSegment loss in Q4 2017 was $20.5 million, compared with segment income of $8.8 million, or 5.0% of revenue in Q4 2016. The decline in segment income was driven by a $29.9 million charge associated with our South African projects.\nFull-year revenue declined 11.1% to $654.5 million in 2017, from $736.4 million in 2016, due primarily to a reduction in revenue of $36.9 million associated with South African project charges. A segment loss of $12.6 million in 2017, compared to segment income of $17.3 million in 2016, was due primarily to South African project charges of $52.8 million in 2017.\nEngineered Solutions (Core)\nExcluding the results of the South African projects, Engineered Solutions recorded Core revenue* in Q4 2017 of $159.3 million, compared with $159.8 million in Q4 2016, a decrease of 0.3%. Excluding the effect of currency fluctuations, organic revenue* declined 0.6% due primarily to the business model shift in process cooling.\nCore income* in Q4 2017 was $12.3 million, or 7.7% of revenue, compared with $13.5 million, or 8.4% of revenue, in Q4 2016. The reduction in Core income* and 70 basis points decline in Core income margin* were primarily due to a less favorable product mix.\nFull-year Core revenue* declined 4.2% to $625.4 million in 2017 from $653.1 million in 2016, due primarily to the business model shift the company has been executing in process cooling. Segment income margins* increased 230 basis points to 7.2% of revenues.\nSouth African Projects\nDuring Q4 2017, the company recorded a charge of $29.9 million to revise the amount of expected revenue and costs on the projects in South Africa, which resulted in a reduction in revenue of $23.4 million and an increase in cost of $6.5 million. Additionally, the company recognized a net tax benefit of $65.9 million associated with the write off of historical investments in its South African holding company for US tax purposes.\nWhen developing projections of future net cash usage associated with South Africa, the company considers a number of potential factors. Based on current projections, and a larger tax benefit than had previously been assumed, the company is reducing its expectations for net cash usage through completion of the projects to $25 to $30 million, and continues to anticipate substantial completion of its role in the projects by the end of 2019.\nRevenue attributable to the large South African projects for Q4 2017 was negative $8.8 million, compared with revenue of $17.8 million in Q4 2016. Losses for these projects recorded in our Engineered Solutions segment in Q4 2017 were $32.8 million, compared with a loss of $4.7 million in Q4 2016.\nFinancial Update:\nAs of December 31, 2017, SPX had total outstanding debt of $356.8 million and total cash of $124.3 million. During the full-year 2017, SPX generated net operating cash from continuing operations* of $54 million, including net cash usage associated with South Africa of $49.5 million, which is net of a tax benefit. Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $11 million. Net leverage as calculated under the company’s new bank credit agreement was 1.5x, compared with 2.1x at the end of Q3 2017.\n2018 Guidance:\nSPX is targeting 2018 Core revenue* in a range of $1.35 to $1.40 billion with Core segment income margin* of 14.0-14.5%. Adjusted operating income margin* is expected to be approximately 10%. Adjusted earnings per share* is expected to be in a range of $2.03 to $2.18.\nSegment performance, on a year-over-year basis, is expected to be as follows:\nRevenue Segment Income Margin % HVAC Organic growth* rate within long-term range of 2.0%-4.0% Approximately 100 basis point increase Detection & Measurement Organic growth* rate within long-term range of approximately 2.0%-6.0% Approximately 50 to 100 basis point increase Engineered Solutions (Core)* Segment (core) revenue decline* in high-single digits %; modest growth in transformer revenue; organic decline* in process cooling resulting from operating model changes Approximately 80-130 basis point increase Non-GAAP Presentation: The results and guidance in this release include non-GAAP financial measures, including “Core” results, “organic revenue increase (decrease),” “adjusted operating income (loss),” and “adjusted earnings (loss) per share.” To provide clarity to its operating results, the company reports “Core” results, which exclude the effect of the South African projects, and separately reports on the progress and results associated with the South African projects. Additionally, 2017 Core segment income and Engineered Solutions (Core) income also exclude a gain related to a contract settlement within our Engineered Solutions segment. Other items adjusted out of operating income and earnings per share consist of a loss on the refinancing of the senior credit agreement and gain on interest rate swaps in Q4 2017, non-service pension items, the previously discussed net tax benefit associated with South Africa recorded in Q4 2017, and various other tax items in 2017 and 2016, non-cash impairment charges on intangible assets recorded in Q1 and Q4 2016, the gain, and the adjustments thereto, on the sale of Dry Cooling that were recorded during each of the first three quarters of 2016, and a loss on early extinguishment of debt that was recorded in Q3 2016.\nForm 10-K: The company expects to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or before March 1, 2018.
