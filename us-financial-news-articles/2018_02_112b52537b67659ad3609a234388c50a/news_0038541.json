One person was slightly injured and seven others were in a state of shock.\nThe factory, which produces raw oil that is later transformed into other products such as biodiesel in other plants, employs 40 people.\nThe company said the causes of the accident remained unclear and that it was too early to say when then output would resume.\nIn June last year, Saipol halted output at one of its biggest crushing units in northern France after a fire hit the electricity supply system.
