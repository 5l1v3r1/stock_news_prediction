The financing is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.\nLast year, JD.com invested in logistics infrastructure in Southeast Asia, expanding from existing presence in Indonesia. It also inked a partnership with Japanese delivery firm Yamato Holdings in December to ship products from Japanese retailers to China.\nReporting by Pei Li and Adam Jourdan; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T09:17:34.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
