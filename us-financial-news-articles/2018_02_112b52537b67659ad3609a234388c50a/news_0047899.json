There are some fragments on the body of the bus. We suspect it as a bomb blast,” military spokesman Sumith Atapattu told Reuters.\n“The investigations underway to find out the details.”\nAtapattu said seven army and five air force personnel along with seven civilians were injured in a fire following the explosion on the passenger bus which operated from northern Jaffna peninsula to central town of Diyathalawa, where one of the main military training centers is located.\nSri Lanka ended a 26-year separatist war in May 2009 defeating Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who fought to carve out a separate state for ethnic minority Tamil’s in the far north of the Indian ocean island nation.\nTamil Tiger rebels commonly used Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) to target civilians and military personnel during the civil war, which killed at least 100,000 people.\nReporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T09:31:59.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
