It starts off usually as a small group of people with a religious fervor willing a space into existence and then it boils over into a moment where someone credible makes you think that this goes from impossible to inevitable, and then a whole ecosystem springs up. And we're gonna see that with these electric vertical take-off and landing craft.\"\nVertical take-off and landing (VOTL) crafts is the clunky, though more accurate way to describe this kind of futuristic vehicle, though Kraus says he prefers the more colloquial \"flying cars.\" \nHe quotes Sebastian Thrun, the founder of Alphabet's X innovation lab and the current CEO of flying car company Kitty Hawk, as saying that people are likely to be flying around in autonomous vehicles before they're driving around in autonomous vehicles.\n\"I think that's likely true,\" Kraus says. \nFor him, it isn't a question about if GV will invest, but when. \n\"I can't predict when we'll make the leap, but we've looked at a lot of this space,\" he says. \nHe also name-checked several flying car startups, including Lilium , eHang , and Joby Aviation , which just raised $100 million . Meanwhile, Alphabet CEO Larry Page is personally involved in two flying car startups : Zee Aero and the aforementioned Kitty Haw, which Thrun recently told CNBC is \"very very close\" to revealing the next version of its flying car. \nKraus says that he's passionate about this revolution in the way we get around.\n\"I'm incredibly excited because I think that there's going to be a radical transformation in the ease that we can get form Point A to Point B and the speed in which we can get there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T20:47:41.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
