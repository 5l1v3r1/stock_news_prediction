JJ Redick returned from a seven-game absence with a leg injury to contribute 20 points.\nDario Saric also had 12, but the Sixers finished 1-3 on their four-game road trip. They dropped their last three games at Oklahoma City, Milwaukee and Brooklyn. Philadelphia fell back to .500 with the loss.\nThe Nets took a 91-88 lead into the fourth quarter.\nDinwiddie hit a 3-pointer from the baseline to cap a 9-0 run for a 100-92 advantage with 7:46 remaining. Jahlil Okafor then knocked down a runner in the lane against his former team for an 11-0 spurt and a 102-92 lead.\nA pair of free throws by Dinwiddie -- he made a career-best 13 -- extended the Brooklyn lead to 107-96 with 5:43 left.\nEmbiid forced his way to the basket and converted a tough layup to get the Sixers within 111-105 with 3:05 left. Another drive by Embiid cut the lead to 111-107.\nThe Nets hit some clutch free throws down the stretch to secure the victory.\nPerhaps disappointed by not being selected as a reserve for the NBA All-Star Game, Simmons was terrific in the first half with 18 points on 9-of-11 shooting.\nEmbiid also scored 14 points, the 53rd straight game he has scored in double figures.\nAfter holding a 34-30 lead after the first, the Sixers still managed to hold on for a 65-64 lead at halftime.\nRussell led the way for the Nets with 17 points in the first half.\nThe Nets knocked down 8 of 16 shots from beyond the arc to stay within one point.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:04:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
