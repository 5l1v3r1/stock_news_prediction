Part of what we achieved in the second half was with the participation of Carroll,” Carvalhal added. \n“Unlucky for Fer, but a lucky situation for Carroll, who came into the side and performed very well.” \nSwansea, who moved out of a congested relegation zone on goal difference, have 24 points from 26 games while Leicester remained eighth with 35.
