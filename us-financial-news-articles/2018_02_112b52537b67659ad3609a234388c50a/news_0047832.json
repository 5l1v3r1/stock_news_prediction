We signed 19 new pilots, 15 of which were in the second half of the year. We also closed our first major subscription renewal, a 4-year, $2.9 million contract with Itron, Inc.\nMr. Chase added, \"In 2018 we will strive to build on momentum with DataV, and will be working diligently to convert new and existing pilots into production deployments. For example, during the current quarter we entered into a DataV services contract that we believe will lead to a significant multi-year SaaS engagement for DataV, which we expect to sign in late first quarter or early second quarter 2018.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the quarter was $19.5 million, down 27% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and down 1% compared to the third quarter of 2017. Net loss for the quarter was $4.2 million, or $(0.33) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.3 million, or $(0.10) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016 and net loss of $2.5 million, or $(0.20) per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDAS (1) for the quarter was negative $3.7 million, down $2.9 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 and down $1.9 million from the third quarter of 2017. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $24.8 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of approximately $8.4 million from December 31, 2016 and a decrease of $2.0 million from September 30, 2017.\nDetails as follows (unaudited, in thousands except percentages and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nQ4-Q4\nChange (2)\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nQ4-Q3\nChange (2)\nRevenue:\nThird-party software\n$\n17,213\n$\n23,751\n$\n(6,538)\n$\n16,240\n$\n973\nProprietary software\n311\n301\n10\n1,200\n(889)\nProfessional engineering service\n1,945\n2,745\n(800)\n2,213\n(268)\nTotal revenue\n$\n19,469\n$\n26,797\n$\n(7,328)\n$\n19,653\n$\n(184)\nTotal gross profit\n$\n3,616\n$\n3,954\n(338)\n$\n4,380\n$\n(764)\nGross margins:\nThird-party software\n17\n%\n15\n%\n2\n%\n16\n%\n1\n%\nProprietary software\n81\n%\n82\n%\n(1)\n%\n97\n%\n(16)\n%\nProfessional engineering service\n26\n%\n7\n%\n19\n%\n27\n%\n(1)\n%\nTotal gross margin\n19\n%\n15\n%\n4\n%\n22\n%\n(3)\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n7,913\n$\n5,261\n$\n2,652\n$\n6,926\n$\n987\nNet loss\n$\n(4,232)\n$\n(1,261)\n$\n(2,971)\n$\n(2,468)\n$\n(1,764)\nPer diluted share\n$\n(0.33)\n$\n(0.10)\n$\n(0.23)\n$\n(0.20)\n$\n(0.13)\nAdjusted EBITDAS (1)\n$\n(3,739)\n$\n(812)\n$\n(2,927)\n$\n(1,843)\n$\n(1,896)\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n$\n24,754\n$\n33,200\n$\n(8,446)\n$\n26,758\n$\n(2,004)\nNotes:\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDAS = Operating loss before depreciation, amortization and stock compensation expense.

The 2016 period benefitted from customer purchases made in advance of anticipated 2017 price increases by Microsoft. Proprietary software revenue was relatively stable compared to the prior year period. Approximately half of the revenue from proprietary software in the current period was related to DataV, while nearly all of the proprietary software revenue in the prior year period resulted from legacy software sales. Professional engineering service revenue decreased, primarily due to the completion of several legacy customer projects and a shift in our sales generation and staffing priorities towards DataV. Professional engineering service gross margin increased, primarily due to higher utilization of professional engineering personnel in the current period. Operating expenses increased, due to continued investment in DataV sales, marketing and product development.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue was $80.8 million, down 17% compared to the prior year. Net loss was $9.1 million, or $(0.72) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.1 million, or $(0.09) per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDAS (1) was negative $7.0 million, down $7.7 million from the prior year.\nDetails as follows (unaudited, in thousands except percentages and per share amounts):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nChange (2)\nRevenue:\nThird-party software\n$\n65,755\n$\n80,231\n$\n(14,476)\nProprietary software\n4,646\n1,939\n2,707\nProfessional engineering service\n10,410\n15,271\n(4,861)\nTotal revenue\n$\n80,811\n$\n97,441\n$\n(16,630)\nTotal gross profit\n$\n18,122\n$\n15,820\n2,302\nGross margins:\nThird-party software\n16\n%\n15\n%\n1\n%\nProprietary software\n96\n%\n83\n%\n13\n%\nProfessional engineering service\n29\n%\n12\n%\n17\n%\nTotal gross margin\n22\n%\n16\n%\n6\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n27,543\n$\n16,978\n$\n10,565\nNet loss\n$\n(9,058)\n$\n(1,052)\n$\n(8,006)\nPer diluted share\n$\n(0.72)\n$\n(0.09)\n$\n(0.63)\nAdjusted EBITDAS (1)\n$\n(7,030)\n$\n687\n$\n(7,717)\nNotes:\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDAS = Operating loss before depreciation, amortization and stock compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDAS is a non-GAAP measurement (reconciliation provided after financial statement tables).\n(2)\nFor gross margin, amount represents percentage point change.\nAdditional DataV Metrics (Including Non-GAAP Measures) (unaudited)\nWe recorded approximately $3.2 million in DataV bookings in the fourth quarter of 2017, and approximately $4.0 million for the full year. Each amount includes our $2.9 million renewal from Itron. DataV bookings is a non-GAAP measure defined as the contract value of new agreements signed with customers. Cash receipts from DataV contracts totaled $3.2 million during 2017. DataV backlog (a non-GAAP measure defined as total DataV bookings less total DataV revenue recognized to date) was approximately $6.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to approximately $5.7 million at December 31, 2016. Total deferred revenue at December 31, 2017 was $3.3 million, compared to $3.9 million at December 31, 2016. The balance at December 31, 2017 included DataV deferred revenue of approximately $2.8 million. The deferred revenue balance relating to our DataV sales does not represent the total contract value of our DataV agreements. DataV unbilled deferred revenue (a non-GAAP measure defined as future contract billings that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not included in deferred revenue) was an additional $3.7 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $2.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nBookings, backlog and unbilled deferred revenue are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures have been included because management believes they provide meaningful information related to our DataV sales, since revenue from such sales may be recognized in different periods than those in which orders have been received or cash has been collected.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Outlook\nRevenue in the range of $17.5 million to $19.0 million, with some potential upside in revenue from our Itron contract; During the current quarter we entered into a DataV services contract that we believe will lead to a significant multi-year SaaS engagement for DataV, which we expect to sign in late first quarter or early second quarter 2018; We expect to sign additional pilots in the quarter; Blended gross margin will be in the 17% to 19% range, with some potential upside in margin from our Itron contract; and A net loss, reflecting continued investments in R&D, sales and marketing to grow DataV.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call today, February 20, 2018, at 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (2 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.)

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAS is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation expense on fixed assets and amortization expense (including impairment) on intangible assets, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDAS should not be construed as a substitute for net income (loss) or net cash provided (used) by operating activities (all as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position and cash flows, as Adjusted EBITDAS is not defined by GAAP. However, BSQUARE regards Adjusted EBITDAS as a complement to net income and other GAAP financial performance measures, including an indirect measure of operating cash flow.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bsquare-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300601425.html\nSOURCE Bsquare", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bsquare-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300601425.html", "http://www.bsquare.com/"], "published": "2018-02-21T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T23:54:21.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
