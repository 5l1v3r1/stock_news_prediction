Baker 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Chipmaker Microchip Technology is in talks to buy Microsemi Corp, the largest U.S. commercial supplier of military and aerospace semiconductor equipment, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The potential deal will value Microsemi at mid-$60s per share and a deal could be struck as early as this week, the source told Reuters. Microsemi has a market capitalisation of $7.55 billion (5.4 billion pounds), based on the stock’s Monday close. The company was exploring its options, including a possible sale, after it received a takeover approach, Reuters reported last month. The deal, if finalised, comes amid a new wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. Broadcom Ltd on Monday had called a proposal by U.S. semiconductor peer Qualcomm Inc for a new meeting to negotiate an increase to Broadcom’s $117 billion acquisition offer “engagement theatre” aimed at dodging a takeover battle. Arizona-based Microchip purchased fellow chipmaker Atmel in January 2016 for $3.42 billion in cash and stock. Microchip and Microsemi did not respond to request for comments outside regular business hours. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Microchip is nearing a deal to buy Microsemi.
