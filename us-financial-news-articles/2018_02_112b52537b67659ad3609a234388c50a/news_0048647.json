But Taulupe Faletau, who Wales declared ready to play on Monday, is not in the match-23 for the game where the Welsh will be seeking to end the hosts’ perfect start. Biggar has recovered from a shoulder injury and will play for the first time in this year’s tournament as he replaces Rhys Patchell at flyhalf. Williams, who is over a groin injury, has not played for Wales since they beat Georgia in November and comes onto the wing in place of Josh Adams. Halfpenny had been named to play against England but pulled out before kickoff with a foot infection. Gareth Anscombe took his place in the 12-6 defeat at Twickenham and drops to the bench for Saturday’s clash.

Faletau is likely play for his club Bath at the weekend as he looks to improve his fitness after being out of the game for two months because of a knee injury.
