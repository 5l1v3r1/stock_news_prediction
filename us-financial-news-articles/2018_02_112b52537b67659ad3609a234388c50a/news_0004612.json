In November, Westpac’s annual cash profit missed estimates, while full-year net interest margin slipped.\n$1 = 1.2649 Australian dollars Reporting by Paulina Duran in Sydney; additional reporting by Ambar Warrick and Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Jane Wardell and Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T01:54:55.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
