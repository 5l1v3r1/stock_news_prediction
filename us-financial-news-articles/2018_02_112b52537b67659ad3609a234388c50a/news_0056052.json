Adam Schiff , the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, attempted to outline mischaracterizations and omissions from another memo released by committee Republicans earlier this month. Republicans, in their memo, accused the FBI of obtaining a FISA surveillance warrant to spy on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page by using information in a controversial dossier by former British spy Christopher Steele, which was funded by Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign.\nWhile talking about the memo, Trump blasted Schiff, calling him a \"bad guy\" and suggested that the California Democrat might be breaking the law and leaking information to reporters.\nHe then said the memo verifies that the \"other side\" did \"fraudulent\" things and should be investigated.\nThen, Trump called for the country to come together as one.\n\"We have to bring the country together,\" he said, adding that the bickering between parties was \"ripping\" Americans apart.\nPirro asked Trump about gun-control laws and a possible military parade in Washington, D.C.\nTrump repeated his call for arming some teachers, expanding background checks to include those with mental illnesses and increasing the age to purchase assault rifles to 21, a divide from the National Rifle Association.\n\"This should be bipartisan,\" he said on tightening gun laws. \"It's time to get it done and get it done right.\"\nTrump also confirmed reports that a military parade was in the works and could be planned for July 4 or Veterans Day.\n\"We're talking about probably Veterans Day,\" he said, adding that he liked the option of having it on July 4.", "external_links": ["https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/24/democratic-memo-here-key-points-schiffs-document/370388002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/24/read-full-text-democratic-intelligence-memo/370401002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/24/congress-releases-democratic-memo-rebutting-gop-claims-fbi-surveillance-abuse/370381002/"], "published": "2018-02-25T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T16:48:40.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
