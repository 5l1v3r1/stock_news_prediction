Darrius Heyward-Bey The Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver has earned about $35 million throughout the course of his career, but instead of spending it on accumulating lots of stuff, he's managed to save most of it, he told ESPN in 2016.\nHe does that by keeping himself on an allowance he worked out with his mom. \"I grew up knowing what to spend and what not to spend,\" Heyward-Bey said. \"It's easy when you don't have money to not spend. That's how I grew up.\"\nHe even cancels his cable during football season, since he's not home to watch it. \"I keep things real simple,\" he said. \"I'm not really a flashy guy. I understand what I want to buy. I invest my money well and pay my taxes.\"\nTom Szczerbowski | Getty Images Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots Rob Gronkowski As of 2015, the New England Patriots star had saved a full 100 percent of his salary .\n\"To this day, I still haven't touched one dime of my signing bonus or NFL contract money,\" Gronkowski wrote in his book from that year, \" It's Good to be Gronk .\"\nInstead, Gronkowski, who signed a six-year, $54 million contract with the Patriots in 2012 , decided to spend only what he made off his endorsement deals: \"I live off my marketing money and haven't blown it on any big-money expensive cars, expensive jewelry or tattoos and still wear my favorite pair of jeans from high school.\"\nScott W.
