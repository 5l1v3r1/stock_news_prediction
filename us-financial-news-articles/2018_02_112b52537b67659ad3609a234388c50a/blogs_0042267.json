Prices rallied to a high of $62.74 a barrel early in the session, the highest since Feb. 7.\nThe most active U.S. crude futures contract for delivery in April was up 17 cents at $61.72 a barrel.\nA strengthening dollar , which hit a six-day high, however, weighed on oil prices. A more robust dollar makes oil and other dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.\nBrent crude futures were down 45 cents from Monday's close at $65.22 a barrel by 2:25 p.m. ET.\nThe divergence in prices kept U.S. crude's discount to Brent near a six-month low after widening to more than $7 in December.\nMonday's U.S. holiday for Presidents Day also supported WTI's performance compared with Brent, as the U.S. markets caught up with Brent's gains on Monday, said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, Germany.\nA narrower premium of Brent to WTI means it is less attractive for consumers in northwest Europe to import U.S. crude, especially with refiners conducting maintenance.
