(NYSE: SPH), a nationwide distributor of propane, fuel oil and related products and services, as well as a marketer of natural gas and electricity, today announced earnings for its first quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nNet income for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $37.2 million, or $0.61 per Common Unit, compared to net income of $34.5 million, or $0.57 per Common Unit, in the prior year first quarter.\nNet income and EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 included a $4.8 million loss from the sale of certain assets and operations in a non-strategic market of the propane segment. Excluding the effect of the foregoing item and unrealized (non-cash) mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments in both years, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) increased $8.9 million, or 10.6%, to $93.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $84.3 million in the prior year first quarter.\nIn announcing these results, President and Chief Executive Officer Michael A. Stivala said, \"After back-to-back record warm winters, the fiscal 2018 heating season started off with closer to seasonally normal temperatures throughout the majority of our service territories which contributed to strong customer demand. Our operating platform, and the more than 3,200 employees of Suburban Propane, were well prepared to respond -- keeping focused on the safety and comfort of our customers, ensuring adequate supplies of product to meet the demand and effectively managing margins and expenses. As a result, we are very pleased to report an improvement of approximately $9 million, or 11%, in Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year first quarter.\"\nMr. Stivala continued, \"The favorable weather pattern, particularly toward the end of the first quarter, and the positive momentum in customer demand trends have carried over into the early part of the fiscal 2018 second quarter. As we have stated in the past, our flexible business model is designed to help insulate the business from unseasonably warm weather, as well as to ramp up our activity levels in relation to an increase in weather-driven demand. Our people stand ready to deliver the highest quality service to our customers and the communities we serve, and I am extremely proud of their hard work and dedication to meet the challenges presented by a return to a more favorable weather pattern in several parts of our service territory.\"\nRetail propane gallons sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of 125.0 million gallons increased 5.4% compared to the prior year first quarter. Sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels of 9.1 million gallons in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 1.2% compared to the prior year first quarter. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, average temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) across all of the Partnership's service territories for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were 8% warmer than normal, yet 6% cooler than the prior year first quarter.\nRevenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $373.3 million increased $56.0 million, or 17.6%, compared to the prior year first quarter, primarily due to higher volumes sold and higher average retail selling prices associated with higher average wholesale product costs. Average posted propane prices (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were 63.7% higher than the prior year first quarter. Cost of products sold for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $165.2 million increased $47.0 million, or 39.8%, compared to $118.2 million in the prior year first quarter, primarily due to higher volumes sold and higher wholesale product costs. Cost of products sold for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 included a $1.5 million unrealized (non-cash) loss attributable to the mark-to-market adjustment for derivative instruments used in risk management activities, compared to a $0.5 million unrealized (non-cash) gain in the prior year first quarter. Excluding these unrealized gains and losses, propane unit margins for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were flat compared to the prior year first quarter.\nCombined operating and general and administrative expenses of $116.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $2.0 million, or 1.7%, compared to the prior year first quarter, primarily due to higher variable operating costs attributable to an increase in operational activities, higher variable compensation expense associated with higher earnings and an increase in general insurance expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $31.1 million was essentially flat compared to the prior year first quarter. Net interest expense of $19.5 million increased marginally compared to the prior year first quarter. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Partnership funded a portion of its cash needs with $47.3 million of incremental borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nAs previously announced on January 25, 2018, the Partnership's Board of Supervisors had declared a quarterly distribution of $0.60 per Common Unit for the three months ended December 30, 2017. On an annualized basis, this distribution rate equates to $2.40 per Common Unit. The distribution is payable on February 13, 2018 to Common Unitholders of record as of February 6, 2018.\nSuburban Propane Partners, L.P. is a publicly-traded master limited partnership listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
