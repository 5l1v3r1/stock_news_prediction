Triton has asked UBS ( UBSG.S ) to organize an auction, which is expected to launch later this year, they said. Aventics makes pneumatic components for industrial, automotive and marine applications. It counts Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ), Caterpillar ( CAT.N ) and Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) among its customers. It is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around 60 million euros this year. The company, which was bought by Triton for around 200 million euros in 2013 is expected to be shopped to peers such as Festo, Emerson ( EMR.N ), IMI ( IMI.L ) and Parker ( 9845.T ). When Aventics was sold to Triton, private equity firms such as Advent and Capvis had also showed interest. Triton and UBS declined to comment.
