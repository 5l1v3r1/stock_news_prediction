The benchmark pared some of those losses in recent weeks.\nTraders blamed the sell-off on increasing worries about rising inflation and the prospect for a faster pace of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to bond prices, had climbed to four-year high of 2.95 percent earlier in the month after the strong January jobs report.\nDespite the move, Goldman Sachs isn't too concerned over the recent move bond yields.\n\"Treasury yields have risen quickly over the last two quarters, with the 10-year yield up 70bp in 5 months,\" Struyven wrote. \"We expect the recent rise in rates to be well absorbed for two reasons. First, our analysis shows that the increase in rates over the last two quarters mostly reflects positive growth news. Second, the overall growth impulse from financial conditions remains positive, as equity prices have surged and the dollar has weakened over the last year.\"\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T18:17:56.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
