However, they were unwilling to be drawn on guidance for UMG or the prospects for margin expansion, citing low predictability,” Jefferies analysts wrote in a note, keeping a “hold” rating on Vivendi shares.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-GuptaEditing by Bate Felix\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T16:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T12:15:10.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
