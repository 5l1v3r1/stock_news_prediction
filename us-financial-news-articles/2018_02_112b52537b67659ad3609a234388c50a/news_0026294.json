REUTERS/Jorge Silva Ian Chesterman, the Australian chef de mission, expressed his concern.\n“I don’t think anyone can say for sure (high winds) caused this accident but I think it certainly needs to be reviewed,” he said on Monday.\nSAFETY ‘UTMOST IMPORTANCE’\nSung Baik-you, spokesman for the local organizing committee POCOG, said the safety of the athletes was of the “utmost importance” in any discussions about re-scheduling.\nAlpine skiing race directors have had contingency plans in place for several days after receiving the forecasts of the high winds and on Monday appeared resigned to two more days of battling the elements.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “We don’t see great changes for tomorrow or Wednesday,” men’s chief race director Markus Waldner said at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre.\n“We all know with big wind gusts it’s not possible to put on speed races.”\nThe women’s giant slalom, which will take place at Yongpyong, was moved to Thursday with an earlier start time to allow a window for the men’s downhill, which was postponed on Sunday.\nRunning races on separate mountains on the same day is hardly ideal, however, especially when one, the men’s downhill, is the marquee event of Alpine skiing at the Games.\nThe men’s Super G has been switched to Friday, previously a rest day, to make room for the downhill.\nDisruption to Alpine skiing competitions is not unusual, however, and it is a rare Games where some re-jigging of the schedule is not necessary.\nThe Alpine skiing at the 1998 Games in Nagano was heavily disrupted by heavy snow and rain and the men’s downhill was rescheduled three times.\nThe schedule for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics was similarly impacted by poor course conditions and bad weather at Whistler with the men’s downhill postponed by two days.\n“It is a little bit early to discuss (scrapping competitions),” International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesman Mark Adams said.\n“Nagano held the downhill five minutes before the closing ceremony. We have reserved space so this is a touch premature.”\nAdditional reporting by Jack Tarrant, Karolos Grohmann and Phil O'Connor, editing by Greg Stutchbury and Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T08:52:45.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
