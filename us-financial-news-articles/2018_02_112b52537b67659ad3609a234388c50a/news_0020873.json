No doubt,” Pochettino said after the game. \n”Always it’s important to feel the net for offensive players and for him to play 90 minutes. It’s an important feeling for him. It’s important because he’s an important player. Soccer Football - FA Cup Fourth Round Replay - Tottenham Hotspur vs Newport County - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - February 7, 2018 Tottenham's Erik Lamela celebrates scoring their second goal REUTERS/Eddie Keogh \nLamela underwent hip surgery last April before returning to the team in November. He has made 13 league appearances this season and two more in the FA Cup. \nThe 25-year-old played the full 90 minutes against Newport, only the second time he has done so this season. \n“Of course it was a massive problem, more than one year out. It’s never easy to come back and perform as he was before. But he loves football, and he loves to train. I think his mentality is fantastic.” \nTottenham are fifth in the Premier League with 49 points from 26 matches and take on sixth-placed north London rivals Arsenal on Saturday.
