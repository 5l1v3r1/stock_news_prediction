The Company reported net income of $117.7 million, or $4.82 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $9.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes a net income benefit of $102.5 million, or $4.20 per diluted share, associated with the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act discussed below.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS:\nIncome from operations increased 18% year-over-year to $26.8 million. Rental revenues increased 10% year-over-year to $77.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 15% to $49.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Dividend rate increased 2% year-over-year to $0.26 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. On an annualized basis, this dividend represents a 2.1% yield on the February 26, 2018 close price of $48.52 per share. United States Tax Reform – On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”), which among other things, reduces the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and requires mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company re-measured its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net benefit of $102.8 million. In addition, a one-time transition income tax estimated at $0.3 million related to repatriation of foreign earnings was recorded. The Company’s 2018 effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 27%.\nThe Company also announced that the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, an increase of $0.08, or 31%, over the prior year period. On an annualized basis, the 2018 dividend represents a 2.8% yield, based on the February 26, 2018 closing stock price. The cash dividend will be payable on April 30, 2018 to all shareholders of record on April 16, 2018. This marks the 26th consecutive year the Company has increased its annual dividend.\nJoe Hanna, President and CEO of McGrath RentCorp, made the following comments regarding these results and future expectations:\n“We were pleased with our fourth quarter performance. The Company’s 18% operating profit increase was driven by a $2.6 million increase in gross profit from rental operations, and an additional $2.6 million increase in sales gross profit.\nMobile Modular rental revenues for the quarter increased 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by 7% improvement in average rental rates. Rental revenue growth continued to be healthy across commercial and education markets, as well as in our Portable Storage business. Modular sales revenues increased significantly year over year, primarily due to higher used equipment sales.\nTRS-RenTelco rental revenues for the quarter increased 7%, primarily driven by 5% higher average rental equipment and improved utilization. Test equipment rental revenues for general-purpose and communications increased by 8% and 7%, respectively.\nAdler Tank Rentals rental revenues for the quarter increased 18% from a year ago. Rental revenue growth occurred across a broad mix of vertical markets, including upstream oil and natural gas, which increased from 8% to 10% of total rental revenues. Average equipment on rent increased 18%, and average utilization increased to 60%. Despite ongoing competitive price pressure, average rental rates remained flat.\nFor the full year, the Company’s operating profit grew by 20% compared to a year ago. Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tank Rentals delivered operating profit growth of 14%, 18% and 40%, respectively, compared to a year ago. Our teams executed effectively throughout 2017, and our performance improvement initiatives delivered results, despite some challenging market conditions. The improved Company performance and anticipated earnings and cash flow benefits from tax reform support the 31% dividend increase announced today.\nEntering 2018, I believe that our businesses are well positioned and we will be working hard to build upon our solid 2017 performance.”\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities can be found at the end of this release.\nDIVISION HIGHLIGHTS:\nAll comparisons presented below are for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 to the quarter ended December 31, 2016 unless otherwise indicated.\nMOBILE MODULAR\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s Mobile Modular division reported income from operations of $12.6 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 5%. Rental revenues increased 9% to $37.7 million, depreciation expense decreased $0.1 million to $5.3 million and other direct costs increased $4.8 million to $12.0 million, which resulted in a decrease in gross profit on rental revenues of 7% to $20.4 million. The increased other direct costs in 2017 was partly attributable to a $1.6 million impairment of rental assets, deemed beyond economic repair in the Southern California region. Rental related services revenues were flat at $12.2 million, with associated gross profit increasing 2% to $3.2 million. Sales revenues increased 74% to $7.4 million and gross margin on sales increased to 30% compared to 29% in 2016, resulting in increased gross profit on sales revenues of $1.0 million, or 79%. Selling and administrative expenses increased 1% to $13.4 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses.\nTRS-RENTELCO\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s TRS-RenTelco division reported income from operations of $8.2 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 29%. Rental revenues increased 7% to $22.2 million, depreciation expense increased 3% to $8.6 million and other direct costs decreased 7% to $3.5 million, which resulted in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of 18% to $10.1 million. Sales revenues increased 20% to $5.4 million. Gross margin on sales decreased to 58% from 60% in 2016 primarily due to lower margins on used equipment sales, resulting in an 18% increase in gross profit on sales revenues to $3.2 million. Selling and administrative expenses increased 4% to $5.7 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs.\nADLER TANKS\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s Adler Tanks division reported income from operations of $4.1 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 86%. Rental revenues increased 18% to $17.8 million, depreciation expense was flat at $3.9 million and other direct costs were flat at $3.1 million, which resulted in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of 33% to $10.7 million. Rental related services revenues increased 10% to $6.6 million, with gross profit on rental related services decreasing 16% to $0.9 million. Selling and administrative expenses increased 13% to $7.7 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs.\nFINANCIAL OUTLOOK:\nFor the full-year 2018, the Company expects:\nRental revenues to increase between 3% and 5% over 2017. Sales revenues to be between flat and 10% lower compared to 2017. Rental equipment depreciation expense to be between $70 and $72 million. “Other” direct costs of rental operations, primarily for rental equipment maintenance and repair, to be between $64 and $66 million. Selling and administrative costs to be between $113 and $115 million. Operating profit to increase between 8% and 12% over 2017. Full year interest expense to be approximately $12 million. Effective tax rate to be approximately 27%. Diluted share count to be between 24.4 and 24.6 million shares.\nThese reflect McGrath RentCorp’s expectations as of February 27, 2018. Actual 2018 results may be materially different and affected by many factors, including those factors outlined in the “ ” paragraph at the end of this press release.\nABOUT MCGRATH RENTCORP:\nFounded in 1979, McGrath RentCorp is a diversified business-to-business rental company with four rental divisions.

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures\nTo supplement the Company’s financial data presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA”, which is defined by the Company as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate the Company’s period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA (dollar amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $ 117,724 $ 9,734 $ 153,920 $ 38,251 (Benefit) provision for income taxes (93,775 ) 10,061 (70,468 ) 28,680 Interest 2,898 2,721 11,622 12,207 Depreciation and amortization 19,991 19,651 78,416 81,179 EBITDA 46,838 42,167 173,490 160,317 Impairment of rental assets 1,639 — 1,639 — Share-based compensation 953 764 3,198 3,091 Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 49,430 $ 42,931 $ 178,327 $ 163,408 Adjusted EBITDA margin 2 40 % 41 % 39 % 39 %\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (dollar amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 49,430 $ 42,931 $ 178,327 $ 163,408 Interest paid (3,262 ) (3,394 ) (11,825 ) (12,436 ) Income taxes paid, net of refunds received (5,994 ) (7,804 ) (29,504 ) (15,555 ) Gain on sale of used rental equipment (4,727 ) (2,941 ) (17,733 ) (13,739 ) Foreign currency exchange loss (gain) (61 ) 180 (334 ) 121 Amortization of debt financing cost 12 13 50 51 Change in certain assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable, net 1,541 6,881 (8,995 ) (1,860 ) Income taxes receivable — — — 11,000 Prepaid expenses and other assets 4,385 575 3,124 1,949 Accounts payable and other liabilities 2,893 3,633 7,559 7,220 Deferred income (2,969 ) (4,655 ) 1,720 536 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 41,248 $ 35,419 $ 122,389 $ 140,695 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation.
