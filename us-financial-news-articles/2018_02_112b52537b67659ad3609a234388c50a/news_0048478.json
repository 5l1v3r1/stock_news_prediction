PAUL, Minn., Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Apex Revenue Technologies , the leader in patient financial engagement solutions that leverage insight into how patients pay, today announced the release of a new online payment experience for patients, designed to integrate printed and electronic communication channels with a more personalized online payment experience. New advancements to its award-winning mySecureBill® payment platform focus on greater clarity for patients to manage their entire healthcare account, a seamlessly-branded user experience, and supports a more outcome-based financial communications strategy for providers.\nThe new mySecureBill features a clear, comprehensive and highly-engaging dashboard, from which patients are only a click away from any action to manage their account, and those of their family members.\n\"Patients not only want to interact with their providers online, they expect it. But each patient's needs and preferences vary,\" said Patrick Maurer, president, Apex Revenue Technologies. \"This new mySecureBill payment experience delivers all of the powerful capabilities of a retail payment experience, geared to meet the unique needs of healthcare providers and individual patients.\"\nBenefits of the new mySecureBill platform:\nUnmatched branding capabilities – Apex offers more options to match the user experience to the provider's website, including logos, multi-color branding of text and interface elements, as well as image selection to mirror the provider's brand tone and boost payer confidence. A seamless, personalized experience – The dashboard suggests payment resolution and user experience options based on the goals of the provider, and what we know about the patient - for greater clarity and convenience, and better results. Clear view of performance – The mySecureBill payment portal fully integrates with the company's award-winning Apex Connect™ platform, a behavioral analytics engine that leverages patient data to automatically match financial conversations to each patient's profile. Activity logged in mySecureBill automatically impacts the patient experience in each subsequent interaction. Speed – Pre-populated data is context rich, meaning line-level details are allocated appropriately for accurate payment posting, which reduces the administrative burden on the back office. The new mySecureBill payment platform can be fully integrated into the provider's revenue cycle processes in a matter of weeks.\nOn the average, 50% of payments are made electronically with Apex, with unparalleled patient satisfaction ratings averaging 95%.\n\"We expect this new experience to advance those success measures even further,\" said Maurer. \"Early satisfaction surveys indicate patients view the new payment experience to raise the bar for ease and clarity in how they manage their healthcare financial obligations.\"\nTo learn more about how Apex combines its visionary patient communications and payment platform, visit www.apexrevtech.com or follow Apex Revenue Technologies on LinkedIn .\nAbout Apex Revenue Technologies\nFounded in 1995, Apex Revenue Technologies ( www.apexrevtech.com ) is the leader in healthcare technology solutions that leverage insight into how patients pay to improve financial outcomes for providers and patients.
