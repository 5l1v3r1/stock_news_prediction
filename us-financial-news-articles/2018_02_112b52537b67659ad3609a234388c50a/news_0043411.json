As a result, that could drive dollars away from stocks and push up borrowing costs for companies and investors.\nThat is because years of very low interest rates made risky assets like stocks more appealing to investors. Meanwhile, rising inflation could also eat into profit margins.\nHigher inflation could also potentially halt the U.S. government's plan to stimulate growth in various parts of the economy.\nLast Thursday , U.S. government bond yields rose amid new economic data that provided further evidence of inflation pressure.\nFor this week's Trader Poll, tell us where rising bond yields could do the most damage.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
