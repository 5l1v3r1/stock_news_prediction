CAAC did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. \nEmbraer Commercial Aviation CEO John Slattery said the policy was designed to stimulate economic activity beyond China’s heavily populated eastern seaboard. \n“As we look at the terms of the detail of the policy document, the E175 is an ideal aircraft to be compliant with the policy and address those requirements,” he told Reuters at the Singapore Airshow. The E175 has around 80 seats. \nBombardier Commercial Aircraft sales head Colin Bole said he sees Chinese regional carriers “graduating to the C Series,” eventually but the 100-seat cap could delay the plane’s proliferation in the country. \n“We are definitely going to get to the point where the C Series will have a significant footprint in China,” Bole said. “But because of that polarisation at this stage there will be a delay before that actually happens.” \nBombardier is looking to boost sales of the 90-seater CRJ 900 regional jet and Q400 turboprop which meet the regional policy requirements, Bole said. \n(This version of the story has been corrected to clarify headline, paragraph 1 to show regional airlines are affected, not all airlines) Reporting By Jamie Freed in Singapore and Allison Lampert in Montreal; Additional reporting by Tim Hepher and Brenda Goh in SingaporeEditing by Muralikumar Anantharaman", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T12:45:20.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
