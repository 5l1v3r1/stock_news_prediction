She did not disappoint. \n”In other competitions and performances, if I made a mistake I would be able to make it up next time. But this was the only chance, this was the moment the world was watching. \n“When I was on the ice rink I couldn’t really see the spectators in the stadium. I was only thinking that I could fall, or that I shouldn’t make any mistakes... that was the only thing on my mind.” \nThe Pyeongchang Olympics run until Feb. 25.
