Powell at the Federal Reserve in Washington, U.S., February 22, 2018. REUTERS/Sait Serkan Gurbuz “Expectations that Powell will be sensitive to financial markets appear to be running high. But he hasn’t said he will sacrifice policy normalisation for the sake of financial markets. I feel there is room for disappointment in markets,” said Hiroko Iwaki, senior bond strategist at Mizuho Securities.\nMSCI’s gauge of equity market performance in 47 countries, which gained 0.8 percent on Monday, rose another 0.1 percent on Tuesday, taking it to a new three-week high.\nStill, it is down 2.2 percent so far this month, suggesting its record 15-month winning streak that began in November 2016 is at risk.\n“The combination of low interest, low inflation and strong economic growth, the best combination for markets that also kept market volatilities low, is coming to an end,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities,\nHe said that while corporate earnings will likely remain strong for some time longer, underpinning stocks, market volatility will be higher.\nIn the currency markets, the euro traded at $1.2327, up 0.1 percent in Asia but off its three-year high of $1.2556 hit earlier this month.\nThe dollar traded at 106.85 yen, stabilising for now above its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb 16.\nFed funds rate futures were almost fully pricing in a rate hike at the Fed’s next policy meeting on March 20-21.\nOil prices held firm at three-week highs, supported by supported by signs of stronger demand, robust production curbs led by OPEC and a slight fall in U.S. output.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fetched $63.86, little changed from U.S. close on Monday, after hitting a three-week high of $64.24 the previous day.\nLondon Brent crude traded flat at $67.48 a barrel, after hitting a three-week high of $67.90 the previous day.\nEditing by Kim Coghill and Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T03:48:48.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
