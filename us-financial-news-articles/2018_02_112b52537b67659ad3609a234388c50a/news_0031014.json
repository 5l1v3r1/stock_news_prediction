Odinga boycotted the repeat vote, which Kenyatta won before he was sworn in for a second term.\nKenyatta said he had nominated Paul Kihara Kariuki, the president of the Court of Appeal, as Muigai’s replacement.\nKihara will have to be vetted by parliament before taking up his post.\nReporting by George Obulutsa and Humphrey Malalo; Editing by Duncan Miriri, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T20:30:10.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
