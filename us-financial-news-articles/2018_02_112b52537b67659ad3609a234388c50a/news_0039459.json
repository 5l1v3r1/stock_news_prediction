Her Olympic medal haul is more modest, though, having missed the 2014 Sochi Games with a knee injury.\nShe is due to race the downhill on Wednesday, and the Alpine Combined on Friday.\nEditing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T12:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:12:07.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
