Red Dead Redemption 2, made by Rockstar Games, follows the original Red Dead Redemption, a game that's perhaps best described as Grand Theft Auto set in the wild west. \n\"We apologize to everyone disappointed by this delay. While we had hoped to have the game out sooner, we require a little extra time for polish,\" the developer for the game, Take-Two's Rockstar, wrote in a post Wednesday. \"We sincerely thank you for your patience and hope that when you get to play the game, you will agree the wait will have been worth it.\" \nTake-Two Interactive said it needs \"additional time to further polish the final product,\" and that, despite the delay, it still expects to \"deliver both record Net Bookings and record net cash,\" in fiscal year 2019. \nThe stock was off the lows but still down nearly 3 percent in the late morning.
