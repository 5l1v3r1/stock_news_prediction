The world’s biggest PC chipmaker was a late entrant into the market for mobile chips, but has recently been pushing aggressively into the space. \n“There is speculation that Apple might drop Qualcomm altogether for its next generation phones and I think that’s part of the reason the stock is down today,” said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research. \nQualcomm issued a revenue forecast last week that missed estimates. It said the forecast already included the assumption that Apple could drop its chips for future products. \nApple will save more than $100 million in the next iPhone cycle by moving to cheaper Intel modem chips, Nomura analyst Romit Shah said. \nBroadcom Ltd ( AVGO.O ), which is trying to acquire Qualcomm, will likely lose some $400 million worth of sales of Apple parts in the second half of the year to Qorvo Inc ( QRVO.O ), Shah added. \nThe reports came as Broadcom on Monday sweetened its bid to buy Qualcomm to more than $121 billion from an earlier $103 billion. \nQualcomm was hit with a $1.23 billion fine by European Union antitrust regulators last month for paying Apple to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel. \nIntel began supplying modem chips to Apple from the iPhone 7 onwards. \nReuters reported in October that Apple had designed iPhones and iPads that would drop chips supplied by Qualcomm. reut.rs/2nNkkGC \nAnalysts at KGI Securities said Intel's modem chips were less expensive than Qualcomm chips and also met Apple's standards, according to Apple news website 9to5Mac. bit.ly/2FKdoBB \nSector analysts have said in the past that Intel may not be as well prepared for 5G networking as Qualcomm, and that iPhones with Qualcomm chips have performed better than models running on Intel chips. \nKGI Securities did not rule out a return by Qualcomm to the supply chain, perhaps in the form of concessions in the patent lawsuit settlement. \nApple and Intel declined to comment. Qualcomm did not immediately responded to a request for comment.
