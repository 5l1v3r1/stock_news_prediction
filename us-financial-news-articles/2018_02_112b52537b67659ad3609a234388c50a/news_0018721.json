The same month, the LNA said it had detained Werfalli and was investigating him, but the ICC said it had received subsequent reports that Werfalli was at large and involved in additional killings.\nLast month, the United Nations called for Werfalli to be handed over to the ICC immediately after images surfaced appearing to show him shooting dead 10 people in front of a mosque in Benghazi hit by a twin car bombing the previous day. [nL8N1PJ6WV]\nA video was posted late on social media late on Tuesday showing a man resembling Werfalli sitting on a sofa in military uniform at an undisclosed location, saying he would hand himself over to military police at LNA headquarters in the eastern town of Marj.\nWerfalliâ€™s unit said last year that it rejected the ICC warrant.
