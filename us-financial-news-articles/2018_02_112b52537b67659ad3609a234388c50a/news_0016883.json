That guidance range was provided on October 31, 2017, and most recently affirmed January 4, 2018.\n“We are pleased with our team’s ability to operate and deliver results at the high end of our expectations,” said Christopher A. Holden, President and Chief Executive Officer of Envision. “We remain focused on executing our strategic plan and taking actions to drive sustained operational excellence across our organization. We look forward to providing a more comprehensive update on our progress and outlook for 2018 when we report complete financial results later this month.”\nEnvision’s estimates for the fourth quarter of 2017 are based on management’s unaudited preliminary financial analysis and are subject to finalizing Envision’s year-end accounting and audit procedures. The Company is not providing a reconciliation of its previously issued Adjusted EBITDA guidance range to the comparable GAAP measure for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as the exact amount of individual adjustments for certain reconciling items are not currently determinable, including variability and timing associated with acquisitions, disposals, deconsolidations and impairment charges. These amounts may be significant and may vary significantly from period to period. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\nEarnings Release and Investor Conference Call Dates\nEnvision will release its financial results for the three months and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, and expects to provide 2018 financial guidance, on Tuesday, February 27, 2018, after the securities markets close.\nThe Company will also host an investor conference call on Wednesday, February 28, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. The live broadcast of Envision’s quarterly conference call will be available on-line by going to www.evhc.net and clicking on the link to Investors. The on-line replay will follow shortly after the call and will be available for 30 days.\nExtension of Director Nomination Deadline\nEnvision also announced that its Board of Directors has amended its bylaws to extend the deadline for stockholders to nominate candidates for election to the Board at its 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to March 16, 2018. The original nomination deadline was February 24, 2018. The date and location of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders has yet to be announced.\nOn October 31, 2017, Envision announced that its Board, in consultation with management and financial and legal advisors, had initiated a full review of a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. The Board is fully committed to conducting a comprehensive review, and the review is ongoing. There can be no assurance that this review will result in a transaction or other alternative of any kind, and the Board has not set a timetable for completion of its review. The Company does not intend to provide updates on its review until it deems further disclosure is appropriate or required.\nAbout Envision Healthcare Corporation\nEnvision Healthcare Corporation is a leading provider of physician-led services and post-acute care, and ambulatory surgery services.
