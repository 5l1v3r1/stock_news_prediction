Consider dimming your screen, using low power mode and other tools. We'll even debunk a couple of battery myths. Todor Tsvetkov | Getty | E+ \nIf you're tired of the battery running out on your iPhone after what seems like a short period of time, we have some tips to keep your iPhone running longer. \nThe tips are straight from Apple , too, which means they're optimized specifically for iPhones. We'll even debunk some old rumors (like: is it OK to let my battery drain faster?). \nHere's how to keep your iPhone working longer on a single charge. Update your iPhone Todd Haselton | CNBC Downloading iOS 11.2.5 \nApple recommends keeping your iPhone on the latest software at all times. While it's true some of the company's software releases have actually been bad for battery life, Apple typically works to improve performance in each release. Dim your screen Todd Haselton | CNBC Dim your screen \nYou don't need your screen blasting at full brightness. You can adjust it easily by opening control center (swipe down on the iPhone X or up on any other iPhone) and changing the brightness level. Apple also recommends using the auto-brightness feature, which dims the screen indoors and brightens it outdoors. Use Wi-Fi Todd Haselton | CNBC Use Wi-Fi when you can \nWhen your phone is connected to a cellular network, it's constantly trying to ping cell towers and using up as much power as it can to get you a good data connection. If Wi-Fi is available, you're better off using it since it doesn't require your phone's modems to work as hard. Turn off background activity Todd Haselton | CNBC Turn off background apps \nBackground Activity allows apps to pull in data even when they're not being used. This doesn't mean you need to close apps (Apple has debunked that theory), but it does mean you can force your phone to stop pinging the email server, for example. Here's how: Go to Settings Tap Background App Refresh and toggle it to off. Try low power mode Todd Haselton | CNBC Use low power mode \nIf you really want to get the most out of your battery, use low power mode. Some folks turn this on when their iPhone is about to die, but you can lengthen the life even if you turn it on at 100 percent. \"Low Power Mode reduces display brightness, optimizes device performance, and minimizes system animations,\" Apple explains.
