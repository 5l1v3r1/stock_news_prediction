He worked at the French industry ministry in the 1980s before joining chemical firm Rhone-Poulenc.\nIn 2003, Clamadieu was appointed chief executive of French specialty chemicals group Rhodia, which merged into Solvay in 2011.\nSolvay declined to comment on Clamadieu’s possible appointment as Engie chairman. Insiders say that Clamadieu could well remain Solvay CEO if he is appointed Engie chair.\nEngie, which changed its name from GDF Suez three years ago, was formed in 2008 from a merger between state-owned Gaz de France and water and waste utility Suez as a defensive move to thwart a bid by Italian utility Enel.\nWith just 7.3 gigawatts (GW) of its 118 GW power generation capacity based in France, Engie is one of the world’s most international utilities, but its debt-fuelled expansion has weighed on it share price.\nFrom a high of more than 44 euros in 2008, Engie stock slid to a low of 10.9 euros in early 2017. It then recovered to 15 euros late last year but slid back below 13 euros in the global market rout of the past two weeks.\nIt was trading at 12.71 euros, up 0.6 percent, at 1625 GMT on Monday.\nAccording to ThomsonReuters data, Engie’s price to book ratio, at 0.78, is the third-lowest in the Stoxx European utilities index, just ahead of German utilities E.ON and Uniper.
