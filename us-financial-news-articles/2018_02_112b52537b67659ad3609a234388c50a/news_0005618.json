They said senior military officers visited the area on Friday, took photographs and held a meeting with the villagers. \nThe residents, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisal, were speaking by telephone to a Reuters reporter at the Balukhali refugee camp in Bangladesh. The reporter was put in touch with them by former residents who have fled Rakhine. \nOne resident said his father attended the meeting, where officers asked how many people had been killed in the violence, who burnt their houses and whether there were mass graves there. \n“The villagers were frightened and said they didn’t know how many had died or who had burnt their houses but said, yes, there are mass graves here,” the resident said. \nAnother resident of the village said three senior military officials arrived late in the morning, took pictures of a mass grave beside his house and then called a meeting at the school. \n“The senior officials are gone now but a large group of military men stayed behind and the villagers are scared,” the resident said. \nSuu Kyi’s spokesman referred requests for comment on the villagers’ description of events to the Rakhine state government. A spokesman from the state government was not immediately available. The military said it had no immediate comment. \nThe AP’s Director of Media Relations Lauren Easton said the agency stood by its reporting. \nReporters are not allowed access to the area, in the north of Rakhine state. The army launched a sweeping counteroffensive there in response to Rohingya militant attacks on Aug. 25. \nThe United Nations has condemned the army’s campaign as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar denies that, saying its forces were carrying out legitimate counterinsurgency operations. \nThe military has acknowledged that Buddhist villagers and soldiers killed 10 people it described as captured Muslim terrorists and buried them in a grave in the village of Inn Din in early September. It has said action will be taken against those responsible.
