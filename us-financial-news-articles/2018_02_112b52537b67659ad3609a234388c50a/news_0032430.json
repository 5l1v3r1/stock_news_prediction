He said it was redemption for his crushing disappointment at Sochi.\n“I was so upset with my performance in Sochi and I had to wait so long for this Olympics. There have been so many ups and downs in the process,” said White.\nFor him it has always been about the Olympics but admitted he was not motivated enough for Sochi and needed to regain his love for the sport.\nWhite gave a lot of credit to his team for helping him reach the point where he could claim another gold medal.\n“I have to thank JJ and Toby and all the people around me. They kept it fun, they kept it motivating,” he said.\nHaving already cemented his legacy as the greatest snowboarder in the sport, the competitive fire still burns deep in White and he was already looking to the future - not only to the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing but also the Tokyo Summer Games, where he hopes to compete in skateboarding.\nFor now White will reflect on his status as one of the greatest Olympians of all time and spend time with friends and family, starting with Miller’s 18th birthday party on Wednesday night.
