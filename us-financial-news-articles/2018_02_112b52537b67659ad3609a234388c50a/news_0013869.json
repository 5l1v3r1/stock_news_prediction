London is competing with rival listing centers like New York for what would be the world’s biggest IPO. \n“There was a range of views on both sides of this issue,” FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey told parliament’s Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday. \n“We are talking to all interested parties who responded to see how we can take those views into account and come up with something practical.” \nThe focus is on whether “sensible adjustments” can be made, but no decision has been taken, Bailey said.
