Scotland beat England 25-13 on Saturday to lift the Calcutta Cup for the first time in 10 years but the victory followed media reports that players from both teams were involved in a melee near the tunnel after the pre-match warm-up. Six Nations Rugby gathered material from the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) plus the BBC and match officials and looked at video footage for their probe.
