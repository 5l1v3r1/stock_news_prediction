That reel was included in Facebook's booth at the Conservative Political Action Committee event, where a user posted it on Twitter:\nTweet \nFacebook removed the reel from the booth, and temporarily removed the shooting demo from the reel, soon thereafter. The company said in a statement to CNBC that it regretted not removing the VR shooter game sooner.\n\"There is a standard set of experiences included in the Oculus demos we feature at public events. A few of the action games can include violence. In light of the recent events in Florida and out of respect for the victims and their families, we have removed them from this demo. We regret that we failed to do so in the first place,\" said Hugo Barra, vice president of VR at Facebook. \nThe demo for the game, called \"Bullet Train,\" is being developed by a third-party game-maker, not Oculus, the company said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T01:56:13.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
