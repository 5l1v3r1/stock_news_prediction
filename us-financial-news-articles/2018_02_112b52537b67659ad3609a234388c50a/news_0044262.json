May will argue that this should not make it harder to extradite terrorists or share information.\nBritain’s interior minister last year warned the EU it could “take our information with us” if it left the bloc without a deal on security matters, jeopardising its membership of agencies such as Europol.\nThe government’s policy paper on security said that co-operation should be maintained and intensified, but acknowledged that a new form of agreement was needed because there was no satisfactory precedent for security co-operation between states.\n“I recognise there is no existing security agreement between the EU and a third country that captures the full depth and breadth of our existing relationship,” May will say, adding there is a precedent for comprehensive, strategic relationships between the EU and other countries in other areas.\n“There is no legal or operational reason why such an agreement could not be reached in the area of internal security.” (Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by John Stonestreet)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T13:50:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
