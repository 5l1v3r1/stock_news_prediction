Provinces and territories have in fact been working expeditiously,” she told the Senate.\nReporting by David Ljunggren; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:16:08.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
