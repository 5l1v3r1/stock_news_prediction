There was no immediate comment from Oxfam.\nGovernment funding only accounted for 8 percent of Oxfam’s overall income last year, its annual report shows, but donations from the public may be hit by the bad publicity, analysts said.\n“It’s inevitable at times like this that people start to question the support that they offer,” said Karl Wilding of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), a British group representing at least 13,000 voluntary organizations.\nThe deputy head of Oxfam resigned on Monday over what she said was the charity’s failure to adequately respond to past allegations of sexual misconduct by staff in Haiti and Chad.\nThe Times newspaper reported last week that some staff in Haiti had paid for sex with prostitutes. Oxfam has not commented on that specific allegation but said an internal investigation from 2011 had confirmed that sexual misconduct had occurred.\nAs a result, four people were dismissed, and three others - including the Haiti country director who had previously held the same role in Chad - had resigned, according to Oxfam.\nFor a sex scandal to hit such a huge charity brand, it risks provoking an immediate and severe backlash that could hurt the sector without leading to much needed reforms, aid experts fear.\n“De-funding organizations like Oxfam is not how we stop sexual exploitation and abuse from happening,” said Megan Nobert, founder of Report the Abuse, a Geneva-based campaign group that collects data on sexual abuse against aid workers.\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Kieran Guilbert; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
