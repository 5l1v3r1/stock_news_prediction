We are not eyeing for specific grades, we are looking for viable options. We mainly look at reserves, production costs and logistics.”\nHe said there was “opportunity in the U.S.” as well given that India imports coal from there. Singh, however, did not say if any deal was in the works.\nAdani is also India’s biggest trader of coal, with volumes of 81 million tonnes in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2017, sourced mainly from Indonesia and Africa. India, the world’s second biggest coal importer after China, brought in a total of 190 million tonnes last fiscal year.\nSingh said the company’s market share in coal trading in the country was going to increase after it extended to retail markets, especially brick kilns and sponge irons.\nThe company has also recently started trading coal in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, in addition to its operations in Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam and China, he said.\n“Asian countries are going to add a lot of demand in the coal market, especially South Asian countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan,” Singh said. “On the supply side, there are limitations. Tonnages are increasing, but quality is decreasing. And to compensate for quality, they have to increase tonnages.”\nPakistan imported 11.2 million tonnes of coal last year, up from around 3.4 million tonnes bought in 2013. Its purchases are expected to jump to 40 million tonnes by 2025.\nPopulous and power-starved Bangladesh is also ramping up coal imports to light up new homes in an election year. Adani Group’s Adani Power in November signed a long-term agreement to sell electricity to Bangladesh. (Writing by Krishna N.
