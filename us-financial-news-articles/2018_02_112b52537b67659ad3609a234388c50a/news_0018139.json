It was not immediately clear why he did not start. \nHome favorite Choi Jae-Woo, who was ranked fourth on the World Cup circuit, had a loose second jump and could only score 72.95 points to finish in 20th place. \nFinland’s Jimi Salonen, who tripped after landing the first jump, and Norway’s Vinjar Slatten, who lost his ski, both fell but have another chance to qualify on Monday.
