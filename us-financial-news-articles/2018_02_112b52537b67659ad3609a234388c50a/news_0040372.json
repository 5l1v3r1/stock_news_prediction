The Tchibo holding company, which owns a 51 percent stake in Beiersdorf, declined to comment.\nAndersen, who previously worked for more than two decades at consumer products group Colgate-Palmolive ( CL.N ), was appointed to the Beiersdorf executive board in 2015 and took over from long-serving CFO Ulrich Schmidt in 2016.\nBeiersdorf last month posted a 5.7 percent underlying rise in group sales in 2017, faster than the 4 to 5 percent gain it had forecast, and said it was optimistic for 2018. It announces full 2017 figures on March 1.
