The takeover, the latest in a series in the agribusiness sector in recent years, would create a company with a share of more than a quarter of the world seed and pesticide market. Bayer has already pledged to sell certain seed and herbicide assets for 5.9 billion euros (£5.2 billion) to BASF to address EU regulatory concerns.

Earlier on Wednesday, Bayer said additional antitrust concessions would include the sale of its vegetable seeds business, confirming a Reuters report. The European Commission, which is expected to issue a decision on the deal ahead of its April 5 deadline, declined to comment. Bayer also declined to comment, saying that it continues its constructive dialogue with the EU competition watchdog. The deal has sparked criticism from environmentalists and some farming groups, concerned about its market power and first move advantage in digital farming data.
