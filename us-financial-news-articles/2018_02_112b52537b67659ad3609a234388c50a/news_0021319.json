Menard now has one month to appeal. \nThe decision is a welcome reprieve for San Francisco-based Uber, banned from cities including Vancouver and pushed out of countries from China to Denmark. \nIt is also battling to keep its cars on the streets of London where it is appealing against a decision not to renew its operating license. The company is also challenging a London employment tribunal ruling that its drivers were entitled to the minimum wage and other workers’ rights. \nIn a separate French setback, however, thousands of licensed seven-seater minivan drivers have been barred by a new law from working as ride-hailing chauffeurs unless they pass additional tests. Uber says it has lost a quarter of its Paris drivers as a result, pushing up waiting times and prices.
