If demand stays strong, it still looks like OPEC will be in control in 2019,\" SEB chief commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said.\n\"If global growth does slow down and oil demand starts to slow, then production growth in the U.S. becomes a problem, because OPEC's cake starts to shrink and that will be the line in the sand,\" he said.\nU.S. oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> has risen above 10 million barrels per day (bpd), overtaking top exporter Saudi Arabia and coming within reach of top producer Russia.\nOPEC and partners including Russia have agreed to cut their crude output by 1.8 million bpd for a second year, but U.S. production looks set to continue to grow.\nU.S. energy companies added 26 oil rigs looking for new production last week, boosting the count to 791, the highest since April 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.\n\"The increase over the last month has been driven primarily from private producers,\" U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said in a note. \"Investor fear around greater U.S. oil production/lack of producer discipline has risen.\"\nPVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said these are tough times for oil bulls.\n\"Positives may appear in short supply but, along with OPEC-led production curbs, buyers can take solace from a healthy global oil demand backdrop. Much of this is owing to Chinas ravenous thirst for oil, which saw it surpass the U.S. to become the worlds largest crude importer in 2017,\" he said.\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE; Editing by Dale Hudson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T16:08:31.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
