The MSCI World Utilities Index has fallen 10% since the end of November, compared with a 3% gain for the MSCI World Index.\n“If rates have risen because of more growth, then the market has acted correctly,” Robert Naess, who manages about $42 billion in stocks at Nordea, said in an interview in Oslo. “If they have risen because they were just too low, then the sector rotation should be the opposite.

This time they haven’t–it’s unusual.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T18:40:11.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
