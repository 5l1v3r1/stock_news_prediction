We could get a bigger dollar rally against EM,” Horchani said, referring to emerging market currencies.\nTraders also watching this week’s large U.S. government debt auctions for clues to international investors’ appetite for U.S. assets.\nSome of the U.S. government’s short-term borrowing costs rose to their highest level in more than nine years on Tuesday as it raised $179 billion in the Treasury securities market to fund spending and make debt payments.\nTuesday’s auctions made up more than half of the $258 billion in Treasury debt supply scheduled for sale this week, which include a $35 billion five-year note sale on Wednesday and $29 billion seven-year note auction on Thursday.
