That deal triggered Waymo's allegations that Uber had stolen its trade secrets to help build its self-driving cars.\n9:40 a.m.\nFormer Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is back in a San Francisco courtroom to answer questions about discussions he had with an engineer who is accused of stealing Google's self-driving car technology.\nWednesday is Kalanick's second day of testimony in a trial centered on allegations that he conspired with former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski to rip off Google's self-driving car project, while Uber was attempting build its own robotic vehicles.\nGoogle's project is now called Waymo.\nA Waymo lawyer confronted Kalanick with several texts between the two in an attempt to prove they would go to extremes for a competitive edge.\nIn one text, Kalanick agreed with Levandowski's comment that \"second place is first loser.\" Another text referenced a line from the movie \"Wall Street\" proclaiming that, \"Greed is good.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:26:38.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
