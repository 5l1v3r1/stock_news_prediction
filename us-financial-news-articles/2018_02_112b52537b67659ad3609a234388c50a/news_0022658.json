Coincheck did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCoincheck froze withdrawals of yen and digital currencies following the theft. The hack highlighted the risks in trading an asset that policymakers are struggling to regulate and drew focus on Japan’s framework on overseeing these exchanges.\nThe FSA will this week launch on-site checks of several other Japanese cryptocurrency exchange operators potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and may widen its inspections, a source said on Thursday.
