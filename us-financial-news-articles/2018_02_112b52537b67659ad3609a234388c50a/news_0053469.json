Andrew Cuomo said during a joint conference call between the governors. “Change comes when people demand change.”\nNew York and Connecticut strengthened gun-control measures after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 26, and New Jersey and Rhode Island also have strict firearm laws. But the states’ four governors said they can better protect the region as a whole by sharing information and more closely cooperating between law enforcement agencies.\n“We can’t wait for the federal government to act,” Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said. “The states that have done something and want to do more are coming together.”\nRelated Video In an emotional meeting at the White House on Wednesday, students, parents, and administrators affected by school shootings offered pleas for change to President Trump.

President Donald Trump has proposed allowing teachers to have guns on campus, raising the legal age to 21 for ownership of certain guns and banning “bump stock” firearm accessories.\nJeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University who studies gun policies, said even background checks that include mental health information wouldn’t prevent all mass shootings because many people who are prone to violence don’t fall into the categories that would merit inclusion on these registries.\n“I do believe that we certainly need better enforcement of anti-trafficking laws, and anything these states can do to work together on that is good,” Mr. Swanson said.\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who has moved to strengthen gun control measures blocked by his Republican predecessor, said the cross-state coalition is an important effort in the face of “complete and utter inaction in Congress.”\nRelated Coverage Parkland Students Protest in Tallahassee, Raising Political Pressure for Tougher Gun Laws Trump, at White House Forum, Signals Support for Arming School Staff Florida, A Big Death-Penalty State, Weighs What to Do About School Shooting Trump Takes Step to Ban ‘Bump Stocks’ FBI Probes Tip-Line Operations After Missed Florida-Shooting Warning Gun Rights Expand Amid Shootings Write to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T00:39:22.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
