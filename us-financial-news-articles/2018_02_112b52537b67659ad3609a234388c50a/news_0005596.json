(Nasdaq: AEMD), a therapeutic technology company focused on unmet needs in global health and biodefense, today announced results for its fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent Corporate Developments\nSubsequent to the previously reported quarter, the Company:\nSubstantially improved its balance sheet as the result of a $6 million equity placement, warrant exercises and use of its at-the-market financing facility;\nExpanded its intellectual property portfolio through patent issuances across the fields of infectious disease and exosome biology;\nAppointed Sabrina Martucci Johnson and Dr. Charles Fisher to its Board of Directors. Both have relevant experience in transitioning first-in-class therapeutic candidates to market. Dr. Fisher was also appointed non-executive Chairman of the Board.\nSubmitted a pre-submission meeting request to the FDA to define the requirements to advance Hemopurifier® therapy toward market under the label indication allowed under an Expedited Access Pathway (EAP) award. Subsequently, the Hemopurifier® was transitioned by the FDA to a \"Breakthrough Device\" designation, which was established under the 21st Century Cures Act recently signed into law. Under this designation, the FDA allowed the following \"indication for use\": \"The Hemopurifier® is a single-use device indicated for the treatment of life-threatening highly glycosylated viruses that are not addressed with an approved treatment.\"\nObtained access to the H3N2 influenza virus to validate in vitro, the ability of the Hemopurifier® to capture the H3N2 virus. The Company previously collaborated with Battelle Memorial Research Institute to confirm capture of the H5N1 bird flu virus, the H1N1 swine flu virus and the reconstructed Spanish Flu of 1918 which caused 50-100 million deaths a century ago.\nDemonstrated the in vitro affinity of the Hemopurifier® to capture tumor-specific exosomes underlying metastatic melanoma as part of a Phase 1 contract award from the National Cancer Institute. The research team then demonstrated the ability to release captured exosomes for analysis and quantification purposes. Tumor-derived exosomes, which seed the spread of metastasis and contribute to immune suppression in cancer patients, represent another life-threatening glycosylated disease target that is not addressed with an approved therapy. Tumor-derived exosomes have also been reported to cause the functional arrest of T cells, which could inhibit emerging immuno-oncology drugs and CAR-T therapies.\nAdvanced the endeavors of its Exosome Sciences (ESI) biomarker subsidiary through the collaboration with Dr. Tsuneya Ikezu at Boston University (BU) that is actively conducting a proteomic analysis of exosomal protein cargos found in former NFL players as compared to non-contact sport control subjects. A goal of the collaboration is to also confirm whether the TauSome biomarker previously measured in the BU DETECT study is brain derived. ESI also agreed to provide TauSome quantification to support the BU DIAGNOSE CTE study, which is actively enrolling subjects. ESI further disclosed that a protocol modification has been submitted to the Institutional Review Board at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGEN) to modify the study enrollment questionnaire to be more consistent with the questionnaire that is being utilized in the BU DIAGNOSE study. In addition to quantifying the presence of the TauSome biomarker in blood plasma, the ESI/TGEN study will explore for the presence of the biomarker in urine and saliva. As compared to the previous DETECT study, the ESI/TGEN study will also seek enroll younger NFL subjects, including those that may be on current NFL rosters.\nThird Quarter Financial Results\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had a cash balance of approximately $5.6 million. The Company also raised approximately $1.4 million over the month of January 2018 through a combination of cash from warrant exercises and sales under the Company's At-The-Market financing agreement.\nDuring the December 2017 quarter, the Company recorded $74,813 in revenues under its contract with the National Cancer Institute. The Company did not have any government contract revenue in the December 2016 quarter.\nConsolidated operating expenses for both the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $1.24 million as increases in payroll and related expenses of approximately $28,000 and in professional fees of approximately $22,000 were largely offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately $47,000.\nThe $28,000 increase in payroll and related expenses was due to a $17,000 increase in stock-based compensation and to an $11,000 increase in cash-based payroll and related expenses due to bonuses given to the Company's support and scientific staff.\nThe $22,000 increase in the Company's professional fees was due to increases various professional fees, including accounting and legal fees, which were partially offset decreases in scientific consulting expenses and business development expenses.\nThe $47,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases in clinical trial expenses and in the cost of lab supplies.\nThe Company had other expense of approximately $56,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to other income of approximately $22,000 in the prior year period.\nThe net loss was approximately $1,215,000, or $(0.08) per share for the December 2017 quarter compared to a net loss of approximately $1,206,000, or $(0.15) for the December 2016 quarter.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet for December 31, 2017 and the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 follow at the end of this release.\nConference Call\nAethlon will hold a conference call for investors today, Thursday, February 1, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. PT (4:30 p.m. ET).
