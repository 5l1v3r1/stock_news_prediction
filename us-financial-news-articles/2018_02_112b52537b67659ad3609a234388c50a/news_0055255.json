The day after the company reported a fourth quarter net profit, Daniel Servitje, Bimboâ€™s chief executive, said in a call with analysts that the company would invest slightly more than the $750 million it had previously projected. The money would largely be spent on quickening the pace of integration for its recent acquisitions.
