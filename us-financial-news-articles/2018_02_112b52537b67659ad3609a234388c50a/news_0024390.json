Net income was $4.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities was $39.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $33.0 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $9.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $42.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $40.8 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $36.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Distributable Cash Flow was $33.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $30.8 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $28.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“As it regards our fourth quarter performance, USA Compression ended the year with continued growth, with contract compression service revenues up more than 5% over the third quarter and average revenue generating horsepower increasing over 50,000 horsepower compared to the third quarter,” said Eric D. Long, USA Compression’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Over the course of 2017, we continued to deploy units and now have approximately 240,000 more revenue-generating horsepower out in the field than we did a year ago. Our primary focus on infrastructure applications and our team’s efforts at redeploying idle equipment has resulted in increased fleet utilization – approaching 95% by the end of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow were also both up quarter-over-quarter.”\n“For 2018, we have made commitments to take delivery of approximately 150,000 horsepower throughout the year, the majority of which consist of very large horsepower units already committed to customers or under contract with customers,” he said. “The improving performance resulted in leverage of 4.65x and improved total coverage for the quarter at 0.99x.”\n“In January, we announced a series of transactions which will result, among other things, in USA Compression acquiring the CDM Resource Management business from Energy Transfer Partners and Energy Transfer Equity acquiring USA Compression’s general partner. We expect these transactions to be accretive to USA Compression’s Distributable Cash Flow and continue to expect these transactions to close in the first half of 2018. We will provide additional information as we are able to,” he concluded.\nAverage revenue generating horsepower was 1,602,365 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 1,548,656 for the third quarter of 2017 and 1,366,371 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Average revenue per revenue generating horsepower per month was $15.21 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $15.13 for the third quarter of 2017 and $15.07 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRevenues were $75.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $72.8 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $74.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross operating margin was $50.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $49.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $45.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross operating margin as a percentage of total revenues was 66.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 67.8% for the third quarter of 2017 and 60.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income was $11.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with $11.5 million for the third quarter of 2017 and compared to $8.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nExpansion capital expenditures were $50.6 million, maintenance capital expenditures were $2.2 million and cash interest expense, net was $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Partnership announced a cash distribution of $0.525 per unit on its common units. This fourth quarter distribution corresponds to an annualized distribution rate of $2.10 per unit. The distribution will be paid on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February 2, 2018. USA Compression Holdings, LLC, the owner of approximately 40% of the Partnership’s outstanding limited partner interests, elected not to reinvest any part of this distribution with respect to its units pursuant to the Partnership’s Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the “DRIP”). For the fourth quarter of 2017, the Partnership’s Distributable Cash Flow Coverage Ratio was 0.99x and Cash Coverage Ratio was 1.00x.\nOperational and Financial Data\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operational Data\nFleet Horsepower (at period end) 1,799,781 1,757,720 1,720,547 1,799,781 1,720,547 Revenue Generating Horsepower (at period end) 1,624,377 1,557,825 1,387,073 1,624,377 1,387,073 Average Revenue Generating Horsepower 1,602,365 1,548,656 1,366,371 1,505,657 1,377,966 Revenue Generating Compression Units (at period end) 2,830 2,793 2,552 2,830 2,552 Horsepower Utilization (at period end) (1) 94.8 % 94.2 % 87.1 % 94.8 % 87.1 % Average Horsepower Utilization (for the period) (1) 94.7 % 94.1 % 87.4 % 92.0 % 87.4 % Financial Data ($ in thousands, except per horsepower data)\nRevenue $ 75,385 $ 72,791 $ 74,913 $ 280,222 $ 265,921 Average Revenue Per Revenue Generating Horsepower Per Month (2) $ 15.21 $ 15.13 $ 15.07 $ 15.07 $ 15.41 Net income $ 4,546 $ 4,789 $ 3,269 $ 11,440 $ 12,935 Operating income $ 11,527 $ 11,508 $ 8,894 $ 37,080 $ 34,408 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 39,343 $ 33,029 $ 9,101 $ 124,644 $ 103,697 Gross Operating Margin (3) $ 50,340 $ 49,350 $ 45,120 $ 187,631 $ 177,760 Gross Operating Margin Percentage 66.8% 67.8% 60.2% 67.0% 66.8% Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 42,111 $ 40,849 $ 36,461 $ 155,703 $ 146,648 Adjusted EBITDA Percentage 55.9% 56.1% 48.7% 55.6% 55.1% Distributable Cash Flow (3) $ 33,223 $ 30,811 $ 28,703 $ 118,330 $ 118,329\n(1) Horsepower utilization is calculated as (i) the sum of (a) revenue generating horsepower; (b) horsepower in the Partnership’s fleet that is under contract but is not yet generating revenue; and (c) horsepower not yet in the Partnership’s fleet that is under contract, not yet generating revenue and is subject to a purchase order, divided by (ii) total available horsepower less idle horsepower that is under repair.

For the definition of each measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Liquidity and Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership was in compliance with all covenants under its $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility, which matures in 2020, was $782.9 million.\nFull-Year 2018 Outlook\nUSA Compression is providing its full-year 2018 guidance as follows:\nNet income range of $30.0 million to $40.0 million; A forward-looking estimate of net cash provided by operating activities is not provided because the items necessary to estimate net cash provided by operating activities, in particular the change in operating assets and liabilities, are not accessible or estimable at this time. The Partnership does not anticipate the changes in operating assets and liabilities to be material, but changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue could be significant, such that the amount of net cash provided by operating activities would vary substantially from the amount of projected Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow; Adjusted EBITDA range of $180.0 million to $190.0 million; and Distributable Cash Flow range of $130.0 million to $140.0 million. Please note this 2018 guidance does not include any effects from the USA Compression announcement made on January 16, 2018 to acquire the CDM Resource Management business from Energy Transfer Partners and Energy Transfer Equity acquiring USA Compression’s general partner. The series of transactions, as discussed in the announcement, are expected to close during the first half of 2018, subject to closing conditions.\nConference Call\nThe Partnership will host a conference call today beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central Time) to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2017 performance.

The Partnership focuses on providing compression services to infrastructure applications primarily in high-volume gathering systems, processing facilities and transportation applications. More information is available at usacompression.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, gross operating margin, Distributable Cash Flow, Distributable Cash Flow Coverage Ratio and Cash Coverage Ratio.\nManagement views Adjusted EBITDA as one of its primary management tools, and the Partnership tracks this item on a monthly basis both as an absolute amount and as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior month, year-to-date, prior year and budget. The Partnership defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and income tax expense. The Partnership defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus impairment of compression equipment, impairment of goodwill, interest income on capital lease, unit-based compensation expense, severance charges, certain transaction fees, loss (gain) on disposition of assets and other. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of its financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\nthe financial performance of the Partnership’s assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of the Partnership’s assets; the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; the ability of the Partnership’s assets to generate cash sufficient to make debt payments and to make distributions; and the Partnership’s operating performance as compared to those of other companies in its industry without regard to the impact of financing methods and capital structure.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because, when viewed with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) results and the accompanying reconciliations, it provides a more complete understanding of the Partnership’s performance than GAAP results alone. Management also believes that external users of its financial statements benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating the results of the Partnership’s business.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance and liquidity. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nGross operating margin is defined as revenue less cost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. Management believes that gross operating margin is useful as a supplemental measure of the Partnership’s operating profitability. Gross operating margin is impacted primarily by the pricing trends for service operations and cost of operations, including labor rates for service technicians, volume and per unit costs for lubricant oils, quantity and pricing of routine preventative maintenance on compression units and property tax rates on compression units. Gross operating margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income (loss), its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, gross operating margin as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Because the Partnership capitalizes assets, depreciation and amortization of equipment is a necessary element of its costs. To compensate for the limitations of gross operating margin as a measure of the Partnership’s performance, management believes that it is important to consider operating income (loss) determined under GAAP, as well as gross operating margin, to evaluate the Partnership’s operating profitability. A reconciliation of gross operating margin to operating income is provided in this news release.\nDistributable Cash Flow is defined as net income (loss) plus non-cash interest expense, non-cash income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, unit-based compensation expense, impairment of compression equipment, impairment of goodwill, certain transaction fees, severance charges, loss (gain) on disposition of assets, proceeds from insurance recovery and other, less maintenance capital expenditures.\nDistributable Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance and liquidity. Moreover, our Distributable Cash Flow as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement believes Distributable Cash Flow is an important measure of operating performance because such measure allows management, investors and others to compare basic cash flows the Partnership generates (prior to any retained cash reserves established by the Partnership’s general partner and the effect of the DRIP) to the cash distributions the Partnership expects to pay its unitholders.\nDistributable Cash Flow Coverage Ratio, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Distributable Cash Flow less cash distributions to be paid to the Partnership’s general partner and incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”) in respect of such period, divided by distributions declared to limited partner unitholders in respect of such period. Cash Coverage Ratio is defined as Distributable Cash Flow less cash distributions to be paid to the Partnership’s general partner and IDRs in respect of such period, divided by cash distributions expected to be paid to limited partner unitholders in respect of such period, after taking into account the non-cash impact of the DRIP. Management believes Distributable Cash Flow Coverage Ratio and Cash Coverage Ratio are important measures of operating performance because they allow management, investors and others to gauge the Partnership’s ability to pay cash distributions to limited partner unitholders using the cash flows the Partnership generates. The Partnership’s Distributable Cash Flow Coverage Ratio and Cash Coverage Ratio as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThis news release also contains a forward-looking estimate of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow projected to be generated by the Partnership in its 2018 fiscal year. A forward-looking estimate of net cash provided by operating activities and reconciliations of the forward-looking estimates of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities are not provided because the items necessary to estimate net cash provided by operating activities, in particular the change in operating assets and liabilities, are not accessible or estimable at this time. The Partnership does not anticipate the changes in operating assets and liabilities to be material, but changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue could be significant, such that the amount of net cash provided by operating activities would vary substantially from the amount of projected Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow.\nSee “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for Adjusted EBITDA reconciled to net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, and net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities reconciled to Distributable Cash Flow, Distributable Cash Flow Coverage Ratio and Cash Coverage Ratio.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the information in this news release may contain forward-looking statements.
