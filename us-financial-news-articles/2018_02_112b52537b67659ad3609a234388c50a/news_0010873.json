Israel disputes this. \nThe decision was approved unanimously by Israel’s cabinet.

REUTERS/Nir Elias/File Photo \nPalestinian officials condemned the move and said it seemed to be the result of a change in U.S. policy toward Israel. \nPresident Donald Trump in December recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, breaking with decades of U.S. policy that the city’s status must be decided in peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

All settlements in the West Bank, including in Jerusalem, are illegal,” said Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s executive committee. \nOn Jan. 9, Havat Gilad resident Rabbi Raziel Shevah was shot dead from a passing vehicle as he drove near his home.
