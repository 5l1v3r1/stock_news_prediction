There are some more pre-commercial trials, the focus is about when will 5G arrive and what will it deliver in the next couple years,\" Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS, told CNBC by phone earlier this week.\nAlready, companies such as Samsung, Nokia, Huawei and some mobile networks have carried out 5G trials.\n5G is already being used at the Winter Olympics and AT&T recently announced plans to roll out 5G to some of its customers this year .\nArtificial intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) was one of 2017's biggest technology buzzwords and it continues to be talked about by companies this year.\nTelecom firms will be discussing how AI is being used to enhance their networks, while mobile players will be talking about how the technology is being used in their devices. For example, last year Huawei launched the Mate 10 Pro, a smartphone with its own Kirin 970 AI chip .\nBut analysts warned that many companies will be marketing their products as AI, without actually using any of the technology. For example, a company might claim that a feature is powered by AI when in reality its software is based on a rigid computer algorithm.\n\"We believe that AI is going to be a fundamental element of all devices and services in the future, the way in which it is being marketed right now feels reckless,\" Wood said.\n\"From the perspective of consumers, they are not going to buy AI. They are going to buy products which use AI and deliver a fantastic experience.\"\nVirtual and augmented reality Worldwide spend on augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) is expected to hit $17.8 billion in 2018, a 95 percent rise from last year, according to research firm IDC, and the technology is expected to make a big appearance at MWC.\nAlbert Llop | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images Visitors examine the new Samsung's VR (Virtual Reality) devices during the Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona, Spain on February 27, 2017. Last year, Apple and Google released developer kits aimed at AR applications. This could lead to more uses being shown off at the show.\n\"We expect the buzz around augmented reality to intensify on several fronts: apps, mobile games, digital marketing, m-commerce (mobile commerce), and social media,\" research firm Ovum said in a note this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T12:07:09.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
