In July, Acacia was served with a $190 billion bill for unpaid taxes, penalties and interest. \nAcacia expects its 2018 all-in sustaining cost of producing an ounce of gold, an industry benchmark, to rise to between $935 and $985, while production should be broadly flat on the previous year. \n“Whilst we were impacted by events beyond our control, we took decisive action to stabilise our business and believe our operations are now well placed to deliver in 2018,” interim chief executive Peter Geleta said in a statement. \nThe company sold its 2 percent royalty asset in Burkina Faso for $45 million and spent a combined $5.2 million hedging its gold production at $1,300 per ounce and $1,320 per ounce. \nThe export ban resulted in about $264 million in lost revenue and a cash burn of $237 million in 2017, Acacia said, but it expects to return to cash-flow generation this year. \nNegotiations between Barrick and the Tanzanian government are ongoing, Acacia said.
