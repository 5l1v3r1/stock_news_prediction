Critics in the Senate - which must approve the law - complain the Liberals are moving too quickly.\nThe Liberals initially planned for pot to be legalized in July but Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said the Senate vote on the draft legislation would be on or around June 7, later than expected.\nIf senators recommend amendments, the bill will be sent back to the House of Commons lower chamber for review, and would then have to go back to the Senate.\nFILE PHOTO: Canada's Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor speaks during a news conference on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada November 21, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Wattie Asked by reporters when legalization was likely to happen, Petitpas Taylor said: “If you do the math, you can certainly see that it certainly won’t be July 2018.”\nShe did not give further details. The House of Commons is due to break for the summer on June 22 and will not come back until Sept. 17.\nLast week, Petitpas Taylor said recreational marijuana would only go on sale a few months after it was legalized because the new retail system needs time to start working properly.\nCanada would be the first Group of Seven country to legalize recreational cannabis nationally.\nSome of the country’s 10 provinces - which have responsibility for setting up a system to handle sales - and police forces have argued that the timeline initially set out by the Liberals was too tight.\nMedical marijuana is already allowed in Canada. The Liberals, which made legalizing recreational use part of their successful 2015 election campaign, say the new law would keep marijuana out of the hands of underage users and reduce related crime.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T01:13:44.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
