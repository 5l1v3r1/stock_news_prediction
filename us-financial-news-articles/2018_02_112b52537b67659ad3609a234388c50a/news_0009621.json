I decided not to use him, let him recover and come back better against Leicester and Basel.” \nAfter the visit of eighth-placed Leicester, City return to Champions League action with a last 16 first leg clash at Swiss side Basel on Feb. 13.   editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T09:30:05.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
