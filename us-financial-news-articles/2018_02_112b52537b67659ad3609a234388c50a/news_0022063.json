Soros’s contributions to the group were first reported in the Daily Telegraph newspaper. \nOpponents of Brexit see leaving the EU as the biggest mistake in post-World War Two British history, and fear it will undermine the remaining financial and political clout that Britain still has. \nSupporters of Brexit say it will free Britain from a German-dominated experiment in European unity and allow the economy to eventually thrive. \nIn the United Kingdom’s 2016 referendum, 51.9 percent, or 17.4 million people, voted to leave the EU while 48.1 percent, or 16.1 million people, voted to stay. \nPrime Minister Theresa May says Britain will leave the EU on March 29, 2019 and that there will not be a rerun of the referendum, though opponents of Brexit want another vote. \n“We think the British people deserve a final say on the Brexit deal and believe the country has been led down a dangerous false turn,” Malloch-Brown said. \n“This is a democratic and patriotic effort to recover our future and we welcome support for our efforts from many quarters,” he said. \nA spokesman for Soros did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nSoros used his Quantum Fund in 1992 to bet successfully that sterling was over-valued against the Deutsche Mark, forcing then-Prime Minister John Major to pull the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). \nSoros, who was born in Hungary but made his way to London as Communists consolidated power in Budapest, said last year that Britain was approaching a tipping point that would see the economy slow to such an extent that Brexit might even be reversed.
