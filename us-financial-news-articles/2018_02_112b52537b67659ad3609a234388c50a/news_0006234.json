Fighting off head lice is a family affair in Reno where parents no longer have to worry about treating the bugs themselves, thanks to the opening of a new Lice Clinics of America clinic.\nLice Clinics of America – Reno ( http://www.liceclinicsreno.com ) provides screening, diagnosis and treatment options for people infested with head lice. The clinic is staffed by certified operators of the AirAllé device, an FDA-cleared medical device that kills head lice and lice eggs (nits) using just heated air.\nOwner Marti Torres-Wilson had a nitpicking business and jumped at the chance to use the revolutionary AirAllé technology, and wants to be able to offer this to many families instead of just one at a time\n\"Conventional lice treatment requires several hours and often multiple sessions to get the lice and nits out before the nits hatch again,\" Marti said. \"The one-and-done treatment that the AirAllé delivers is a game changer. Our customers are lice-free in about an hour. At the former company I worked for, I spent close to 11 hours on one customer!\"\nThe Reno clinic is located at 1055 W. Moana Lane, Suite 105, and is open seven days per week by appointment. AirAllé treatments take about an hour and come with a 30-day guarantee when all family members are treated or screened for head lice.\nWith more than 300 clinics in 34 countries, Lice Clinics of America ( www.LiceClinicsOfAmerica.com ) is the largest network of professional head-lice-treatment centers in the world. Lice Clinics of America and AirAllé ( www.airalle.com ) are brands owned by Larada Sciences, Inc., which is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nAttachments:\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/94af95dd-2886-461b-9bde-78eef36609c8\nMarti Torres-Wilson Lice Clinics of America 775-357-7523 info@liceclinicsreno.com\nSource:Lice Clinicsof America", "external_links": ["http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/94af95dd-2886-461b-9bde-78eef36609c8", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vp9slEmLECSUH8PdFfmUN4tsza38gMLTbehnz43FFXnQd2WLZXpdpd3tqYfpdCm_3YkKpWeS8GkmS2dsJnkvWb1bi-vScKrmfkUiTUfxvAYM6gxNKU3mOM_qi4Hq_JZ52NDvVZ5i2fNJHq_ltjY6PA2L_BQxQyfjpKEngxC8w-Sh63SYOROb-u-X_8kpGKNW1SEmK9aRM7G4WgB1di2XM0a0TeDu4jTAJcAhCkrHIIgcjCxzOTPobZpJuLa8xVUNgaoUb_zVvJ4CxZWAeZxIKw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/94af95dd-2886-461b-9bde-78eef36609c8/en"], "published": "2018-02-01T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:27:16.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
