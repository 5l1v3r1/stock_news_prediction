For the last six months of 2017, we saw a broader trend of year-on-year increases...but in January the market has really taken off,” said David Puth, CLS’s CEO.\nCLS said trading had accelerated further in early February, possibly as the equity sell-off starting in late January increased volatility even more.\nIn the first four days of last week, Feb. 5 to Feb. 8, volumes rose by a further 14 percent over January’s numbers to $2.054 trillion, CLS said.\nCurrency market swings, however, have been far more measured than in stocks, with volatility still below long-term average levels.\nThomson Reuters said this week that FX trading volumes on its platforms had hit a record high in January, the first month following the introduction of sweeping European regulations, known as MiFID II or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II.\nAverage daily volumes topped $432 billion in January compared with an average of more than $407 billion, the company said.\nThe new European rules, designed to increase market transparency, have also driven electronic fixed income trading volumes.\nMarketAxess, one of the bigger platforms, said this month that average daily trading volumes hit a record $7.3 billion in January, up 22 percent from a year earlier.\nRISING VOL The uptick in volatility will be welcomed by investment bank trading desks, which can make more money when prices swing wider but have faced years of calmer markets.\n“January was active because it was the start of the next phase of the dollar’s depreciation, and then you had the ECB,” JP Morgan’s Head of Currencies and Emerging Markets Trading in EMEA, Stephen Jefferies, told Reuters, referring to minutes from the European Central Bank that raised speculation of monetary tightening in the euro zone.\nStill, Jefferies noted that volatility in the world’s most traded currency pair, the euro/dollar, remains below its long-term average even after the recent rise.\nWhen stocks tumbled earlier this month, Jefferies said currencies did not move as much as many had expected, suggesting “positions might not have been as big as you thought”.\nBut with central banks expected to accelerate unwinding of their balance sheets as inflation expectations rise, currency volatility is set to rise.\n“This shift in central bank thinking has some serious implications for currencies as well,” said Neil Jones, London-based head of hedge fund currency sales at Mizuho bank.\nadditional reporting by Jemima Kelly and Abhinav Ramnarayan; Editing by Sujata Rao and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T14:11:04.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
