Brunel kept faith in scrumhalf Maxime Machenaud and flyhalf Lionel Beauxis after the 32-26 defeat by Scotland, but added fresh blood to the outside backs for the game in Marseille. Winger Remy Grosso replaced the disappointing Virimi Vakatawa and Benjamin Fall came in for Teddy Thomas, France’s only try scorer in the championship who was left out of the squad after several players were sanctioned for going out late in Edinburgh 10 days ago. Mathieu Bastareaud was named at centre in place of Remi Lamerat and Hugo Bonneval replaced Geoffrey Palis at fullback. Geoffrey Doumayrou retained his spot at centre alongside Bastareaud. “I‘m expecting from them to bring us safety, but also creativity in other moments, and enthusiasm always,” Brunel told a news conference when referring to the backline. “Like I said, there are spots up for grabs. Some have the opportunity to show what they are capable of.” Brunel has high expectations for Bastareaud, who is in the squad after his ban for making homophobic comments in a Champions Cup game expired. “It seems like he has reached a new dimension since he was named captain at Toulon,” said Brunel, who will be facing the team he coached from 2011-16. “He has a special profile and he’s got experience.” The pack was unchanged apart from Paul Gabrillagues coming in for the injured Arthur Iturria in the second row. France and Italy lost their first two matches in the tournament, the Azzurri conceding 102 points in defeats by England and Ireland.
