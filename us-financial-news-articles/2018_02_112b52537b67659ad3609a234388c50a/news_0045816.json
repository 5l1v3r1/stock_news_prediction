The news wire added that global demand is estimated at more than 110,000 metric tons this year. \nApple should have moved to lock in cobalt supplies earlier, according to Ives. He pointed out that, while there was some saturation in the market, about 350 million iPhones were up for an upgrade and there were approximately 1.3 billion active devices. \n\"This is a move they should have done year-and-a-half, two years ago. There were definitely some questions about, as the prices were going up, why they didn't lock this in earlier,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T10:26:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
