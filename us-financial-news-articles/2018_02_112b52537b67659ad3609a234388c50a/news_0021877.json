I don’t know what it is but it definitely seems to be some kind of home course advantage.\n“I‘m leading, I‘m inside the top 24 and that’s my only focus this week, finish inside that number. Whether I lead the qualifying again? That would be a nice bonus but it’s not my priority this week and I‘m playing accordingly.”\nWestwood’s opening round of 66 contained five birdies and an eagle with his only blemish coming on the eighth hole.\nReporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:07:07.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
