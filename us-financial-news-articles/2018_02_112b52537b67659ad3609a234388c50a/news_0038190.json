The margin of error for the January rise of 9.7% was plus or minus 16.8 percentage points. \nEconomists said the report was encouraging because starts rose despite frigid January weather across many parts of the country. \nMore disappointing was that last month’s gains were overwhelmingly driven by an increase in multifamily starts, which tend to be especially volatile and are unlikely to remain at such high levels, economists said. \nApartment starts surged 24% in January, while construction of single-family homes rose just 3.7%. Permits for buildings with five units or more likewise were up more than 25%, while permits for single-family homes fell 1.7%. \nOver the longer-term, new-home construction is picking up. Total starts rose 7.3% in the 12 months through January, while single-family starts rose 7.6% during that period. \nJanuary’s numbers offer the first glimpse into the impact of a tax overhaul bill passed in late December that reduced incentives for homeownership that are especially important in higher cost markets. The bill also cut individual tax rates and slashed the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, along with other changes benefiting small businesses. \nTendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree, said the tax code changes could boost builder margins by 10% to 15%, which could in turn encourage them to build more homes at the low end, where profit margins are thinnest. \n“Home builders are able to be a little more aggressive in terms of getting out there and building homes,” he said.
