Record-breaking holiday sales in a resurgent U.S. economy drew larger volumes into domestic shipping networks at the end of 2017, just as tough weather conditions and new regulatory demands for truck safety technology sidelined many big rigs.\n“The market is strong and capacity is tight,” Chief Operating Officer David Menzel of Echo Global Logistics Inc., ECHO -0.70% one of several freight brokers recently reporting big earnings gains, said in an earnings conference call on Wednesday.\nEcho’s net revenue, or the money brokers keep after paying transportation costs, soared 34.2% in the last three months of 2017, and overall revenue rose 34.6% from the year before, to $547.7 million. “Bottom line, the market is in the process of adapting to the impact of tighter measurement and compliance to the hours-of-service rules and this is impacting both shipper and carrier behaviors,” said Mr. Menzel.\nConnecticut-based XPO Logistics Inc. reported this week that revenue at its freight brokerage segment rose 33% in the fourth quarter from the year before, well above the company’s 14.1% increase in overall revenue.\n“The tight market that started in the third quarter carried into the fourth, driving a significant amount of spot business,” XPO Chief Executive Bradley Jacobs said in an earnings call Thursday.\nMinnesota-based C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. last week reported a 12.5% increase in net revenue, and overall revenue rose 16% to just shy of $4 billion, a signal that the company was able to pass along to its customers a substantial share of its higher transportation costs.\n“Given the healthy economy, high freight demand and tight capacity environment we do expect prices to increase in 2018,” C.H. Robinson Chief Executive John Wiehoff said on an earnings conference call.\nThe growth marks a turnabout for a freight brokerage field that had been mostly stagnant over the past couple of years as lackluster growth in shipping demand and plentiful capacity left little room to expand their third-party purchasing services.\nQuarterly reports from the Transportation Intermediaries Association, a trade group representing brokers, showed revenue for a sample of companies in the industry declining during parts of 2016 from the year before. The group’s most recent report, from the third quarter last year, showed shipments and revenue expanding by double digits in the third quarter and “shipment invoice” levels up 4.6% from the year before, signaling the push for freight space was already getting more expensive.\nWrite to Erica E.
