This is a clear breach of the U.N. and UNMISS Code of Conduct which prohibits sexual relationships with vulnerable individuals, including all beneficiaries of assistance,” it said.\n“UNMISS has informed U.N. headquarters in New York of the allegations, which in turn notified the Member State that the matter was being investigated by the United Nations. There is no indication that this behavior is more widespread within the Mission.”\nSouth Sudan, which won independence from Sudan in 2011, descended into civil war in 2013 months after President Salva Kiir fired his deputy Riek Machar. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and a third of the population have fled their homes.\nThe United Nations has six civilian protection sites across the country, housing some 204,501 people.\nUNMISS comprises over 17,000 peacekeeping personnel including 13,000 soldiers and 1500 police officers.\nReporting by George Obulutsa, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T16:39:25.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
