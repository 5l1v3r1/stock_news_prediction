So far, the lender has already recovered 47.51 billion rupees from other banks’ letter of credits. \nBOI reported a net loss of 23.41 billion rupees ($364 million) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of 1.02 billion rupees a year ago. Analysts on average had expected the company to make a loss of 693.9 million rupees.
