The few remaining families say they are attached to the homes and the land or see no way of moving.\n“My father died, my mother died, the girls got married and I was left alone. They all went to lead their own lives,” said Latifa Ben Yahia, 38, who lives in a five-room troglodyte home in the village of Tijma.\n“If I leave then the house will be gone.”\nThe homes are concentrated around Matmata, which lies in a cratered landscape dotted with palm trees and olive groves about 365 km (227 miles) south of Tunis.\nThey are highly unusual, though similar constructions are found across the border in Libya, to the southwest. In other parts of the Djebel Dahar, houses and storerooms were carved from rock and earth above ground.\nMany families left the underground houses when new towns and villages were built in the 1960s and 1970s as part of a modernization drive by President Habib Bourguiba.\nLocals suspect Bourguiba wanted to dilute Berber communities as he strove to integrate them into the Arab nation after independence from France.\nSaliha Mohamedi, 36, fills a bowl from her water storage outside her troglodyte house on the outskirts of Matmata, Tunisia, February 5, 2018. \"I don't want to leave my house, it would be as if I was throwing my life and my traditions away,\" Saliha said. REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra Disputes over inheritance and periods of drought or heavy rain, which can cause the houses to collapse, also contributed to the rural exodus.\nSome built modern houses on adjoining land, using the traditional homes as stables or workshops.\nSlideshow (20 Images) Residents live largely off olive farming and tourism. Matmata became a popular destination after a troglodyte home converted into a hotel was used as a Star Wars set in the 1970s.\nBut tourism across Tunisia is still recovering from a sharp decline after the country’s 2011 Arab Spring uprising and major attacks targeting tourists in Tunis and Sousse in 2015.\n“Before the revolution there was tourism. Since then there’s not been much, just some Tunisians who come on days off or holidays,” said Saliha Mohamedi, 36.\nShe says she is comfortable in the house, where she lives with her husband and four children and lets tourists visit in return for tips.\n“If I got another house I would give it to (my children). This is where we have passed our lives,” she said.\nHedi Ali Kayel, 65, who runs a small shop in the village of Haddej, is one of the last people in the area who knows how to build and maintain the houses. The last new house he dug was in the 1970s.\nNow he is fighting a lonely battle to save the ones that still exist. “Every time there’s rain I come and repair them,” he says. “I don’t let them go.”\nWriting by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T11:55:43.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
