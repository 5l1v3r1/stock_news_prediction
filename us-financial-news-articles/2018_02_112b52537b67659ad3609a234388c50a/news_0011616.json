Frist. “We need solutions that embrace practical opportunities for clinicians to share timely and accurate information on an individual patient in combination with technology to advise the best resource and treatment plans, based on population health data and evidence-based guidelines.”\nSen. Frist represented the state of Tennessee for 12 years in the U.S. Senate, including four years as Senate Majority Leader. Under his leadership, Congress passed the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act and approved unprecedented levels of funding for the fight against HIV/AIDS. Sen. Frist gained recognition earlier in his career as a world-renowned heart and lung transplant surgeon and founder of the Vanderbilt Multi-Organ Transplant Center. Currently, Dr. Frist serves as an adjunct professor of Cardiac Surgery at Vanderbilt University.\n“There are very few people in the world who have an understanding of the Global Healthcare ecosystem like Dr. Frist,” said McArthur VanOsdale, myNEXUS founder and Chief Executive Officer. “His experience as a physician and as Senate Majority Leader lend a broader vision to our team that challenges conventional assumptions about the types of care that can be delivered in the home. Additionally, Dr. Frist’s passion for patients will continue to challenge our team to drive quality through better clinical integration and care coordination beyond the post-acute episode.”\nDr. Frist serves on the boards of publicly-traded companies AECOM, Select Medical Corporation, and Teladoc, as well as on the boards of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, and the Kaiser Family Foundation. In addition, he serves on multiple early- and mid-market health boards. He co-founded Aspire Health, is a founding partner of Frist Cressey Ventures, and is a board member of Devoted Health.\nmyNEXUS, which was launched in 2014 and fueled through a private equity-backed partnership, with WindRose Health Investors, has rapidly expanded its footprint by collaborating with many of the nation’s largest health insurers. The company has been a pioneer at lowering total cost of care while improving quality outcomes in the post-acute and home-based service arena. myNEXUS was most recently recognized by The Brookings Institution for transforming healthcare through innovative care delivery models.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207005313/en/\nOwen Blicksilver Public Relations, Inc.\nLisa Baker, 914-725-5949\nlisa@blicksilverpr.com\nSource: myNEXUS", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207005313/en/"], "published": "2018-02-07T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T18:55:55.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
