The Montenegrin man, aged about 41 and born in Serbia, was identified by police only by the initials D.J., though media named him as Dalibor Jaukovic, a decorated Yugoslav army veteran. “He was a real patriot during the NATO bombing. He served with the Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences,” Milutin Dragicevic, who described himself as a distant relative told Reuters. In 1999 NATO planes bombed targets in Montenegro and Serbia which together formed rump-Yugoslavia at the time, to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Serbia’s then southern province of Kosovo. Montenegro, the smallest of all former Yugoslav republics, became the 29th country to join NATO last May. At just before midnight, the man lobbed a hand grenade over the embassy compound fence and then blew himself up, assistant police chief, Enis Bakovic, told reporters.

A neighbour who said her name was Branka told Reuters that Jaukovic “was an ordinary, normal man.” “He was always polite to me,” she said. Though the embassy said all staff were safe, it closed for issuing visas on Thursday and told U.S. citizens to stay away until further notice. “The U.S. embassy in Podgorica advises U.S. citizens there is an active security situation at the U.S. embassy in Podgorica,” it said on its website.
