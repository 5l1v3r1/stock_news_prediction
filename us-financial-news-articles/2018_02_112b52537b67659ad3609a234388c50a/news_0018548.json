We believe that this can double,” he said in a telephone interview.\n“There may be some opportunity to grow trade with Russia, just as we can improve our trade with China and also receive investments from Russia and China,” Reyser said.\nHe said this would not imply a concentration of trade with the two countries. “On the contrary, we seek diversification,” he said.\nTillerson raised eyebrows last week when he said the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, which has been linked to U.S. armed intervention in Latin America, was “as relevant today as it was the day it was written.”\nPeru’s trade minister Eduardo Ferreyros defended China as a good trade partner on Tuesday.\nHe said Peru’s 2010 trade liberalization deal with China had allowed the Andean nation of about 30 million people to post a $2.74 billion trade surplus with Beijing last year. “We’re happy with the results of the trade agreement,” he said.\nWriting by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T01:57:49.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
