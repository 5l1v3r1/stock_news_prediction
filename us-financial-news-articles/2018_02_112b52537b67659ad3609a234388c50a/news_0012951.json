So all of us who are feminists have to redouble our efforts to ensure we have gender equality,” he said at an exhibition about the movement.\nFew women in Britain hold top positions and salary differences have attracted significant public attention, with large businesses required to publish pay gap figures this year.\nWomen working for the BBC have complained they are paid less than men in equivalent jobs and accused managers of misleading them about their pay to hide widespread gender discrimination at Britain’s public broadcaster.\n“You look at the senior positions in business, in journalism, in politics - there are too few women, not because they’re not talented but because there’s gender inequality,” Khan said.\nWomen in Britain earn 18 percent less than men on average, government data shows.\nHalf of young British women surveyed by the Fawcett Society did not believe they would live to see equal representation in parliament, the rights group - named after the moderate suffragist Millicent Fawcett - said on Tuesday.\nIt also called for the pardoning of suffragettes who were jailed for their political campaigning.\n“It would be a fitting tribute to pardon them now. They made such sacrifices so that we could all enjoy the rights we have today,” said chief executive Sam Smethers in a statement.\nFawcett - who led a peaceful campaign for equal rights including petitions, lobbying members of parliament and non-violent protests - will become the first woman honored with a statue in London’s Parliament Square.\nReporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Katy Migiro.
