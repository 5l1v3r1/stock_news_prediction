This year staff will share a pot of $3.3 billion, compared with $3.04 billion a year earlier.\nHSBC said Gulliver’s successor John Flint, currently head of the bank’s wealth management and retail banking division, would earn a salary of 1.2 million pounds in his new role, a fixed pay annual allowance of 1.7 million pounds and cash in lieu of pension set at 30 percent of salary.\nThe bank’s pre-tax profit for 2017 more than doubled due to the absence of hefty restructuring costs incurred in the prior year but still lagged expectations following writedowns stemming from U.S. tax changes.\nReporting By Sinead Cruise, editing by Lawrence White\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:42:27.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
