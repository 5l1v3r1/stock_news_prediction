Its 464,000 members still have the chance to veto the deal in a postal ballot whose results will be announced on March 4, party sources said. \nThe Constitutional Court has rejected five complaints about the SPD ballot’s legitimacy, a court spokesperson said. \nSchulz highlighted policies that the SPD had pushed through, notably reducing the scope for short-term work contracts and increasing apprentice loans and minimum wages for apprentices - as demanded by the party’s leftist youth wing, which has drummed in new members in the hope that they will vote against the deal. \nHe said he was optimistic he could persuade grassroots members, many of whom are sceptical, to back the deal. CDU CHANCELLOR, SPD GOVERNMENT? \nJulian Reichelt, editor of Germany’s biggest selling paper, Bild, suggested the SPD had got the better end of the deal, tweeting: “This is the first SPD government led by a CDU chancellor.” \nWhile the talks have dragged on, Europe’s biggest economy has moved into overdrive, offering increased scope for government spending and investment. \nInvestors and partner countries had been alarmed at Merkel’s struggle to assemble a government at a time when Europe faces multiple challenges, including the need for euro zone reform and Britain’s looming departure from the EU. \nIn their 177-page document, the parties laid out plans to develop the euro zone’s bailout fund into a full-blown European Monetary Fund anchored in EU law - and therefore outside the direct control of national government - and support budgetary means to shield the euro zone from crises.

He urged members to back parliamentary floor leader Andrea Nahles as his successor.
