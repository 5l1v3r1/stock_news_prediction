Just made our 1st sale using #CoinbaseCommerce and it was paid with $LTC ! #Litecoin #PayWithLitecoin pic.twitter.com/qoGTnL3Klf \n— Crypto Whale Clothing (@ClothingWhale) February 15, 2018 \nStill, don’t expect a mass surge of merchants gearing up to accept cryptocurrency. Questions about whether or not the platform addresses issues that have barred many other merchants and consumers from accepting cryptocurrency still exist. The volatile price of Bitcoin, for instance, has made it difficult to nail down a price on payments. Gaming platform Steam cited that as an issue when it stopped accepting cryptocurrency. \nCoinbase is not the only company with such a platform. Bitpay, which is used by Microsoft , also makes a cryptocurrency payments program—though notably, it only accepts Bitcoin. \nCoinbase’s announcement comes at a time when the firm itself is having issues with payments. Several major banks no longer allow consumers to buy Bitcoin using credit cards. More recently, users reported issues withdrawing from their wallets using PayPal, prompting Coinbase to say it would disable PayPal transactions in two weeks , and overhaul the “entire experience.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T14:03:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
