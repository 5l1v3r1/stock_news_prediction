Standard deductions \nThose who are married and filing jointly will have an increased standard deduction of $24,000, up from the $13,000 it would have been under previous law. \nSingle taxpayers and those who are married and file separately now have a $12,000 standard deduction, up from the $6,500 it would have been for this year prior to the reform. \nFor heads of households, the deduction will be $18,000, up from $9,550.

The top rate kicks in for married taxpayers who file jointly at $600,000 and up. \nThe new tax law also includes changes to other tax brackets . Jon Boyes | Getty Images Estate tax \nThe estate exemption doubles to $11.2 million per individual and $22.4 million per couple in 2018. Aleksandar Stojanov | Getty Images Child tax credit \nThe child tax credit has been raised to $2,000 per qualifying child, those who are under 17, up from $1,000. A $500 credit is available for dependents who do not get the $2,000 credit. Getty Images Mortgage interest \nThe deduction for interest is capped at $750,000 for mortgage loan balances taken out after Dec. 15 of last year. The limit is still $1 million for mortgages that were established prior to Dec. 15, 2017.

Getty Images Contribution limits for retirement savings \nEmployees who participate in certain retirement plans ‒ 401(k), 403(b) and most 457 plans, and the Thrift Savings Plan – can now contribute as much as $18,500 this year, a $500 increase from the $18,000 limit for 2017. Jamie Grill | Getty Images Savings in IRAs \nSavers who contribute to individual retirement accounts will have higher income ranges following cost-of-living adjustments. Note that the deduction phases out for individuals and their spouses who are covered by workplace retirement plans. \nFor single taxpayers, the limit will be $63,000 to $73,000. \nFor married couples, the phaseout range will vary depending on whether the IRA contributor is covered by a workplace retirement plan or not. When the spouse who is investing has access to an employer plan, the range is $101,000 to $121,000. For individuals who don't have a retirement plan but are married to someone who does, the phaseout has been raised to $189,000 to $199,000. \nThe phaseout was not adjusted for married individuals who file a separate return and who are covered by a workplace retirement plan. That range is $0 to $10,000.

For married couples who file jointly, the range climbs to $189,000 to $199,000. \nThe phaseout was not adjusted for married individuals who file a separate return. That is $0 to $10,000. designer491 | Getty Images ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:32:16.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
