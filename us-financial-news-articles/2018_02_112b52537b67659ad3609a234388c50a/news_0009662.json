The 110,000 bpd DCU-2 coker will be shut through mid-March for a planned overhaul, the sources said.\nBoth units were part of a $10-billion expansion of the Port Arthur refinery between 2007 and 2012 that more than doubled the plantâ€™s capacity to over 600,000 bpd.\nVPS-5 suffered disastrous piping damage in early June 2012 from chemical corrosion, about six weeks after beginning initial production following construction. The damage required eight months of repairs.\nThe lengthy shutdown of the marquee crude unit strained what was then a 50-50 partnership between Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Saudi Aramco.\nAramco became the sole owner of Motiva and the Port Arthur refinery in a negotiated break-up of the partnership on May 1, 2017.\nMost refinery units are shut for a full overhaul about every five years.\nVPS-5 is the largest of three CDUs at the Port Arthur refinery. The other two remain in operation.\nThe CDUs do the primary refining of crude oil and supply hydrocarbon feedstock for all other units.\nThe coker converts residual crude from VPS-5 into motor fuel feedstock and petroleum coke, which can be used as a coal substitute.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:45:54.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
