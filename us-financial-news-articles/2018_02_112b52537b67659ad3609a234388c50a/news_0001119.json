October’s flat reading was unrevised.\nGrowth was widespread as goods-producing industries led the way higher with a 0.8 percent gain. The manufacturing sector jumped 1.8 percent, its biggest gain since February 2014, helped by increased manufacturing of vehicles and parts.\nThe oil and gas extraction subsector climbed 1.6 percent as some facilities continued to get back to normal capacity after maintenance that started in mid-September.\nAmong the services industries, the real estate sector rose 0.4 percent as activity by agents and brokers increased for the fourth month in a row on higher home sales in Ontario and Alberta.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:43:36.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
