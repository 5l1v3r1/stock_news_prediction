It’s good for the curling sport.”\nWith a Swedish rink in the final for the fourth consecutive Olympics, Hasselborg’s team played with cool confidence while the charismatic Korean four from a small garlic-growing county who had been thrust into the global spotlight, seemed to finally wilt under the immense pressure.\n“It’s an honor for us to win South Korea’s first silver medal and we have faced many struggles to come this far,” said Korean skip Kim Eun-jung.\nCurling - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Final - Sweden v South Korea - Gangneung Curling Center - Gangneung, South Korea - February 25, 2018 - Team Sweden celebrate their win.
