Other companies are planning new investments, and several have pledged new jobs.\" \nRetailers announced the most cuts in January â€” representing more than a third of the total number with 15,378. That number is down 32 percent, however, from last year. \nThe Challenger report comes a day before the Labor Department releases its January jobs data. On Wednesday, ADP and Moody's Analytics said U.S. companies hired 234,000 employees in January.
