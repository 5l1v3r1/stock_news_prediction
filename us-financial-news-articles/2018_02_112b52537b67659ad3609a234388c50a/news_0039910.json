It is not a store of value because it is all over the map. Nobody uses it as a medium of exchange,” Carney told students at London’s Regent’s University.\nBut the underlying technology may still prove useful as a way to verify financial transactions in a decentralised way, he added in response to a question.\nThe central bank governor also said sterling’s movements were largely driven by financial speculation over Brexit, and he said British and European officials were working hard to secure a transitional deal before the end of March.
