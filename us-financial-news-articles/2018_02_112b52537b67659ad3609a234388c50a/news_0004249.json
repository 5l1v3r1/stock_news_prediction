REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo \nBut on Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Freedom Party in Lower Austria confirmed a report by Austrian news agency APA that Landbauer had resigned from all political posts. She declined further comment. \nLandbauer has said he did not know of the anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi content of the songbook, since it was published in 1997, well before he joined, and he had only seen copies with those passages redacted or pages torn out. \nProsecutors have opened an investigation into four people, under a law banning Holocaust denial and other Nazi-related offences, but Landbauer is not one of them. \nAustria’s main Jewish body, the IKG, and Israel have upheld their boycot of FPO officials even after they entered government. \nAbout 40 percent of FPO members of parliament, several FPO ministers and numerous FPO ministry staff are members of right-wing fraternities, according to IKG.
