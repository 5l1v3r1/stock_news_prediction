(NASDAQ:VERU) today announced its financial results for the fiscal 2018 first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“We continue to advance our product development program, which has been expanded to include two recently acquired late-stage urology drugs,” said Mitchell Steiner, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Veru. “The two products expand our portfolio of urology and oncology drug candidates and address large patient populations. Moreover, the FDA has agreed that for each of these two products a single bioequivalence study would be acceptable for New Drug Applications (NDA).”\n“Last week, we announced positive preclinical data for our VERU-111 drug candidate; the data were presented at an American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers (ASCO GU) medical conference on February 9, 2018 and we expect additional data for VERU-111 will be presented at other key medical conferences later in the year. While in early stage development, VERU-111 was highly effective at inhibiting tumor growth in prostate cancer, specifically paclitaxel resistant prostate cancer, and, we believe, has strong potential in other cancer types.”\n“Importantly, we remain on track to file with the FDA the Company’s first NDA for Tamsulosin DRS in 2018. Moreover, we plan to submit two additional NDAs in 2019.”\n“Turning to our financial results, which currently are primarily derived from sales of FC2, our fiscal 2018 first quarter performance continues to reflect the inconsistent procurement cycles for our two largest customers, Brazil and South Africa. Both countries have announced large new tenders for female condoms. We are optimistic about potential near-term orders for FC2 from these two large international public-sector customers. Furthermore, we are seeing measurable sales growth following the implementation of several initiatives to grow our US revenue for FC2. Our US FC2 revenues for the first four months of our 2018 fiscal year were approximately $1.5 million, which is approaching the historical average annual US FC2 revenues over the last three fiscal years of approximately $1.9 million.”\nFiscal First Quarter Results: 2018 vs. 2017\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, net revenues were $2.6 million, compared with net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 of $3.2 million. Gross profit was $1.3 million, or 51% of net revenues, compared with $1.7 million, or 51% of net revenues, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating expenses were $8.8 million, which includes a $3.8 million charge related to the settlement of certain receivables owed by our distributor in Brazil. This compares with operating expenses of $3.5 million for the prior year first quarter, which includes non-recurring acquisition-related expenses of $826,000. Net loss was $4.3 million, or $0.08 per share, compared with $1.4 million, or $0.04 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nSignificant quarter-to-quarter variations in the Company’s results have historically resulted from the timing and shipment of large orders rather than from any fundamental changes in the business or the underlying demand for female condoms.\nConference Call Event Details\nVeru Inc. will host a conference call on Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 8 a.m. Eastern Time to review the company’s performance.
