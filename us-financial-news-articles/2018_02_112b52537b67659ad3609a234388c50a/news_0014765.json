Maintaining its highest levels of GAAP equity (including and excluding mark-to-market) and assets under management, Ohio National finished the year with growth in distribution channels, product offerings and sales.\n“Ohio National experienced another positive financial year in 2017,” reported Gary T. “Doc” Huffman, chairman, president and chief executive officer, at today’s board of directors meeting. “We continue to face significant headwinds from low interest rates and changing regulations. In spite of the challenging external environment, we’ve remained focused on our mission to help our customers achieve financial security and independence today, and for generations to come. We do this by taking a long-term perspective, building trusted relationships with our network of financial professionals and offering the products and features that meet the changing needs of our customers.”\n“As a mutual company, we serve our policyholders. Our financial results continue to reflect our long-standing strength and stability. Our balance sheet and capital position remain strong,” Huffman noted. “I’m particularly proud that we maintained our statutory surplus while continuing to invest in our company’s growth. Our team works hard every day to provide the highest quality products with the benefits and protection our customers need.”\nThe company highlighted the following from its 2017 results:\nEnterprise life insurance sales remained strong, with traditional sales channel * growth of 2.6 percent to $139.1 million . Whole life insurance sales reached a record level at $110 million. The indexed universal life product launched in October built momentum with better than expected 2017 sales. Disability income insurance line broke sales record, more than doubling 2016 sales. Driven by the competitive ContinuON II product, DI sales grew 118.6 percent to $6.0 million and multi-life sales exceeded plan at $1.2 million. New fixed indexed annuity sales exceeded goal by 9.4 percent. Total annuity sales were $1.3 billion, down from 2016 and reflecting a decline in variable annuity sales across the industry. Sales of the ONdex fixed indexed annuity (launched September 2016) exceeded expectations in its first full year in the marketplace.\n*Ohio National's traditional sales channel includes both personal producing general agents and career agency organizations.\nFourth quarter retirement plans sales reached highest level for the year. Driven by strong equity market appreciation, separate account assets in the retirement plans business grew 13 percent. Ohio National’s Latin America life business exceeded goal with $36.9 million (U.S. dollars), 19.7 percent ahead of 2016. Our network of financial professionals grew in strong numbers, significantly increasing the company’s distribution footprint across the country. The career agency distribution channel achieved records for sales, number of agencies and number of career agents. In addition, more than 1,200 new personal producing general agents contracted with the company. Total GAAP revenue (excluding realized gains and losses) increased 10.4 percent to $2.2 billion. GAAP equity grew at record levels. Equity (excluding mark-to-market) grew to $2.3 billion, an increase of 0.1 percent. Equity (including mark-to-market) grew to $2.6 billion, a 2.3 percent increase. Core earnings increased 2.7 percent to $181.5 million . The increase relates to higher than planned fee-related income, offset by higher than planned claims and mortality and less than planned investment income and margins.
