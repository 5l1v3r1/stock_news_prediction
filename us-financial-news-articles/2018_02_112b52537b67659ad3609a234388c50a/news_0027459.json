But authorities are proceeding cautiously to avoid any sharp blow to economic growth or excessive financial market volatility. \nBroad M2 money supply also beat expectations, growing 8.6 percent in January from a year earlier, central bank data showed on Monday. Economists had expected the growth rate to edge up to 8.4 percent from 8.2 percent in December. \nAfter the December data was released, PBOC spokeswoman Ruan Jianhong said the weak M2 growth was caused by a crackdown on banks’ off-balance sheet activities and that lower M2 growth may become a new normal. CREDIT STILL AMPLE \nOutstanding yuan loans grew 13.2 percent from a year earlier, also faster than an expected 12.5 percent rise and compared with an increase of 12.7 percent in December. \nLast year China’s total new loans hit a record 13.53 trillion yuan, 7 percent more than the previous record in 2016. \nThe credit boom has been fuelled by strong economic growth, a robust property market and a crackdown on riskier shadow lending, which has forced banks to shift such loans back onto their balance sheets. \nSince the start of 2017, Chinese regulators have announced a slew of steps to coax financial institutions to reduce riskier activity and leverage, targeting everything from interbank lending levels to bond trading, negotiable certificates of deposit and entrusted loans. \nThe PBOC has also been gingerly nudging up money market interest rates, most recently in December, but rates have also been slowly creeping higher on their own as regulators look set to persist with the “de-risking” campaign much longer than policy crackdowns in the past. \nThose efforts are showing some progress. The outstanding amount of banking wealth management products (WMPs) grew just 1.7 percent last year, compared with a near 24 percent rise in 2016. Many of these products had strong links with the less regulated shadow banking sector. \nAnalysts expect authorities to step up their efforts this year, focussing on local government debt, rising corporate and household debt levels and dealing with “zombie” companies. \nBut analysts say more still needs to be done on structural reforms to rein in ballooning corporate debt, which has reached that the IMF and others have warned sharply raises the risks of a financial crisis. \nChina’s total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, surged to 3.06 trillion yuan in January from 1.14 trillion yuan in December, the data showed on Monday. \nTSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales. \nThat can provide hints of activity in China’s vast and unregulated shadow banking sector, which authorities have also been targeting in their campaign to reduce systemic risks. \nChina: an economic snapchot - tmsnrt.rs/2lQ48De Reporting by Cheng Fang and Kevin Yao; Editing by Kim Coghill", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T12:07:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
