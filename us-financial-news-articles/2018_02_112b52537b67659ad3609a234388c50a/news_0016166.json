So we support all the major OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] globally,\" said Briand Greer, Honeywell's president for Southeast Asia. \nThe narrow-body plane, seen as a symbol of China's aerospace ambitions, adds to competition in the commercial aircraft manufacturing space currently led by Boeing and Airbus . \nThe company has, in fact, worked with Comac to have a number of its products used on the C919 jet, Greer added. \nHoneywell has also strengthened its businesses beyond China . The American conglomerate this week signed contracts with Singapore Airlines Group and Indonesia's Lion Air Group to provide the two with services that include back-up power for planes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T06:20:48.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
