Sidley is one of the nation's largest law firms and recently renewed its lease at the property. The trophy property combines innovative design, technology-enabled infrastructure and a five-star amenity package.\n\"Starwood is very excited to add One South Dearborn to SOF X's portfolio. It is one of the top office properties in Chicago's Loop,\" said Austin Nowlin, Head of Capital Markets at Starwood Capital Group. \"ING was the perfect partner for us on this transaction.
