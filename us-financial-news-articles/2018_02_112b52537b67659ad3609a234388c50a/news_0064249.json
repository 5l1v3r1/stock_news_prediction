Returns on equity after tax were 13.6 percent.\nThe Productivity Commission has said the Big Four are more profitable than their smaller rivals, partly because the banking regulator had focused on stability at the expense of competition.\nWestpac posted a record cash profit of A$8.06 billion ($6.3 billion) for the year ended Sept. 30, missing market expectations. Its net interest margin, a barometer of profitability, was down 4 basis points to 2.06 percent as competition eroded the benefits of higher mortgage rates.\nAustralia’s major banks have posted record profits for years on the back or mortgage lending, but they are now starting to feel the pinch of a softening property market, weak retail sales, heightened competition and tighter regulation.\nReporting by Paulina Duran Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:00:28.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
