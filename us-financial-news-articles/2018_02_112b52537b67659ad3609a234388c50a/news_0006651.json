It was the main driver of the decline,” Kavashe said.\nBefore the rate cap kicked in and squeezed credit growth, Kenya’s new car industry had its best year in 2015, when 20,000 units were sold.\nKavashe said sales were likely to rebound towards 2016 levels this year as consumers who held off vehicle purchases in the fourth quarter, due to the uncertainty, now buy them.\nKenya’s vehicle market is dominated by cheaper second-hand imports from countries such as Japan, which account for 89 percent of annual sales.\nVehicle manufacturers have, however, been investing in Kenya recent years, to take advantage of growing demand for newer, environmentally friendly vehicles.\nVolkswagen said it would double its Kenyan production earlier this month. Other companies that have announced plans to start or restart assembly in Kenya in the past two years include Peugeot and Volvo.\nIsuzu also increased its local presence last year by buying a 57.7 percent stake from General Motors in GM’s Kenyan franchise.\n“Long term, Kenya is still very good, we just had a difficult period, but that will correct,” Kavashe said.\nReporting by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:14:25.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
