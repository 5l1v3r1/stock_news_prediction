(Nasdaq:KERX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing innovative medicines to people with kidney disease, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The company also reviewed its commercial progress with Auryxia following approval of the medicine’s second indication for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease, not on dialysis.\n“In 2017, we brought Auryxia to an increasing number of people with hyperphosphatemia, and with the recent approval of a second indication, we are confident we can bring Auryxia to even more patients living with chronic kidney disease in the coming years,” said Greg Madison, president and chief executive officer of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. “With approval of a second indication for Auryxia, we believe we are in a unique position to offer patients and their healthcare providers a medicine that can treat two distinct but related complications of chronic kidney disease.

This formulary status applies to both Auryxia indications.\nFourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Results\n“The strong prescription demand growth generated in the fourth quarter, coupled with the stabilization of the gross-to-net adjustment, led to $17.3 million of net U.S. Auryxia product sales in the fourth quarter of 2017,” said Scott Holmes, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. “As we enter 2018, we believe we will continue to drive Auryxia growth as a chronic kidney disease treatment for both hyperphosphatemia in the dialysis setting, as well as iron deficiency anemia in the non-dialysis setting.”\nTotal revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $18.7 million, compared with $9.5 million during the same period in 2016.

Auryxia tablets were designed to contain 210 mg of ferric iron, equivalent to 1 gram of ferric citrate, and offers convenient mealtime dosing. The starting dose of Auryxia for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia for patients on dialysis is six tablets per day (two per meal) and for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients not on dialysis is three tablets per day (one per meal). For more information about Auryxia and the U.S. full prescribing information, please visit www.Auryxia.com .\nIMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION FOR AURYXIA ® (ferric citrate)\nCONTRAINDICATION\nAURYXIA ® (ferric citrate) is contraindicated in patients with iron overload syndromes, e.g., hemochromatosis.\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nIron Overload: Increases in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were observed in clinical trials with AURYXIA in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis treated for hyperphosphatemia, which may lead to excessive elevations in iron stores. Assess iron parameters prior to initiating AURYXIA and monitor while on therapy. Patients receiving concomitant intravenous (IV) iron may require a reduction in dose or discontinuation of IV iron therapy. Risk of Overdosage in Children Due to Accidental Ingestion: Accidental ingestion and resulting overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of age. Advise patients of the risks to children and to keep AURYXIA out of the reach of children.\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nMost common adverse reactions with AURYXIA were:\nHyperphosphatemia in CKD on Dialysis: Diarrhea (21%), discolored feces (19%), nausea (11%), constipation (8%), vomiting (7%) and cough (6%) Iron Deficiency Anemia in CKD Not on Dialysis: Discolored feces (22%), diarrhea (21%), constipation (18%), nausea (10%), abdominal pain (5%) and hyperkalemia (5%)\nSPECIFIC POPULATIONS\nPregnancy and Lactation: There are no available data on AURYXIA use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. However, an overdose of iron in pregnant women may carry a risk for spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes and fetal malformation. Data from rat studies have shown the transfer of iron into milk, hence, there is a possibility of infant exposure when AURYXIA is administered to a nursing woman.\nTo report suspected adverse reactions, contact Keryx Biopharmaceuticals at 1-844-445-3799.\nPlease click here to view the Full Prescribing Information for Auryxia.\nAbout Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.\nKeryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., with headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts, is focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that provide unique and meaningful advantages to people with kidney disease.

For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are the following: our ability to successfully market Auryxia and whether we can increase adoption of Auryxia in patients with CKD on dialysis and successfully launch Auryxia for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, not on dialysis; whether we can maintain our operating expenses to projected levels while continuing our current clinical, regulatory and commercial activities; our ability to continue to supply Auryxia to the market; the risk that increased utilization by Medicare Part D subscribers will increase our gross-to-net adjustment greater than we anticipate; and other risk factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any forward-looking statements set forth in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release. We do not undertake to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof.
