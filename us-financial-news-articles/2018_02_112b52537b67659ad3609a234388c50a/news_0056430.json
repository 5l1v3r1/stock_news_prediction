They have challenged the National Rifle Association, a politically powerful defender of the U.S. constitutional right to bear arms.\nFILE PHOTO: Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel speaks before the start of a CNN town hall meeting at the BB&T Center, in Sunrise, Florida, U.S. February 21, 2018. REUTERS/Michael Laughlin/Pool/File Photo Israel has acknowledged that an armed deputy assigned to the school, Scot Pederson, remained outside during the seven minutes that Cruz was inside the school.\nPederson resigned after he was suspended with the intent to fire him, Israel said.\nFILE PHOTO: Nikolas Cruz, facing 17 charges of premeditated murder in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, appears in court for a status hearing in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, U.S. February 19, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Stocker/Pool News organizations, including CNN and NBC, have reported that at least three other Broward deputies also failed to enter the campus during the shooting, citing unnamed sources from the Coral Springs Police Department, which also responded.\n“Our investigation to this point shows that during this horrific attack, while this killer was inside the school, there was only one law enforcement person, period, and that was former deputy Scot Pederson,” Israel said.\nIsrael did not rule out that the investigation could find other deputies who were guilty of dereliction of duty.\nThe sheriff’s office is also investigating whether it missed danger signs about Cruz from two phone calls warning he might be dangerous, Israel said. Proper steps were taken after 16 other calls about Cruz.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation also said it failed to follow proper protocols after it received a tip that Cruz possessed a gun, had indicated the desire to kill and could potentially commit a school shooting.\nFBI officials have told families of victims they “deeply regret” their mishandling of the matter.\nReporting by Daniel Trotta in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:27:31.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
