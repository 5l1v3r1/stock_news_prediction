It will be the first of its kind in Europe.\nStarbucks has till now launched two Reserve Roasteries, in its hometown of Seattle, in 2014 and in Shanghai, in December 2017. The firm reportedly spent $20 million on the Seattle outlet. It says it plans to open ‘Roasteries’ in New York, Tokyo and Chicago.\nAfter the launch in Milan, its Italian commercial partner and licensee Percassi will open more typical Starbucks shops in the city later in the year, the company said.\nA total of 300 people will be hired for its Italian stores in 2018, it said.\nOther coffee makers like Lavazza have opened shops in Italy’s financial capital, reflecting global competition among major brands to capture a growing market for people prepared to pay a premium for quality espresso coffees.\nReporting by Elisa Anzolin; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T19:10:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
