It’s businesses are mainly domestic. Shin has attempted to expand Lotte overseas by growing its chemical business and retail presence in Asia, but that is expected to grind to a halt - at least until the appeals ruling,” said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.\nShares in Lotte Corp, the holding company of Lotte Group, tumbled more than 7 percent to its lowest in almost eight weeks, while flagship retailer Lotte Shopping slid 5.5 percent, marking its lowest point since early January.\nLotte Group said after Shin’s arrest on Tuesday it will begin “emergency operations” to “put the minds of stakeholders at rest”. Analysts have said they expect Hwang Kag-gyu, the co-CEO of the South Korean holding company, to take a leading role but that major decisions are likely to be put on hold.\nShin’s appeals trial is expected to take months.\nLotte had been in the process of tranferring control of various units to Lotte Corp after it debuted in late last year, but analysts said the work is partly done, as Lotte Corp does not control Lotte Chemical and key unit Hotel Lotte.\nLotte Group expressed concern on Tuesday that Shin’s arrest could hinder plans to list Hotel Lotte.\nLotte Group has sought a fresh opportunity to list Hotel Lotte after a planned $4.5 billion IPO was scuppered in 2016.\nLotte also planned this year to expand its presence in overseas markets such as Vietnam and Indonesia, since Lotte units sustained losses in China, where it was forced to close stores as business suffered following “fire inspections” that were ordered after a U.S. missile defense system was deployed in South Korea on land provided by Lotte.\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Additional reporting by Dahee Kim; Editing by Edwina Gibbs & Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T08:36:22.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
