Since late last year, some of those villages - and at least two previously intact settlements - had been flattened, it said.\n“Many of these villages were scenes of atrocities against Rohingya and should be preserved so that the experts appointed by the U.N. to document these abuses can properly evaluate the evidence to identify those responsible,” said Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch’s Asia director.\n“Bulldozing these areas threatens to erase both the memory and the legal claims of the Rohingya who lived there.”\nHuman Rights Watch said a series of images taken from satellites showed that two villages in the area called Myin Hlut were not damaged by fire and were “likely inhabitable” before they were “destroyed and smoothed over by heavy machinery” between Jan. 9 and Feb. 13.\nGovernment spokesman Zaw Htay was not immediately available for comment.\nMyanmar officials have said the government is preparing areas to receive refugees who will return under a repatriation agreement signed by Myanmar and Bangladesh in November.\nAerial view of a burned Rohingya village near Maungdaw, north of Rakhine State, Myanmar, September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun/Files Myanmar state media reported in January that eight excavators and four bulldozers were working in the area.\nMyanmar has established two reception centres and a camp for returnees, but it says they are temporary and people will be able to return to their original places or nearby.\nWin Myat Aye, the minister charged by Suu Kyi with leading rehabilitation efforts in Rakhine, said in September that land damaged by fire legally becomes “government-managed land”.\n‘PATH TO PEACE’\nThe state-run Global New Light of Myanmar daily reported that Myanmar, Japan and seven U.N. agencies had struck a deal on help for Rakhine State worth $20 million.\nThe United Nations suspended its activities in northern Rakhine and evacuated non-critical staff after the government suggested it had supported Rohingya insurgents last year.\nNeither the state-run newspaper nor the United Nations specified what proportion of projects would be implemented in the northern part of the state where the Red Cross has been providing limited assistance.\n“The U.N. agencies have to plan projects and will coordinate with the government for implementing their plans,” Win Myat Aye told Reuters on Friday.\nKnut Ostby, the interim U.N. coordinator for Myanmar, said in a release the immediate concern was to provide humanitarian aid to people in need, “irrespective of their religion, ethnicity, gender or citizenship status”.\n“More than 40 percent of people in Rakhine live in poverty and we have to reach them with development assistance in order to set the state on the path to peace and inclusive growth,” he said.\nU.N. projects aim to reach half a million beneficiaries over the next year, the United Nations said in a statement, though adding that humanitarian access remained restricted.\nThe U.N. refugee agency has also been excluded from a Rohingya refugee repatriation process organised by Bangladesh and Myanmar.\nThe United Nations said it would keep calling for “voluntary, safe, sustainable and dignified return of refugees to places of origin - and UNHCR’s involvement in the repatriation process”.\nReporting by Shoon Naing; Writing by Simon Lewis; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T11:21:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
