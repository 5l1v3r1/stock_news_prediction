Gangwon province, which is hosting the 2018 Pyeonchang Olympics, also wants to find ways to use Olympic venues after the current Games finish, Choi was quoted as saying. He said he would start mapping out details once the Games end and that the proposal would also utilise North Korea’s Masik ski resort, Yonhap reported. The proposal, if put forward, would need to approval from South Korea’s unification ministry. The venue for the 2021 Asian winter Games has yet to be decided.
