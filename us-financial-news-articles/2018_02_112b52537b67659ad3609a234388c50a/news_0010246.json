Kawamoto, a veteran of Amazon Web Services, will direct expansion of the company’s footprint in the U.S., working with a growing staff that includes co-founder and CTO Kenta Yasukawa.\nThe Soracom platform for IoT applications combines robust network management tools, secure integration to the cloud, and pay-as-you go pricing for cellular and low-power radio connectivity that gives both start-up and enterprise customers flexibility to go from prototype to field deployment of thousands of devices. The company launched in Japan in late-2015 and now serves more than 9,000 customers globally.\n“We’ve known Eugene through his work at Amazon since we started Soracom and it’s very exciting to now have him as part of the leadership team,” said Ken Tamagawa, co-founder and CEO of Soracom, Inc. “Our Americas operation has been in place for more than a year and is well-positioned to meet the needs of customers across a range of end-use industries.”\nKawamoto spent 6.5 years with Amazon Web Services, most recently as Director of Worldwide Business Development for database, analytics, and AI services, leading sales and business development teams in Seattle headquarters. As head of Japan Business Development in Tokyo, he launched the Japan business in 2011.\n“The IoT today is like the cloud was when I joined Amazon; still in the development stage and rich with transformative potential,” said Eugene Kawamoto. “I’m looking forward to the opportunity to help IoT developers and business managers easily solve connectivity and device management challenges and create amazing new connected experiences.”\nAbout Soracom\nSoracom is the market-leading platform for cloud-native IoT connectivity.
