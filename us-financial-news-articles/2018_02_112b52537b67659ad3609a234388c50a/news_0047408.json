(NASDAQ: ICCH) (the Company), parent company of Illinois Casualty Company, a regional, multi-line property and casualty insurance company focusing exclusively on the food and beverage industry, today reported preliminary, unaudited results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFOURTH QUARTER AND TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 – FINANCIAL RESULTS\nNet earnings totaled $452,000 or $0.14 per share for the quarter of 2017, compared to net earnings of $1,225,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net earnings of $717,000 or $0.23 per share, compared to $2,810,000 for the same period in 2016.\nDirect premium written grew by $1,281,000, or 10.8%, to $13,143,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $11,862,000 for the same period in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, direct premiums grew by $2,639,000, or 5.2%, to $53,670,000 from $51,031,000 for the same period in 2016. Net premiums earned grew by 5.1% and 3.8%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company ceded to reinsurers $1,956,000 of earned premiums, compared to $1,939,000 of earned premiums for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company ceded $7,948,000 of earned premiums to reinsurers compared to $7,898,000 of earned premiums for the same period in 2016.\nNet realized investment gains were $622,000 compared to net realized investment gains of $18,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net realized investment gains increased by $971,000 to $1,008,000 from $37,000 for the same period in 2016. These increases were a result of the Company liquidating assets to secure the funding used to purchase the ESOP shares in the first quarter of 2017 and liquidating an ETF position in the 4 th quarter of 2017 to be in compliance with the Illinois Department of Insurance regulations.\nNet investment income increased by $248,000, or 46.4%, during the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net investment income grew $664,000, or 33.7% to $2,632,000 from $1,968,000 for the same period in 2016. The growth in net investment income is primarily from the increase in the size of the available for sale securities portfolio.\nLosses and settlement expenses increased by $1,850,000, or 32.8%, to $7,483,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, from $5,633,000 for the same period in 2016. Losses and settlement expenses increased by $4,665,000, or 19.2%, to $29,010,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $24,345,000 for the same period in 2016. The increase in losses and settlement expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 is primarily due to an increase in fire losses and higher retention of property losses compared to the same period in 2016.\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs incurred to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports, and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets the direct commissions it pays with ceded commissions it receives from reinsurers. Other operating expenses consist primarily of information technology costs, accounting and internal control salaries, as well as audit and legal expenses. Policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses increased by $449,000, or 11.1%, to $4,500,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $4,051,000 for the same period in 2016. Policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses increased by $1,450,000, or 9.1%, to $17,299,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $15,849,000 for the same period in 2016. The increases in policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 are primarily driven by increases in the other operating expenses. This principally is due to additional costs associated with operating as a public company which did not occur in previous years.\nTotal assets increased by 24.7 % from $122,160,000 at December 31, 2016 to $152,334,000 at December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of our initial public offering completed during the first quarter of 2017. Our investment portfolio, which consists of fixed maturity securities, common stocks, preferred stocks, and property held for investment, increased by 38.1% from $76,122,000 at December 31, 2016 to $105,133,000 at December 31, 2017, as a result of deploying the net proceeds from our completed initial public offering.\nFOURTH QUARTER AND TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 – FINANCIAL RATIOS\nThe Company's loss and settlement expense ratio (defined as loss and settlement expenses divided by net premiums earned) was 65.2% and 65.6% in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with 51.6% and 57.1% for the same periods in 2016, respectively.\nThe expense ratio (defined as the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expenses divided by net premiums earned) was 39.2% and 39.1% in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with 37.1% and 37.2% for the same periods in 2016, respectively.\nThe Company's GAAP combined ratio (defined as the sum of the losses and settlement expense ratio and the expense ratio) was 104.5% and 104.7% in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to 88.7% and 94.3% for the same periods in 2016, respectively.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\n\"The Company continued to have strong results in the core liquor liability line and profitable workers' compensation experience. However, the Company experienced an above normal frequency and severity of fire losses in comparison to previous years. Although financial results were not as favorable as we had anticipated, we saw significant improvements during the fourth quarter in comparison to the third quarter of 2017. The Company is optimistic that the trend marks a return to historical loss levels.\n\"Recent geographic expansion efforts into Colorado, Kansas, and Ohio generated strong, double-digit, top-line premium growth for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company is committed to maintaining its traditional underwriting discipline throughout this growth phase.\n\"We are excited to report that 2018 is off to a record start in premium growth. This is further evidence of the success of our geographic expansion efforts. We anticipate this momentum will continue to build as we start quoting business in Michigan for the second quarter of 2018,\" stated Arron Sutherland, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Wednesday, April 4 th , 2018 at 1:30 CT to discuss results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nTeleconference:\nDial-in information for the call is 866-595-5224 (toll-free domestic) or 636-812-6497.\nABOUT ICC HOLDINGS, INC.\nICC Holdings, Inc. is a vertically integrated company created to facilitate the growth, expansion and diversification of its subsidiaries in order to maximize value to its stakeholders.
