During his Jan. 16 appearance, Bannon refused to answer questions about his time in President Donald Trump’s administration or the post-election presidential transition, committee members said.\nThe Intelligence Committee and the White House have not resolved the question of whether executive privilege would apply in Bannon’s case.\nThe House Intelligence Committee is one of three congressional committees, along with the Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller, investigating the allegations of Russian influence.\nThe source said Bannon would answer all of Mueller’s questions when he appears before him, which is expected next week.\nRussia denies meddling in the election, and Trump has denied any collusion between his associates and Russia.\nReporting by Karen Freifeld, Jonathan Landay and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Peter Cooney and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T05:58:01.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
