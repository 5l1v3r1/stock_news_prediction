Russia denies interfering in the election. Trump denies any collusion by his campaign.\nThe House Intelligence panel is conducting one of three main congressional investigations, along with a criminal probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The dispute over the memos has been raging for weeks, which many lawmakers deem a distraction from the investigations.\nEven as the probes continue, top intelligence officials said on Tuesday that mid-term elections in November, which will determine whether Trump’s fellow Republicans maintain control of Congress, are already being targeted by Moscow, including using social media.\nSchiff, speaking at a breakfast with journalists sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor, said the committee was continuing to press social media companies to “be transparent” about advertisements taken out by foreign operatives.\nHe also said there are dozens of witnesses who still need to be interviewed in his panel’s Russia probe, and others who had refused to respond to questions and should be compelled to respond.\nOne witness who has declined to answer, former Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon, is expected to appear before the panel again on Thursday, committee sources said.\n“Right now there are too many witnesses under the impression that if they just say, ‘I’m here voluntarily and I refuse to answer those questions,’ the committee will just say, ‘that’s fine, have a nice day,'” Schiff said.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T17:35:38.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
