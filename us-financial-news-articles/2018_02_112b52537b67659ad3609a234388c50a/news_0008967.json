South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand suffered the worst losses.\nMSCI’s benchmark emerging markets index has fallen over 6 percent since the start of the month and was set for its worst daily fall since November 2016 on Tuesday, tumbling 3 percent.\nInvestors have scrambled for the exits after data on Friday’s showed the largest U.S. wage growth since 2009. That has fueled speculation the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates faster than had been expected, which would mean higher borrowing costs for emerging markets.\n“While we remain generally optimistic on EM flows this year, downside risks should not be understated,” the IIF said. “A sustained global equity market sell-off would clearly be one such downside risk.”\nRelated Coverage Emerging stocks modestly outperform in sell-off, Brazil, South Africa outliers Reporting by Claire Milhench, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T12:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T13:55:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
