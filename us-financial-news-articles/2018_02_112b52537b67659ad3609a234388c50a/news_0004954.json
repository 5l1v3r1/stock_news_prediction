With this acquisition, the Company expects to reduce its reliance on co-manufacturing; The 137,000 square-foot bakery facility represents the largest individually-wrapped Danish pastry facility in North America;\n“This strategic acquisition allows us to bring important product manufacturing in-house as we expand and drive growth in our breakfast product portfolio,” commented Bill Toler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hostess. “In addition, this purchase will enable Hostess to forgo in-house capital investments and create significant value over the next few years.”\n“We have had a long supply relationship with ARYZTA for our breakfast items and are eager to expand our growing breakfast offerings with these capabilities. In addition, the positioning and consumer loyalty to the Big Texas and Cloverhill brands will broaden our participation in a number of distribution outlets,” said Andy Jacobs, Chief Operating Officer of Hostess. “This acquisition will enhance our competitive position as we have the opportunity to further build our branded distribution and market share in the breakfast category within sweet baked goods 1 , as well as enhance new and existing retailer relationships, particularly in the complementary club and vending sales channels.”\nThe acquired assets include inventory, property, plant, equipment and customer relationships serviced by the Chicago Cloverhill bakery facility. The Company expects short-term EBITDA losses of approximately $15 million to $20 million and corresponding earnings per diluted share dilution of approximately $0.10 to $0.12 as a result of anticipated operating losses from the acquired business through the second half of 2018 as the Company improves the sales and operating performance of the facility.
