In this demonstration, the drone took off from its maintenance center, was automatically loaded with a robotic arm at a “specially designed parcel station, took off again, landed, and then automatically unloaded its package. \nWhen the Skyways trial launches in the coming months, campus students and staff will be able to use it for the delivery of packages weighing 2-4 kilograms (4.4-8.8 lbs) within the campus grounds. \nSingapore’s civil aviation authority (CAAS) is on board, so to speak. It wants to see the project rolled out in phases, though. \n“For Singapore, this project will help to develop innovative rules to support the development of the unmanned aircraft industry in Singapore,” said director-general Kevin Shum. \nSingapore, of course, is pretty small as countries go. In the U.S., conflicting federal and state-level drone rules have led companies to test deliveries in other countries. President Donald Trump’s White House last year made it easier to get approval for tests.
