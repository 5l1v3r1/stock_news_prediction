GAAP Net Income of $16.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $25.0 million, or $0.54 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of $89.8 million, up 16% from $77.5 million in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income per diluted share of $0.73 compared to $0.79 in the prior year, impacted by additional interest and depreciation expense from acquisitions completed in January 2017. Adjusted gross profit margin of 35.3%, approximately flat compared to the prior year.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights:\nTotal revenues of $1.51 billion, up 19% (20% on a constant-currency basis) from $1.27 billion in the prior year, driven by the DCPayments and Spark acquisitions completed in January 2017. ATM operating revenues of $1.45 billion, up 20% from $1.21 billion in the prior year. GAAP Net (Loss) of $(145.4) million, or $(3.19) per diluted share, compared to Net Income of $88.0 million in the prior year, or $1.92 per diluted share, impacted by the impairment of the Company’s Australia & New Zealand segment during the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA of $348.6 million, up 9% from $318.9 million in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income per diluted share of $3.00 compared to $3.26 in the prior year, impacted by additional interest and depreciation expense from acquisitions completed in January 2017.\n“2017 represented a dynamic and transitional year for Cardtronics. During the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we expanded our relationships with financial institutions, leveraging our unrivaled retail ATM footprint and breadth of offering. This past quarter was highlighted by new and expanded relationships with our Allpoint and ATM branding surcharge-free solutions. This traditional growth lever was complemented by growth in our new end-to-end ATM managed service solutions for financial institutions. We also continue to be the provider of choice for retailers with ATMs, adding high quality locations with both new and existing merchants, providing convenient consumer cash access,” commented Edward H. West, Cardtronics’ chief executive officer.\nMr. West continued, “Looking ahead to 2018, with our leading ATM platform, we are well positioned to drive growth and become an increasingly important strategic partner to both financial institutions and retailers in our key markets and we look forward to realizing the opportunities ahead. In 2018, we expect to generate increased free cash flows, which we plan to use to reduce debt.”\nSee Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Information in this earnings release for definitions of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per diluted share, Free Cash Flow, and certain other non-GAAP measures on a constant-currency basis. For additional information, including reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measure recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”), see the supplemental schedules of selected financial information in this earnings release.\nU.S. TAX REFORM\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) was enacted and signed into law. Under U.S. GAAP, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform, in the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company provisionally recognized a one-time net tax benefit totaling $11.6 million. This amount included a one-time tax benefit of $19.4 million due to the re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Partially offsetting this non-cash book tax benefit, the Company recognized an estimated one-time tax expense on its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings of $7.8 million related to foreign operations under its U.S. business.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nBelow is the Company’s financial outlook for the year ending December 31, 2018:\nRevenues of $1.25 billion to $1.29 billion; GAAP Net Income of $1.0 million to $6.5 million; Adjusted EBITDA of $250 million to $260 million; Depreciation and accretion expense of $125 million to $127 million; Cash interest expense of $36 million to $37 million; Adjusted Net Income of $63 million to $73 million; Adjusted Net Income per diluted share of $1.35 to $1.55, based on approximately 46.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding; and Capital expenditures of $110 million.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income outlook excludes the impact of certain expenses, as outlined in the reconciliation provided at the end of this earnings release. See Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Information in this earnings release for definitions of these Non-GAAP measures. This outlook is based on average foreign currency exchange rates for the year of £1.00 U.K. to $1.35 U.S., $20.00 Mexican pesos to $1.00 U.S., $1.00 Canadian dollar to $0.80 U.S., €1.00 Euros to $1.24 U.S., $1.00 Australian dollar to $0.80 U.S., and R13 South African Rand to $1.00 U.S. Additionally, this outlook is based on an estimated non-GAAP tax rate of 26% to 28% for 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nThe Company will host a conference call today, Tuesday, February 20, 2018, at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.

These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on the Company and there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those that are anticipated. All comments concerning the Company’s expectations for future revenues and operating results are based on its estimates for its existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions. The Company’s forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond its control) and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from its historical experience and present expectations or projections. Risk factors are described in the Company’s 2016 Form 10-K, and those set forth from time-to-time in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release, which speak only as of the date of this earnings release. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nDISCLOSURE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per diluted share, Free Cash Flow, and certain GAAP as well as non-GAAP measures on a constant-currency basis represent non-GAAP financial measures provided as a complement to financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and measuring the performance of its business, including setting and measuring incentive based compensation for management. Management believes that the presentation of these measures and the identification of notable, non-cash, and/or (if applicable in a particular period) certain costs not anticipated to occur in future periods enhance an investor’s understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s business and provide for better comparability between periods in different years.\nAdjusted Gross Profit represents total revenues less the total cost of revenues, excluding depreciation, accretion, and amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted Gross Profit by total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation, accretion, and amortization of intangible assets as these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the Company’s industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, and the methods by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes share-based compensation expense, acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, certain non-operating expenses, (if applicable in a particular period) certain costs not anticipated to occur in future periods, gains or losses on disposal and impairment of assets, the Company’s obligations for the payment of income taxes, interest expense, and other obligations such as capital expenditures, and includes an adjustment for noncontrolling interests. Adjusted Net Income represents net income computed in accordance with GAAP, before amortization of intangible assets, gains or losses on disposal and impairment of assets, share-based compensation expense, certain other expense amounts, acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, certain non-operating expenses, and (if applicable in a particular period) certain costs not anticipated to occur in future periods (together, the “Adjustments”). Prior to June 30, 2016, Adjusted Net Income was calculated using an estimated long-term, cross-jurisdictional effective cash tax rate of 32%. Subsequent to the redomicile of the Company’s parent company to the U.K., the Company revised the process for determining its non-GAAP tax rate and now utilizes a non-GAAP tax rate derived from the GAAP tax rate adjusted for the net tax effects of the Adjustments, based on the nature and geography of the Adjustments. Additionally, the non-GAAP tax rate excludes a non-recurring net benefit of $11.6 million related to U.S. Tax Reform which is included in the U.S. GAAP tax rate for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The non-GAAP tax rate for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 excludes a non-recurring benefit of $8.2 million related to the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.K., which is included in the U.S. GAAP tax rate for those periods. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the non-GAAP tax rate used to calculate Adjusted Net Income was approximately 28.6% and 27.7%, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, the non-GAAP tax rate used to calculate Adjusted Net Income was approximately 29.2%. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the non-GAAP tax rate of 29.1% is a result of 29.2% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, 24.2% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, and for the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company used its previously estimated long-term cross-jurisdictional tax rate of 32%. Adjusted Net Income per diluted share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less payments for capital expenditures, including those financed through direct debt, but excluding acquisitions. The Free Cash Flow measure does not take into consideration certain other non-discretionary cash requirements such as mandatory principal payments on portions of the Company’s long-term debt. Management calculates certain GAAP as well as non-GAAP measures on a constant-currency basis using the average foreign currency exchange rates applicable in the corresponding period of the previous year and applying these rates to the measures in the current reporting period. Management uses GAAP as well as non-GAAP measures on a constant-currency basis to assess performance and eliminate the effect foreign currency exchange rates have on comparability between periods.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented herein should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities, or other income or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in tabular form at the end of this earnings release.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(In thousands, excluding share, per share amounts, and percentages) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % Change 2016 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Revenues: ATM operating revenues $ 346,181 17.5 % $ 294,656 $ 1,451,372 19.7 % $ 1,212,863 ATM product sales and other revenues 16,784 10.7 15,166 56,227 7.1 52,501 Total revenues 362,965 17.2 309,822 1,507,599 19.1 1,265,364 Cost of revenues: Cost of ATM operating revenues (excludes depreciation, accretion, and amortization of intangible assets reported separately below.) 222,123 18.4 187,680 951,670 23.9 768,200 Cost of ATM product sales and other revenues 12,779 6.4 12,014 47,450 3.4 45,887 Total cost of revenues 234,902 17.6 199,694 999,120 22.7 814,087 Operating expenses: Selling, general, and administrative expenses 42,686 11.5 38,277 174,237 13.3 153,782 Redomicile-related expenses — n/m 1,546 782 (94.3 ) 13,747 Restructuring expenses 2,111 n/m — 10,354 n/m — Acquisition and divestiture-related expenses 3,579 (21.8 ) 4,575 18,917 98.9 9,513 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment — n/m — 194,521 n/m — Depreciation and accretion expense 33,353 52.5 21,868 122,036 34.2 90,953 Amortization of intangible assets 12,443 43.1 8,693 57,866 57.2 36,822 Loss on disposal and impairment of assets 7,105 n/m 556 33,275 n/m 81 Total operating expenses 101,277 34.1 75,515 611,988 100.7 304,898 Income (loss) from operations 26,786 (22.6 ) 34,613 (103,509 ) n/m 146,379 Other expense: Interest expense, net 9,276 124.4 4,133 35,036 101.8 17,360 Amortization of deferred financing costs and note discount 3,257 12.6 2,893 12,574 9.1 11,529 Other expense 5,254 137.7 2,210 3,524 19.1 2,958 Total other expense 17,787 92.6 9,236 51,134 60.6 31,847 Income (loss) before income taxes 8,999 (64.5 ) 25,377 (154,643 ) n/m 114,532 Income tax (benefit) expense (6,957 ) n/m 418 (9,292 ) n/m 26,622 Effective tax rate (77.3 %) 1.6 % 6.0 % 23.2 % Net income (loss) 15,956 (36.1 ) 24,959 (145,351 ) n/m 87,910 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 2 (120.0 ) (10 ) (1 ) (98.8 ) (81 ) Net income (loss) attributable to controlling interests and available to common shareholders $ 15,954 (36.1 )% $ 24,969 $ (145,350 ) n/m % $ 87,991 Net income (loss) per common share – basic $ 0.35 $ 0.55 $ (3.19 ) $ 1.95 Net income (loss) per common share – diluted $ 0.35 $ 0.54 $ (3.19 ) $ 1.92 Weighted average shares outstanding – basic 45,685,325 45,292,386 45,619,679 45,206,119 Weighted average shares outstanding – diluted 46,193,914 45,935,367 45,619,679 45,821,527\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\n(In thousands) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (Unaudited) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 51,370 $ 73,534 Accounts and notes receivable, net 105,245 84,156 Inventory, net 14,283 12,527 Restricted cash 48,328 32,213 Prepaid expenses, deferred costs, and other current assets 96,106 67,107 Total current assets 315,332 269,537 Property and equipment, net 497,902 392,735 Intangible assets, net 209,862 121,230 Goodwill 774,939 533,075 Deferred tax asset, net 6,925 13,004 Prepaid expenses, deferred costs, and other noncurrent assets 57,756 35,115 Total assets $ 1,862,716 $ 1,364,696 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities: Current portion of other long-term liabilities $ 31,370 $ 28,237 Accounts payable and other accrued and current liabilities 351,180 285,583 Total current liabilities 382,550 313,820 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 917,721 502,539 Asset retirement obligations 59,920 45,086 Deferred tax liability, net 37,130 27,625 Other long-term liabilities 75,002 18,691 Total liabilities 1,472,323 907,761 Shareholders' equity 390,393 456,935 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 1,862,716 $ 1,364,696\nSELECTED BALANCE SHEET DETAIL: Long-term debt: December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (In thousands) (Unaudited) Revolving credit facility $ 122,461 $ 14,100 1.00% Convertible senior notes (1) 251,973 241,068 5.125% Senior notes (1) 248,038 247,371 5.50% Senior notes (1) 295,249 — Total long-term debt $ 917,721 $ 502,539 (1) The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 with a face value of $287.5 million are presented net of the unamortized discount and capitalized debt issuance costs of $35.5 million and $46.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
