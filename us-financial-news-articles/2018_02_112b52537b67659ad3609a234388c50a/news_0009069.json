Global Technologies and EMEA had strong growth of 9% and 5% respectively, and Americas, Entrance Systems and Asia Pacific all had good growth of 3-4%. Demand was positive for nearly all regions and business units, with strong demand for our electromechanical products and smart door locks. In EMEA we saw sales increase in all regions. All business units in Americas also showed growth – even Brazil. In Asia Pacific we had growth in Pacific, South Korea and Southern Asia, while sales in China were stable. Our digital and mobile solutions continue to be very successful on the market. We saw strong growth in Global Technologies for access control products and mobile keys for both hotels and companies. In Entrance Systems we had strong growth for door automation, industrial doors and high-speed doors, among others.\nDuring the quarter our leadership in smart door locks was confirmed by our collaboration with Amazon, where they chose our Yale locks for their new investment in home deliveries. Collaboration in smart door locks was also initiated with Walmart and Google during the quarter, to start in 2018. I am confident that the majority of all private residences will be converted to smart door locks during the next decade. A gigantic market is opening up! Our acquisition during the third quarter of August Home, a leading supplier of smart door solutions for the residential market in the USA, was therefore of strategic importance.\nOur acquisition activity remained high during the fourth quarter with two acquisitions. We have signed a strategic contract to acquire Phoniro, a Swedish specialist in smart locks, personal alarms and access-control systems adapted to the care of the elderly – a growth segment that is rapidly being digitalized. We have also acquired Dale & Excel, which complements very well our market offer in the UK.\nOperating income for the quarter increased by 5%* and amounted to SEK 3,359 M with an operating margin of 16.7% (16.5*). The margin improved in EMEA, Global Technologies and Entrance Systems but was lower for Americas and for Asia Pacific.\nMy judgment is that the global economic trend has improved to some degree compared with last year. On most markets, especially in Europe, there is a positive trend, but on some markets, such as China and Brazil, demand remains weak. However, our strategy of expanding our market presence, even on the emerging markets, remains unchanged. We are also continuing our investments in new products, especially in the growth area of electromechanics.\nIn December Nico Delvaux was named as the new President and CEO of ASSA ABLOY AB. He began his employment with us on 3 February and during the next six weeks I will ensure a good handover to him before he takes over as CEO on 15 March. Nico is a strong and experienced leader of global businesses and I am confident that ASSA ABLOY's journey of profitable growth will continue under Nico's leadership.\nWith these comments I want to express my own thanks to all ASSA ABLOY's employees and to wish them and my successor Nico Delvaux a continuing successful journey\".\n* Excluding restructuring costs and the write-down in China in Q4 2016.\nASSA ABLOY is holding an analysts' meeting at 10.00 today at Operaterrassen in Stockholm, Sweden.\nThe analysts' meeting can also be followed on the Internet at www.assaabloy.com .
