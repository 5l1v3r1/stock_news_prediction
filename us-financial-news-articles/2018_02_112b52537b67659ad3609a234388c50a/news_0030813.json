It’s a great validation of everything Metallica has done over the last 35 years. At the same time, we feel like we’re in our prime with a lot of good years ahead of us.” \nPrevious winners of the Polar Music Prize include Yo-Yo Ma, Paul Simon, the Kronos Quartet, Patti Smith and Björk. \n\nFILE PHOTO: James Hetfield of Metallica performs at the Global Citizen Festival at Central Park in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 24, 2016.

The strength of the band’s uncompromising albums has helped millions of listeners to transform their sense of alienation into a superpower”, the committee said. \nFounded in 1981 by drummer Ulrich and guitarist and singer James Hetfield, is one of the most commercially successful rock acts in history, having sold 110 million albums worldwide. \nTwo prizes are given out each year, traditionally to one classical and one pop musician. The committee also rewarded the Afghanistan National Institute of Music and its founder Ahmad Sarmast. \nThe winners will receive their awards, including a check of 1 million Swedish crowns ($124,000), at a gala in Stockholm on June 14. \n($1 = 8.0395 Swedish crowns) \nReporting by Johan Sennero; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T16:41:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
