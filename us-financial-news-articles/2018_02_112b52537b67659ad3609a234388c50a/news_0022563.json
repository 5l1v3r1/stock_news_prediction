It’s due for a correction and looking for a reason, and I think it kind of found it with this,” he said. \nThe Dow .DJI plunged more than 1,000 points on Thursday. That represented a full market correction, defined as a 10 percent drop from the 52-week high. The S&P 500 <.SPX > dropped 3.7 percent to a new low for the week. \nThe declines followed a catalyst that, at first, seemed positive: U.S. wages increased at their largest annual pace in more than 8-1/2 years, data showed last Friday. \nBut rising wages could crimp corporate profits and push up inflationary pressures, forcing the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and tighten economic conditions faster than expected. \nThat possibility along with rising rates gave markets an excuse to pause a long run-up that pushed the S&P 500 up some 20 percent in 2017 and almost another 8 percent in the first 18 days of the new year alone. \nKeon cautioned that the withdrawal figures for the week were boosted by ETFs, which are often used by fast-trading institutional investors. \nStock ETF outflows were $21 billion, compared with modest mutual fund withdrawals of $3 billion, according to Lipper. By comparison, those mutual funds lost $236 billion for the week just from negative performance. CHICKENS ROOST \nStill, there were signs of excess. Just last month, U.S.-based domestic equity funds took in the most cash since July 2013. Two weeks ago, U.S. technology stock funds took in more cash than in any week since the turn-of-the-century dot.com bubble. Last week, five products that essentially bet on market calm by shorting the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX took in the most money ever. \nTechnology stock funds’ $1.1 billion outflow during the most recent week marked the largest withdrawals since September 2016. And short-volatility products sank so much on Monday that at least two are closing for good. \nNon-domestic stocks, including in emerging markets, and bonds were among safe havens chosen by investors. Financial sector funds, which are seen profiting from rising rates by boosting lending, took in $861 million. \nBonds attracted money overall despite their negative performance during the week. Treasury fund inflows of $2 billion were the largest since September, Lipper said, though high-yield junk fund outflows rose to $2.7 billion. Demand for those lower-quality bonds often moves in sympathy with equities. \nThe following is a breakdown of the flows for the week, including mutual funds and ETFs: \nSector Flow Chg % Assets Assets Count \n($blns) ($blns) \nAll Equity Funds -23.895 -0.33 6,807.397 12,167 \nDomestic Equities -28.004 -0.57 4,635.164 8,671 \nNon-Domestic Equities 4.109 0.18 2,172.232 3,496 \nAll Taxable Bond Funds 3.112 0.12 2,629.007 6,049 \nAll Money Market Funds 30.815 1.17 2,665.631 1,019 \nAll Municipal Bond Funds 0.675 0.17 401.881 1,472 Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Leslie Adler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T00:43:40.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
