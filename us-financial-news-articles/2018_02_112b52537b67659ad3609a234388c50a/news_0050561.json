Highlights include:\n2017 net production totaled 44.5 MMBoe, delivering 165% production growth from top tier Midland Basin assets and 47% operating margin growth per Boe 4Q16 to 4Q17 as the Company successfully continues its portfolio transition. 2017 year-end proved reserves increased to 468 MMBoe, adding 47% reserve growth on a retained asset basis, nearly tripling Midland Basin reserves and increasing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows by 2.5 times from $1.2B to $3.0B. 2018-2019 operating plan targets competitive growth in debt adjusted cash flow and aligns expected total capital spend with expected cash flow by mid-year 2019. Outstanding performance from new wells in Howard County ranks SM top Midland Basin operator by revenue per well and results in significant value creation on RockStar properties. New RockStar wells announced today include two Maverick pad wells with 30-day IP rates that each approximated 200 Boe/d per 1,000 lateral feet, continuing the Company's strong performance record.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Jay Ottoson comments: \"At this time last year we set forth an aggressive three-year plan to grow debt adjusted cash flow --our preferred measure of returns-- implementing a strategy that included driving value creation on our newly acquired Howard County assets through optimizing drilling and completion operations, generating margin expansion through a capital program focused on growth on our Midland Basin assets, and further coring up our portfolio to maximize the present value of assets and de-lever the balance sheet. 2017 was a highly successful year in meeting and exceeding our announced objectives, and I thank our SM team across the board for successful execution.\n\"We commence 2018 well positioned to continue this strategy and meet our planned growth trajectory. While 2017 was a transitional year for production and cash flow growth, 2018 and 2019 target substantial growth in cash flow along with a reduction in net debt:EBITDAX to approximately 2.5 times. This year we move into development mode on our RockStar assets. We have increased the rig count in the Midland Basin from four in early 2017 to nine currently, while continuing to demonstrate top tier efficiency metrics. I believe our operations are top tier as is our asset base, and we look forward to generating increased value for our shareholders in 2018 and beyond.\"\n\"Lastly, I want to congratulate Jennifer Martin Samuels on her well deserved promotion to Vice President - Investor Relations in recognition of her outstanding work in leading our investor relations efforts.\"\n2017 IN REVIEW\nYEAR-END 2017 PROVED RESERVES\nYear-end 2017 proved reserves of 468 MMBoe are calculated in accordance with SEC pricing at $51.34 per barrel of oil NYMEX, $3.00 per MMBtu of natural gas at Henry Hub, and $27.69 per barrel of NGLs at Mt. Belvieu. Year-end proved reserves were 34% oil, 20% NGLs and 46% natural gas. Proved reserves were 46% proved developed.\nAdjusting year-end 2016 reserves for divestitures, proved reserves increased 47% on a retained asset basis. Net proved reserve additions were 192 MMBoe, or 4.3 times production. Midland Basin proved reserves nearly tripled to 160 MMBoe.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of changes in the Company's proved reserves from year-end 2016 to year-end 2017 (numbers are rounded):\nProved reserves year-end 2016 (MMBoe)\n396\nDivestitures completed in 2017\n(76)\nProved reserves 2016 pro forma sold properties\n320\nProduction\n(44)\nReserve additions from drilling and performance\n182\nReserve additions through acquisition\n1\nReserve revisions net of price and 5-year rules\n9\nProved reserves year-end 2017 (MMBoe)\n468\nProved reserves at year-end include approximately 4.2 MMBoe associated with the announced agreement to sell certain Powder River Basin assets.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $3.0 billion at year-end 2017, up from $1.2 billion at year-end 2016. PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure, reconciled to the standardized measure, see Financial Highlights below) was up more than 2.5 times at $3.1 billion at year-end 2017, compared with $1.2 billion at year-end 2016.\nFOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS\nSee the Financial Highlights section below for production and per Boe detail, summary financial statements and non-GAAP reconciliations.\nProduction volumes for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were:\nPRODUCTION\nFourth Quarter 2017\nFull Year 2017\nOil (MMBbls)\n3.9\n13.7\nNatural gas (Bcf)\n26.0\n123.0\nNGLs (MMBbls)\n2.2\n10.3\nTotal MMBoe\n10.4\n44.5\nBy region:\nREGIONAL PRODUCTION\nFourth Quarter 2017\nFull Year 2017\nEagle Ford\n6.0\n29.5\nPermian Basin\n3.6\n11.0\nRocky Mountain\n0.8\n4.1\nTotal MMBoe\n10.4\n44.5\nAmounts may not calculate due to rounding Eagle Ford includes nominal other production from the region; full year includes non-operated Eagle Ford production prior to divestiture For purposes of 2017 presentation, retained assets include Powder River Basin assets expected to be sold in 2018\nProduction increased 2% and 8% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, compared with the prior year periods on a retained asset basis. Oil production increased 51% and 52% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, compared with the prior year periods on a retained asset basis. Production in the fourth quarter reflects strong 21% sequential growth in Permian Basin volumes, which was more than offset by lower sequential Eagle Ford volumes as a result of the previously announced joint venture as well as natural declines, as no new wells were completed in the Eagle Ford during the quarter.\nRealized prices (before and after the effect of derivative settlements) for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were:\nCOMMODITY PRICES\n4Q17\nPre/post Hedge\nFull Year 2017\nPre/post Hedge\nOil - $/Bbl\n53.32/48.90\n47.88/45.60\nNatural gas - $/Mcf\n3.09/4.03\n3.00/3.72\nNGLs - $/Bbl\n26.01/18.84\n22.35/18.91\nBoe - $/Boe\n32.95/32.16\n28.20/28.68\nPre-hedge realized prices of $32.95 per Boe and $28.20 per Boe for the two periods presented were up 27% and 32%, respectively, from the prior year periods demonstrating the revenue benefit from increasing the proportion of production from the oil-rich Midland Basin and improved benchmark commodity prices. Oil, natural gas and NGL revenue was up in 2017 versus 2016, despite a 20% decline in total production. Cash derivative settlements for NGLs were a loss of $15.8 million in the fourth quarter, as the benchmark NGL price jumped to a 13-quarter high.\nOperating costs for the fourth quarter and full year were:\nOPERATING COSTS $ PER BOE\nFourth Quarter 2017\nFull Year 2017\nTotal LOE, incl. ad valorem tax\n$\n5.43\n$\n4.77\nTransportation\n5.01\n5.48\nProduction tax\n1.41\n1.18\nGeneral and administrative\n3.38\n2.71\nTotal\n$\n15.23\n$\n14.14\nGeneral and administrative costs include $0.69 and $0.43 for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, for non-cash expenses.\nOverall, production costs are influenced by the commodity mix as oil production from the Midland Basin increases and natural gas and NGL production from the Eagle Ford decreases, relative to the total production mix. LOE costs increase because lifting costs are higher for oil, and transportation costs decrease because higher cost third party transportation contracts relate to Eagle Ford natural gas and NGLs. Each quarter of 2017, LOE costs trended higher partially offset by transportation costs that trended lower. Fourth quarter of 2017 LOE costs included road work required following the Texas storms.\nNET LOSS AND LOSS PER SHARE\nThe Company's GAAP net loss for 2017 was $26.3 million or $0.24 per diluted common share compared with 2016 net loss of $200.9 million, or $2.20 per diluted common share. For the full year 2017, net loss was $160.8 million, or $1.44 per diluted common share, compared with a net loss in 2016 of $757.7 million or $9.90 per diluted common share.\nThe operating margin (before the effects of derivative settlements) per Boe was up 71% in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting the portfolio transition to increased Midland Basin oil production, higher benchmark prices and a continued focus on controlling costs. The greater net loss in 2016 was predominantly driven by impairment and abandonment charges in 2016 totaling $435 million and higher depletion, depreciation and amortization charges. Fourth quarter and full year 2017 net loss includes a one-time tax benefit of $63.7 million (included in Income tax benefit) related to a reduction in deferred taxes as a result of the changed corporate income tax rate under US tax reform.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $144.8 million in 2017 and $515.4 million for the full year 2017.\nADJUSTED EBITDAX AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME\nAdjusted EBITDAX, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share are non-GAAP measures. Please reference the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the Financial Highlights section at the end of this release.\nThe Company's adjusted EBITDAX for 2017 was $174.0 million, compared with $186.2 million in the prior year period. For the full year 2017, adjusted EBITDAX was $664.7 million, compared with $790.8 million in the prior year.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDAX included an accrual of $5 million in other expense that was a non-recurring charge.\nThe Company's adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter was $8.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share, compared with adjusted net loss of $28.7 million, or $0.31 per diluted common share, in 2016. For the full year 2017, adjusted net loss was $91.2 million, or $0.82 per diluted common share, compared with adjusted net loss of $142.4 million or $1.86 per diluted common share in 2016.\nFourth quarter adjusted net loss removes the one-time tax benefit of $63.7 million and one-time charge of $5 million, each discussed above, as well as other items that are non-recurring or difficult to estimate.\nFINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY\nAt December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal balance on the Company's long-term debt was $2.8 billion in senior notes plus $172.5 million in senior convertible notes, with zero drawn on the Company's senior secured credit facility. The Company's undrawn credit facility plus cash on hand provided $1.2 billion in liquidity at December 31, 2017.\nCOSTS INCURRED AND TOTAL CAPITAL SPEND\nTotal capital spend discussed below is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as costs incurred less ARO, capitalized interest and acquisitions. See the Financial Highlights section below for the GAAP reconciliation.\nCosts incurred for 2017 were $1,040 million, which included $80.2 million of proved and unproved property acquisitions. Full year 2017 total capital spend was $936 million. Allocated by region, total capital spend was invested 78% in the Permian Basin, 18% in the Eagle Ford, and 4% in the Rocky Mountain region. Allocated by expenditure, total capital spend was invested 88% in development, 5% in infrastructure, 1% in leasehold and 6% in corporate and exploration costs.\nDuring 2017, the Company drilled 123 net wells, of which 98 were in the Permian Basin, 24 were in the Eagle Ford and 1 was in the Powder River Basin. During 2017, the Company completed 111 net wells, of which 73 were in the Permian Basin, 35 were in the Eagle Ford and 3 were in the Rocky Mountain area. During 2017, the Company added one rig and one completions crew to its Midland Basin program. Fourth quarter total capital spend was higher than forecast. A fourth Permian completions crew was added earlier than originally planned during the quarter, which enabled the Company to secure an experienced crew and increase the expected number of flowing completions for the first quarter of 2018. Total capital spend was also affected by acceleration of facilities to keep pace with completions. In addition, drilling and completion costs increased per well as a result of employing enhanced completion technologies and cost inflation, as cost escalators tied to oil prices in certain contracts began to take effect.\n2018 OPERATING PLAN AND GUIDANCE\nThe Company's objective is to deliver competitive long-term growth in debt adjusted cash flow. Over the next two years, it is the Company's goal to generate substantial growth in cash flow, end 2019 with net debt:EBITDAX approximating 2.5 times and exit 2019 positioned to deliver continued cash flow growth while keeping total capital spend aligned with cash flow. The Company's two-year strategy to meet these objectives includes:\ngenerating substantial growth in high-margin Permian production maintaining the Company's operational excellence and top tier capital efficiency continuing to demonstrate the value proposition of the RockStar acquisitions; and managing the balance sheet as measured by ample liquidity, declining net debt:EBITDAX and absolute debt reduction.\nKey assumptions in the Company's 2018 operating plan include:\nTotal capital spend of approximately $1.27 billion. Cost inflation for drilling and completions services per lateral foot of 10%-15% over average 2017 costs. Permian -- Expect to drill approximately 130 net wells and complete approximately 100 net wells. Eagle Ford -- Expect to drill approximately 17 net wells and complete approximately 25 net wells. The Company's JV counterparty is expected to pay the costs to complete 16 wells, which the Company expects will effectively fund a significant portion of the Company's leasehold development obligations in the Eagle Ford. Fewer net completions for the year are expected to result in lower Eagle Ford production in 2018 compared to 2017 run rate. Total capital spend is weighted to the first half of 2018 as the rig and completion crew count in the Midland Basin is expected to be reduced from 9 and 5, respectively, in the first quarter to 7 and 3, respectively, at year-end. Rocky Mountain -- Nominal capital allocation. Facilities - Approximately $130 million, of which more than one-half relates to building fresh and produced water infrastructure in the RockStar area (including associated land costs). This investment is expected to enable acceleration and control of needed facilities while significantly reducing future per well capital costs and operating expenses. Capitalized overhead/exploration - $70-75 million. Average commodity price projections: 2018 WTI oil $57.40 (1Q18 at $64.70 and remainder of 2018 at $55.00 flat), Henry Hub natural gas $3.00, and NGLs 50% of WTI. Asset divestiture timing: The PRB sale is expected to close at the end of the first quarter, and as a result, production volumes are removed starting April 2018, but there can be no assurance that this transaction will close on time or at all. Hedges: Based on the production guidance mid-point, the Company has hedges in place for approximately 75% of 2018 oil production and 65% of 2018 natural gas production. NGL production is hedged by product and includes ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance:\nTotal capital spend (before acquisitions) is a non-GAAP measure. The Company is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking, non-GAAP financial measure without unreasonable effort because acquisition costs are inherently unpredictable.\nTotal capital spend: ~$1.27 billion. Production: 42-46 MMBoe, with oil approximately 41% of the commodity mix. LOE: ~$5.00 per Boe average for the year, reflecting a higher proportion of oil in the commodity mix. It is expected that 1H18 will exceed the annual average and 2H18 to be below the annual average, as Permian costs are expected to be reduced with the planned completion of produced water handling systems. Transportation: ~$4.50 per Boe average for the year, expected to decline sequentially through the year as higher cost Eagle Ford production is a reduced proportion of the commodity mix. It is expected that 1H18 will exceed the annual average and 2H18 be below the annual average. Production taxes: ~$1.55 per Boe or 4.0-4.5% of pre-hedge revenue. Ad Valorem taxes: $0.55-0.65 per Boe G&A: $125-135 million, including approximately $20 million of non-cash compensation. Capitalized overhead/exploration: $70-75 million, before dry hole expense, all of which is included in capital expenditure guidance. DD&A: $13.00-15.00 per Boe.\nFirst quarter of 2018 Guidance:\nProduction of approximately 9.5-10.0 MMBoe, with oil production approaching 40% of commodity mix. Lower sequential production from 2017 is driven by declines in the Eagle Ford, where no new wells were completed in 2017, and declines in the Rocky Mountain region. Completion of approximately 18 net wells in the Midland Basin and 5 net wells in the Eagle Ford during the quarter. Total capital spend of approximately $350 million, which includes approximately $40 million allocated to facilities and land, which is largely associated with construction of RockStar fresh and produced water infrastructure.\nOFFICER APPOINTMENT\nOn February 16, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Jennifer Martin Samuels to Vice President - Investor Relations.\nUPCOMING EVENTS\nEARNINGS WEBCAST AND CALL\nAs previously announced, SM Energy is posting a pre-recorded discussion and presentation in conjunction with this earnings release.

before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depletion, depreciation, amortization and asset retirement obligation liability accretion expense, exploration expense, property abandonment and impairment expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, derivative gains and losses net of settlements, gains and losses on divestitures, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, and certain other items. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes certain items that we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally one-time in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that we present because we believe it provides useful additional information to investors and analysts, as a performance measure, for analysis of our ability to internally generate funds for exploration, development, acquisitions, and to service debt. We are also subject to financial covenants under our Credit Agreement based on adjusted EBITDAX ratios. In addition, adjusted EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by operating activities, or other profitability or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX amounts presented may not be comparable to similar metrics of other companies. Our credit facility provides a material source of liquidity for us. Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, if we failed to comply with the covenants that establish a maximum permitted ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted EBITDAX and a minimum permitted ratio of adjusted EBITDAX to interest, we would be in default, an event that would prevent us from borrowing under our credit facility and would therefore materially limit our sources of liquidity. In addition, if we are in default under our credit facility and are unable to obtain a waiver of that default from our lenders, lenders under that facility and under the indentures governing our outstanding Senior Notes and Senior Convertible Notes would be entitled to exercise all of their remedies for default.\n(2) Stock-based compensation expense is a component of exploration expense and general and administrative expense on the accompanying statements of operations. Therefore, the exploration line items shown in the reconciliation above will vary from the amount shown on the accompanying statements of operations for the component of stock-based compensation expense recorded to exploration expense.\nSM ENERGY COMPANY\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nDecember 31, 2017\nAdjusted Net Loss\nFor the Three Months\nEnded December 31,\nFor the Twelve Months\nEnded December 31,\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet loss (GAAP)\n$\n(26,258)\n$\n(200,946)\n$\n(160,843)\n$\n(757,744)\nNet derivative loss\n115,778\n129,547\n26,414\n250,633\nDerivative settlement gain (loss)\n(8,168)\n23,244\n21,234\n329,478\nNet (gain) loss on divestiture activity\n(537)\n(33,661)\n131,028\n(37,074)\nImpairment of proved properties\n—\n76,780\n3,806\n354,614\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties\n12,115\n74,450\n12,272\n80,367\nTermination fee on temporary second lien facility\n—\n—\n—\n10,000\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n35\n(15,722)\nOther, net (1)\n8,200\n(306)\n13,820\n(7,731)\nTax effect of adjustments (2)\n(45,987)\n(97,760)\n(75,308)\n(349,173)\nUS tax reform (3)\n(63,675)\n—\n(63,675)\n—\nAdjusted net loss (Non-GAAP) (4)\n$\n(8,532)\n$\n(28,652)\n$\n(91,217)\n$\n(142,352)\nDiluted net loss per common share (GAAP)\n$\n(0.24)\n$\n(2.20)\n$\n(1.44)\n$\n(9.90)\nNet derivative loss\n1.04\n1.42\n0.24\n3.27\nDerivative settlement gain (loss)\n(0.07)\n0.25\n0.19\n4.30\nNet gain (loss) on divestiture activity\n—\n(0.37)\n1.18\n(0.48)\nImpairment of proved properties\n—\n0.84\n0.03\n4.63\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties\n0.11\n0.81\n0.11\n1.05\nTermination fee on temporary second lien facility\n—\n—\n—\n0.13\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n—\n(0.21)\nOther, net (1)\n0.07\n(0.01)\n0.12\n(0.10)\nTax effect of adjustments (2)\n(0.42)\n(1.05)\n(0.68)\n(4.55)\nUS tax reform (3)\n(0.57)\n—\n(0.57)\n—\nAdjusted net loss per diluted common share (Non-GAAP) (4)\n$\n(0.08)\n$\n(0.31)\n$\n(0.82)\n$\n(1.86)\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding (GAAP)\n111,611\n91,440\n111,428\n76,568\n(1) For the three-month and twelve-month periods , the adjustment is related to impairment on materials inventory, pension settlement expense, the change in Net Profits Plan liability, bad debt expense, and an accrual for a non-recurring matter. For the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016, the adjustment relates to the change in Net Profits Plan liability, impairment of materials inventory, and an adjustment relating to claims on royalties on certain Federal and Indian leases. Pension settlement expense is included within exploration expenses and general and administrative expense on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Other noted items are included in other operating expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\n(2) For the three and twelve-month periods , adjustments are shown before tax effect which is calculated using a tax rate of 36.1%, which approximates the Company's statutory tax rate adjusted for ordinary permanent differences. For the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016, adjustments are shown before tax effect and are calculated using a tax rate of 36.2%, which approximates the Company's statutory tax rate adjusted for ordinary permanent differences.\n(3) US tax reform adjustment primarily relates to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act on December 22, 2017, which reduced the Company's federal tax rate for 2018 and future years from 35 percent to 21 percent.\n(4) Adjusted net loss excludes certain items that the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results. Items excluded generally are non-recurring items or are items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. These items include non-cash and other adjustments, such as derivative gains and losses net of settlements, impairments, net (gain) loss on divestiture activity, materials inventory loss, and gains or losses on extinguishment of debt. The non-GAAP measure of adjusted net income (loss) is presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors for analysis of SM Energy's fundamental business on a recurring basis. In addition, management believes that adjusted net income (loss) is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. Adjusted net income (loss) should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash provided by operating activities, or other income, profitability, cash flow, or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP. Since adjusted net income (loss) excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted net income (loss) amounts presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nRegional proved oil and gas reserve quantities:\nPermian\nEagle Ford (1)\nRocky\nMountain\nTotal\nYear-end 2017 proved reserves\nOil (MMBbl)\n117.5\n13.3\n27.4\n158.2\nGas (Bcf)\n252.8\n998.1\n29.2\n1,280.1\nNGL (MMBbl)\n0.2\n95.6\n0.7\n96.5\nTotal (MMBOE)\n159.9\n275.2\n33.0\n468.1\n% Proved developed\n34%\n52%\n53%\n46%\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding\n(1) Includes nominal amounts outside of the Eagle Ford.\nSM ENERGY COMPANY\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nDecember 31, 2017\nTotal Capital Spend Reconciliation:\n(in millions)\nReconciliation of costs incurred in oil & gas activities (GAAP) to total capital spend (Non-GAAP) (1)(3)\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nCosts incurred in oil and gas activities (GAAP):\n$\n1,040.0\nAsset retirement obligations\n(12.1)\nCapitalized interest\n(12.6)\nProved property acquisitions (2)\n(1.6)\nUnproved property acquisitions\n(78.6)\nOther\n1.3\nTotal capital spend (Non-GAAP):\n$\n936.4\n(1) The non-GAAP measure of total capital spend is presented because management believes it provides useful information to investors for analysis of SM Energy's fundamental business on a recurring basis.
