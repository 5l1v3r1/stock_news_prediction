Zuma denies all wrongdoing.\n“It’s all systems go. We are expecting our political programme to be delivered by the new president,” parliamentary speaker Baleka Mbete told state broadcaster SABC from Cape Town, where the state of the nation address will be made from around 1700 GMT.\nRamaphosa, who will see out the remainder of Zuma’s presidential term until elections next year, faces an uphill battle to win public and investor support.\nAfrica’s most developed economy needs faster economic growth if it is to reduce high unemployment - currently at 27 percent - and alleviate widespread poverty that has persisted since the end of white minority rule in 1994.\nThe economy slipped into recession last year for the first time since 2009 and has also declined in indices that measure corruption and the ease of doing business.\nFinancial markets have rallied since Ramaphosa took over from Zuma as ANC leader in December, as investors warmed to his pledges to straighten out the country’s struggling state-owned enterprises and woo overseas investment.\nSouth Africa’s rand extended recent gains early on Friday.\nRamaphosa, a former union leader who played an important role in talks to end apartheid, is expected to announce major cabinet changes in the coming days to replace Zuma acolytes in key portfolios who have been accused of mismanagement and implicated in corruption.\nOrdinary South Africans are hopeful that he will deliver on promises to create more jobs.\nReporting by Alexander Winning; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T11:10:46.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
