The timescale will be worked out at a series of industry briefings, a Lloyd’s spokesman said. \nInsurance staff traditionally carry their documentation around the 14-storey Lloyd’s building in the City of London in briefcases - or slipcases. \nOnly 10 percent of Lloyd’s business is currently processed through the market’s electronic placement platform, which launched in Sept 2016, the spokesman said. \nIn addition to administrative costs, Lloyd’s is grappling with the impact of last year’s record levels of insurance losses from natural disasters. \nIt is also setting up a subsidiary in Brussels following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. \nLloyd‘s, which started life in Edward Lloyd’s coffee house in 1688, takes on a wide range of insurance risks, from natural catastrophes to highly specialised business such as footballers’ legs.
