And Coindesk notes that the domain was originally registered in 2015 in Panama, but changed hands in early January. The project also promotes an affiliate rewards structure for people who help create interest in the days before the ICO, which some liken to a pyramid scheme. \n“To promote Bitcoiin B2G, a depositor who chooses to participate in one of our accredited Mining Programs will earn commissions off their recruits’ earnings,” the company said in a press release . “Bitcoiin B2G is offering a 4-level commission structure, available to whoever joins the program and/or purchases Bitcoiin B2G during the ICO period.” \nIt’s hard to say which is a more questionable decision, investing in Bitcoiin2gen or renting Seagal’s Contract to Kill (a 2016 film that has a metacritic score of 3). Either way, you might be better off spending time and money elsewhere.
