We can only emphasise we are not Carillion, we are not Capita, there are all kinds of things that set us apart.” \n“We are not running payrolls, cutting grass or looking after buildings, we are running critical infrastructure,” he told Reuters. \nBabcock said its short-term pipeline of bids remained strong, and 80 percent of expected orders were already in place for the year to March 2019, meaning it could keep its profit guidance with confidence. \n“We’ve increased margins, and we are heading for another really good year,” Bethel said. \nBabcock said it now expected revenue for the year to March 2018 of 5.3-5.4 billion ($7.4-$7.6 billion), compared with analysts’ average forecast of 5.41 billion pounds. \n“We have indicated that revenues will be slightly lower than forecast but that’s really due to timing issues, we do have a lumpy business and that happens, but none of it is due to cancellations, it’s due to timings,” Bethel said. \nHe said a major marine project with Britain’s defence ministry and BAE ( BAES.L ) to provide support to aircraft carriers had been slightly slower and more complex to get started, but was now underway. \nAlthough Babcock is much less dependent on discretional spending than peers such as Capita and Serco ( SRP.L ), its shares have been hit by the uncertainty in the outsourcing sector and concerns about a squeeze on defence-related spending. \nBethel said he saw “no serious prospect” of less British defence spending, but was not expecting a boost either.
