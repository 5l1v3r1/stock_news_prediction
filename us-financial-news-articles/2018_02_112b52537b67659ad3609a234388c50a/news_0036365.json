We kind of stopped playing after 30 minutes. We can’t do that in the tournament,” Kovalchuk said.\nNorway’s loss came a day after they had notched their first Olympic hockey victory since 1994, when they hosted the games in Lillehammer.\nIce Hockey - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's Quarterfinal Match - Olympic Athletes from Russia v Norway - Gangneung Hockey Centre, Gangneung, South Korea - February 21, 2018 - Ivan Telegin, an Olympic Athlete from Russia (2nd from L, obscured), celebrates his third period goal with teammates and fans. REUTERS/David W. Cerny The Russians broke through about midway through the first period. Coming through center ice, Ilya Kablukov bounced it forward off the left boards to Mikhail Grigorenko who was entering the Norwegian zone and he fired a quick wrist shot into the far side upper corner, beating Lars Haugen on his glove side.\nNikita Gusev made it 2-0 later in the period when he jammed in a bouncing rebound after Haugen had stopped a couple of hard Russian shots. Vyacheslav Voinov rounded out the first-period scoring with under a minute remaining, beating Haugen with a snap shot to the stick side.\nSlideshow (6 Images) Norway got onto the score sheet in the second period. From behind the Russian goal, Mathis Olimb fed Alexander Bonsaksen out near the blue line. Bonsaksen, the hero from Tuesday’s overtime win for Norway over Slovenia, stopped the puck with his right skate, got it to his stick and snapped a shot past goaltender Vasili Koschechkin.\nSergie Kalinin answered right back for the Russians. With Bonsaksen sent off for high sticking, Kalinin took a feed in the crease from Ilya Kovalchuk and forced it into the Norwegian net.\nBonsaksen’s rough luck then continued when Nikita Nesterov snapped a puck across the front of the Norwegian goal and would have gone wide, but it struck Bonsaksen’s skate and ricocheted into the net behind his own goalkeeper.\nIn the third, Ivan Telegin made it 6-1.\nThe Russians and Czechs play on Friday to determine who advances to Sunday’s gold medal game, the final event of the Pyeongchang Games.\nReporting By Dan Burns; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T13:07:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
