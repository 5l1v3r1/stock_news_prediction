On a pre-tax basis, these items include a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of $93.4 million, a $27.0 million reduction to RINs costs as a result of our Woods Cross refinery's small refinery exemption and HollyFrontier's pro-rata share of Holly Energy Partners' remeasurement gain on pipeline acquisitions of $21.4 million, slightly offset by $4.4 million of integration costs related to our Petro-Canada Lubricants Inc. (“PCLI”) acquisition. Additionally, the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 reduced income taxes by approximately $307.0 million.\nExcluding these items, net income for the current quarter was $124.6 million ($0.70 per diluted share) compared to a net loss of ($10.0) million (($0.06) per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2016, which excludes an inventory valuation adjustment and PCLI pre-acquisition costs that collectively increased net income by $63.2 million. Adjusted for these items, net income for the quarter increased $134.6 million compared to the same period of 2016 driven by both higher sales volumes and refining margins combined with earnings attributable to our recently acquired PCLI operations. For the current quarter, crude oil charges averaged 461,110 barrels per day (“BPD”) compared to 432,070 BPD for the fourth quarter of 2016. On a per barrel basis, consolidated refinery gross margin was $12.54 per produced barrel sold, an 85% increase compared to $6.77 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $349.8 million compared to $258.7 million for the fourth quarter of last year and include $64.0 million in costs attributable to our PCLI operations.\nHollyFrontier’s President & CEO, George Damiris, commented, “In comparison to last year, HollyFrontier's significant financial improvement for the fourth quarter reflects both better refinery operations and the improved macroeconomic environment. Additionally, Lubricants and Specialty Products had a strong fourth quarter led by the Rack Forward Business. We are excited about 2018 based on our improving refinery reliability, our positive outlook for both product cracks and crude spreads, as well as the growth potential of converting a higher percentage of base oil sales into finished products.\"\nFor , net cash provided by operations totaled $166.0 million. During the period, we declared and paid a dividend of $0.33 per share to shareholders totaling $59.0 million. At December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $630.8 million and our consolidated debt was $2.5 billion. Our debt, exclusive of Holly Energy Partners' debt which is nonrecourse to HollyFrontier, was $991.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company has scheduled a webcast conference call for today, February 21, 2018, at 8:30 AM Eastern Time to discuss fourth quarter financial results. This webcast may be accessed at: https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1177986&tp_key=757b7364b3 . An audio archive of this webcast will be available using the above noted link through March 7, 2018.\nHollyFrontier Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer that produces high-value light products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and other specialty products.

decision maker manages and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, our Tulsa refineries' lubricants operations, previously reported in the Refining segment, are now combined with the operations of our Petro-Canada lubricants business (acquired February 1, 2017) and reported in the Lubricants and Specialty Products segment. Our prior period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation.\nOur operations are organized into three reportable segments, Refining, Lubricants and Specialty Products and HEP. Our operations that are not included in the Refining, Lubricants and Specialty Products and HEP segments are included in Corporate and Other. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements and are included in Eliminations. Corporate and Other and Eliminations are aggregated and presented under Corporate, Other and Eliminations column. The Refining segment includes the operations of our El Dorado, Tulsa, Navajo, Cheyenne and Woods Cross refineries and HFC Asphalt (aggregated as a reportable segment). Refining activities involve the purchase and refining of crude oil and wholesale and branded marketing of refined products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel. These petroleum products are primarily marketed in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. HFC Asphalt operates various terminals in Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma.\nThe Lubricants and Specialty Products segment involves PCLI's production operations, located in Mississauga, Ontario, that include lubricant products such as base oils, white oils, specialty products and finished lubricants and the operations of our Petro-Canada business that includes the marketing of products to both retail and wholesale outlets through a global sales network with locations in Canada, the United States, Europe and China. Additionally, the Lubricants and Specialty Products segment includes specialty lubricant products produced at our Tulsa Refineries that are marketed throughout North America and are distributed in Central and South America.\nThe HEP segment involves all of the operations of HEP, a consolidated variable interest entity, which owns and operates logistics assets consisting of petroleum product and crude oil pipelines, terminals, tankage, loading rack facilities and refinery process units in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. At December 31, 2017, the HEP segment also includes a 75% interest in UNEV Pipeline (an HEP consolidated subsidiary), and a 50% ownership interest in each of the Osage Pipeline and Cheyenne Pipeline. Revenues from the HEP segment are earned through transactions with unaffiliated parties for pipeline transportation, rental and terminalling operations as well as revenues relating to pipeline transportation services provided for our refining operations. Due to certain basis differences, our reported amounts for the HEP segment may not agree to amounts reported in HEP's periodic public filings.\nLubricants\nCorporate, and Specialty\nOther and Consolidated Refining Products HEP Eliminations Total (In thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Sales and other revenues: Revenues from external customers $ 3,546,444 $ 415,693 $ 29,399 $ 1,169 $ 3,992,705 Intersegment revenues 70,262 — 99,822 (170,084 ) — $ 3,616,706 $ 415,693 $ 129,221 $ (168,915 ) $ 3,992,705 Cost of products sold (exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment) $ 3,059,588 $ 275,003 $ — $ (149,919 ) $ 3,184,672 Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment $ (92,114 ) $ (1,248 ) $ — $ — $ (93,362 ) Operating expenses $ 264,820 $ 67,666 $ 35,021 $ (17,710 ) $ 349,797 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 31,608 $ 33,659 $ 5,451 $ 9,497 $ 80,215 Depreciation and amortization $ 70,500 $ 11,324 $ 21,145 $ 2,762 $ 105,731 Income (loss) from operations $ 282,304 $ 29,289 $ 67,604 $ (13,545 ) $ 365,652 Earnings of equity method investments $ — $ — $ 1,545 $ — $ 1,545 Capital expenditures $ 46,295 $ 10,691 $ 14,135 $ 8,021 $ 79,142 Lubricants\nCorporate, and Specialty\nOther and Consolidated Refining Products HEP Eliminations Total (In thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Sales and other revenues Revenues from external customers $ 2,823,701 $ 112,685 $ 18,833 $ (151 ) $ 2,955,068 Intersegment revenues 74,317 — 93,693 (168,010 ) — $ 2,898,018 $ 112,685 $ 112,526 $ (168,161 ) $ 2,955,068 Cost of products sold (exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment) $ 2,608,746 $ 89,087 $ — $ (147,061 ) $ 2,550,772 Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment $ (96,436 ) $ (1,220 ) $ — $ — $ (97,656 ) Operating expenses $ 239,869 $ 3,229 $ 34,819 $ (19,229 ) $ 258,688 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 25,045 $ 786 $ 3,914 $ 7,633 $ 37,378 Depreciation and amortization $ 71,745 $ 228 $ 18,841 $ 2,780 $ 93,594 Income (loss) from operations $ 49,049 $ 20,575 $ 54,952 $ (12,284 ) $ 112,292 Earnings of equity method investments $ — $ — $ 4,058 $ — $ 4,058 Capital expenditures $ 77,722 $ 638 $ 11,480 $ 2,473 $ 92,313 Year Ended December 31, 2017\nSales and other revenues Revenues from external customers $ 12,579,672 $ 1,594,036 $ 77,225 $ 366 $ 14,251,299 Intersegment revenues 338,390 — 377,137 (715,527 ) — $ 12,918,062 $ 1,594,036 $ 454,362 $ (715,161 ) $ 14,251,299 Cost of products sold (exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment) $ 11,009,345 $ 1,093,984 $ — $ (635,530 ) $ 11,467,799 Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment $ (107,479 ) $ (1,206 ) $ — $ — $ (108,685 ) Operating expenses $ 1,006,675 $ 222,461 $ 137,605 $ (72,507 ) $ 1,294,234 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 103,067 $ 105,112 $ 14,323 $ 42,372 $ 264,874 Depreciation and amortization $ 289,434 $ 31,894 $ 77,660 $ 10,949 $ 409,937 Goodwill and asset impairment $ 19,247 $ — $ — $ — $ 19,247 Income (loss) from operations $ 597,773 $ 141,791 $ 224,774 $ (60,445 ) $ 903,893 Earnings of equity method investments $ — $ — $ 12,510 $ — $ 12,510 Capital expenditures $ 176,533 $ 31,464 $ 44,810 $ 19,452 $ 272,259 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Sales and other revenues Revenues from external customers $ 10,002,831 $ 464,359 $ 68,927 $ (417 ) $ 10,535,700 Intersegment revenues 317,884 — 333,116 (651,000 ) — $ 10,320,715 $ 464,359 $ 402,043 $ (651,417 ) $ 10,535,700 Cost of products sold (exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment) $ 9,003,505 $ 377,136 $ — $ (614,714 ) $ 8,765,927 Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment $ (287,848 ) $ (4,090 ) $ — $ — $ (291,938 ) Operating expenses $ 909,724 $ 13,867 $ 123,984 $ (28,736 ) $ 1,018,839 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 92,297 $ 2,899 $ 12,532 $ 17,920 $ 125,648 Depreciation and amortization $ 281,701 $ 620 $ 68,811 $ 11,895 $ 363,027 Goodwill and asset impairment $ 654,084 $ — $ — $ — $ 654,084 Income (loss) from operations $ (332,748 ) $ 73,927 $ 196,716 $ (37,782 ) $ (99,887 ) Earnings of equity method investments $ — $ — $ 14,213 $ — $ 14,213 Capital expenditures $ 357,407 $ 5,708 $ 107,595 $ 9,080 $ 479,790 December 31, 2017 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities $ 7,488 $ 41,756 $ 7,776 $ 573,737 $ 630,757 Total assets $ 6,474,666 $ 1,610,472 $ 2,191,984 $ 415,032 $ 10,692,154 Long-term debt $ — $ — $ 1,507,308 $ 991,685 $ 2,498,993 December 31, 2016 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities $ 49 $ — $ 3,657 $ 1,131,021 $ 1,134,727 Total assets $ 6,048,091 $ 465,715 $ 1,920,487 $ 1,001,368 $ 9,435,661 Long-term debt $ — $ — $ 1,243,912 $ 991,225 $ 2,235,137 Refining Segment Operating Data\nThe following tables set forth information, including non-GAAP performance measures about our refinery operations. Refinery gross and net operating margins do not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments and depreciation and amortization. Reconciliations to amounts reported under GAAP are provided under “Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” below.\nDuring , we revised the following refining segment operating data computations: refinery gross margin; net operating margin; and operating expenses to better align with similar measurements provided by other companies in our industry and to facilitate comparison of our refining performance relative to our peers. Effective with this change, these measurements are now inclusive of all refining segment activities including HFC asphalt operations and revenues and costs related to products purchased for resale and excess crude oil sales. All prior period data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current presentation.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Mid-Continent Region (El Dorado and Tulsa Refineries)\nCrude charge (BPD) (1) 270,180 272,520 261,380 262,170 Refinery throughput (BPD) (2) 289,050 289,990 277,940 280,920 Sales of produced refined products (BPD) (3) 277,560 285,800 260,800 262,300 Refinery utilization (4) 103.9 % 104.8 % 100.5 % 100.8 % Average per produced barrel sold (5) Refinery gross margin (6) $ 11.42 $ 6.04 $ 9.91 $ 7.44 Refinery operating expenses (7) 5.09 4.27 5.15 4.73 Net operating margin $ 6.33 $ 1.77 $ 4.76 $ 2.71 Refinery operating expenses per throughput barrel (8) $ 4.89 $ 4.21 $ 4.83 $ 4.42 Feedstocks: Sweet crude oil 59 % 59 % 61 % 58 % Sour crude oil 19 % 19 % 17 % 18 % Heavy sour crude oil 16 % 16 % 16 % 17 % Other feedstocks and blends 6 % 6 % 6 % 7 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Sales of produced refined products: Gasolines 53 % 52 % 50 % 50 % Diesel fuels 32 % 31 % 33 % 33 % Jet fuels 7 % 8 % 7 % 7 % Fuel oil 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Asphalt 2 % 2 % 3 % 3 % Base oils 3 % 4 % 4 % 4 % LPG and other 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Three Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Southwest Region (Navajo Refinery) Crude charge (BPD) (1) 110,980 92,450 100,040 98,090 Refinery throughput (BPD) (2) 121,400 100,720 109,280 107,690 Sales of produced refined products (BPD) (3) 122,710 105,180 111,630 111,390 Refinery utilization (4) 111.0 % 92.5 % 100 % 98.1 % Average per produced barrel sold (5) Refinery gross margin (6) $ 12.91 $ 9.14 $ 12.40 $ 9.49 Refinery operating expenses (7) 4.71 5.35 5.20 5.05 Net operating margin $ 8.20 $ 3.79 $ 7.20 $ 4.44 Refinery operating expenses per throughput barrel (8) $ 4.76 $ 5.59 $ 5.31 $ 5.23 Feedstocks: Sweet crude oil 31 % 25 % 25 % 28 % Sour crude oil 61 % 67 % 66 % 63 % Other feedstocks and blends 8 % 8 % 9 % 9 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Sales of produced refined products: Gasolines 51 % 52 % 51 % 52 % Diesel fuels 40 % 38 % 39 % 39 % Fuel oil 3 % 4 % 3 % 3 % Asphalt 3 % 3 % 4 % 3 % LPG and other 3 % 3 % 3 % 3 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Rocky Mountain Region (Cheyenne and Woods Cross Refineries) Crude charge (BPD) (1) 79,950 67,100 77,380 63,650 Refinery throughput (BPD) (2) 87,000 75,930 84,790 68,870 Sales of produced refined products (BPD) (3) 82,590 73,190 79,840 66,950 Refinery utilization (4) 82.4 % 69.2 % 79.8 % 65.6 % Average per produced barrel sold (5) Refinery gross margin (6) $ 15.77 $ 6.22 $ 15.78 $ 8.80 Refinery operating expenses (7) 10.75 11.27 10.46 10.17 Net operating margin $ 5.02 $ (5.05 ) $ 5.32 $ (1.37 ) Refinery operating expenses per throughput barrel (8) $ 10.20 $ 10.86 $ 9.85 $ 9.89 Feedstocks: Sweet crude oil 35 % 37 % 34 % 39 % Heavy sour crude oil 34 % 32 % 35 % 35 % Black wax crude oil 23 % 19 % 22 % 18 % Other feedstocks and blends 8 % 12 % 9 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Sales of produced refined products: Gasolines 59 % 60 % 58 % 59 % Diesel fuels 30 % 30 % 32 % 32 % Fuel oil 3 % 3 % 3 % 2 % Asphalt 4 % 5 % 4 % 4 % LPG and other 4 % 2 % 3 % 3 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Three Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Consolidated Crude charge (BPD) (1) 461,110 432,070 438,800 423,910 Refinery throughput (BPD) (2) 497,450 466,640 472,010 457,480 Sales of produced refined products (BPD) (3) 482,860 464,160 452,270 440,640 Refinery utilization (4) 100.9 % 94.5 % 96.0 % 92.8 % Average per produced barrel sold (5) Refinery gross margin (6) $ 12.54 $ 6.77 $ 11.56 $ 8.16 Refinery operating expenses (7) 5.96 5.62 6.10 5.64 Net operating margin $ 6.58 $ 1.15 $ 5.46 $ 2.52 Refinery operating expenses per throughput barrel (8) $ 5.79 $ 5.59 $ 5.84 $ 5.43 Feedstocks: Sweet crude oil 48 % 48 % 48 % 48 % Sour crude oil 26 % 26 % 25 % 26 % Heavy sour crude oil 15 % 16 % 16 % 16 % Black wax crude oil 4 % 3 % 4 % 3 % Other feedstocks and blends 7 % 7 % 7 % 7 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Consolidated Sales of produced refined products: Gasolines 53 % 54 % 52 % 52 % Diesel fuels 34 % 32 % 34 % 34 % Jet fuels 4 % 5 % 4 % 4 % Fuel oil 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % Asphalt 3 % 3 % 4 % 3 % Base oils 2 % 2 % 2 % 3 % LPG and other 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Crude charge represents the barrels per day of crude oil processed at our refineries.

Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\nReconciliations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA excluding special items (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in financial statements.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as EBITDA, is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders plus (i) interest expense, net of interest income, (ii) income tax provision, and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus or minus (i) lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments (ii) incremental cost of products sold attributable to our PCLI inventory value step-up (iii) PCLI acquisition and integration costs (iv) goodwill and asset impairment charges (v) our RINs cost reduction related to our Cheyenne and Woods Cross Refinery small refinery exemptions (vi) net gain on foreign currency swaps and (vii) HollyFrontier's pro-rata share of HEP's remeasurement gain on pipeline interest acquisitions.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculations provided for under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; however, the amounts included in these calculations are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as alternatives to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These are presented here because they are widely used financial indicators used by investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for financial covenants.\nSet forth below is our calculation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders $ 521,082 $ 53,165 $ 805,395 $ (260,453 ) Add (subtract) income tax provision (benefit) (185,972 ) 12,952 (12,379 ) 19,411 Add interest expense (1) 32,063 26,304 129,822 80,910 Subtract interest income (1,667 ) (1,111 ) (3,736 ) (2,491 ) Add depreciation and amortization 105,731 93,594 409,937 363,027 EBITDA $ 471,237 $ 184,904 $ 1,329,039 $ 200,404 Subtract lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment (93,362 ) (97,656 ) (108,685 ) (291,938 ) Add PCLI acquisition and integration costs 4,436 13,406 27,942 13,406 Add goodwill and asset impairment — — 19,247 654,084 Add incremental cost of products sold attributable to PCLI inventory value step-up — — 15,327 — Subtract RINs cost reduction (27,000 ) — (57,456 ) — Subtract HollyFrontier's pro-rata share of HEP's remeasurement gain on pipeline interest acquisitions (21,390 ) — (21,390 ) — Subtract gain on foreign currency swaps — — (24,545 ) — Adjusted EBITDA $ 333,921 $ 100,654 $ 1,179,479 $ 575,956 (1) Includes loss on early extinguishment of debt of $12.2 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nReconciliations of refinery operating information (non-GAAP performance measures) to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements.\nRefinery gross margin and net operating margin are non-GAAP performance measures that are used by our management and others to compare our refining performance to that of other companies in our industry. We believe these margin measures are helpful to investors in evaluating our refining performance on a relative and absolute basis. Refinery gross margin per produced barrel sold is total refining segment revenues less total refining segment cost of products sold, exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments, divided by sales volumes of produced refined products sold. Net operating margin per barrel sold is the difference between refinery gross margin and refinery operating expenses per produced barrel sold. These two margins do not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments or depreciation and amortization. Each of these component performance measures can be reconciled directly to our consolidated statements of income. Other companies in our industry may not calculate these performance measures in the same manner.\nBelow are reconciliations to our consolidated statements of income for refinery net operating and gross margin and operating expenses, in each case averaged per produced barrel sold. Due to rounding of reported numbers, some amounts may not calculate exactly.\nReconciliation of average refining segment net operating margin per produced barrel sold to refinery gross margin to total sales and other revenues\nThree Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands, except per barrel amounts) Consolidated Net operating margin per produced barrel sold $ 6.58 $ 1.15 $ 5.46 $ 2.52 Add average refinery operating expenses per produced barrel sold 5.96 5.62 6.10 5.64 Refinery gross margin per produced barrel sold 12.54 6.77 11.56 8.16 Times produced barrels sold (BPD) 482,860 464,160 452,270 440,640 Times number of days in period 92 92 365 366 Refining segment gross margin 557,066 289,097 1,908,308 1,315,998 Add rounding 52 175 409 1,212 Total refining segment gross margin 557,118 289,272 1,908,717 1,317,210 Add refining segment cost of products sold 3,059,588 2,608,746 11,009,345 9,003,505 Refining segment sales and other revenues 3,616,706 2,898,018 12,918,062 10,320,715 Add lubricants and specialty products segment sales and other revenues 415,693 112,685 1,594,036 464,359 Add HEP segment sales and other revenues 129,221 112,526 454,362 402,043 Subtract corporate, other and eliminations (168,915 ) (168,161 ) (715,161 ) (651,417 ) Sales and other revenues $ 3,992,705 $ 2,955,068 $ 14,251,299 $ 10,535,700 Reconciliation of average refining segment operating expenses per produced barrel sold to total operating expenses\nThree Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands, except per barrel amounts) Consolidated Average operating expenses per produced barrel sold $ 5.96 $ 5.62 $ 6.10 $ 5.64 Times barrels of produced products sold (BPD) 482,860 464,160 452,270 440,640 Times number of days in period 92 92 365 366 Refining segment operating expenses 264,762 239,989 1,006,979 909,587 Add (subtract) rounding 58 (120 ) (304 ) 137 Total refining segment operating expenses 264,820 239,869 1,006,675 909,724 Add lubricants and specialty products segment operating expenses 67,666 3,229 222,461 13,867 Add HEP segment operating expenses 35,021 34,819 137,605 123,984 Subtract corporate, other and eliminations (17,710 ) (19,229 ) (72,507 ) (28,736 ) Operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 349,797 $ 258,688 $ 1,294,234 $ 1,018,839 Reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders to adjusted net income attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders\nAdjusted net income attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments, PCLI acquisition and integration costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, incremental costs of products sold due to PCLI inventory value step-up, RINs cost reductions, remeasurement gain on HEP's pipeline interest acquisitions and gain of foreign currency swaps.
