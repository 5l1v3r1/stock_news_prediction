Ending January 2018 with home closings up 61% year-over-year, we believe we are poised to see continued growth in 2018 and believe we are well positioned to increase our revenues, community count and earnings per share, allowing LGI Homes to achieve our long-term goals and objectives of market leading returns for our stockholders. For the year, we expect to close between 6,000 and 7,000 homes and believe basic EPS will be in the range of $6.00 to $7.00 per share,” Lipar concluded.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Results\nHome closings during the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 61.9% to 1,844 from 1,139 during the fourth quarter of 2016. Active selling communities increased to 78 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 63 communities at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.\nHome sales revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $405.0 million, an increase of $168.1 million, or 71.0% over the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in home sales revenues is due to both the increase in the number of homes closed and an increase in the average home sales price.\nThe average home sales price was $219,618 for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 5.6% over the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is largely attributable to changes in product mix, price points in new markets, and a favorable pricing environment.\nGross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 24.4% as compared to 27.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) as a percentage of home sales revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 25.8% as compared to 28.5% for the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease is primarily due to a combination of increased home production and higher construction and lot costs partially offset by higher average home sales prices. Please see “Non-GAAP Measures” for a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) to gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure.\nNet income of $35.6 million, or $1.65 per basic share and $1.43 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $12.4 million, or 53.6%, from $23.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to the 61.9% increase in homes closed, the 5.6% increase in average home sales price, and operating leverage realized related to selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n2017 Full Year Results\nHome closings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased 40.4% to 5,845 from 4,163 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nHome sales revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased 50.1% to $1.3 billion compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in home sales revenues is primarily due to the increase in the number of homes closed and an increase in the average home sales price.\nThe average home sales price was $215,220 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $13,846, or 6.9%, over the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This increase is largely attributable to changes in product mix, higher price points in certain new markets, and a favorable pricing environment.\nGross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 25.5% as compared to 26.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) as a percentage of home sales revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 26.9% as compared to 27.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily due to a combination of higher construction costs and lot costs partially offset by higher average home sales price, and to a lesser extent due to 201 wholesale home closings during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Please see “Non-GAAP Measures” for a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) to gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure.\nNet income of $113.3 million, or $5.24 per basic share and $4.73 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $38.3 million, or 51.0%, from $75.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to the 40.4% increase in homes closed, a higher average sales price and improved operating leverage realized in 2017 related to selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nOutlook\nSubject to the caveats in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this press release, the Company offers the following guidance for 2018. The Company believes it will have between 85 and 90 active selling communities at the end of 2018, close between 6,000 and 7,000 homes in 2018, and generate basic EPS between $6.00 and $7.00 per share during 2018. In addition, the Company believes 2018 gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues will be in the range of 24.0% and 26.0% and 2018 adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) as a percentage of home sales revenues will be in the range of 25.5% and 27.5% with capitalized interest accounting for substantially all of the difference between gross margin and adjusted gross margin. The Company also believes that the average home sales price in 2018 will be between $220,000 and $230,000. This outlook assumes that general economic conditions, including interest rates and mortgage availability, in the remainder of 2018 are similar to those in the first quarter of 2018 and that average home sales price, construction costs, availability of land, land development costs and overall absorption rates for 2018 are consistent with the Company’s recent experience.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call via live webcast for investors and other interested parties beginning at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 (the “Earnings Call”).

The Company defines adjusted gross margin as gross margin less capitalized interest and adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in the cost of sales. Management believes this information is useful because it isolates the impact that capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments have on gross margin. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments, which have real economic effects and could impact the Company’s results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of the Company’s operating performance may be limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate adjusted gross margin information in the same manner that the Company does. Accordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of the Company’s performance.\nThe following table reconciles adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the GAAP financial measure that management believes to be most directly comparable (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Home sales revenues $ 404,975 $ 236,830 $ 1,257,960 $ 838,320 Cost of sales 306,298 172,502 937,540 616,707 Gross margin 98,677 64,328 320,420 221,613 Capitalized interest charged to cost of sales 5,852 3,249 17,400 10,680 Purchase accounting adjustments (a) 20 31 246 485 Adjusted gross margin $ 104,549 $ 67,608 $ 338,066 $ 232,778 Gross margin % (b) 24.4 % 27.2 % 25.5 % 26.4 % Adjusted gross margin % (b) 25.8 % 28.5 % 26.9 % 27.8 % (a) Adjustments result from the application of purchase accounting for acquisitions and represent the amount of the fair value step-up adjustments included in cost of sales for real estate inventory sold after the acquisition dates.\n(b) Calculated as a percentage of home sales revenues.\nHome Sales Revenues and Closings by Division (Revenues in thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Revenues Closings ASP Revenues Closings ASP Central $ 161,897 789 $ 205,193 $ 120,180 595 $ 201,983 Southwest 80,651 307 262,707 46,645 192 242,943 Southeast 49,757 263 189,190 28,342 157 180,522 Florida 70,388 358 196,615 34,364 173 198,636 Northwest 41,475 124 334,476 7,299 22 331,773 Midwest 807 3 269,000 — — — Total home sales revenue $ 404,975 1,844 $ 219,618 $ 236,830 1,139 $ 207,928\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Revenues Closings ASP Revenues Closings ASP Central $ 532,447 2,613 $ 203,768 $ 429,505 2,143 $ 200,422 Southwest 243,037 942 258,001 165,017 737 223,904 Southeast 183,422 973 188,512 111,651 635 175,828 Florida 199,733 1,014 196,975 115,276 595 193,741 Northwest 98,514 300 328,380 16,871 53 318,321 Midwest 807 3 269,000 — — — Total home sales revenue $ 1,257,960 5,845 $ 215,220 $ 838,320 4,163 $ 201,374 CONTACT:\nInvestor Relations:\nCaitlin Stiles, (281) 210-2619\nInvestorRelations@LGIHomes.com\nSource: LGI Homes\nSource:LGI Homes, Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T17:33:01.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
