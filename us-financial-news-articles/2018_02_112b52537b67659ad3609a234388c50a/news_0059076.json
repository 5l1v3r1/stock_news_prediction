(\"Theravance Biopharma\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: TBPH) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. Revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 was $4.5 million and $15.4 million, respectively. Full year operating loss was $260.1 million or $211.0 million excluding share-based compensation expense, in line with the Company's previously stated financial guidance. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $390.2 million as of December 31, 2017.\nRick E Winningham, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"2018 will be an important year for the Company, as we intensify our focus on our strategic priorities, drive clinical execution, and advance programs from our validated research platform towards clinical development. With Trelegy Ellipta launched in the US and multiple strategic partners secured to complement our internal efforts, we are well positioned to execute on the most important opportunities in our portfolio, including optimizing development of our intestinally restricted JAK inhibitor, TD-1473, with Janssen Biotech; advancing our drug for neurogenic orthostatic hypertension, TD-9855, towards a registrational program; launching our nebulized LAMA revefenacin, if approved, with our partner Mylan; and progressing a new program – an inhaled JAK inhibitor for serious respiratory disease – into the clinic.\"\nAnticipated Near-Term Milestones and Events\nTD-1473 (intestinally restricted pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor): Initiations of Phase 2b/3 induction and maintenance study in ulcerative colitis and Phase 2 induction study in Crohn's disease in second half of 2018 TD-9855 (norepinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitor (NSRI)): Data from exploratory Phase 2a study in patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) at the end of the first half of 2018 Revefenacin (TD-4208, nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)): Potential regulatory approval in the US for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of November 13, 2018 Progression of inhaled JAK inhibitor, the next program from our research platform aimed at discovering localized medicines that target diseased tissues without systemic exposure, into first-in-human studies in late 2018 or early 2019 Trelegy Ellipta (Company entitled to approximately 5.5% to 8.5% of worldwide net sales): Potential label expansion in COPD to include IMPACT study data and completion of Phase 3 CAPTAIN study in asthma patients, both expected in 2018 1\nProgram Updates\nRecently announced global collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen) to jointly develop and commercialize TD-1473 in inflammatory intestinal diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Theravance Biopharma eligible to receive up to $1 billion in potential payments, including $100 million upfront payment received in February 2018 following execution of the agreement; additionally, companies sharing profits and expenses in the US, and Theravance Biopharma would receive double-digit tiered royalties on ex-US sales Recently announced acceptance by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of New Drug Application (NDA) for revefenacin for the treatment of COPD and PDUFA target action date of November 13, 2018 Completed Phase 3b study of revefenacin, designed to assess nebulized revefenacin versus handheld tiotropium via Handihaler ® in improving lung function in COPD patients with suboptimal peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR) Primary endpoint of improvement in lung function in COPD patients with suboptimal PIFR, as measured by trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) after 4 weeks of treatment While numerical improvements for revefenacin over tiotropium were not statistically significant for the primary endpoint, the study provided important insights for the use of the product (if approved) in patients with COPD In the pre-specified subgroup of severe and very severe (GOLD 3/4) COPD patients (representing approximately 80% of the patients in the study), revefenacin demonstrated nominally statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in FEV1 versus tiotropium Revefenacin was generally well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified Study conducted to support commercialization and is not required for FDA approval Expect to provide an update in the first half of 2018 regarding dialogue with US and EU regulators on Phase 3 requirements for velusetrag (TD-5108; 5-HT4 agonist) program in gastroparesis Alfasigma S.p.A. evaluating option under existing collaboration agreement to further develop and potentially commercialize velusetrag in the EU (and certain other markets); opt-in by Alfasigma would result in $10 million payment to the Company and right to receive certain future milestones and royalties Phase 3 bacteremia study of VIBATIV ® (telavancin) discontinued following recent interim analysis conducted by independent review committee and company-wide review of investment priorities Committee concluded the study is underpowered and therefore unlikely to achieve the primary study objective without a significant increase in study size beyond the planned enrollment of 250 patients In light of incremental investment required, Company is closing the study No new safety issues identified; all currently enrolled patients allowed to complete dosing Data generated from study to be shared with regulators and submitted for future scientific publication Trelegy Ellipta launched by GSK in November 2017 1 Commercial and Medicare Part D coverage at several top national payers secured since early January 2018 1 Landmark IMPACT data submitted to FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) to support expanded label for Trelegy Ellipta 1\nNotes:\n1 As reported by Glaxo Group Limited or one of its affiliates (GSK); Economic interest related to Trelegy Ellipta (the combination of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol) entitles Company to upward tiering payments equal to approximately 5.5% to 8.5% on worldwide net sales of the product\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results\nRevenue\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.5 million, primarily related to US net product sales of VIBATIV ® of $4.1 million. This represents a decrease of $1.2 million over the same period in 2016, largely due to the impact of generic competition. Full year 2017 revenue was $15.4 million, comprised primarily of US net product sales of VIBATIV ® of $14.3 million.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses\nR&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $51.1 million representing an increase of $9.0 million compared to the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, share-based compensation, and other expenses of $14.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in external costs of $5.3 million. Full year R&D expenses were $173.9 million, or $151.2 million excluding share-based compensation.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses\nSG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $29.5 million, representing an increase of $9.2 million compared to the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily due to higher expenses related to employee-related costs and share-based compensation. Full year SG&A expenses were $95.6 million, or $69.1 million excluding shared-based compensation expense.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $390.2 million as of December 31, 2017. This amount excludes the $100 million upfront payment received in February 2018, from the recently announced global collaboration with Janssen.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe Company anticipates full year 2018 operating loss, excluding share-based compensation, will be in the range of $180.0 to $200.0 million. The actual amount could be above or below this forecast as a result of a variety of factors impacting our business, including the amount of revenue recognized in 2018 related to the global collaboration agreement with Janssen (currently expected to be less than $25 million), the timing and cost of clinical studies associated with our key programs, and net product sales of VIBATIV ® . Operating loss, excluding share-based compensation does not include potential royalties for Trelegy Ellipta.\nConference Call Today at 5:00 pm ET\nTheravance Biopharma will hold a conference call today at 5:00 pm ET.

(\"Theravance Biopharma\") is a diversified biopharmaceutical company with the core purpose of creating medicines that help improve the lives of patients suffering from serious illness.\nIn our relentless pursuit of this objective, we strive to apply insight and innovation at each stage of our business, including research, development and commercialization, and utilize both internal capabilities and those of partners around the world. Our research efforts are focused in the areas of inflammation and immunology. Our research goal is to design localized medicines that target diseased tissues, without systemic exposure, in order to maximize patient benefit and minimize risk. These efforts leverage years of experience in developing localized medicines for the lungs to treat respiratory disease. The first potential medicine to emerge from our research focus on immunology and localized treatments is an oral, intestinally restricted pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, currently in development to treat a range of inflammatory intestinal diseases. Our pipeline of internally discovered product candidates will continue to evolve with the goal of creating transformational medicines to address the significant needs of patients.\nIn addition, we have an economic interest in future payments that may be made by Glaxo Group or one of its affiliates (GSK) pursuant to its agreements with Innoviva, Inc. relating to certain programs, including Trelegy Ellipta.\nFor more information, please visit www.theravance.com .\nTHERAVANCE ® , the Cross/Star logo, and VIBATIV ® are registered trademarks of the Theravance Biopharma group of companies.
