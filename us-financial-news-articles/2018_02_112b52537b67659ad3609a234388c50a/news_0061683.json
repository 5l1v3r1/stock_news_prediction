Prior year results have not been restated for the change in the reporting calendar.\nFull Year and Fourth Quarter 2017 Results:\nFull year net income was $227 million, compared to $137 million in 2016, an increase of 65 percent. Fully diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") was $8.18, compared to $4.83 in 2016, an increase of 69 percent. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $108 million, or $3.95 fully diluted EPS. Full year adjusted net income was $160 million, compared to $134 million in 2016, an increase of 19 percent. Adjusted fully diluted EPS was $5.78 compared to $4.73 in 2016, an increase of 22 percent. Adjusted net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $43 million, or $1.56 adjusted fully diluted EPS. Full year adjusted EBITDA totaled $280 million, an increase of $19 million, or 7 percent, year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $66 million. Total full year company contract sales were $803 million, an increase of $79 million, or 11 percent, compared to the prior year. Contract sales in the company's key North America segment were $729 million, an increase of $83 million, or 13 percent, compared to the prior year. The company estimates Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria (the \"2017 Hurricanes\") negatively impacted contract sales by approximately $20 million in 2017. Excluding that impact, total company and North America contract sales would have increased 14 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Total company and North America contract sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $201 million and $181 million, respectively. The company estimates the 2017 Hurricanes negatively impacted contract sales by approximately $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusting for that impact, as well as the impact of the change in the company's financial reporting calendar, total company and North America contract sales would have increased 9 percent and 11 percent, respectively, compared to the prior year period. Full year North America VPG totaled $3,565, a 3 percent increase from 2016. Tours increased 12 percent year-over-year. North America VPG in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $3,518. The company generated net cash provided by operating activities of $142 million and adjusted free cash flow of $253 million, nearly $30 million above the high end of the company's previous guidance range. During 2017, the company returned $126 million to its shareholders through the repurchase of 0.8 million shares for $88 million and $38 million in dividends paid. The company recorded a benefit in its provision for income taxes of $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The company entered into a capital efficient arrangement with a third party to purchase an operating property located in San Francisco, California that the company expects to re-brand as a Marriott Vacation Club Pulse property in 2019. In February 2018, the company amended certain agreements with Marriott International. The company expects these amendments to provide immediate annualized financial benefits of $3 million resulting from a reduced annual royalty fee plus $15 million to $17 million of benefits from increased annual co-marketing funds associated with Marriott International's new credit card arrangements and reduced costs of Marriott Rewards points under the company's existing agreements with Marriott International from planned system-wide reductions in the rates Marriott International charges its loyalty program partners. Finally, the amendments provide for significantly expanded marketing opportunities with Marriott International. Effective January 1, 2018, the company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\"), which supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance.\nNon-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted fully diluted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow, and adjusted development margin are reconciled and adjustments are shown and described in further detail on pages A-1 through A-17 of the Financial Schedules that follow.\n\"I am very pleased with how we closed out 2017, with contract sales and adjusted EBITDA in line with our previous guidance, and adjusted free cash flow of $253 million,\" said Stephen P. Weisz, president and chief executive officer. \"I am even more excited about what lies ahead for Marriott Vacations Worldwide as we continue to expand our portfolio of resorts. We are also very optimistic about recent enhancements to some of our agreements with Marriott International, which expanded our great partnership with Marriott and provide immediate benefits to our financial results and significantly enhanced rights to expand our call transfer, digital marketing, and linkage arrangements with Marriott. We expect that these expanded opportunities will provide significant contributions to our growth going forward.\"\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nOn December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $409 million. Since the beginning of the year, real estate inventory balances increased by $3 million to $712 million, including $379 million of finished goods, $2 million of work-in-progress, and $330 million of land and infrastructure. The company had $1,095 million in debt outstanding, net of unamortized debt issue costs, at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of $358 million from year-end 2016, consisting primarily of $835 million of debt related to our securitized notes receivable and $193 million of convertible notes.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the company had approximately $245 million in available capacity under its revolving credit facility after taking into account outstanding letters of credit, and approximately $151 million of gross vacation ownership notes receivable eligible for securitization under its warehouse credit facility.\nFiscal Year Change\nThe table below shows the number of days for each reporting period in 2017 and 2016:\n2017\n2016\nFirst Quarter\n91 days\n84 days\nSecond Quarter\n91 days\n84 days\nThird Quarter\n92 days\n84 days\nFourth Quarter\n92 days\n112 days\nFull Year\n366 days\n364 days\nImpact of Amended Agreements with Marriott International\nIn February 2018, the company and Marriott International amended several of the agreements governing their ongoing relationship, including the agreements relating to the company's license arrangements with Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company and its participation in the Marriott Rewards program. The company agreed to a limited exception to its exclusive rights with respect to access to the Marriott Rewards program and member lists and Marriott International's reservation system and marriott.com website in exchange for the following:\n$3 million reduction in its annual royalty fee; $15 million to $17 million of benefits from increased annual co-marketing funds associated with Marriott International's new credit card arrangements and reduced costs of Marriott Rewards points under the company's existing agreements with Marriott International resulting from planned system-wide reductions in the rates Marriott International charges its loyalty program partners; the exclusive right to market the company's products (e.g., linkage opportunities) at 14 full service Marriott International and former Starwood hotel brands, subject to a limited exception for the St. Regis, Westin, and Sheraton brands; the exclusive right to be the timeshare partner for call transfer activities for all Marriott and, beginning in the second quarter of 2018, all former Starwood reservation call centers, as well as an extension of the term of our long-term call transfer arrangement with the potential for further extension; the exclusive right to be the timeshare partner for certain digital marketing programs with respect to Marriott International's digital lodging platforms, including marriott.com ; the ability to market to Marriott International's combined loyalty program members upon consolidation of the Marriott and Starwood loyalty programs.\nImpact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, includes a number of complex provisions, which the company is currently reviewing. However, the company expects future earnings to be positively impacted largely due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This rate reduction had a significant impact on the company's income taxes for 2017, including an estimated $65 million one-time impact from the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new lower rate.\nImpact of Accounting Changes\nThe company adopted ASC 606, on a retrospective basis, at the beginning of 2018. The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity shall recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also contains significant new disclosure requirements regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.\nFollowing the adoption of ASC 606, recognition of revenue from the sale of vacation ownership products that is deemed collectible will be deferred from the point in time at which the statutory rescission period expires to closing, when control of the vacation ownership product is transferred to the customer. In addition, the company will align its assessment of collectibility of the transaction price for sales of vacation ownership products with its credit granting policies. The company has elected the practical expedient to expense all marketing and sales costs as they are incurred. Its consolidated cost reimbursements revenues and cost reimbursements expenses will increase significantly, as all costs reimbursed to it by property owners' associations will be reported on a gross basis. In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, the company will also reclassify certain revenues and expenses.\nSummary Estimated Financial Impact of the Adoption of ASC 606 on 2017 Financial Results\n$ in millions, except per share amounts\n2017\nAs Reported\nAdjustments\n2017\nAs Adjusted\nNet income\n$227\n$9\n$235\nFully diluted EPS\n$8.18\n$0.31\n$8.49\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$142\n-\n$142\nAdjusted net income\n$160\n$9\n$169\nAdjusted fully diluted EPS\n$5.78\n$0.31\n$6.09\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$280\n$14\n$294\nAdjusted free cash flow\n$253\n-\n$253\nContract sales growth\n11%\n-\n11%\nSummary Estimated Financial Impact of the Adoption of ASC 606, amendments to certain agreements with Marriott International, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (included in the company's 2018 Outlook below)\n$ in millions, except per share amounts\nASC 606 Adjustments\nAmended Agreements\nand Other Changes in\nMarriott International\nArrangements\nTax Cuts and\nJobs Act of 2017 1\nNet income\n($4)\nto\n($3)\n$9\nto\n$10\n$29\nto\n$32\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$—\nto\n$—\n$9\nto\n$10\n$47\nto\n$51\nAdjusted net income\n($4)\nto\n($3)\n$9\nto\n$10\n$29\nto\n$32\nAdjusted EBITDA\n($5)\nto\n($4)\n$11\nto\n$12\n$—\nto\n$—\nAdjusted free cash flow\n$—\nto\n$—\n$9\nto\n$10\n$47\nto\n$51\n1 While a portion of the benefit to net cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow in 2018 from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will be realized after 2018, roughly half of the total 2018 benefit relates to the timing of taking advantage of certain tax credits.\n2018 Outlook\nPages A-1 through A-17 of the Financial Schedules reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures set forth below to the following full year 2018 expected GAAP results:\nNet income\n$182 million\nto\n$193 million\nFully diluted EPS\n$6.61\nto\n$7.01\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$180 million\nto\n$205 million\nAdjusted net income\n$184 million\nto\n$195 million\nAdjusted fully diluted EPS\n$6.69\nto\n$7.09\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$310 million\nto\n$325 million\nAdjusted free cash flow\n$185 million\nto\n$215 million\nContract sales growth\n7%\nto\n12%\nFourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call\nThe company will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. ET today to discuss these results and the guidance for full year 2018.

The certain items adjustments for the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliations exclude depreciation and income taxes on certain items included in the Adjusted Net Income reconciliations.\nA-14\nMARRIOTT VACATIONS WORLDWIDE CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn our press release and schedules, and on the related conference call, we report certain financial measures that are not prescribed by United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). We discuss our reasons for reporting these non-GAAP financial measures below, and the financial schedules reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to each non-GAAP financial measure that we report (identified by a double asterisk (\"**\") on the preceding pages). Although we evaluate and present these non-GAAP financial measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues, net income, earnings per share or any other comparable operating measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated and / or presented differently than measures with the same or similar names that are reported by other companies, and as a result, the non-GAAP financial measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others.\nAdjusted Net Income\nWe evaluate non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Development Margin, that exclude certain items in the quarters and fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 30, 2016, because these non-GAAP financial measures allow for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before the impact of these items. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our comparison of results from our on-going core operations before these items with results from other vacation ownership companies.\nCertain items - Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017\nIn our Statement of Income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $7.1 million of net pre-tax items, which included $2.9 million of variable compensation expense related to the impact of the 2017 Hurricanes, $2.0 million of litigation settlement expenses, $1.3 million of acquisition costs, $1.2 million of variable compensation expense related to the impact of Hurricane Matthew, a $0.4 million reduction of the previously recorded charge at several of our properties, primarily in Florida and the Caribbean, that were impacted by the 2017 Hurricanes, and $0.1 million of miscellaneous losses and other expense.\nIn our Statement of Income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $6.8 million of net pre-tax items, which included $8.7 million in net insurance proceeds related to the settlement of business interruption insurance claims arising from Hurricane Matthew, $6.5 million of variable compensation expense related to the impact of the 2017 Hurricanes, $4.2 million of litigation settlement expenses, $1.8 million of acquisition costs, a charge of $1.3 million associated with the estimated property damage insurance deductibles and impairment of property and equipment at several of our resorts, primarily in Florida and the Caribbean, that were impacted by the 2017 Hurricanes, $1.2 million of variable compensation expense related to the impact of Hurricane Matthew and $0.4 million of miscellaneous losses and other expense.\nCertain items - Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended December 30, 2016\nIn our Statement of Income for the quarter ended December 30, 2016, we recorded $1.5 million of net pre-tax items, which included $1.4 million of Hurricane Matthew related expenses, $0.2 million of acquisition costs, and $0.1 million of gains and other income not associated with our on-going core operations.\nIn our Statement of Income for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2016, we recorded $5.0 million of net pre-tax items, which included $11.2 million of gains and other income not associated with our on-going core operations, $4.9 million of acquisition costs, $1.4 million of Hurricane Matthew related expenses, $0.2 million of losses (including $0.5 million of depreciation) from the operations of the property we acquired in Australia in 2015 that we sold in the second quarter of 2016, and a $0.3 million reversal of litigation settlement expense.\nAdjusted Development Margin (Adjusted Sale of Vacation Ownership Products Net of Expenses)\nWe evaluate Adjusted Development Margin (Adjusted Sale of Vacation Ownership Products Net of Expenses) as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted Development Margin adjusts Sale of vacation ownership products revenues for the impact of revenue reportability, includes corresponding adjustments to Cost of vacation ownership products expense and Marketing and sales expense associated with the change in revenues from the Sale of vacation ownership products, and may include adjustments for certain items as itemized in the discussion of Adjusted Net Income above. We evaluate Adjusted Development Margin because it allows for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before the impact of revenue reportability and certain items to our Development Margin.\nA-15\nMARRIOTT VACATIONS WORLDWIDE CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nEarnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as earnings, or net income, before interest expense (excluding consumer financing interest expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization. For purposes of our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations, we do not adjust for consumer financing interest expense because the associated debt is secured by vacation ownership notes receivable that have been sold to bankruptcy remote special purpose entities and is generally non-recourse to us. Further, we consider consumer financing interest expense to be an operating expense of our business. We consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be indicators of operating performance, which we use to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business. We also use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, because these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also exclude depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. Adjusted EBITDA reflects additional adjustments for certain items, as itemized in the discussion of Adjusted Net Income above, and excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense to address considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use share-based payment awards differently, both in the type and quantity of awards granted. Prior period presentation has been recast for consistency. We evaluate Adjusted EBITDA as an indicator of operating performance because it allows for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before the impact of the excluded items. Together, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate our comparison of results from our on-going core operations before the impact of these items with results from other vacation ownership companies.\nFree Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nWe evaluate Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow as liquidity measures that provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash provided by operating activities after capital expenditures for property and equipment, changes in restricted cash, and the borrowing and repayment activity related to our securitizations, which cash can be used for strategic opportunities, including acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which reflects additional adjustments to Free Cash Flow for the impact of organizational and separation related, litigation, and other cash charges, allows for period-over-period comparisons of the cash generated by our business before the impact of these items.
