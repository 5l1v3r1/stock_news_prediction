Worse, clubroot spores make themselves at home in the soil for up to 20 years, unlike most crop diseases that damage harvests for a single season.\nAnother challenge is canola farmers themselves, who have rapidly spread clubroot by planting record canola crops for the last two years. The best way to avoid the disease is for farmers to give fields at least a two-year break between canola sowings. But with canola consistently delivering much higher profits than wheat, many are unable to resist.\nFarmer Bill Craddock acknowledged he plants canola with only a one-year break in Manitoba, where clubroot first appeared in 2013.\n“We don’t really want to back off,” he said. “There’s just more money in canola.”\nThe crop - Canada’s most profitable - provides big earnings for the seed firms, too. Canola accounts for one-third of Monsanto’s total annual Canadian revenue, said spokeswoman Trish Jordan, who declined to specify the amount.\n“Companies are very mindful of it because the consequences are huge,” said David Dzisiak, DowDuPont’s North America commercial leader in grains and oils. “If farmers can’t grow their most profitable crop, we can’t sell it.”\nDuPont Pioneer Canada, a unit of DowDuPont, has the largest market share of Canadian clubroot-resistant seeds, according to Monsanto. DowDuPont, which declined to confirm its market position, may add to its lead on the others as it broadly launches a new clubroot-resistant seed this year after introducing it last year on a small scale.\nMonsanto hopes to have a new disease-resistant canola seed on the market in two to four years. Bayer expects to have a variety in two to five years.\nBut all firms face uncertainty because the clubroot pathogen adapts rapidly and not all pathotypes have been identified, said Marcus Weidler, vice-president of seeds operations at Bayer Crop Science.\n“Sooner or later, the pathogen will find a way around it,” Weidler said.\n“WILD” RUTABAGA CROSSBREEDS\nYellow-flowering canola, called rapeseed in other countries, is grown and exported in Canada more than anywhere else. Canola seeds are crushed by Cargill Inc [CARG.UL], Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd and Louis Dreyfus Corp for vegetable oil used, for instance, in French fries, potato chips and granola bars produced by McDonald’s Corp, PepsiCo Inc and General Mills.\nClubroot first hit Western Canada’s canola in 2003 but dates back centuries in Europe. It has now been found on all agriculture-producing continents, often in vegetable farms, but it has rarely affected crops as widely planted as canola in Canada.\nIt remains a “seriously increasing problem” in Europe, especially in rapeseed-intensive areas of northern Germany and Sweden, said Elke Diederichsen, a biologist at Free University Berlin.\nDeveloping clubroot-resistant seeds takes many years because it requires painstaking crossbreeding with plant relatives such as rutabaga, cabbage or turnip. Resistant genes do not exist naturally within the canola plants.\n“The first generations of a canola-by-rutabaga cross will look pretty wild,” said Jed Christianson, trait lead at Monsanto’s Winnipeg office, where some 30 breeders and technicians are involved in the search for clubroot solutions.\nClad in lab coats, masks, goggles and gloves, they work on rows of hundreds of canola plants, ranging from petri dishes of tiny floating embryos to tall stalks topped with yellow blossoms.\nMonsanto’s early results in breeding canola and rutabaga produced misshapen or oversized leaves, and main roots that ranged in width from a finger to a fist.\nResearch technicians working on the development of clubroot-resistant canola bag plants to control pollen at Monsanto Canada's plant breeding centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada February 12, 2018.

The strategy allows Monsanto to take advantage of northern and southern hemispheres to grow plants year-round and speed the process.\nMonsanto released its first clubroot-resistant seed in 2009, but just three years later, the disease showed up in those fields, too - sending Monsanto and rival firms scrambling for new solutions.\n“That’s a very short period of time,” Christianson said. “It was a bit alarming.”\nLIKE ‘CANCER’\nThe long-term damage to fields makes fighting clubroot all the more urgent, said Igor Falak, senior research scientist at DuPont Pioneer Canada.\n“If you don’t have resistance, you can’t grow canola at all in some areas,” Falak\nSlideshow (10 Images) Each gram of dirt in an infected field can host 100 million clubroot spores, which spread by wind, water, farm machinery - even a farmer’s boots.\n“It’s a lot like being told you have cancer,” said Alberta farmer John Guelly. “You feel helpless, and you’re not sure what you can do.”\nClubroot infected Guelly’s crops and forced him to plant less profitable wheat and barley for the next two years and adopt ongoing two-year breaks in canola plantings.\nFarmers, seed companies and industry groups told Reuters the disease is spreading fast, but the data to quantify the damage is incomplete.\nIn Alberta, the second-biggest canola-producing province, clubroot damage has been confirmed in 2,744 fields, or about 50 percent more than three years ago, according to University of Alberta.\nMost of those fields span about 160 acres, said Stephen Strelkov, an agriculture professor at the university. That much land would translate to about 439,000 acres that now have limited canola-growing potential, representing 6 percent of Alberta’s total canola cropland last year.\nBut many more fields may go undetected, in part because clubroot carries a stigma. Some farmers hesitate to report its spread for fear that land values will fall or out of embarrassment, Guelly said.\nMany farmers also resist steps that might slow the spread of clubroot because it presents unusual economic dilemmas.\nIn Saskatchewan, the biggest canola-growing province, where clubroot first appeared in 2008, canola is expected to net farmers this year double or triple the return per acre of spring wheat, according to a provincial government forecast.\nIn addition, farmers who gamble on back-to-back canola sowings - rather than letting fields recover - may still initially reap good harvests until clubroot spreads enough to substantially lower yields.\nClubroot produces swellings on canola’s roots, choking them of nutrients and stunting growth of the plant’s valuable seeds, but the disease does not affect the quality of canola oil and meal.\nThe seriousness of the disease has prompted some Alberta municipalities to ban canola plantings in certain infected fields for three years. The goal is to prevent farmers from making decisions that make economic sense in the short-term but cause lasting damage to the industry at large.\n“If we aren’t putting in restrictions, they’ll keep planting canola and putting everyone else at risk,” said Aaron Van Beers, agriculture foreman for Leduc County south of Edmonton.\nWeidler, from Bayer, agreed the problem demands a broad strategy.\n“We need a lot more research,” he said. “We need an effort from the whole industry to keep this under control.”\nReporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Editing by Brian Thevenot\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T08:21:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
