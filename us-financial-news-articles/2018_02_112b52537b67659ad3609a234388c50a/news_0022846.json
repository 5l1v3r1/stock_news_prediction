Maldivian opposition leaders have urged New Delhi to intervene in the crisis.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Paul Tait & Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:29:44.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
