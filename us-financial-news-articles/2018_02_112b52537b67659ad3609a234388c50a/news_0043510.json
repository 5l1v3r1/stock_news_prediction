They were freed early Monday. There was no word on injuries.\nThe incident was the latest in a string of deadly uprisings in Brazil’s prisons, which experience endemic violence and are under the de facto control of powerful drug gangs.\nRights groups call prison conditions medieval, with food scarce and cells often so packed that inmates have no space to lie down.\nEarlier on Sunday, Rio state authorities said they would make changes to increase prison security, although details were not disclosed. The changes are part of the federal government’s intervention in Rio state’s security system.\nOn Friday, President Michel Temer ordered the military to take control of Rio state’s police force and its prisons, a decree that Congress must approve, which it is expected to do this week.\nReporting by Pedro Fonseca in Rio de Janeiro; Writing by Brad Brooks in Sao Paulo; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T15:08:41.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
