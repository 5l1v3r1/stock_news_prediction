We want to remain in energy, mainly the conventional energy where we have strong know-how,” Svoboda said.\nTykac has been active in Czech energy markets for more than a decade and is one of the richest business executive in the central European country.\n“We believe the end of conventional (energy) sources is unavoidable. But it will be slower than how the politicians have planned it,” he told newspaper Hospodarske Noviny.
