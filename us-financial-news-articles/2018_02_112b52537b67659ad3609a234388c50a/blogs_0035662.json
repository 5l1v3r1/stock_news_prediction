This is the first time the company has publicly demonstrated its SpotMini robot opening a door.\nMany reactions on both social media and among media outlets combine awe with dark humor characterized by discomfort or anxiety. More than a few are alluding to science fiction stories, particularly the \"Metalhead\" episode of the BBC show Black Mirror, a show comprised of vignettes that depict haunting worlds shaped by familiar technologies. \nBoston Dynamics was not available for comment.\nend \nFunny or Die \nMashable \nTelegraph \nMatthew Green \nThomas Rid \nThe robot is just over 2Â½ feet tall and weighs about 66 pounds. It comes with an onboard 3-D vision system that helps it \"see\" and it has 17 joints, according to the Boston Dynamics website. \n\"SpotMini is a small four-legged robot that comfortably fits in an office or home,\" the site says. \nIt can operate for 90 minutes on a single charge and is the quietest robot the company has built. \nAnd it walks like a four-legged animal. And it opens doors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T22:22:03.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
