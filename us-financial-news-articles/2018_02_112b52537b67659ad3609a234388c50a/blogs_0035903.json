A Pakistani court freed him from house arrest last year after ruling there was insufficient evidence to convict him.\nPakistan drew up plans late last year to take over Saeed’s charities in a secret order first reported by Reuters.\nIn the city of Rawalpindi, in Punjab province, district officers had begun taking over the charities’ offices, a city official said.\n“We’ve taken over all the JuD and FIF assets. We’ve completed the takeover,” Rawalpindi commissioner Nadeem Aslam told Reuters.\nLIST Aslam said he did not have an exact number of offices and seminaries involved in the asset seizure but data was being compiled in all four districts of Rawalpindi division and he expected full details of the assets.\nA spokesmen for JuD declined to make an immediate comment but said a statement would be issued. Officials at FIF could not be reached for comment, nor could Hafiz Saeed himself, who rarely speaks to the media.\nPakistan has banned the LeT but its charity wings, the JUD and FIF have been operating.\nThe United States has offered $10 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Saeed, who heads JuD, which Washington says is a front for the LeT.\nPakistani officials involved in the seizures of assets said failure to act against the charities could lead to Pakistan’s inclusion on the FATF watchlist.\nThat would make it harder for foreigners to do business in the nuclear-armed South Asian nation.\nPakistan’s de facto finance minister, Miftah Ismail, told Reuters the FATF would consider a motion to place Pakistan on the list but the government was “hopeful” it could make its case to avoid it.\nPakistan was on the FATF watchlist from 2012 to 2015.\nWriting by Kay Johnson; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T15:25:25.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
