She had already won the gold medal. \nLast in the starting order, having taken the lead with a high score of 83 out of a possible 100 on the first run, the American watched as 25 other riders tried and failed to knock her from her perch atop the leaderboard. Her second run turned into a victory lap, as she celebrated her second consecutive gold medal in the event. \nFour years after her win at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, the 27-year-old from California gave the U.S. its second gold medal in as many days at a blustery Phoenix Snow Park. Red Gerard won the men’s slopestyle event on Sunday. \n“Jamie is the most legendary female slopestyle rider of all time,” said Spencer O’Brien of Canada, who finished 22nd. “There’s no question about that. You saw her ability to ride through anything today.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T13:36:00.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
