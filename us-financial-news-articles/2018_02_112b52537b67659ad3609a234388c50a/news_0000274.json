Because of Adam’s quality in training, it looks immediately like we can put him in, but physical-wise he’s not fit. \n”The two things that happened after his big injury were in the 10 or 15 minutes after he came on. From nil to 100 in a second, and that’s maybe what caused the problem. \n”We really tried to be sensible with it, to do the right thing. But it didn’t work, twice. It’s really not a big thing, three games is like not being injured. \nKlopp did not completely rule out Lallana’s participation against fifth-placed Tottenham though. \n“He’s maybe available for Tottenham, and if not then he’ll have missed three games,” Klopp added. \n“That’s really OK but of course it’s not cool. The body needs to adapt again to the intensity.” \nLiverpool are third in the league with 50 points from 25 games, 18 points behind runaway league leaders Manchester City.
