The Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $380,000 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 vs. $591,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net Income available to common shareholders for the 2017 fiscal year was $2.5 million vs. $2.1 million for the 2016 fiscal year after a $408,000 preferred stock dividend. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $0.07 for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.43 per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 vs. $0.10 and $0.37 per share, respectively, for similar periods in 2016.\nProfitability in 2017 was impacted due predominantly to non-recurring expenses from the successful completion of a core conversion during the third quarter of 2017 as well as professional fees related to the outsourcing of internal audit activities prior to bringing this function in-house. Income tax expense for 2017 included an adjustment to net deferred tax assets in the amount of $100,000, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. The Act reduced the corporate Federal tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and will benefit future years.\n“2017 was a year of transition for HomeTown Bank with a major conversion to a new core processor, the continued reduction in our OREO portfolio and a charge to earnings due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act at year end,\" said Susan Still, President and CEO. \"In spite of these adjustments, our core banking business was solid with an 8% increase in core revenues, 6% increase in loans, and core deposit growth of 6% for the year.\"\nRevenue\nRecord core revenue of $23.9 million was realized for the year ended December 31, 2017, up $1.9 million or 8% over 2016, which included $6.1 million in core revenues realized during the fourth quarter of 2017 - 6% higher than 2016. Higher core revenues were generated from commercial lines and loans, commercial real estate loans, personal lines and loans, private banking loans as well as non-interest income from treasury and merchant services, mortgages and brokerage services.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income in the fourth quarter 2017 increased $323,000 to $4.5 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 with a $1.5 million increase or 9% to $17.6 million for the 2017 fiscal year vs. $16.2 million earned for the 2016 fiscal year. Higher loan volume helped to offset the income from maturing, higher rate loans and the competitive interest rate environment that continued during 2017. The more competitive marketplace ultimately led to an 8 basis point decline in the net interest margin during 2017 in spite of a 5 basis point improvement in the cost of funds.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income, net of security gains, increased slightly to $787,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 while core noninterest income of $3.2 million was realized for the fiscal year 2017, up 13% from $2.8 million realized for 2016. The primary increase for 2017 was continued, double-digit growth in ATM and interchange income, mortgage income, and merchant services income.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased only slightly in the fourth quarter 2017 vs. Q4 of 2016 while noninterest expense during the 2017 fiscal year increased 13% compared to 2016 due primarily to the core conversion, increased operations staffing and data processing costs to support the transition as well as costs associated with additional consulting fees and OREO write-downs for the 2017 fiscal year. We also experienced increased personnel costs with the transition of a new Chief Credit Officer due to the retirement of our former Chief Credit Officer as well as the addition of a new Chief Risk Officer. We anticipate a return to normal overhead and a favorable comparison to peers and core operating costs during 2018.\nLoans\nTotal loans were $444 million at December 31, 2017, up $9 million or 2% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and up $25 million or 6% over the prior year ended December 31, 2016. Loan growth was driven by commercial real estate, commercial and industrial lines and term loans, consumer lines and loans as well as private client loans.\nDeposits\nCore deposit growth for the 2017 fiscal year was up $24 million and was 6% over the 2016 fiscal year. Solid core deposit growth was achieved in 2017 by continued growth in new banking relationships as well as growth in existing commercial and consumer accounts. Conversely, increased liquidity from strong core deposit growth resulted in a 45% reduction in wholesale funding and the associated interest expense.\nCapital\nCapital levels remained sound during 2017 with total stockholders’ equity increasing $2.7 million through December 31, 2017. HomeTown Bank common equity tier 1 capital, total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios were 11.7%, 12.5%, 11.7% and 10.4%, respectively. All ratios continue to exceed the current regulatory standards for well-capitalized institutions. Book value per common share amounted to $8.72 at December 31, 2017 vs. $8.30 at December 31, 2016.\nCredit Quality\nCredit quality remained sound thru December 31, 2017 with a slight increase in the provision for loan losses to $1.14 million vs. $1.08 million in 2016. The increased provision was a result of a combination of increased charge-offs and additional provision from increased loan production.\nNonperforming Assets\nOREO balances continued to decrease during 2017 – down $545,000 or 14%. Non-performing assets, excluding performing restructured loans, improved to 0.80% of total assets at December 31, 2017 vs. 0.91% at December 31, 2016. Non-performing assets, including restructured loans, also improved from 2.10% of total assets at December 31, 2016 to 1.51% at December 31, 2017.\nPast Due and Nonaccrual Loans\nPast due accruing loans amounted to 0.67% of total loans at December 31, 2017 vs. 0.29% in 2017 while nonaccruals amounted to 0.26% of total loans at December 31, 2017 vs. 0.22% of total loans at December 31, 2016.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $3.8 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $3.6 million at December 31, 2016. Provisions for credit losses were $1.14 million for the fiscal year 2017 vs. $1.08 million for 2016 due to solid loan growth as well as charge-offs during the fiscal year.\n“Solid balance sheet growth in both loans and core deposits as well as continued double-digit growth in core non-interest income resulted in record core revenues during 2017,” said Still. “Our credit quality is sound and we remain well-capitalized,” continued Still. “Our brand recognition is strong as evidenced by our growth and we continue to benefit from being the largest bank headquartered in the Roanoke Valley,\" she said.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nCertain statements in this press release may be “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, predictions, expectations or beliefs about future events or results that are not statements of historical fact and that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
