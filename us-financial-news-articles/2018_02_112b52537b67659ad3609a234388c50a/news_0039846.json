CMO Today recently learned that Chobani is sitting out of the Olympics, and now we may have figured out why. To mark its 10th anniversary, the yogurt company is planning to give away at least 10 million free products over three weeks to remind people why it’s better than its competitors, according to Ad Age. Chobani’s coconut flavor won me over early in the yogurt battles, but it’s still tough out there, with brands like Yoplait and Dannon (remember brogurt ?) firing on all cylinders. Let the yogurt battle continue! Especially if it means free food.\nCan We Automate That? Jeff Lucas has left Snap Inc. after a year and a half in the top sales role, Cheddar first reported . Mr. Lucas, formerly of Viacom, had joined the Snapchat parent when the social media company was struggling to fine-tune its ad sales process and compete for big brand dollars with the TV industry, Google and Facebook. Mr. Lucas was meant to help Snap mature its sales process and sell big, premium ad packages. Since then, the company’s automated ad sales strategy, led by chief strategist Imran Khan, has gained traction and become a priority for Snap, CMO Today reports. The more traditional ad deals offered less in terms of data and insights than the automated approach, people familiar with the matter told CMO Today. Mr. Lucas wrote in an internal memo that he is exiting to pursue a new challenge.\nExamples of AMP stories Photo: CNN, Mic, SBNation, Washington Post Google Joins the Party Snap may need Mr. Lucas’s big brand approach after all. Google has unveiled new technology that lets publishers create mobile-friendly visual stories, similar to the style on Snapchat and Instagram, reports CMO Today’s Ben Mullin. The offering, dubbed AMP stories, will feature vertical, swipeable slides of text, photos, graphics and video optimized for the mobile web. AMP stories can’t yet incorporate ads, but Google says it’s working on building the capability. Nonetheless, publishers involved in the early development of the product are optimistic it will pay off, through eventual advertising or prominent placement in search results. “Google has a track record of delivering a return on investment in the longer run,” said Regina Buckley, senior vice president of digital business development at Meredith. “And we’re willing to take a leap of faith on that.” Other publishers involved in the development of AMP stories included Vox Media, Condé Nast, CNN and the Washington Post, among others.\n—Brand Safety Cloud Still Looms—\nGoogle may be luring publishers in with new content formats, but it has yet to win back all of the ad dollars that left YouTube in the wake of its brand safety crisis. Despite the video site’s reforms to help address marketers’ concerns, AT&T has yet to return to YouTube after pulling its advertising almost a year ago due to concerns about offensive content, reports the New York Times.\nBehind the Facebook Curtain In an 11,000 word cover story, Wired’s Nicholas Thompson and Fred Vogelstein advance the Facebook narrative with behind-the-scenes accounts of internal unrest over the past two years and the social network’s reckoning with its responsibilities as a publisher, as well as a platform. The story starts with an account of a contractor with Facebook’s Trending Topics group who leaked questions for an all-hands meeting that indicated many employees thought Facebook should help prevent the election of Donald Trump. Since then, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had to face evidence that Russian entities spread misinformation on his platform to meddle in the U.S. election and confront publishers’ complaints about the power of Facebook’s algorithm to determine which news outlets thrive. According to Wired, News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and CEO Robert Thomson met with Mr. Zuckerberg at the Sun Valley conference in 2016 and threatened to more publicly denounce the company if Facebook didn’t offer a better deal to the publishing industry. (News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal, declined to comment.) Mr. Zuckerberg has undergone a tumultuous transformation from viewing Facebook as a strictly neutral platform to one that must combat misinformation and promote trustworthy journalism.\nAre You Ready? By now, we’re all aware that Europe’s new privacy law, known as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is set to go into effect this May. Right? Large, ad-reliant digital companies like Google and Facebook face a significant business impact, since the rule will make it more difficult to access the data that informs targeted advertising. Deutsche Bank recently pinned the potential impact at 2% of Google’s revenue, according to Business Insider. Other companies, according to a new report from data governance company Erwin, are not prepared at all. Only 6% of North American enterprises are ready for GDPR, according to the report. The company surveyed North American companies with 1,000 or more employees in more than 16 sectors, including financial services, government, health care, IT and telecommunications. That could mean a lot of money is at stake since fines for violating GDPR could be as high as 4% of a firm’s annual global revenue.\nBest of the Rest CNN is bracing for layoffs in its digital group as the Time Warner-owned news network targets savings. CNN could eliminate as many as 50 jobs around the world this week. [ Vanity Fair ]\nThe 4As, a trade association for ad agencies, launched an “enlightened workplace” certification to support agencies in “eliminating discrimination, harassment, bullying, intimidation and retaliation.” [ Press release ]\nBuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti wants Facebook to share the revenue it makes from its News Feed with publishers, he said during Recode’s Code Media event. Sharing revenue, rather than just traffic, would help the platform influence the quality of content in its News Feed, he argued. [ Recode ]\nThe Trump administration’s proposed 2019 budget plan again threatens funding for public broadcasting, such as NPR and PBS, arguing that they can make do with donations and grants. Despite a similar recommendation last year, funding wasn’t cut in the 2018 budget. [ Variety ]\n21st Century Fox Inc. has offered to increase the editorial independence of Sky’s news operations in its latest attempt to win over British regulators for its $16 billion bid for the portion of Sky it doesn’t already own.
