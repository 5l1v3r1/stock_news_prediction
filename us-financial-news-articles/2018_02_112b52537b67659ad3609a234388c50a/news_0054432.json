Should scientists, for example, have the right to run experiments that create heritable genetic changes in embryos, sperm or eggs? Or, is it too risky to the environment to use genetic technology to try to eradicate a species of disease-carrying mosquito?\nDr. Wu is eager to help non-scientists understand the complexities—and to hear their concerns. “That’s why...
