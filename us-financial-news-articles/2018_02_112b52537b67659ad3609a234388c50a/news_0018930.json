Atlantia’s were down 1.9 percent at 24.72 euros, while Hochtief’s were down 3.2 percent at 133.7 euros and ACS’s down 0.9 percent at 29.04 euros.\n$1 = 0.8143 euros Reporting by Carlos Ruano; Writing by Jesus Aguado; Editing by Angus Berwick and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:51:15.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
