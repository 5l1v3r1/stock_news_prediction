San Francisco is the fifth most congested. Atlanta and Miami also make the top 10 list. \nThe scorecard is based on an analysis of 1,360 cities. The congestion data provides insight into each cityâ€™s unique set of transportation problems and how they might be solved (or made worse) with technology and new forms of transporatation such as ride-hailing, car-sharing, and eventually self-driving vehicles. It also shows what the transportation headaches are costing drivers and the city (meaning taxpayers) that must pay for road improvements and infrastructure maintenance. \nAngelenos spent an average of 102 hours last year in traffic jams during peak congestion hours, costing drivers $2,828 each and the city $19.2 billion from direct and indirect costs. Direct costs relate to the value of fuel and time wasted, and indirect costs refer to freight and business fees from company vehicles idling in traffic. Those fees are then passed on to households through higher prices, according to Inrix. \nThe top 10 most congested cities in the world are: \n1. Los Angeles 2. New York City (tie) 2. Moscow (tie) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T06:13:10.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
