At the same time, President Juncker has decided that his current Deputy Head of Cabinet, Clara Martinez Alberola, will become his new Head of Cabinet,” the Commission said.\nThe EU officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Selmayr’s appointment would make it more difficult to remove him from the EU bureaucracy after Juncker goes.\nBut Juncker told a news conference it would be down to the next head of the EU Commission to confirm whether to keep Selmayr, who will be responsible for coherence of shaping new policies and steering them through other EU institutions, in the job.\nOfficials in Brussels speculate the next Commission head could be French -- either the current chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier or International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde.\nSelmayr worked for the European Central Bank from 1998 to 2000 and in 2000 joined the media conglomerate Bertelsmann as a legal adviser. He started working for the Commission in 2004.\nReporting by Jan Strupczewski; Additional reporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T12:16:38.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
