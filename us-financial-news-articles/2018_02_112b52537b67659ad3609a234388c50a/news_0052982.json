The size of the IPO has raised concern among fund managers about the ability of the Saudi market, which has a capitalization of about $470 billion, to absorb it smoothly.\nMSCI is expected to announce its decision in June on a potential upgrade of Saudi Arabia to emerging market status.\nReporting by Stanley Carvalho; Writing by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Andrew Torchia\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:12:05.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
