Independent experts have said Vinci could stand to receive up to 350 million euros.\nVinci shares have lost 2.81 percent so far this year, having gained 31 percent last year. Vinci shares trade at 17.7 times estimated 2018 earnings compared to 17.4 times for Eiffage .\n$1 = 0.8144 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon.
