( bit.ly/2nZbqqH )\n“We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations,” Caterpillar said in the filing.\nThe U.S. tax overhaul signed into law in December has raised hopes of a settlement with the government. Chief Executive James Umpleby last month said the company was cooperating with authorities and hopeful of a quick resolution.\nThe company’s shares were up more than 1 percent at $159.31 in afternoon trading.\nReporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2nZbqqH", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:13:07.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
