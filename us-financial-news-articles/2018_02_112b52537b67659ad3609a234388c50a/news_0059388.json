I am very excited to reach this definitive agreement with Phantom and look forward to welcoming the team to Splunk.”\n“Sourabh Satish and I founded Phantom to give SOC analysts a powerful advantage over their adversaries, a way to automatically and quickly resolve threats,” said Oliver Friedrichs, Founder and CEO, Phantom. “Combining SOAR with the industry’s leading big data platform is a revolutionary advance for security and IT teams and will further cut down the time it takes them to eliminate threats and keep the business running. We are thrilled to empower Splunk customers to solve these important challenges.”\nAnalytics-Driven Security and SOAR\nSOAR platforms improve the efficiency of security operations by automating tasks, orchestrating workflows, improving collaboration, and enabling organizations to respond to incidents at machine speed. According to Gartner*, “By year-end 2020, 15% of organizations with a security team larger than five people will leverage SOAR tools for orchestration and automation reasons, up from less than 1% today.”\nCustomers will be able to use Splunk® technology for orchestration and automation as an integral part of their Security Operations Center (SOC) platform to accelerate incident response while addressing the skills shortage. The combination will help SecOps teams to:\n● Advance cyber defense and reduce organizational risk using analytics-driven security\n● Respond faster by accelerating incident response\n● Work smarter and reduce staffing and skills challenges\nAutomation Beyond Security\nOnce integrated with the Splunk platform, IT teams will be able to leverage these automation capabilities to help solve automation challenges in a widening range of use cases, including Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps). According to Gartner**, “By 2022, 40% of all large enterprises will combine big data and machine learning functionality to support and partially replace monitoring, service desk and automation processes and tasks, up from 5 percent today.”\nBusiness Outlook\n“The majority of purchase price consideration will be paid from cash on our balance sheet. Total equity consideration plus Phantom employee retention incentives will result in less than one percent total dilution from this transaction,” said Dave Conte, chief financial officer, Splunk.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding the expected benefits of the acquisition of Phantom, the impact of the acquisition on Splunk’s products and services, the capabilities of Phantom’s products and services, and expected dilution to Splunk stockholders.
