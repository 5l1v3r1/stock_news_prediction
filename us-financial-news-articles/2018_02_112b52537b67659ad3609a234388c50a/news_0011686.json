By making those exclusively available on its streaming service, Disney doesn't face the same pressure to outbid other companies in the content spending race. In January, Netflix said it plans on spending between $7.5 billion and $8 billion on content in 2018 alone.\nInstead, the entertainment giant can focus on developing its existing franchises and originals. In August, Disney said it would be pulling its movies from Netflix in 2019, when it plans to launch its own streaming platform. The news sent Netflix shares down 4 percent in extended trading .\nBesides the nostalgic benefits of Disney's original movies, there's plenty of new content on the horizon. Iger said Tuesday that \"Black Panther\" ticket presales were \"outpacing every other superhero movie ever made, driven in part to the phenomenal reaction to the premiere last week.\"\nWATCH:  Iger: 'Black Panther' a great movie with a great story show chapters Bob Iger extra: 'Black Panther' a great movie with a great story      15 Hours Ago | 04:35", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T01:05:25.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
