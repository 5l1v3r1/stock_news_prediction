It finishes late, people are working, it’s winter. We just try to allow those who do come to enjoy themselves.” Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Atletico Madrid vs Getafe - Wanda Metropolitano, Madrid, Spain - January 6, 2018 Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa celebrates scoring their second goal with fans before being sent off REUTERS/Javier Barbancho \nIt is a problem the King’s Cup has faced all season. Real Madrid, with their 81,000 capacity Bernabeu stadium, only sold 46,409 tickets for their quarter-final tie against local rivals Leganes last month. \nThere were also more than 15,000 empty seats for Atletico Madrid’s home encounter with Sevilla in the same round. \nThere are a number of reasons why attendances are lower for King’s Cup matches than for league fixtures. \nThe competition’s two-legged format means fans could have four extra games to attend in January and early February, immediately after Spain’s prolonged festive period in what is traditionally the most frugal period of the year. \nOther factors include adverse weather conditions, late mid-week kickoffs and the fact that Cup games are shown on terrestrial television. \nThey all combine to ensure that in its current format, the King’s Cup shows few signs of whetting fans’ appetites.
