Cyber crime insurance, once a little-known product, has gained traction as hacks involving large companies such as Equifax Inc and Target Corp have become more costly and commonplace.\nFILE PHOTO - The Cisco Systems logo is seen as part of a display at the Microsoft Ignite technology conference in Chicago, Illinois, May 4, 2015. REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo U.S. cyber security premiums totaled $1.35 billion in 2016, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. That is a sliver of the $244.9 billion in total premiums for U.S. commercial line insurers, but a growing market in which insurers are trying to distinguish themselves.\nApple CEO Tim Cook said in June that his company and Cisco were collaborating to get cyber insurance discounts for businesses using their products. He said the combination of gear from the two companies was more secure than competing technology.\nLong known for its consumer devices, Apple has embraced business users in recent years, adding additional security features to its iPhones and iPads. In 2015, Cook said Apple was generating at least $25 billion a year in sales to businesses.\nThe new offering begins with a cyber security evaluation by Aon, the companies said. Businesses using Cisco Ransomware Defense malware-blocking software and certain Apple devices can then apply for special cyber insurance through the specialty lines unit of Allianz SE, the companies said.\nPolicyholders that are victims of a cyber attack will receive support services from either Cisco or Aon, the companies said.\nReporting by Suzanne Barlyn in New York; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T14:45:08.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
