Over time, more oil and gas fields, now in excess of 50, were linked to it. \nRoyal Dutch Shell said production at its Shearwater platform in the North Sea had been shut down as a result of the outage. The Nelson field, which also connects to the pipeline, had already been closed for maintenance, a spokesman said. \nTotal said it had to stop gas exports from its Elgin Franklin terminal due to the Forties pipeline outage.
