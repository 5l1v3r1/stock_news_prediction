And we decided to focus into United because we thought there is more margin expansion opportunities,\" he said Wednesday on CNBC's \" Halftime Report .\" \"United has a significant discount in their profitability versus the industry. So if they wind up with a big cap shrink and improving their profitability, you can have a leveraged return.\"\nThe investor noted United Continental reported earnings per share above expectations last quarter and cited its low valuation. He predicts the airline can increase its profit margins toward the industry average.\n\"I would expect the stock to probably in the next 2 to 3 years be a double,\" he said.\nCooperman founded Omega Advisors in 1991. The firm has approximately $3.8 billion in assets under management.\nHis firm agreed last year to a $4.9 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission after allegations of insider trading. As part of the settlement, Omega Advisors admitted to no wrongdoing.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T20:08:19.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
