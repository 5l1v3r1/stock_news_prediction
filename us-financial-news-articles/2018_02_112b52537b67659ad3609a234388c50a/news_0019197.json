As a consequence, core inflation ought to remain around 1 percent, at least this year, providing the ECB with the arguments to maintain its expansionary stance.” \nSpanish Inflation data on Thursday will broaden the picture out to those countries where unemployment is at its highest, while fourth-quarter growth data for the bloc as a whole - and individually for the likes of Germany, Italy and the Netherlands - are set to show an ever broadening recovery.

REUTERS/Staff/Remote MARKET OVER-REACTION POSSIBLE \nIn Britain, where consumers have been facing price pressures for far longer after the 2016 Brexit vote pushed down the value of the pound, the Bank of England said on Thursday that it sees a growing need to keep a grip on inflation. \nThat means raising interest rates sooner and by more than it flagged only three months ago, as central banks move towards tightening monetary policy a decade after the financial crisis. \nData on Wednesday will show whether inflation continues to hold steady at 3 percent where it has spent three of the last four months, and if November’s 3.1 percent reading can be considered a post-Brexit peak. \nThat will leave markets squarely fixed on the U.S. inflation report later that day, alongside retail sales figures also due out for January. \nEconomists polled by Reuters see core inflation - which excludes the volatile food and energy components - rising by 0.2 percent month-on-month, a touch slower than December when consumer prices recorded their largest increase in 11 months. \nThat should nevertheless hold the annual rate steady at 1.8 percent, according to the poll, given the tough comparison with a year ago when consumer prices jumped at the fastest rate in nearly four years. \n“While there is likely to be significant focus on this report, the reality is that the inflation narrative is not poised to gather any real momentum until Q2 when the idiosyncratic effects from last year - wireless price wars, etc. - finally roll off the year-on-year calculation,” RBC Capital Markets’ analysts wrote in a note. \n“But the potential for the market to overreact to an inflation scare is non-trivial.” Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Hugh Lawson", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:03:32.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
