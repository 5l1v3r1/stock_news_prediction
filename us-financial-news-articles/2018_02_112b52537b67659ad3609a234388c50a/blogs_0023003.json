Ankara is pushing to lift visa requirements for its citizens traveling to Europe.\nThe EU is unwilling to grant Turks that concession now but, careful to avoid upsetting President Tayyip Erdogan too much, is due to commit more money for the large number of Syrian refugees living in Turkey.\nAdditional reporting by Samantha Koester in Brussels and; Karolina Tagaris in Athens, Writing by Gabriela Baczynska,; editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T15:38:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
