Robusta is also used to create the froth in some espressos. \n\"If we're going to harvest robusta, the process should be ordered, planned and technically sound,\" said Arauz. \nThe minister added that ICAFE will determine where the crops can be planted and what varieties will be allowed. \nICAFE was not available for comment. \nThe move in Costa Rica comes as changing climates are making robusta farming more attractive and as a growing number of farmers in Latin American are starting to plant the cheaper crop. \nRobusta survives better in warmer temperatures, and higher-levels of caffeine make the trees hardier against some diseases and pests. \nFarmers growing arabica in Central America were hit hard by the spread of an airborne fungus known as roya in 2012. \nIn low-lying areas, which are more susceptible to roya, some producers are now looking to robusta as an alternative crop because many varieties are resistant to the fungus and less costly to grow than arabica. \nStill, some in the industry see robusta as a threat to Costa Rica's global reputation as an exporter of high-quality arabica beans. \n\"The complaints can be resolved with clearly designated areas (for planting robusta) and by talking to farmers. We believe that if it's done right there won't be a negative effect on arabica,\" said Arauz. \nThe minister said robusta is a good option for areas too hot and humid for arabica and where the crop of choice is pineapple, which along with bananas is Costa Rica's main agricultural exports. \n\"We need to create jobs and well-being in agricultural areas where the most profitable crop is the pineapple,\" he said.
