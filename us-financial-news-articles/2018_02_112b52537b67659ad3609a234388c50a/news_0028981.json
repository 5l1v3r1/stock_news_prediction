This is the main thing.”\nThe 34-year-old competed for Ukraine at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics where she and partner Stanislav Morozov finished 15th.\nA year later she teamed up with German skater Robin Szolkowy and relocated to his country to train before taking German citizenship so they could compete internationally.\nFigure Skating – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Pair Skating free skating competition final – Gangneung Ice Arena - Gangneung, South Korea – February 15, 2018 - Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany compete. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Savchenko and Szolkowy won five world championship titles and bronze at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics and 2014 Sochi Games. But when Szolkowy retired in 2014, Savchenko found herself looking for a new partner.\nMassot had been competing with Russian-born Daria Popova since 2011 and although the pair was set on competing for France in Sochi, Popova did not receive a French passport.\nSlideshow (5 Images) “It was very sad because it was the dream of my life to go to the Olympic Games and for stupid papers, it was not possible,” Massot, 29, told a news conference.\n“But today I‘m here. Everything happened for a reason. If today I get the gold medal, maybe it’s also because of this.”\nAfter the 2014 season, Savchenko and Massot decided to form a pair but nationality remained an issue.\nThey had to wait for more than a year for the French Federation of Ice Sports to release Massot, but when it did in October, 2015, Massot was still a long way from receiving a German passport.\nWith Pyeongchang looming, Massot took citizenship tests because the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requires athletes to be nationals of the country they represent and in late November the German Ice Skating Union announced that Massot had been naturalized.\n“I guess it has made me stronger and ready to fight in these Olympic Games,” Massot said.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber,; Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T13:26:19.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
