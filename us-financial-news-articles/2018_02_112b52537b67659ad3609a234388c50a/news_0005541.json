It’s been men interviewing men – but this is just the stuff Bushnell bragged about. Can’t imagine what you would find if you dug deeper. \nBushnell is an important figure. But this isn’t the year to honor him. \n— Brianna Wu (@Spacekatgal) January 30, 2018 \nThe complaints about Bushnell are not tied to any recent allegations or previously unknown information. He has long admitted to Atari having a “fraternity” culture in the early 1970s, with hot tub meetings and a habit of code naming projects after attractive female employees. The home version of Pong , for instance, was called “Darlene.” \nThe culture was described in Steven L. Kent’s 2001 book The Ultimate History of Video Games. Bushnell, wrote Kent, “made sure that the men around him agreed with his philosophy” and “held meetings in hot tubs, drank heavily, experimented with drugs…Sometimes Atari board meetings seemed more like fraternity parties than business meetings.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T18:05:15.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
