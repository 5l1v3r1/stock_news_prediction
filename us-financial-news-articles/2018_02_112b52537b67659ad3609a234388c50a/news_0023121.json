She was a child refugee to Australia from the country also known as Timor Leste. \nA former Portuguese colony northwest of the Australian city of Darwin, East Timor declared its independence in 1975 but was then invaded by Indonesia. One of the poorest countries in the world, it became a sovereign state only in 2002. \n“To the world maybe that is how I appeal, like an exotic fruit, but it is a more personal thing as well,” he said. \n“My uncle’s fight for the independence of Timor... It was a way for me to give back as well. So there is a lot of personal stuff involved for me representing Timor each day.” Additional reporting by Yiming Woo, editing by Darren Schuettler and Clare Fallon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T12:21:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
