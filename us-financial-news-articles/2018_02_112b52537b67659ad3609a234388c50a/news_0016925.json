However, the company has already suffered a minor commercial impact from the rule and is working on potential options to offset it, he said.\n“Of course, the team has been looking at options,” Luciano said, after ADM reported quarterly earnings.\n“We’re not going to sit idle and see ourselves losing share.”\nLuciano did not elaborate on the options or the impact of the provision on the company. A spokeswoman later declined to provide details.\nRepublican leaders of Congress have been working with representatives of grain companies and cooperatives to address the issue since early January.\nSome grain handlers were hoping Congress would include a solution in a spending bill that the U.S. House of Representatives was set to vote on Tuesday evening.\nRepublican senators Pat Roberts of Kansas, John Hoeven of North Dakota and John Thune of South Dakota were still working on a resolution on Tuesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Roberts said.\n“Whether it’s coming now or coming in the next month, it’s coming in the near future,” Luciano said on the call.\nThe grain sector is struggling with low crop prices following years of big harvests and is paying close attention to the tax law after support from rural communities helped propel U.S. President Donald Trump into office in 2016. The restructuring of the tax code, the biggest in 30 years, handed Trump his first major legislative victory since taking office.\nReporting by Tom Polansek and Mark WeinraubEditing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T01:36:20.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
