One important focus will be to provide alternative and sustainable means of production for the oil fields by using the pump jacks on the field to generate electricity, which will be put back onto the grid in addition to plans for solar panels and other methods of energy regeneration.\nAnother key contribution will be the implementation of the latest control and monitoring equipment which will allow us to safely monitor our facilities 24 hours of the day. In essence, the monitoring equipment will not only ensure safety protocols are continually checking and predicting possible offline periods, the system will also allow for fast response time if and when a tripped well occurs on the fields.\nShane Fraser, Director of Ziyen Energy:\n“We already have an ambitious and focused growth plan in place for Ziyen Energy and the appointment of Maurice and Andy will ensure Ziyen Inc. will have the newest technology in place to deliver low-risk solutions to our projects and ultimately, our shareholders. Our new team members will allow us to deliver our promise to optimise operations by increasing well uptime, cut costs by reducing unnecessary servicing of the fields all in an effort to increase production uptime in the most environmentally sustainable way possible.”\nMaurice Wright, “When Shane approached me for the position, I was excited to accept the post as I thoroughly enjoy staying hands-on in the industry and I am confident in my expertise having used innovative and original solutions to help solve any technical problems. We look forward to working closely with Shane and the land team in Indiana to ensure all projects run smoothly and efficiently.”\nFor more information please contact marketing@ziyen.com of visit Ziyen Inc.
