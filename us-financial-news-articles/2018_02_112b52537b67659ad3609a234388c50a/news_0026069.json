I know it’s a comparison between sports and I don’t think there’s a sport in the Winter Olympics where you can even win 23 medals across three or four Olympics. \n”I could never imagine myself even in the same sentence as Michael Phelps. \n“It’s extremely flattering but it’s apples and oranges.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T05:29:06.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
