Their side prevailed by 52 to 48 percent in the vote.\nThe anti-Brexit campaign group 'Is it worth it?' launch their campaign bus to the press before it embarks on an eight-day tour of the UK from outside parliament in London, Britain, February 21, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls Pro-Remain members of parliament and campaigners gathered for Wednesday’s launch of the “is it worth it?” bus and called for a public vote on the terms of any Brexit deal once it has been reached with Brussels.\n“Brexit in the form that it was promised to the British people with 350 million pounds extra per week going to the NHS, it’s simply undeliverable, it’s not going to happen. And what we’re doing today is highlighting that fact,” opposition Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna told Reuters.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Opponents of Brexit are trying to mobilize to stop Britain’s departure from the EU, scheduled for March 2019, even as polls show little sustained appetite for a reversal. On Monday, a new anti-Brexit party was launched. The new bus campaign was started by non-partisan grassroots groups based in London. It will visit 33 locations during its eight-day tour of Britain.\nLast month, Foreign Secretary and prominent Leave campaigner Boris Johnson said the extra 350 million pound promised for public services after Brexit was actually an underestimate, and that the figure would be greater.\n($1 = 0.7174 pounds)\nReporting by Emily Roe; writing by Alistair Smout; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T18:53:51.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
