Other charges include bribery, logistics fraud and trafficking of refugee girls.\nThe country says it has a total refugee population of about 1.4 million, more than a million of whom have fled from South Sudan’s four-year civil war.\nInvestigations by both the Ugandan government, the UN and the European Union are under way to verify the charges, and UNHCR has said its donors have told them they will withhold funding until the refugee numbers are verified.\n“Our resources are stretched to the limit,” Duniya said, adding they needed new funds to de-congest existing settlements stretched by the Congolese influx.\nReporting by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by George Obulutsa and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:35:43.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
