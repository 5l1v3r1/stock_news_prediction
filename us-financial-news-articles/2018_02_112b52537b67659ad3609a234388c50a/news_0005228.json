U.S. special services have effectively continued ”hunting“ for Russians around the world,” the travel warning said. \n“Considering these circumstances, we strongly insist that Russian citizens carefully weigh up all the risks when planning trips abroad,” the Foreign Ministry said. \nIt said more than 10 Russians had been detained in foreign countries with U.S. involvement since the start of 2017. \nBy way of example, it pointed to at least four Russians arrested on U.S. cyber crime charges in Spain, Latvia and Greece. U.S. action against suspected Russian cyber criminals surged to a record high last year. \nSeven Russians were arrested or indicted in 2017 in the United States and abroad, compared to an average of two a year in the preceding six years. \nThe ministry pointed to the case of Stanislav Lisov, accused of creating a computer virus that targeted customers of financial institutions, causing millions of dollars of damage, who was extradited from Spain to the United States last year. \nIt mentioned earlier cases as well, including the detention of Roman Seleznev for cyber crime in the Maldives in 2014, which it described as a kidnapping by American agents. \nThe statement, published on Thursday, also warns Russian citizens that upon extradition they will face biased treatment at the hands of the U.S. justice system. \nThe U.S. State Department declined to comment.
