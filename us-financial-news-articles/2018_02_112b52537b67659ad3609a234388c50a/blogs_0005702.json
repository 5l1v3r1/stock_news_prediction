Revenue from HBO, home to hit fantasy show \"Game of Thrones,\" rose 12.7 percent to $1.68 billion, the company reported Thursday. Analysts were expecting revenue of $1.65 billion, according to data and analytics firm FactSet.\nHBO parent company Time Warner beat analyst estimates as it awaits the outcome of a Department of Justice lawsuit to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. That suit is set to go to trial in March.\nThe company's net income attributable to shareholders surged to $1.39 billion, or 1.75 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to a gain of $1.06 per share related to changes to U.S. tax laws.\nIn the year-ago quarter, the company earned $293 million, or 37 cents per share.\nRevenue rose 9 percent to $8.61 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $8.42 billion. According to Thomson Reuters, Time Warner's adjusted EPS was $1.60 per share, while the average analyst estimate was $1.43.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:51:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
