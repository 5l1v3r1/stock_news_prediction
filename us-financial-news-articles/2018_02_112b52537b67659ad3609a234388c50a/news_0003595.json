That created the world’s largest chemical maker, until the company goes through with a plan to split into three companies - expected within about 14 to 16 months.\nThe merger was welcomed by investors as a way to streamline the companies’ sprawling operations by combining overlapping businesses.\nDowDuPont said on Thursday it was now planning to save $3.3 billion in costs on the back of the merger - slightly more than the $3 billion it expected to save earlier.\nFor the reported quarter DowDuPont saw a $1.1 billion benefit from lower U.S corporate taxes, but still posted a net loss of $1.2 billion from continuing operations - substantially the result of merger-related costs.\nAdjusted for those and other one time effects, the company earned 83 cents on a share. Ahead of the numbers Wall Street was expecting it to make 67 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S numbers.
