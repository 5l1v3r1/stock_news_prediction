Jerry Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats. The meetings were closed to the media.\nNewsom said later on Twitter that the two talked about trade, the environment and universal health care.\nIn brief remarks before the meeting, Newsom thanked Trudeau for his \"energetic leadership on the international stage ... at a time when that's not lost on many of us in the political sphere.\" The comment was an apparent reference to President Donald Trump.\nUncertainty over Trump's immigration policies has provided momentum for Trudeau's economic pitch to Silicon Valley, where many companies that rely on foreign workers have become uneasy over increasing scrutiny on the H1-B work visa program.\nTrudeau promoted his country's fast-track employment permit for certain workers, dubbed the \"global skills strategy visa.\"\nTrudeau demurred when asked whether Trump's immigration efforts are making the sales pitch easier, pointing to the power of globalism.\n\"We know that bringing in great talent from around the world is an enormous benefit, not just to the companies that want to do that, but to Canadian jobs and to our country as a whole, so we're going to continue to do that,\" he said.\nTrudeau also met Thursday with Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos as Bezos considers possible locations for a second headquarters. Toronto, which has created a government-sponsored innovation hub for tech companies, was the only one of several Canadian cities that made the shortlist.\nTrudeau's stop in San Francisco highlights the already strong ties between Canada and California, particularly in research, academia and technology.\nWhile much of the attention on the North American Free Trade Agreement has focused on physical commodities such as vehicle manufacturing, dairy and timber, skilled workers have also become increasingly mobile between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nGoogle built its latest DeepMind artificial intelligence facility at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, after several of its graduates came to work on the project.\nThe next round of talks over the 24-year-old trade pact in Mexico later this month loomed over Trudeau's visit. Trump has called the agreement a job-killing \"disaster\" on the campaign trail and has threatened to withdraw from it if he can't get what he wants.\nThe lengthy talks have increased the political pressure and the rhetoric in Canada, where the stakes are high.\nTrudeau declined to talk about specifics Thursday, but said Canada wants an agreement that is \"win-win-win\" for all three countries.\n\"We're going to continue to make an argument that it's not enough to just trade, we have to ensure that the benefits of trade are properly and fairly shared,\" he said.\nLater Friday, Trudeau will deliver a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.\nThe location is a symbolic choice, referring to the longstanding trade relationship between the U.S. and Canada. In 1988, Reagan and then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed the first free trade agreement — a precursor to NAFTA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T23:42:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
