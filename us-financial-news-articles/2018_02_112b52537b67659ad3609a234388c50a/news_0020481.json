The firm’s own investigation found the resulting leak was caused by insufficient maintenance and a poor understanding of risk. \nWhile nobody was injured, the leak could have been fatal if the gas had ignited, Statoil’s probe concluded. \n“The October 2016 leak is being investigated by police and ... we are cooperating,” a company spokeswoman said. She declined to provide to further details. \nThe police were not immediately available to comment.
