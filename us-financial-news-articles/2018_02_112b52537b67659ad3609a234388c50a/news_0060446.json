It plans to supply these to firms including battery material manufacturing affiliate POSCO ES Materials and its joint venture with China’s Huayou Cobalt Co Ltd, as well as South Korean battery makers.\nKey South Korean battery makers include LG Chem, Samsung SDI and SK Innovation.\nPOSCO said the deal meant it had secured a stable source of raw materials for manufacturing batteries, adding that it would be able to choose between different sources of lithium depending on prices. It said other sources of the material included recycling.\nPOSCO also agreed to acquire convertible bonds worth about A$79.6 million that can be turned into another stake in Pilbara.\nPilbara Minerals, which owns 100 percent of the Pilgangoora lithium mine in western Australia, plans to begin production of about 300,000 tonnes of lithium concentrate in the second half of this year, eventually reaching as much as 800,000 tonnes annually, POSCO said.\nIt added that Pilbara also planned to take a 30-percent stake in POSCO’s planned future lithium factory. POSCO has yet to disclose a timetable or location for that facility.\n$1 = 1.2737 Australian dollars Reporting by Joyce Lee Editing by Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:44:45.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
