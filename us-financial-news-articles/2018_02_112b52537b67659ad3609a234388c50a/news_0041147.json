The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!” Trump said in a tweet.\nReporting by Susan Heavey; Writing by Mohammad Zargham; editing by Grant McCool\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T23:14:21.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
