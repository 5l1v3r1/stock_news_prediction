(NASDAQ: AVNW), (\"Aviat Networks\" or \"the Company\"), the leading expert in microwave networking solutions, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended December 29, 2017.\nCommenting on the Company's fiscal 2018 second quarter results, Michael Pangia, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aviat Networks stated, \"I'm very pleased with our results this quarter, as we exceeded our gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and cash generation targets. Our success was primarily driven by continued strength in our private networks business and in North America, which also led to a significant sequential improvement in bookings. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, as evidenced by strong performance in cash from operations and increases in our cash position. With our year-to-date results and our expectations in the second half of the year, we remain on track to meet both our top- and bottom-line guidance.\"\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Results Comparisons\nThe Company reported total revenues of $61.7 million for its fiscal 2018 second quarter as compared to $68.5 million in the comparable fiscal 2017 period, a decline of $6.8 million or 9.9%. The year-over-year decline in revenue is primarily related to a decline in international revenue offset in part by an increase in North America revenue. On a sequential basis, total revenues increased $5.5 million or 9.9%, as compared to the prior fiscal 2018 first quarter.\nGAAP gross margins for the fiscal 2018 second quarter were 35.5% as compared to 30.8% in the fiscal 2017 second quarter, an improvement of approximately 470 basis points. Non-GAAP gross margins for the fiscal 2018 second quarter were 35.3% as compared to 31.3% in the fiscal 2017 second quarter, an increase of 400 basis points. Both GAAP and Non-GAAP gross margin percentage improvements were primarily driven by improved product and service margins and increased share of business in North America.\nGAAP total operating expenses for the fiscal 2018 second quarter were $19.0 million as compared to $18.6 million reported in the fiscal 2017 second quarter, an increase of $0.4 million or 2.1%. Non-GAAP total operating expenses for the fiscal 2018 second quarter, excluding the impact of share-based compensation and strategic alternative costs, were $18.2 million as compared to $18.1 million reported in the fiscal 2017 second quarter, an increase of $0.1 million or 0.8%. The increases in both GAAP and Non-GAAP operating expenses are related to a one-time bad debt recovery in fiscal 2017 that did not repeat in the fiscal 2018 second quarter.\nGAAP operating income was $2.9 million for the fiscal 2018 second quarter as compared to $2.5 million for the comparable fiscal 2017 period. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 million for the fiscal 2018 second quarter as compared to $3.4 million for the comparable fiscal 2017 period. The Company reported a GAAP net income from continuing operations of $5.1 million, or an income of $0.90 per diluted share and Non-GAAP income from continuing operations of $3.0 million, or income of $0.53 per diluted share. This compares to a GAAP income from continuing operations of $1.7 million, or an income of $0.31 per diluted share for the comparable year-ago period, and a Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Aviat Networks of $3.1 million or an income of $0.57 per diluted share for the comparable fiscal 2017 period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2018 second quarter was $4.6 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA of $4.8 million in the comparable fiscal 2017 period.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $42.1 million as of December 29, 2017 as compared to $36.2 million as of June 30, 2017, an improvement of $5.9 million.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 along with the accompanying notes is provided in Table 3 below.\nFiscal 2018 Third Quarter Outlook\nThe Company anticipates revenue to be in the range of $62.0 to $65.0 million. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated to be in the range of 30.0% and 32.0% based on geographic mix and the anticipated split between products and services. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $18.3 and $18.7 million, in line with the Company's prior outlook, with the range dependent upon the top-line. This would result in positive operating income and positive Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Full Year Outlook\nThe Company today reaffirmed its previously announced fiscal 2018 full year outlook. The Company still anticipates fiscal 2018 revenue to be in the range of $245.0 to $255.0 million, with Non-GAAP gross margins between 31.5% to 32.5% and Non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $72.0 million to $75.0 million. The Company anticipates it will meet its bottom-line objectives and generate Non-GAAP operating income of approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $11.0 million to $13.0 million in fiscal 2018.\nConference Call Details\nAviat Networks will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on February 8, 2018 to discuss its financial results for the fiscal 2018 second quarter.

Management of Aviat Networks monitors gross margin, research and development expenses, selling and administrative expenses, operating income (loss), income tax provision (benefit), income from continuing operations attributable to Aviat Networks, diluted net income per share from continuing operations attributable to Aviat Networks, adjusted income before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") attributable to Aviat Networks adjusted to exclude certain costs, charges, gains and losses, on a non-GAAP basis for planning and forecasting results in future periods, and may use these measures for some management compensation purposes. These measures exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses as shown on the attached Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures table (Table 3). As a result, management is presenting these non-GAAP measures in addition to results reported in accordance with GAAP to better communicate underlying operational and financial performance in each period. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on results in any given period. Management also believes that these non-GAAP measures enhance the ability of an investor to analyze trends in Aviat Networks' business and to better understand its performance. Aviat Networks' management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Aviat Networks presents these non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its financial performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are included in the tables below.\nAbout Aviat Networks\nAviat Networks, Inc. works to provide dependable products, services and support to our customers.

We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP items provides meaningful supplemental information to investors, when viewed in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, our GAAP results. However, the non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
