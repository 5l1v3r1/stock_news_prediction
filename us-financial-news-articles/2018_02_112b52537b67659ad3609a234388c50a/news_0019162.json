Waymo had previously estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, which Uber rejected.\nA jury trial to decide a lawsuit filed by Waymo a year ago was dismissed by the judge just five days after it started in San Francisco federal court.\nThe settlement allows new Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi to put another scandal behind the company after the tumultuous leadership of former CEO Travis Kalanick, who testified at the trial on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nThe settlement includes an agreement \"to ensure that any Waymo confidential information is not being incorporated in Uber Advanced Technologies Group hardware and software,\" a Waymo representative said.\nKhosrowshahi, who joined the company last August, said: \"While we do not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber, nor do we believe that Uber has used any of Waymos proprietary information in its self-driving technology, we are taking steps with Waymo to ensure our Lidar and software represents just our good work.\"\nKhosrowshahi expressed \"regret\" over the company's actions.\nWaymo's lawsuit said that one of the company's former engineers, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files containing designs for autonomous vehicles in December 2015 before he went on to work at Uber in 2016, leading the ride-hailing firm's self-driving car unit.\nThe case had hinged on whether Uber used the trade secrets to further its autonomous vehicle program.\nLevandowski has never publicly addressed the allegations of taking the documents and law enforcement has not charged anyone with their theft. Levandowski was not a defendant in the case.\nAutonomous cars offer a multi-billion-dollar opportunity to remake transportation, and companies including Apple Inc , General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and scores of startups are competing to develop the technology.
