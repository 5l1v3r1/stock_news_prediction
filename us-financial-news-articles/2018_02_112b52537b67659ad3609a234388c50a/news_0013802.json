His death caused outrage over a bloody drugs crackdown that is largely supported by Filipinos, but condemned by the international community. \nThe three policemen were also charged with planting drugs and a handgun on delos Santos, who according to police experts, was shot dead while on his knees in a dark alley. His family and friends insist he had no involvement in drugs. \nAs in nearly 4,000 killings of drug suspects by police as part of the 19-month-old crackdown, the official report said delos Santos was killed because he violently resisted arrest, endangering officers’ lives. \nBut human rights groups and activists dismiss that as implausible and accuse police of systematic executions and cover-ups that President Rodrigo Duterte not only refuses to investigate, but tacitly supports. \nDuterte and the police have repeatedly rejected that and say there is no evidence to support such allegations. \nDelos Santos’ death sparked a big protest and led to Duterte briefly suspending police operations in October. \nTwo months later, however, he ordered police to resume raids and sting operations. Some 46 deaths have been reported in a two-month period ending Feb. 5, based on official reports. \nDuterte has frequently praised police who kill drug dealers and promised to pardon any officers who are jailed. However, he has lambasted the men accused of killing the teenager and promised his family justice.
