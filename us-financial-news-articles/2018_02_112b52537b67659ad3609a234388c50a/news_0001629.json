Key metrics such as revenues and earnings per share remain patchy and slightly light of expectations,” Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said.\nAstraZeneca also saw its shares decline after giving an update on its performance for the full-year.\nThe pharma company dropped 1.7 percent on the back of a disappointing profit outlook.\nElsewhere a bounce among commodities-related stocks was a bright spot. Shares in miners Anglo American, Antofagasta and Rio Tinto rose between 0.3 percent to 0.9 percent thanks to a firmer copper price.\nHeavyweight oil stocks Royal Dutch Shell and BP also advanced 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent respectively as oil prices extended gains.\nAmong smaller stocks, troubled outsourcer Capita was the top gainer on the mid cap index, its shares rising more than 5 percent following an upgrade from broker Morgan Stanley to “equal-weight” from “underweight”.\nCapita’s shares have tumbled this week following a big profit warning and dividend suspension.\n“We continue to view Capita as a traditional BPO provider that is competitively challenged, which justifies a discount to its wider peers,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note, referring to business process outsourcing.\n“But with the shares now up with events, we move to Equal-weight.”\nReporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:36:54.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
