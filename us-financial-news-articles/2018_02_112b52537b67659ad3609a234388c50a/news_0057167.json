Fans came out in large numbers at the airport in Narita, east of Tokyo, waving placards and banners saying “Thank you for gold medal” and “Fly High Yuzu”, in reference to figure skater Yuzuru Hanyu. “I took the bullet train from Kobe (western Japan) to see them. It was worth a trip,” said a middle-aged woman. The showing was a welcome boost for Japan, with Tokyo hosting the Summer Games in 2020. Hanyu took gold in the men’s singles competition, reasserting his dominance after being off the ice for weeks having injured his ankle in a training fall in November.

The win, ahead of compatriot Shoma Uno, who took silver, made the 23-year-old Hanyu the first man in 66 years to defend an Olympic title.

Her younger sister, Miho, who was part of that team, also won silver and bronze in the 1,500 and 1,000 metres speed skating, while Nao Kodaira took gold in the 500 metres. “I have put my life on skating since I missed Sochi Olympics four years ago. I wanted to share courage with everyone, so I‘m happy that I could do that even a little bit,” Miho said. After Kodaira’s win over South Korean defending champion Lee Sang Hwa, the Japanese athlete hugged and comforted her rival in a show of friendship and sportsmanship between athletes from the two countries, whose ties remain strained due to a shared past in which Japan colonised the Korean peninsula from 1910-1945. “I realised that we can spend a wonderful time in life if everyone extends a circle of friendship. These 17 days have become an unforgettable moment,” Kodaira said.
