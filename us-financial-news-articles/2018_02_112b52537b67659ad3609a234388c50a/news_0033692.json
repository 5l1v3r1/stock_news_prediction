In December, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported that the U.S. rate of drug overdose deaths in 2016 grew 21 percent from the prior year.\nMinnesota had 395 opioid overdose deaths in 2016, an 18 percent increase over the previous year.\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a national trade association, said it was reviewing the proposal.\nBut it opposed a similar measure in California last year, according to Kaiser Health News, saying the industry was overtaxed and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency already regulated opioids.\nDayton’s proposed measure, part of a larger effort to boost treatment, access to overdose medications and enforcement, will be debated in the legislative session starting Feb. 20.\n“I don’t see any reason why the taxpayers should have to pay to fix this. I believe (pharmaceutical companies) owe reparations,” State Senator Chris Eaton said Wednesday during a news conference, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.\nAndrew Kolodny, an opioid policy researcher at Brandeis University, said the tax is a good way to increase treatment that more states should seek to adopt, despite the opposition.\n“I don’t think we’re going to see overdose deaths start to come down until we do a better job of expanding access to effective outpatient treatment,” he said.\nReporting by Chris Kenning; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T22:15:52.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
