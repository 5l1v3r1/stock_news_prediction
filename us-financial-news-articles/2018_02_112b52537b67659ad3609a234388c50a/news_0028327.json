The plan submitted by the bondholders would give them a bigger stake, but the precise size was unclear.\nFredriksen’s original plan is backed by 97 percent of banks, who hold about $5.7 billion in secured loans. Their approval will be needed for any amendments.\nWriting by Gwladys Fouche\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:35:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
