The declines for the Dow and the benchmark S&P 500 index were the biggest single-day percentage drops since August 2011. \nThe rout reverberated through the Japanese market, which hit a 26-year peak last month, buoyed by last year’s re-election of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, firm global growth and strong earnings expectations by local companies. \n“Investors are now unwinding their risk positions,” said Takuya Takahashi, strategist at Daiwa Securities. “People are pulling out of risk assets now and at this point we don’t know if this is temporary or not.” \nTakahashi added that the Nikkei’s immediate support is seen at its 200-day moving average of 20,938. \nAll of the Topix’s 33 subsectors were in the red, with insurance and exporter stocks, such as machinery and electric component makers, among the worst hit. \nInsurer T&D Holdings stumbled 7 percent and Dai-ichi Life Holdings nosedived 7.4 percent. \nFurukawa Electric declined 6.2 percent, Yokogawa Electric dropped 6.3 percent and Sumitomo Electric Industries fell 6.2 percent. \nBellwether companies also lost ground. Toyota Motor Corp shed 3.7 percent, Honda Motor Co fell 4.4 percent, Sony Corp slipped 4.2 percent and Nintendo Co tumbled 5.2 percent. \nMarket participants expect that the Bank Of Japan will buy exchange-traded funds on Tuesday to support the market. \nThe BOJ bought 73.1 billion yen ($672 million) of ETFs on Monday. \nThe broader Topix dropped 4.6 percent to 1,740.32.
