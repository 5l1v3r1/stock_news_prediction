The poorest have the least access to electricity.\nRockstrom and Edenhofer were named by the institute on Friday to succeed Hans Joachim Schellnhuber in October.\nReporting By Alister Doyle\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T19:51:40.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
