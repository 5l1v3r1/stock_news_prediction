The slowdown in Italy came before the new challenger entrant, Iliad, arrives this year. \nGermany, South Africa, Turkey and Egypt remained the bright spots. \nThe company said competition in Spain had eased since the quarter ended on Dec. 31, and the group remains on track for its full-year target of growing adjusted core earnings by around 10 percent. \n“It was a heavy promotional quarter, specifically Orange was pretty aggressive, and specifically targeting ourselves,” Finance Director Nick Read told reporters of the Spanish market, where Vodafone competes with Orange ( ORAN.PA ) and Telefonica ( TEF.MC ). \n“We clearly had to respond and there was a degree of churn that we experienced. All of those promotions are now out of the market place.” \nGroup service revenue in the quarter was 10.19 billion euros ($12.68 billion), broadly in line with consensus according to broker Jefferies. \nShares in Vodafone fell 1.6 percent by 0948 GMT. Analysts at Bernstein described the performance of Spain and Britain as “so-so” but said they were concerned by the deterioration in Italy. \n“It suggests corrosive competition, despite the change of guard/CEO at Telecom Italia,” they said. “And this in the lead-up to Iliad’s entry into the market?” Reporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton and Adrian Croft", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T09:44:14.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
