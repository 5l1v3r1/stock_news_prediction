Disley has decided to step down as Chief Executive Officer in order to pursue other business interests.

A search for a CEO successor will begin immediately.\nCommenting on the announcement, Dr. Ian Gilham, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Horizon Discovery, said: \"I would like to express my sincere appreciation for Darrin's achievements as CEO since he joined in 2007 when Horizon was a start-up company through to now being a global leader in gene editing and gene modulation. During his tenure, he has built a world-class management team, set a highly successful commercial and business strategy, led the Company through several financing rounds, including the Company's successful IPO in 2014, and driven multiple acquisitions including the Company's recent transformational deal with Dharmacon. We support Darrin's decision to step down at this time. We look forward, in due course, to announcing the appointment of a new CEO who will lead the Company through the next phase of its growth and development.\"\nDr. Darrin M Disley, said: \"I am proud to have led the team through this successful period and feel now is the right time, after 11 years as Chief Executive Officer, to hand over the reins to pursue my other business interests. I know the Group and the current leadership team is the strongest it has ever been. I wish everyone well and look forward to watching Horizon's future successes.\"\nRichard Vellacott, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Horizon Discovery, said: \"Horizon has never been in a stronger position operationally and I would like to thank Darrin for everything he has contributed to Horizon over the past many years - he has been truly inspirational in the evolution of our strategy and the rapid growth of the business, which is now a global leader in gene editing and gene modulation. I look forward to working closely with our focused and strong leadership team.\"\nDue to the leadership changes, the Group's Capital Markets Day scheduled for 20 February 2018 will now take place on 5 March 2018.\nENDS\nFor further information from Horizon Discovery Group plc, please contact:\nHorizon Discovery Group plc\nIan Gilham, Chairman\nRichard Vellacott, Interim Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 (0) 1223 655 580\nNumis Securities Limited (Broker and NOMAD)\nMichael Meade / Freddie Barnfield\nTel: +44 (0) 207 260 1000\nConsilium Strategic Communications (Financial Media and Investor Relations)\nMary-Jane Elliott / Matthew Neal / Melissa Gardiner\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3709 5701\nEmail: horizon@consilium-comms.com\nZyme Communications (Trade and Regional Media)\nKatie Odgaard\nTel: +44 (0)7787 502 947\nEmail: katie.odgaard@zymecommunications.com\nAbout Horizon Discovery Group plc www.horizondiscovery.com\nHorizon Discovery Group plc (LSE: HZD) (\"Horizon\") is a world leader in gene editing and gene modulation technologies.
