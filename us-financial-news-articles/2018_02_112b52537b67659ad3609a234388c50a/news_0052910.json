I knew that was the move I was going to do. It worked against Russia. Going to my backhand I just brought back to my forehand, I knew when that went in that Maddie was going to stop the next one.”\nIndeed, goaltender Maddie Rooney did stop the next one.\n“Our journey has certainly been unique, but it’s always been the two of us,” Monique said. “I can’t imagine what it would be like not to have her next to me on the ice, and we’ve pushed each other and we wouldn’t be where we are without the other.”\n“So to have your best friend with you through all the good times and the bad times and to win in the way we did makes it special.”\nReporting by Dan Burns, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:40:22.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
