Work is underway for construction of a Futenma replacement facility, but some aspects require approval from the Nago mayor.\nMany Okinawa residents have long associated the U.S. military presence with crime, pollution and accidents, and resentment was rekindled by a spate of incidents involving U.S. military aircraft. In December, a window fell from a U.S. helicopter onto a school sports field, fanning safety concerns.\nToguchi’s victory, however, could bode ill for Okinawa Governor Onaga, who is up for re-election late this year, media said.\nReporting by Linda Sieg; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T03:34:40.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
