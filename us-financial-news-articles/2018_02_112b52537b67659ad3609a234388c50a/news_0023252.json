More than 600,000 migrants have arrived on Italy’s shores from North Africa in the last four years. \nOfficials in Macerata, in central Italy, had originally banned the event due to fears of violence involving extreme right-groups, and only authorised it on Friday. \nItalians and migrants peacefully carried Italian flags and banners against violence and racism, and flew red, heart-shaped balloons with the names of the victims of the shooting. \nOne placard read “fascist Salvini” a reference to Matteo Salvini, the leader of the right-wing Northern League party which campaigns strongly against illegal immigrants. \nHowever, in a sign of widespread and growing anti-migrant sentiment in Italy, none of the leaders of the main parties attended the march.
