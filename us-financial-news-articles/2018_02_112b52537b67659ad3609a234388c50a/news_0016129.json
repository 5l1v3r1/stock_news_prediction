(NASDAQ: SWIR) (TSX: SW) today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. All results are reported in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except as otherwise indicated below.\n“In the fourth quarter of 2017, we delivered year-over-year revenue increases in each of our three segments, with particularly strong growth in our high margin Enterprise and IoT Services lines of business,” said Jason Cohenour, President and CEO. “We also significantly strengthened our IoT Services business with the addition of Numerex, and are now better positioned than ever before to expand our IoT services and scale our subscription based recurring revenue.”\nQ4 2017\nRevenue of 2017 was $183.5 million, an increase of 12.6% compared to $163.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue from OEM Solutions was $139.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 3.4% compared to $135.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue from Enterprise Solutions was $31.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 52.0% compared to $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue from IoT Services was $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 73.5% compared to $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes $3.1 million of revenue from Numerex Corp. (\"Numerex\") which was acquired on December 7, 2017. Subsequent to the acquisition of Numerex, our former Cloud and Connectivity Services segment was renamed IoT Services and now includes Numerex.\nGAAP RESULTS\nGross margin was $61.8 million, or 33.7% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $68.8 million, or 42.2% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter 2016, gross margin was favorably impacted by a change in estimate of our Intellectual Property (\"IP\") royalty accrual. Operating expenses were $64.8 million and loss from operations was $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to operating expenses of $49.6 million and earnings from operations of $19.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss was $3.5 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net earnings of $15.7 million, or $0.49 diluted per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNON-GAAP RESULTS (1)\nGross margin was 33.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 34.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating expenses were $52.5 million and earnings from operations were $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to operating expenses of $44.1 million and earnings from operations of $11.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net earnings were $9.2 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net earnings of $8.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") were $13.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results by Quarter\" below.\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 were $65.2 million, representing a decrease of $9.0 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the acquisition of Numerex partially offset by positive cash flows from operating activities.\nFULL YEAR 2017\nRevenue for 2017 was $692.1 million, an increase of 12.4% compared to $615.6 million in 2016. Revenue from OEM Solutions was $555.9 million in 2017, up 7.6% compared to $516.5 million in 2016. Revenue from Enterprise Solutions was $101.5 million in 2017, up 42.0% compared to $71.5 million in 2016. Revenue from IoT Services, including $3.1 million from Numerex was $34.7 million in 2017, up 25.5% compared to $27.6 million in 2016.\nGAAP RESULTS\nGross margin was $234.9 million, or 33.9% of revenue, in 2017, compared to $217.7 million, or 35.4% of revenue, in 2016. In 2016, gross margin was favorably impacted by a change in estimate of our IP royalty accrual and two legal settlements. Operating expenses were $235.3 million and loss from operations was $0.4 million in 2017, compared to operating expenses of $196.4 million and earnings from operations of $21.3 million in 2016. Net earnings were $4.1 million, or $0.13 per share, in 2017, compared to net earnings of $15.4 million, or $0.48 per share, in 2016.\nNON-GAAP RESULTS (2)\nGross margin was 34.0% in 2017, compared to 33.3% in 2016. Operating expenses were $196.3 million and earnings from operations were $39.2 million in 2017, compared to operating expenses of $175.0 million and earnings from operations of $30.1 million in 2016. Net earnings were $34.1 million, or $1.04 per share, in 2017, compared to net earnings of $22.0 million, or $0.68 per share, in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $54.2 million in 2017, compared to $43.9 million in 2016.\n(2) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results by Quarter\" below.\nAcquisition\nOn December 7, 2017, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 2, 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Numerex in a stock-for-stock merger transaction (the \"Transaction\") whereby Numerex stockholders received a fixed exchange ratio of 0.18 common shares of Sierra Wireless for each share of Numerex common stock. On closing of the Transaction, Sierra Wireless issued 3,580,832 common shares as merger consideration in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Numerex common stock and certain outstanding Numerex equity awards and warrants. Concurrent with closing, approximately $20.2 million of cash in the aggregate was paid to retire outstanding Numerex debt for total consideration of $97.5 million.\nFinancial Guidance\nFor the first quarter of 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $181 million to $189 million and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.04 to $0.10. Our guidance for the first quarter of 2018 includes a full quarter of Numerex following the acquisition of the company on December 7, 2017. We expect the first quarter of 2018 to be impacted by some unusual and mainly non-recurring items, including higher one-time costs related to a Numerex network upgrade and customer migration and tight component supply constraining revenue and adding to cost of goods.\nAdditionally, with the integration of Numerex, we have commenced various efficiency and effectiveness initiatives. These initiatives are focused on capturing synergies as we integrate Numerex and efficiency gains in other areas of our business. The initiatives being undertaken are expected to reduce cost of goods sold, as well as on-going operating expenses. As a result of implementing these initiatives, we are targeting a quarterly non-GAAP operating expense run rate of $56.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, down from approximately $59 million in non-GAAP operating expense that is included in our guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect these initiatives will result in a one-time non-GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $4.5 million.\nThis Non-GAAP guidance reflects current business indicators and expectations. Inherent in this guidance are risk factors that are described in greater detail in our regulatory filings. Our actual results could differ materially from those presented above. All figures are approximations based on management's current beliefs and assumptions.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe disclose non-GAAP financial measures as we believe they provide useful information on actual operating performance and assist in comparisons from one period to another. Readers are cautioned that non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nNon-GAAP gross margin excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related social taxes and certain other nonrecurring costs or recoveries.\nNon-GAAP earnings (loss) from operations excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related social taxes, amortization related to acquisitions, acquisition-related and integration expense, restructuring expense, impairment and certain other nonrecurring costs or recoveries.\nIn addition to the above, Non-GAAP net earnings (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share exclude the impact of foreign exchange gains or losses on translation of certain balance sheet accounts, unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses on forward contracts and certain tax adjustments.\nWe use the above-noted non-GAAP financial measures for planning purposes and to allow us to assess the performance of our business before including the impacts of the items noted above as they affect the comparability of our financial results. These non-GAAP measures are reviewed regularly by management and the Board of Directors as part of the ongoing internal assessment of our operating performance. We also use non-GAAP earnings from operations as one component in determining short-term incentive compensation for management employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss) plus stock-based compensation expense and related social taxes, acquisition-related and integration expense, restructuring expense, impairment, certain other nonrecurring costs or recoveries, amortization, foreign exchange gains or losses on translation of certain balance sheet accounts, unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses on forward contracts, interest and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by investors and analysts for valuation purposes and we believe that it is an important indicator of our operating performance and our ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow that will fund future working capital needs and capital expenditures.\nConference call and webcast details\nSierra Wireless President and CEO, Jason Cohenour, and CFO, David McLennan, will host a conference call and webcast with analysts and investors to review the results on Thursday, February 8, 2018, at 5:30 PM Eastern Time (2:30 PM PT).
