He’s ultra consistent and that’s what makes him so great,” the 23-year-old Graham told a news conference at the Alpensia Resort in Pyeongchang on Tuesday. \n”He’s able to put runs in day in day out that are really high quality. A bad run for him is a second or third place which not many people can really say. \n”But for us, he’s beatable. I know I can beat him, a bunch of other guys can beat him. \n“Since he’s been on tour seven years ago, he’s set the standard really high and it’s just kind of felt like it’s a bit of a cat and mouse race, you know, we’re all just trying to chase him down.” \nGraham is part of a competitive team of eight Australians in the moguls events and will hope to emulate his mentor Dale Begg-Smith, who claimed gold at the 2006 Turin Games.
