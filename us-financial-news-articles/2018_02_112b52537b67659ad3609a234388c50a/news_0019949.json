I felt I was fast - it was strange because it was very different from yesterday.”\nJansrud, however, warned reporters against reading too much into the day’s results.\nAlpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics –Men’s Downhill Training – Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 9, 2018 - Christof Innerhofer of Italy trains. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann “Looking at the time, for Innerhofer and me, I think I got some tailwind,” said the 2014 Olympic Super G champion.\n“That’s the problem with the lower start, they even moved the gate due to take down the speed on the first jump, so it’s not a training run that tells us very much.”\nSvindal, who moved up 15 places from 20th on Thursday, said that with the wind and the cold “it felt all of a sudden way faster”.\nThe skiers have three training runs to master the jumps and map the best line down the mountain before competing in the purest speed event of the Alpine skiing disciplines, which also include Super G, giant slalom, slalom and a new team event.\nBut the timing of the final, scheduled for Sunday, has been thrown into doubt as weather forecasters predict the winds to strengthen.\nOn Thursday race officials said they were considering alternative plans in case of a postponement, but the option of moving the race forward by a day had already been rejected.\nInternational Ski Federation (FIS) Chief Race Director Markus Waldner said winds in excess of 30 knots (55.6 kph) would close the gondola that transports the skiers to the top of the mountain for the opening race of the 2018 Olympics.\nAdditional reporting by Nick Mulvenney and Simon Evans; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T07:45:15.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
