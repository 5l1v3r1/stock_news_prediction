Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican who has backed the agreement, predicted the chamber would pass the budget deal. \n“I think we will,” Ryan told radio host Hugh Hewitt. “This is a bipartisan bill. It’s going to need bipartisan support. We are going to deliver our share of support.” \nThe rare bipartisan deal reached by congressional leaders on Wednesday would stave off a government shutdown before a Thursday night deadline and extend the federal government’s debt ceiling until March 2019. \nThe deal, backed by President Donald Trump, raises spending on military and domestic programs by almost $300 billion over the next two years. \nA two-year budget bill would end the fiscal uncertainty that followed Congress’ passage of four stopgap funding measures this fiscal year and led to a three-day partial shutdown last month. \nThe measure fails to end uncertainty, however, for 700,000 young immigrants brought into the United States illegally as children. \nDemocrats had sought to pass legislation ensuring protections for the so-called Dreamers as part of any budget measure but Republicans refused. Instead, they have pledged to hold a separate immigration debates in Senate this month. \nIt would allow for $165 billion in extra defence spending and $131 billion more for non-military programs, including health, infrastructure, disaster relief and efforts to tackle an opioid crisis in the country. \nMany Republicans, whose party controls both chambers of Congress, said the military’s need for funding justified the extra spending. \nHowever, the conservative House Freedom Caucus said it opposed the measure, which caucus chairman Mark Meadows called “eye-popping and eyebrow-raising.” \nSenators Bob Corker and Rand Paul, Republican fiscal conservatives, said they would not support the bill. ”I‘m against adding over $1 trillion of debt,” Paul said. \nRepublican Senator John Kennedy said there were many good things in the measure but he was concerned about adding to the deficit. \n“I feel like I have to choose between love and honour here. I don’t know how I‘m going to vote,” he said. LIBERAL OPPOSITION \nLiberal Democrats opposed the deal because it does not include an agreement to protect the Dreamers from deportation.
