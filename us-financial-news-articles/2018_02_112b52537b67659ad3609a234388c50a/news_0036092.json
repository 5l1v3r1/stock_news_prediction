The lenders have been under regulatory pressure to boost capital and rein in lending to speculative investors amid fears of a downturn in the property markets of the country’s biggest cities.\nMoreover, a government-backed inquiry into banks began earlier this week following years of scandals including interest-rate rigging, poor financial advice and accusations of breaking money laundering rules.\nSelling tactics on mortgages will be the first focus of the inquiry, whose final recommendations could lead to criminal or civil prosecutions as well as greater regulation.\nThe banking regulator, meanwhile, earlier this week proposed higher risk weightings on some mortgages.\nThe changes are likely to put pressure on revenues as they could result in fewer mortgage loan applications being approved, analysts say.\n“Revenues would be somewhat lower,” as a result of the new focus on mortgage affordability imposed on banks, as well as the higher risk weightings, said TS Lim, banking analyst at Bell Potter Securities.\nA spokesman for ANZ said the bank had recently added a higher level of approvals for some mortgage serviceability assessments to ensure “lending standards are in line with community expectations and our own risk appetite”.\nA Westpac spokeswoman said the bank had recently bolstered their lending practices, “with our staff and brokers now seeking more detailed information from customers to determine their borrowing capacity”.\nA spokeswoman for Macquarie, which has a much lower exposure to mortgages than the Big Four, said the bank conducts regular reviews of its lending parameters and pricing.\nRepresentatives from CBA and NAB did not return requests for comment.\nNone of the banks addressed questions on whether the enhanced diligence would affect their sales.\nReporting by Paulina Duran; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T11:25:01.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
