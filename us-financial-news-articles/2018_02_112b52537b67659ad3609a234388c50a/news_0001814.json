Cryan told journalists “we aim for a profit” in 2018 without being more precise.\nDeutsche Bank is in the throes of a major restructuring, seeking to put out fires as competitors take market share. At the same time, shareholders are griping about the pace of the turnaround, doubting the bank’s strategy and leadership.\nThe quarterly loss “illustrates the scale of the reengineering task still facing the firm,” said Peter Nerby of the ratings agency Moody‘s.\nELUSIVE COST CUTS Investors have called on Cryan to cut costs, but the bank said it anticipated costs this year of 23 billion euros ($28.6 billion), higher than a previously targeted 22 billion and down only 4 percent from 2017.\nLast March Deutsche announced an overhaul that includes the integration of its Postbank retail bank unit with its own in-house Deutsche Bank-branded consumer bank, as well as the partial sale of its asset management unit.\nOn Friday it said the integration with Postbank was “on schedule” and that it would partially float its asset management unit “in the earliest available window”.\nStill, executives have warned that a recovery would be a long, hard slog that would take years.\nContinued weak performance at the bank has prompted some investors to question whether Cryan should be given more time to turn around the bank, after less than three years as CEO.\nIt reported a 2017 loss of 497 million euros, worse than the loss of 290 million forecast by nine banks and brokerages polled by Reuters.\nU.S. tax reforms prompted a non-cash tax charge of 1.4 billion euros, pushing the bank into a full-year loss.\nIn the fourth quarter, its net loss widened to 2.19 billion euros from 1.89 billion a year earlier and revenue slumped 19 percent to 5.7 billion euros. Analysts had forecast a loss of 1.95 billion euros on revenue of 6.2 billion.\nDeutsche Bank building before the bank's annual news conference in Frankfurt, Germany, February 2, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski LESS VOLATILITY Its cash-cow bond-trading division saw revenue tumble 29 percent in the quarter due to lower client activity in less volatile markets. Competitors saw similar declines.\nThe bank’s shares were 5.5 percent lower in late afternoon on Friday. “There is not really anything good that can be said about Deutsche Bank’s earnings,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO and founder of consultancy Opimas.\nDuring his tenure, Cryan has stabilised the bank, raised capital, confronted legal challenges and managed the demands of greater regulation.\nBut shareholders are now voicing their impatience. Hendrik Leber, a fund manager with Acatis, said he liked Cryan personally. “But I don’t know which direction Deutsche Bank is heading toward,” he said.\nSlideshow (4 Images) “With UBS, the direction was clear with its big restructuring,” Leber said. “I‘m not seeing a clear strategy with Deutsche Bank.”\nBONUS DEBATE Adding to its problems, the bank has been the focus of national debate over its intention to resume bonuses despite its loss.\nPay and benefits at the investment bank rose 45 percent in the fourth quarter to 1.29 billion euros.\nFurther unsettling investors, Cryan warned that he would make “no big promises” for the bank’s 2017 dividend.\nRelated Coverage Deutsche Bank lowers 2018 cost-cutting aim on delayed divestitures “Shareholders shouldn’t walk away with nothing if Deutsche Bank pays its staff bonuses,” said Ingo Speich, a fund manager Union Investment, one of Deutsche Bank’s larger shareholders.\nDeutsche Bank became a major player on Wall Street over the past two decades but misguided bets and poor conduct have resulted in a litigation bill of 15 billion euros since 2009.\nLegal battles have ranged from its role in the marketing of U.S. mortgage-backed securities to a so-called “mirror trading” scheme that could be used for money laundering.\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it issued an order settling charges against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, a unit of the bank, for attempted manipulation of the ISDAFIX benchmark and requiring the firm to pay a $70 million civil penalty.\n($1 = 0.8049 euros)\nReporting by Tom Sims and Arno Schuetze; Additional reporting by Andreas Framke; Editing by Jason Neely and Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:32:25.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
