He faces an immediate set of challenges: a wobbly stock market, rising interest rates and the fallout from one of his predecessor's final acts â€” the removal of four Wells Fargo board members . \nPowell, 65, took the oath of office at 9 a.m. ET, succeeding Janet Yellen , who left the position Friday after serving a four-year term. President Donald Trump chose not to reappoint Yellen and instead turned to Powell, a former Fed governor expected mostly to continue to current Fed path. \n\"I am humbled and honored by this opportunity to serve the American people,\" Powell said in a statement. \" \n\"My colleagues and I will remain vigilant, and we are prepared to respond to evolving risks.\" \nHowever, continuing exactly down the same path could prove to be a challenge. \nBoth Yellen and Ben Bernanke before her dealt with a low-inflation, low-interest-rate economy that gave rise to a strong run in the stock market. Government bond yields, though, are now at multiyear highs, and the stock market is coming off a rough week that saw the Dow industrials lose 666 points Friday. \n\"As I begin my term, I want to stress my commitment to explaining what we're doing and why we are doing it,\" Powell said. \nPowell also takes over the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee at a time when it has multiple holes to fill. Yellen's departure leaves four vacancies on the seven-member FOMC. Trump has nominated Carnegie Mellon economist Marvin Goodfriend for one opening.
