Commission on Human Rights and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement on Sunday.\nThe agencies also expressed alarm at the increase in the number of murders in the Bajo Cauca area, without giving figures.\nViolence has continued in some areas of the Andean country despite the 2016 peace deal between the government and the FARC to end a five-decade conflict. The FARC is now a political party.\nThe competing groups are eager to control lucrative illegal mining and cultivation of coca, the base ingredient in cocaine, and the trafficking routes that send the drug to consumers, largely in the United States and Europe.\nReporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:38:10.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
