Morey’s Chairman of the Board Justin Heyman passed away suddenly on Friday, Feb. 9, as the result of injuries sustained in a snowmobiling accident while on retreat in Wyoming. Never one to shy away from a challenge, Mr. Heyman was an avid cyclist, sports enthusiast and true adventurer who lived life to the fullest. He was 50 years old.\nMr. Heyman leaves behind sons Austin, Chase and Hunter, and is survived by his parents, Sydney and Hermia Heyman, as well as sister Lauren Heyman and brother Dan Heyman. He was a devoted and loving father to his three sons and was truly grateful for his family.\n“Justin was a passionate businessman and, above all, an outstanding father to his children,” said Jim Walstrom, Morey’s Seafood president. “He was a tireless champion for the leadership team at Morey’s. We will miss his counsel and guidance as we continue to grow the business into the future in his honor.”\nBorn in South Africa, Justin lived in Chicago, where he was a partner at Acuity Capital Partners, LLC and held the position of Chairman of the Board for Morey’s since 1998. Justin enjoyed the seafood industry and the challenges and rewards it presented. He was proud to be a member of the Morey’s family.\nAfter the passing of his sister, Ann, Mr. Heyman focused his passion on continuing the selfless work she had begun with the Agahozo Shalom Youth Village in Rwanda. This village provides a home to many of Rwanda’s orphaned and vulnerable youth, offering a much-needed sense of hope, peace and family. Youth from this village are able to grow intellectually and emotionally, reach their full potential and become well balanced adults poised to make the world a better place. Donations in Mr. Heyman’s memory can be made to the Agahozo Shalom Youth Village at asyv.org .\nMr. Heyman’s funeral was held on Tuesday, Feb. 13 in Valhalla, New York. A memorial service will be held in Chicago at a future date and time.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180216005584/en/\nMorey's Seafood\nKris Tanchin, 763-542-6200\nSource: Morey's Seafood", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180216005584/en/"], "published": "2018-02-16T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T22:50:35.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
