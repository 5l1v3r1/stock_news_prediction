Data is set to be released at 8 a.m. [1400 GMT] on Thursday.\nThat would be the lowest level in ten months but is still well above the central bank’s target of 3.0 percent.\nPolicymakers are still expected to raise their benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent on Thursday to contain worries that inflation may not cool as fast as expected amid concerns the country’s peso could be battered again this year.\nThe annual rate was seen dropping in the month as the impact fades of sharp gasoline price increases in January 2017.\nThe Reuters poll estimates year-on-year core inflation dipped to 4.56 percent from 4.87 percent in December.\nCompared with January, consumer prices were seen up 0.50 percent in the poll, while core inflation was seen rising 0.27 percent month-on-month.\nReporting by Noe Torres and Sharay Angulo; Writing by Daina Beth Solomon and Michael O'BoyleEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:44:51.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
