Last week it suffered its worst weekly performance since 2013.\nBritish bank Lloyds Banking Group on Sunday said it was banning customers from buying Bitcoin using credit cards. It joined U.S. banking giants JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup who announced similar bans on concerns the lenders could be held liable when the volatile currencies plunge in value.
