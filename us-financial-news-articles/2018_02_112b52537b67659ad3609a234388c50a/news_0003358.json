According to prosecutors, BNY had failed to monitor risks and did not comply with local asset-allocation rules. At the time, the unit called those accusations “unfounded.” Reporting by Eduardo Simões in São Paulo and Ricardo Brito in Brasília; writing by Bruno Federowski; editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Susan Thomas", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T12:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T12:34:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
