We need to be open and we need to ask for a lot of reforms,” said Belgium’s Didier Reynders.\nRegional disputes also hamper the accession process, with Serbia’s president warning on Friday that Belgrade was unlikely to support full recognition of Kosovo as an independent state in exchange for winning EU membership.\nSpain, where a standoff between Madrid and Catalan separatists intensified in recent months, is among five EU states that do not recognise Kosovo either.\nThe foreign minister of Macedonia, locked in a name dispute with EU member Greece, said he hoped recent diplomatic efforts would soon lead to a compromise with Athens over his country’s name. Greece says the name ‘Macedonia’ implies a territorial claim on a northern Greek province of the same name and has been blocking Skopje’s EU bid.\n“We are doing everything we can so that there be a political decision in June,” said the minister, Nikola Dimitrov, hoping the EU would agree to start membership negotiations then.\nHis Albanian colleague, Ditmir Bushati, said the region needed EU development money, not only advice on strengthening democracy: “Rule of law comes first but there is no rule of law without economic development.”\nWriting by Gabriela Baczynska Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:42:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
