Supporters say self-sufficiency is an important criterion when considering immigration decisions and that concerns about the draft rule were exaggerated.\nA DHS spokesman declined to comment on the draft policy beyond a statement last week that the Trump administration seeks to be “good stewards of taxpayer funds.”\nOmolara Uwemedimo, the Thomases’ eldest daughter and the baby Akingbade Thomas was carrying at the time she received government aid, is now a 36-year-old pediatrician who treats poor children in New York. She is a critic of the draft plan.\nAs a child growing up in Brooklyn and Queens, Uwemedimo excelled academically, graduated from high school at age 15 and won a scholarship to cover her undergraduate and medical school tuition. At age 22, she received her medical degree.\nMany of Uwemedimo’s patients have parents who were born in other countries, she said in an interview. Over half her patients are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, government benefits that help low-income families with medical costs.\nUwemedimo said the new rule could force parents to decline health insurance and food aid for their American-born children, for fear of losing their shot at permanent residency. Shunning government help, she says, would “push a tremendous number of families into poverty.”\nUwemedimo said her own family’s experience taught her some of the hardships immigrants can face. “Ultimately that transition, even for people who came as skilled workers, it was still quite difficult,” she said.\nPresident Donald Trump, who took a hard line on illegal immigration during the 2016 election campaign, has also sought to curtail legal immigration. He has advocated ending a visa lottery program and some kinds of family-based immigration.\nCritics of the draft rule believe it would effectively make it harder for lower- and middle-income people to immigrate.\nJessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors immigration restrictions, said she does not believe the draft rule intends to deter people from accessing services.\n“It’s to make sure that the United States is not giving out green cards to people who don’t qualify because they’re not self-sufficient,” Vaughan said.\nRobert Rector, an expert on welfare programs and immigration at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said cases such as the Thomas family - educated immigrants who rely for a short time on public benefits - are not typical of the burden on U.S. taxpayers posed by immigrants generally.\nThough Rector supports the draft regulation’s aims of reducing the burden of immigration on taxpayers, he said a more efficient way of doing so would be changing the law to limit the number of low-skilled immigrants who can be admitted.\n“The solution is not to bring them into the country and then say, ‘Oh we’re going to monitor every month of food stamps you get,'” he said. “The proper policy is to make a distinction at the front door.”\nCornelius Thomas, Uwemedimo’s father, is grateful he did not have to worry about jeopardizing his chance at permanent residency when his family accepted government aid for about six months. After earning his engineering degree, he worked two jobs for years. His wife worked as a nurse and now runs a home health care business.\nIt was the only time the family received public benefits, Cornelius Thomas said.\n“The amount we paid back, it’s more than what they gave us,” he said, referring to taxes they paid for decades. “We never stopped working.” (Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati, editing by Sue Horton and Grant McCool)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:15:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
