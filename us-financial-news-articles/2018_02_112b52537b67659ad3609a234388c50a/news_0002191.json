There is no reason for him not to start,” Brunel, who took over from Guy Noves after a dismal series of international tests last November, told a news conference on Thursday. \n”He has what it takes to take the lead. He’s well integrated in the squad. \n“He is mature enough even if the Irish are going to take care of him,” Brunel joked. \nMachenaud, who has a 94 percent kicking rate this season, will kick the conversions and penalties, said Brunel. \nFrance will rely on Virimi Vakatawa and Teddy Thomas’s speed on the wings while Palis, even though he will win his first cap at 26, will be the perfect man to “handle Ireland’s kicking game”, according to Brunel, who earlier this year said Les Bleus should be title contenders. \nFrance last won the Six Nations in 2010. \n15-Geoffrey Palis, 14-Teddy Thomas, 13-Remi Lamerat, 12-Henry Chavancy, 11-Virimi Vakatawa, 10-Matthieu Jalibert, 9-Maxime Machenaud, 8-Kevin Gourdon, 7-Yacouba Camara, 6-Wenceslas Lauret, 5-Sebastien Vahaamahina, 4-Arthur Iturria, 3-Rabah Slimani, 2-Guilhem Guirado (cap), 1-Jefferson Poirot \nReplacements: 16-Adrien Pelissie, 17-Dany Priso, 18-Cedate Gomes Sa, 19-Paul Gabrillagues, 20-Marco Tauleigne, 21-Antoine Dupont, 22-Anthony Belleau, 23-Benjamin Fall Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Gareth Jones/Amlan Chakraborty/Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T11:21:34.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
