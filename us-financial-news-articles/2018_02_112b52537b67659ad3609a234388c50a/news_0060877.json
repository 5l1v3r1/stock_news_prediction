Up and down the country, businesses are plainly worried at the lack of clarity over the UK’s future relationship with ... the EU,” Newton-Smith said.\nOn Friday, CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said business growth risked being stunted if firms lost ready access to EU migrant labor.\nReporting by David Milliken, editing by Andy Bruce\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T12:18:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
