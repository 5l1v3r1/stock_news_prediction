Domestic sales fell by 2.3 percent and export sales by 3.1 percent. \nOnce the world’s largest beer consumer, Germany’s consumption has dropped by 17 percent since 1993, but euphoria surrounding the national soccer team’s victory in the 2014 World Cup appeared to have checked the decline. \nSales rose 1.1 percent that year and remained stable in the following two years. \nThe decline in last year’s exports was a result of market saturation in China, the German Brewers Association said, holding out hope that soccer could again drive a return to growth in 2018. \n“The World Cup could provide important impulses for the industry,” the association’s head Holger Eichele said, reeferring this summer’s tournament in Russia. \nEichele said that a growing number of non-alcoholic beer brands, which are not included in the official statistics, would make a positive contribution to breweries in the long term.
