Japan Tobacco is still one-third government-owned.\nIt said it would spend more than 100 billion yen ($917.43 million) over the next three years on development and production of what it calls “reduced-risk products (RRP),” or cigarette alternatives that do not use combustion to deliver nicotine.\n“For Japan Tobacco’s continuous growth, we must win in the RRP category,” Chief Executive Officer Masamichi Terabatake told a news conference.\nJapan has become a fertile market for HNB products as the country’s regulations effectively ban e-cigarettes that use nicotine-laced liquid. Tobacco makers have been struggling to ship enough products to meet demand as a growing number of smokers switch to these smokeless tobacco offerings.\nMizuho Securities analyst Hiroshi Saji estimated HNB products will account for 29 percent of Japan’s tobacco market this year, up from 16 percent in 2017. He estimated Philip Morris to keep its lead in the HNB market with a 76.2 percent share, with the rest evenly held by Japan Tobacco and British American Tobacco PLC\nJapan Tobacco, which commands over 60 percent of the domestic cigarette market, lags behind Philip Morris, which launched its IQOS device in Japan in 2014 and expanded nationwide in April 2016.\nJapan Tobacco introduced its Ploom Tech smokeless tobacco product in central Tokyo in June last year after production delays and is now trying to catch up with IQOS and BAT’s glo.\nJapan Tobacco said it now plans to expand sales of Ploom Tech nationwide in September and aims this year to sell 200 million packages of tobacco capsules for Ploom Tech, which is a pen-like battery-powered device.\nJapan Tobacco said it expects its domestic cigarette sales volume to decline by more than 16 percent in 2018, after falling 12.5 percent to 92.9 billion cigarettes in 2017, its lowest on record.\nThe tobacco makers have said HNB products release fewer harmful chemicals than conventional cigarette since they do not combust, but their long-term health impact has not been verified.
