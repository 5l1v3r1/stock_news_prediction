The Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap hit 145 bps, close to its widest in around five weeks.\nThere was a firmer tone in other major bond markets. Japanese government bond yields fell in anticipation of strong demand at a 20-year-bond sale this week.\nU.S. Treasury yields steadied, after rising on Tuesday as markets absorbed the first chunk of this week’s supply deluge.\nMinutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s January meeting are due later in the day and are in focus as investors assess the speed and pace of U.S. rate hikes this year.\n“We expect the minutes to echo the more positive tone of the post-meeting statement on the economy and the FOMC’s increased confidence in reaching its inflation target,” analysts at UniCredit said in a note.\n“This sets the stage for further rate hikes, with the next one likely to come in March.”\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T18:57:51.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
