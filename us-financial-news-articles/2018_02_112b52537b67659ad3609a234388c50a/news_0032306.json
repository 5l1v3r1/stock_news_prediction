It's sometimes called the \"fear gauge.\"\nThe VIX surged by 115.6 percent last Monday to 37.32. It rose briefly early Tuesday to over 50, the highest level since August 2015. The measure spent most of the second half of 2017 at or below 10 as hedge funds continued to bet successfully on smooth sailing for the stock market ... until last week. That's when the losing bet for this trader paid off.\n\"At one point, he was down $200 million, most of that permanently lost in expired option premium. At one point, '50 Cent' became '30 Cent,' scrimping on his usual VIX option purchases, unwilling to pay up for the 50 cent VIX options that were his namesake,\" Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, wrote in a note to clients Monday. \"But in early February, when it seemed like Fiddy's fortunes could go no lower, it came: redemption.\"\nshow chapters Here's what you should know about the 'fear index' 5:56 PM ET Wed, 7 Feb 2018 | 02:05 Market participants called the trader \"50 Cent\" due to his or her penchant for paying a fixed 50 cents on 50,000 VIX contract call options trades.

He also speculated the trades were not an outright bet on volatility, but protection for a long-biased portfolio.\n\"We will re-iterate that contrary to many sensationalistic reports, we think 50 Cent was running this strategy as a hedge rather than some kind of 'doomsday bet.' In other words, they were long risk against it,\" he wrote.\nBloomberg News was first to report on the Macro Risk Advisors \"50 Cent\" profit figures.\nWATCH: Here's why the Dow doesn't really matter show chapters Why the Dow is the most controversial market measure 11:03 AM ET Fri, 9 Feb 2018 | 02:46 Disclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T20:11:52.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
