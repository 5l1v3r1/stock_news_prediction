Hebei as a whole saw PM2.5 concentrations hit 65 micrograms per cubic meter last year.\nMeanwhile, Tangshan said it would eliminate 1.2 million tonnes per year of steel capacity and 1.81 million tonnes of coal capacity by the end of this year, as well as speed up the relocation of heavy industry to coastal regions.\nThe city plans to achieve its annual coal-to-gas or coal-to-electricity switching target by the end of October, according to the document, which did not provide a figure for the target.\nBy the same month, 45 Tangshan steel mills are required to have upgraded their sintering equipment.\nReporting by Tom Daly and Muyu Xu, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:04:50.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
