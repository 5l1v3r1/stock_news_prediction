The United States operates 10 and plans to build two more.\nChina’s navy has been taking an increasingly prominent role over the last year, with its first aircraft carrier sailing around self-ruled Taiwan and new Chinese warships popping up in far-flung places.\nReporting by Christian Shepherd; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:32:08.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
