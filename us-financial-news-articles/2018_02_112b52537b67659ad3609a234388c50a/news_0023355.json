Sessions, a key surrogate for Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, was found to have previously undisclosed contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak that Sessions did not mention in testimony on Capitol Hill.\nReports emerged Friday that Brand planned to leave the department \"in the next few weeks.\" She has accepted a position as Walmart 's executive vice president of global governance and corporate secretary, in which she will report directly to the company's President and CEO Doug McMillon .\n\"We have strengthened our governance capabilities and Rachel will help us continue on that journey,\" McMillon said Friday. Walmart did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nRosenstein has reportedly been the target of Trump complaints lately . Aides have advised Trump not to fire the deputy attorney general.\nSources told NBC that Brand's job change followed a lengthy period of feeling unsupported in her role. As far back as the fall, she expresssed worries to friends about her proximity to the looming Russia investigation, NBC's sources said. Key vacancies in the Justice Department, unfilled more than one year into the Trump administration, exacerbated Brand's discontentment in her position.\nAbout a third of the 13 divisions in Brand's purview, including the civil rights and civil divisions, remain vacant, according to NBC.\nThe White House and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nRead the full report from NBC News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T20:24:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
