You will never get it for as long as I am president. We are neutral,\" Duterte said, without making clear if he was referring to Canada or the U.S., his country's treaty ally, or both.\nDuterte, who has been critical of U.S. security policies and has lashed out at Washington for criticizing his deadly crackdown on illegal drugs, did not elaborate on why he wants purchases of unspecified U.S. arms to be stopped.\n\"U.S., because of its too much imposition, but I assure you, I am supporting Trump,\" Duterte said. \"He is a good president. He is doing it also for his country, people just don't understand him.\"\nDuterte's friendly attitude toward Trump contrasts with his disdain for former U.S. President Barack Obama, who raised concerns about Duterte's anti-drug campaign.\nTrump visited the Philippine capital, Manila, in November to meet Duterte and attend an annual summit with Asian and Western leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nTrudeau said then that he raised concerns about human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings in Duterte's anti-drug campaign during a meeting with the Philippine president. The Canadian leader was praised by human rights groups for raising the concerns, but Duterte said he was insulted and angered by the remarks.\nNearly 4,000 mostly poor drug suspects have been killed in clashes with police, according to police officials, who say the suspects resisted violently. Human rights groups have reported much higher death tolls and accused law enforcers of carrying out extrajudicial killings and of setting up crime scenes to make the victims appear to have fought back.\nDuterte, a former city mayor who built a political name with his extra-tough approach to crime, has denied condoning unlawful killings but has openly threatened drug suspects with death and cursed people who criticize his anti-crime methods.\nA prosecutor in the International Criminal Court announced Thursday that she was opening a preliminary probe into alleged crimes by Duterte in connection with the war on drugs.\n\"While some of such killings have reportedly occurred in the context of clashes between or within gangs, it is alleged that many of the reported incidents involved extrajudicial killings in the course of police anti-drug operations,\" said Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda.\nBensouda has said in the past that she was deeply concerned about reports of the killings, and that statements by \"high officials\" in the Philippines \"seem to condone such killings.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:01:50.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
