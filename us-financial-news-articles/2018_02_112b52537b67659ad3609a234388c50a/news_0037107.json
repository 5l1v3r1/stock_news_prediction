I dropped my things as quickly as I could and just ran there,” team mate Mona Brorsson, who finished 14th, told Reuters.\nBiathlon - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's 15km Individual Final - Alpensia Biathlon Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 15, 2018 - Gold medalist Hanna Oeberg of Sweden celebrates during the victory ceremony.

I don’t think anyone understands how big this is,” she added.\n“It’s so emotional. It’s so unbelievably big.”\nSlideshow (4 Images) The Swedish biathlon team has worked extremely hard in preparation for the Pyeongchang Games.\n“It’s a lot of time, high intensity, and at times you’re so worn out you don’t know if you can deal with it. That’s our strength - in that team spirit we have. We’re happy for each other when it goes well and we support each other when it’s tough,” Brorsson said.\nBrorsson may have been convinced that her team mate was headed for the top step of the podium, but Oeberg revealed that she wasn’t sure until her long wait was nearly over.\n“I didn’t see the miss (by Dahlmeier), but when I saw on the last lap that she wasn’t closing the gap I knew,” she said.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T13:46:13.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
