British Columbia announced last week a tax deal with Airbnb Inc, a popular home-sharing website.\n($1 = 1.2590 Canadian dollars)\nReporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T02:43:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
