Noble has defended its accounts.\nThe company's market value has fallen to just S$259 million($197 million) from the $6 billion it commanded in February 2015. Noble said the latest profit guidance and ranges were estimates and may change as it finalizes its annual results, which will be announced on February 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T11:42:52.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
