However, the mixed results triggered varied responses from analysts. At least three brokerages raised their target price on the company’s stock largely banking on the possibility of cash returns, while three cut price targets.\n“(Apple‘s) cash return should support the stock, but we see little to drive upside,” KeyBanc analysts said.\nReporting by Muvija M and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:46:12.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
