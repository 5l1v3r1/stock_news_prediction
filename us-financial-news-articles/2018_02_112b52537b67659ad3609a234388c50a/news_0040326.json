So if I would’ve won silver I’d also be very happy still, so this gold is ... this is a special day for sure.”\nAn emphasis on culture can be a cliche among elite sports teams, but for a small country like Norway, it’s imperative, according to Norway Alpine team director Claus Ryste.\n“We are a small nation with very little resources and we have to keep it tight and real,” he told reporters.\n“The team shows its strength, the coaches and the other athletes. I think the strength that Kjetil, Aksel and Aleks (Aamodt Kilde) have together also makes us stronger than the others.”\nAttention to detail also seems to be key, as anyone who would care to listen to Ryste’s exhaustive analysis of the quality of the local snow and its effect on his skiers’ performances would attest.\nBeing so dry, the snow crystals were sharp and “grippy”, he said, requiring brute strength from his skiers not to dig down on the edges of their skis and be slowed.\n“I think strong physical training is the secret. (A) strong physical condition programme keeps you more healthy,” added Ryste.\nDespite a litany of serious injuries through his long career, none were stronger than Svindal on the piste and his longevity is inspiring for 32-year-old Jansrud.\n“Normally you can go until you are 36, 37 but it’s all about the health, your mindset, if it’s fun, if you are fast naturally,” he said.\n”Aksel can ski for many years to come and still be fast.\n“I am excited for what is to come. I can’t promise four more years but with the track record (we have) it seems like a good idea to try.”\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:38:27.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
