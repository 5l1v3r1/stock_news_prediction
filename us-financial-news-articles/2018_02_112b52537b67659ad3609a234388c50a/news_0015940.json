Then we’ll start worrying about the future.” \nValencia have not reached the final for 10 years, with Ronald Koeman leading them to the trophy in 2008 after knocking Barca out in the last four. \n“I don’t know if we deserve it or not but what I can assure you is that we want it,” Valencia coach Marcelino said. \n”We are playing against the clear favourites for the competition and with an adverse result. The players are convinced they can do it and we’re going to give everything. \n“We expect a long and complicated game but we’re going to make things very difficult for Barca.” Reporting by Richard Martin, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:08:42.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
