LASER FOCUS \nOvercoming the injury undoubtedly helped her develop a cold, mental toughness and laser focus on her own performances, rather than that of her rivals like Evgenia Medvedeva and Alina Zagitova, both Olympic Athletes from Russia. \n“I focus on myself because that’s all I can control. There’s no sense in worrying about something that’s out of my control,” she said. \n“I have a job to do, and if I go out there and do my job, and whether I end up ahead of them or behind them, I know I’ve done my best and I’ll be happy with that.” \nOther skaters have complained about the early time for the competitions, which are normally held in the evening, but this, too, Tennell takes in stride. \nShe is normally up at 4 a.m. as a matter of course. \n“I feel more productive when I get up early. I feel like I get more done with my day,” she said. \nHer mother and both her younger brothers will be in the stands to cheer her on, although her mother is currently so busy touring South Korea the two have yet to catch up. \n“It means everything to me,” she said. \n“My family has been here with me on this crazy journey from the beginning, so I feel that it’s only right they be here to see this destination.” Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T08:30:49.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
