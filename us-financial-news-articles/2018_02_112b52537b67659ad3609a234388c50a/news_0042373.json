Both male and female attendees sported badges name-checking the “Time’s Up” campaign against sexual harassment. \nBritish newspaper The Observer had earlier published an open letter calling for sexual harassment and abuse to be stamped out, signed by 190 actresses including British Oscar winners Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet and Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan. \n“This movement is bigger than just a change in our industry alone. This movement is intersectional, with conversations across race, class, community, ability and work environment, to talk about the imbalance of power,” said the letter, whose signatories also included Sophie Okonedo, Olivia Colman, Carey Mulligan and Emma Watson. \nThe #MeToo and Time’s Up movements have seen victims use social media to share their stories of harassment and abuse as allegations have emerged in recent months of sexual misconduct by many powerful men in business, politics and entertainment. \nAdditional reporting by Jayson Mansaray; Writing by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T21:34:23.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
