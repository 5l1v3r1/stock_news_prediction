It has been my privilege to identify and recruit Steve to the Board of Directors to help the Company achieve its goals.”\nSince 1995, Mr. Domenik has served as a general partner of Sevin Rosen Funds, a venture capital firm. From 2010 to 2016, Mr. Domenik served on the board of directors of Pixelworks, Inc., and, from February 2016 to April 2016, Mr. Domenik served as its Interim Chief Executive Officer.
