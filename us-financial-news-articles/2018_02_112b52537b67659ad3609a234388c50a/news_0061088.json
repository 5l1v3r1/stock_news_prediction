(NYSE: BWXT) (“BWXT” or the “Company”) reported fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $430 million, a 6.5% increase compared to $404 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter 2017 was $16 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $34 million, or $0.34 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Results were unfavorably impacted by tax reform in the amount of $55 million, primarily related to one-time, non-cash deferred tax asset write-downs. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $48 million, or $0.47 per share, compared to $47 million, or $0.46 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. A reconciliation of non-GAAP results is detailed in Exhibit 1.\nFull year 2017 revenue was $1.69 billion, an 8.8% increase compared to $1.55 billion in 2016. GAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the full year 2017, which include the $0.54 tax reform impact described above and an $0.07 unfavorable impact of non-cash, mark-to-market loss for pension and other post-retirement benefits, was $1.47 compared to $1.76 in 2016. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year 2017 was $2.05 compared to $1.76 in the prior year.\n“BWXT had solid fourth quarter results and a capstone to an outstanding 2017 while continuing to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders,” said John A. Fees, Executive Chairman. “The company grew EPS a remarkable 16 percent on top of 9 percent revenue growth. The NPG team completed the integration of BWXT Nuclear Energy Canada, which we believe will continue to offer significant long-term value for the Company. NOG continued to produce record results with a 22.8% operating margin for the year. Lastly, NSG continued to leverage our environmental management credentials to win new key multi-billion dollar contracts, including the Savannah River Site liquid waste services contract and the Los Alamos National Laboratory legacy cleanup contract.”\n“I am also pleased to announce that the Board of Directors approved a 45 percent quarterly dividend increase to 16 cents per share. This represents our third increase in the cash dividend, which is now up 167 percent since the spin,” Fees continued, “The increase demonstrates confidence in our long-term outlook and our ability to generate cash and maximize shareholder value within our balanced capital allocation approach.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Segment Results\nNuclear Operations Group (NOG) segment revenue was $309 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a 6.7% decrease from the prior-year period. Full year segment revenue was $1.27 billion, up slightly compared to 2016. NOG operating income was $69.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an 8.8% decrease from the prior-year period. Full year segment operating income was a record $289.9 million, an 8.0% increase compared to 2016.\nNuclear Power Group (NPG) segment revenue was a record $85.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a 105.7% increase from the prior-year period. Full year segment revenue was also a record at $285.8 million, a 76.9% increase compared to 2016, inclusive of $93 million attributed to the BWXT Nuclear Energy Canada acquisition. NPG operating income was $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 149.1% increase from the prior-year period. Full year segment GAAP operating income was $40.0 million, a 6.6% decrease compared to 2016 on a GAAP basis and a 43% increase on a non-GAAP basis.\nNuclear Services Group (NSG) segment operating income was $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up significantly from the prior-year period. Full year segment GAAP operating income was $23.1 million, an 89.9% increase compared to 2016. Full year segment adjusted (non-GAAP) operating income was $15.2 million, a 25.0% increase compared to 2016.\n“Our 2017 results were driven by superior execution from the entire BWXT team,” said Rex D. Geveden, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our backlog remains robust at $4 billion, with NPG backlog up an outstanding 35% in 2017. Our strong backlog coupled with our growth strategy gives us confidence in meeting our strong expectations for 2018 and beyond. We expect to drive future growth through a combination of organic demand, research and development-driven new products, and attractive M&A opportunities. Our balanced capital deployment approach remains unchanged, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share buybacks, while also providing the capital needed for organic growth and retaining the capacity for accretive acquisitions.”\nLiquidity and Debt\nThe Company generated net cash from operating activities of $77.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with net cash from operating activities of $147.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. At the end of the fourth quarter, the Company’s cash and short-term investments position, net of restricted cash, was $206.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, outstanding balances under our credit facility included $513.1 million in term loans, no revolving line of credit borrowings, and $75.9 million in letters of credit. As a result, the Company had $324.1 million of remaining availability under its credit facility, excluding an additional $250 million accordion provision.\nQuarterly Dividend\nOn February 22, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share. The dividend will be payable on March 29, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 12, 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nInitial guidance for expected adjusted earnings per share for 2018 is between $2.45 and $2.55, which excludes mark-to-market adjustments for pension and post-retirement benefits. Initial guidance for 2018 revenue is expected to be between $1.75 billion and $1.85 billion. The Company also expects the following for 2018:\nNOG revenue in a range of $1.3 to $1.4 billion and operating margin in the high teens with upside potential NPG revenue in a range of $300 to $350 million and operating margin of approximately 12% NSG operating income of approximately $20 million Research and development costs of approximately $15 million Corporate unallocated costs of approximately $20 million Other income primarily related to pension and other post-employment benefit plans in a range of $30 to $35 million Effective non-GAAP tax rate in a range of 22% to 25% An increase in capital expenditures to approximately $250 million to support growth initiatives across the company Depreciation and amortization of approximately $60 million\nLong-term Outlook\nThe company reiterates its long-term guidance that beyond 2017, we anticipate an EPS Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in the low-double digits over a three to five year period based on a robust organic growth strategy and balance sheet capacity.\nConference Call to Discuss Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results\nDate: Wednesday, February 28, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. EST\nLive Webcast: Investor Relations section of website at www.bwxt.com\nForward-Looking Statements\nBWXT cautions that this release contains , including, without limitation, statements relating to backlog, to the extent they may be viewed as an indicator of future revenues, anticipated benefits of BWXT Nuclear Energy Canada Inc., management’s plans and expectations for the NOG, NPG and NSG segments, as well as our outlook and guidance for 2018 and beyond.
