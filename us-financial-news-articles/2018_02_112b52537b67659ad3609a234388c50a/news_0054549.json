A similar emergency appeal failed earlier this month when it was turned down by Justice Samuel Alito .\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court last month invalidated the congressional districts drawn by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2011, ruling the map was an unlawful partisan gerrymander aimed at maximizing the electoral success of Republican candidates.\nThe court’s majority based its ruling on the state’s Constitution, giving federal judges little room to intervene.\nAfter the legislature and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf failed to agree on a replacement map, the state court on Monday presented its own map . The court said the redrawn districts are to take effect right away, for use in the May 15 primary elections and the general election in November.\nThe plaintiffs in Thursday’s lawsuit, who include state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, argue the state court violated the Elections Clause of the federal Constitution. They want the federal court to bar state election officials from implementing the new map and to compel them to carry out the May 15 primary using the current districts.\nThe lawsuit criticized the new map as unfairly benefiting Democrats. “Far from being free of politics, it appears that every choice made in the Court Drawn Plan was to pack Republicans into as few districts as possible, while advantaging Democrats,” the suit said. Seven of the eight members of Congress who are suing are running for re-election in districts that have “drastically changed,” the suit says.\nPolitical analysts say under the court-imposed map, Democrats could pick up several congressional seats in November, aiding the party’s effort to retake the U.S. House. Democrats won only five of Pennsylvania’s 18 seats in Congress under the old map, even though statewide elections are usually close.\nA spokeswoman for Pennsylvania’s Department of State said that state officials were focused on implementing the court-ordered map. “We have made significant progress and have nearly completed the necessary database updates and will proceed on this course unless ordered otherwise by the courts,” it said.\nStanton Jones, a lawyer representing the 18 voters who successfully challenged the congressional map in state court, called Thursday’s suit baseless and “the latest in a series of vexatious tactics by Pennsylvania Republican leaders attempting to cling to the unconstitutional 2011 map.”\nWrite to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T03:22:47.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
