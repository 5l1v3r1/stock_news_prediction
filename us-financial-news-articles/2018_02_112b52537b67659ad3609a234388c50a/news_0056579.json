At year end, we announced that we agreed to sell four senior living communities for $368 million and we expect to report a gain of approximately $308 million on this sale. During the 2017 fourth quarter, we acquired four medical office buildings and two senior living communities for aggregate consideration of $120 million at attractive cap rates and subsequent to year end, we acquired three medical office buildings and two senior living communities for $133 million.”\nResults for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017:\nNet income attributable to common shareholders was $65.0 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $42.9 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This increase in net income attributable to common shareholders is primarily the result of a $46.1 million gain on sale of properties recognized for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as well as acquisitions since October 1, 2016, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of $33.7 million of business management incentive fee expense recognized for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as a result of SNH's total shareholder return, as defined, exceeding the returns for the SNL U.S. REIT Healthcare index over the applicable three year measurement period ended December 31, 2017. Normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, were $59.2 million and $118.6 million, respectively, or $0.25 and $0.50 per diluted share, respectively, for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nReconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to funds from operations, or FFO, and Normalized FFO for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 appear later in this press release.\nResults for the Year Ended December 31, 2017:\nNet income attributable to common shareholders was $147.6 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $141.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in net income attributable to common shareholders is primarily the result of a $46.1 million gain on sale of properties recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017, acquisitions since January 1, 2016 and decreases in depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition and certain other transaction related costs and asset impairment charges, partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses as a result of $55.7 million of business management incentive fee expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of SNH's total shareholder return, as defined, exceeding the returns for the SNL U.S. REIT Healthcare index over the applicable three year measurement period ended December 31, 2017. Normalized FFO were $375.3 million and $446.4 million, respectively, or $1.58 and $1.88 per diluted share, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nReconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders determined in accordance with GAAP to FFO and Normalized FFO for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 appear later in this press release.\nPortfolio Operating Results:\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, 45.1% of net operating income, or NOI, came from 235 triple net leased senior living communities with 25,790 living units. As a result of increased capital investments, which increase rents and may disrupt community operations during expansions and renovations, along with other factors, the weighted average rent coverage for triple net leased senior living communities decreased to 1.21x for the 12 month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to 1.28x for the 12 month period ended September 30, 2016 (1)(2) . Cash basis net operating income, or Cash Basis NOI, from triple net leased senior living communities owned continuously since October 1, 2016, or same property, increased 0.9% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, 39.0% of NOI came from 125 properties leased to medical providers, medical related businesses, clinics and biotech laboratory tenants, or MOBs, with 12.1 million leasable square feet. As of December 31, 2017, 95.0% of MOB square feet were leased compared to 96.5% as of December 31, 2016. Same property occupancy at MOBs was 94.9% as of December 31, 2017 compared to 96.4% as of December 31, 2016.

Occupancy at managed senior living communities was 85.9% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 85.2% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Same property occupancy at managed senior living communities was 87.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 86.5% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Same property average monthly rates at managed senior living communities increased by 0.9% to $4,262 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Same property Cash Basis NOI from managed senior living communities decreased 3.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nSNH's 10 wellness centers remained 100% leased as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and provided SNH with Cash Basis NOI of $4.4 million in each of the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nConsolidated same property Cash Basis NOI decreased 0.7% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nReconciliations of net income determined in accordance with GAAP to same property Cash Basis NOI by operating segment for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 appear later in this press release.\nFinancing Activities:\nIn December 2017, SNH prepaid approximately $8.4 million of secured debt encumbering one MOB with an annual interest rate of 6.73% and a maturity date in April 2018.\nIn January 2018, SNH prepaid approximately $4.3 million of secured debt encumbering one senior living community with an annual interest rate of 4.375% and a maturity date in September 2043.\nIn February 2018, SNH issued $500.0 million of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2028. SNH used the net proceeds of this offering to reduce the outstanding balance under its revolving credit facility.\nInvestment Activities:\nIn October 2017, SNH acquired two MOBs (two buildings) located in Minnesota and North Carolina with a total of approximately 255,000 square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $38.5 million, excluding closing costs.\nIn November 2017, SNH acquired one MOB (one building) located in California with approximately 63,000 square feet for approximately $26.5 million, excluding closing costs.\nIn November 2017, SNH agreed to acquire six senior living communities from Five Star Senior Living Inc. (Nasdaq: FVE), or Five Star, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $104.0 million, including SNH’s assumption of approximately $33.7 million of mortgage debt secured by certain of these senior living communities and excluding closing costs. In December 2017, SNH acquired two of these communities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $39.2 million, excluding closing costs. In January 2018, SNH acquired one of these communities for approximately $19.7 million, excluding closing costs. In February 2018, SNH acquired one of these communities for approximately $22.2 million, including the assumption of approximately $16.8 million of mortgage debt and excluding closing costs. In connection with these acquisitions, SNH entered management and pooling agreements with Five Star for Five Star to manage these senior living communities for SNH, and SNH expects to enter additional management and pooling agreements with Five Star concurrent with the acquisition of the remaining two communities. The closings of the acquisitions of the remaining two communities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $23.3 million, including SNH's assumption of approximately $16.8 million of mortgage debt, are expected to occur as third party approvals are received by the end of the first quarter of 2018.\nIn December 2017, SNH acquired one MOB (one building) located in Virginia with approximately 136,000 square feet for approximately $15.6 million, excluding closing costs.\nIn January 2018, SNH acquired three MOBs (three buildings) located in Kansas, Missouri and California with a total of approximately 400,000 square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $91.2 million, excluding closing costs.\nIn November 2017, SNH entered an agreement to acquire one MOB (one building) located in Virginia with approximately 135,000 square feet for approximately $22.8 million, including the assumption of approximately $11.2 million of mortgage debt and excluding closing costs.

SNH regularly makes additional investments at its MOBs and its managed senior living communities that it expects may maintain or enhance the competitive positions of those properties and may increase its operating revenue from those properties.\nDisposition Activities:\nIn December 2017, SNH agreed to sell four senior living communities with a total of 1,619 living units that were leased to Sunrise Senior Living, LLC, or Sunrise, for an aggregate sales price of $368.0 million, excluding closing costs. The sale of one of these communities was completed in December 2017 for a sales price of $55.0 million, excluding closing costs, resulting in a gain of approximately $45.9 million. SNH expects the closings of the sales of the remaining three senior living communities, for an aggregate sales price of $313.0 million, to occur by the end of the first quarter of 2018. These four communities produced rental income to SNH during 2017 of approximately $14.8 million. SNH expects to realize a total of approximately $308.0 million from the sale of these four Sunrise leased communities.\nAt December 31, 2017, four senior living communities, including the three communities leased to Sunrise that are discussed above and one additional community leased to Five Star, were classified as held for sale.\nConference Call:\nOn Tuesday, February 27, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, President and Chief Operating Officer, David Hegarty, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Richard Siedel, and Senior Vice President of The RMR Group LLC, Jennifer Francis, will host a conference call to discuss SNH's fourth quarter 2017 financial results.

FFO is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is net income attributable to common shareholders, calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties and loss on impairment of real estate assets, if any, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and the difference between net income attributable to common shareholders and FFO attributable to noncontrolling interest, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to SNH. SNH’s calculation of Normalized FFO differs from Nareit’s definition of FFO because SNH includes business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of SNH’s core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year, and SNH excludes acquisition and certain other transaction related costs expensed under GAAP such as legal and professional fees associated with SNH's acquisition and disposition activities, gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt, if any, and Normalized FFO from noncontrolling interest, net of FFO attributable to noncontrolling interest, if any. SNH considers FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income attributable to common shareholders and operating income. SNH believes that FFO and Normalized FFO provide useful information to investors, because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization expense, FFO and Normalized FFO may facilitate a comparison of SNH's operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by SNH’s Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to its shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain SNH’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in SNH’s revolving credit facility and term loan agreements and SNH’s public debt covenants, the availability to SNH of debt and equity capital, SNH’s expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance and SNH’s expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its obligations. FFO and Normalized FFO do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income, net income attributable to common shareholders or operating income as indicators of SNH’s operating performance or as measures of SNH’s liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to common shareholders and operating income as presented in SNH’s consolidated statements of income. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than SNH does. (2) Incentive fees under SNH’s business management agreement are payable after the end of each calendar year, are calculated based on common share total return, as defined, and are included in general and administrative expense in SNH’s consolidated statements of income. In calculating net income attributable to common shareholders in accordance with GAAP, SNH recognizes estimated business management incentive fee expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters. Although SNH recognizes this expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters for purposes of calculating net income attributable to common shareholders, SNH does not include these amounts in the calculation of Normalized FFO until the fourth quarter, when the amount of the business management incentive fee expense for the calendar year, if any, is determined. Excluding business management incentive fee expense of $55,740 included in Normalized FFO for the three months ended December 31, 2017, Normalized FFO per share for this period would have been $0.48.

SNH calculates NOI and Cash Basis NOI as shown above. SNH defines NOI as income from its real estate less its property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that SNH records as depreciation and amortization. SNH defines Cash Basis NOI as NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fee amortization, if any, and non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses. SNH considers NOI and Cash Basis NOI to be appropriate supplemental measures to net income because they may help both investors and management to understand the operations of SNH’s properties. SNH uses NOI and Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company wide property level performance, and it believes that NOI and Cash Basis NOI provide useful information to investors regarding its results of operations because these measures reflect only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of its operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI and Cash Basis NOI do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income, net income attributable to common shareholders or operating income as indicators of SNH’s operating performance or as measures of SNH’s liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to common shareholders and operating income as presented in SNH’s consolidated statements of income. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI and Cash Basis NOI differently than SNH does. (2) SNH recorded a liability for the amount by which the estimated fair value for accounting purposes exceeded the price SNH paid for its investment in RMR Inc. common stock in June 2015. A portion of this liability is being amortized on a straight line basis through December 31, 2035 as a reduction to property management fee expense, which is included in property operating expenses.
