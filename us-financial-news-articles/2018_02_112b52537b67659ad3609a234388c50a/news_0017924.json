GERMAN SENSITIVITIES \nWhile the strategy will not revive a much larger Cold War-era Atlantic Command disbanded in 2002, it would broaden NATO’s new deterrent against Russia, which involves rotating forces in the Baltics, Poland and in the Black Sea region. \nRussia’s Crimea annexation, its direct support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and what the West says is a deliberate disinformation campaign to undermine U.S. and European democracies have unnerved governments. \nMany in the West were also alarmed by Moscow’s war games in September that massed tens of thousands of troops and may have tested electronic warfare on Latvia, NATO officials say. \nBen Hodges, who recently retired as commander of U.S. Army in Europe, had long called for Germany to take on a bigger role in managing logistics and transportation needs for the alliance. \nNational and European Union border regulations make moving military equipment and soldiers slow and costly. \nThe issue is sensitive, however. Germany wants to keep talking to Moscow and has chafed at a proposed name of ‘Rear Area Operations Command’ for the logistics base that could imply that NATO was preparing for war. \nThey want to see the name of the command changed to ‘Allied Command Operations Support Command’. \nHosting the command will include responsibility for air defense and cybersecurity, as well as the training and movement of follow-on forces, one official said. \n“This is not just a matter of making sure the trains run on time,” the official said.
