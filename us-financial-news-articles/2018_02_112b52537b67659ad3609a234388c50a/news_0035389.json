Such a move could further stoke expectations that Sky is worth more than Fox has agreed to pay.\n“There’s a lot going on now,” Odey said of Comcast’s potential interest.\nLike Odey, hedge fund Polygon has questioned the price that Fox has offered and said in December that it thought Sky was worth more than 13 pounds a share.\nElliott, the U.S. hedge fund best-known for its activist campaigns at companies, including forcing bidders to pay more during takeovers, has also been stakebuilding in Sky recently and lifted its interest to 1.99 percent last week.\nElliott has not given a reason for its Sky investment and declined to comment on Wednesday.\nEditing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:22:27.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
