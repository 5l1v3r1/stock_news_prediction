Increasing rates also could indicate a tightening of economic conditions.\n“I think the turnaround in the equity market was more associated with an improving economy and removing the focus on the yield environment,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.\n“The market switched its attention to, ‘OK, we have an expanding economy, it’s not running so hot that I have to be overly worried about interest rates.’”\nPavlik and McMillion favor sectors that should perform well during an improving economy, including financials and consumer discretionary stocks.\nSince October, the S&P 500 and 10-year Treasury yields have been positively correlated, moving in the same direction, when viewed over a mid-term, 60-day period, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nBut the move higher came as bond yields were rising off of very low levels. The benchmark 10-year yield hovered on Thursday around 2.90 percent after touching a more-than four year high during the session.\n“If the economy is accelerating then we should be able to handle higher bond yields and not derail the economy,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “If growth is accelerating and moving higher, then along the way we can handle higher levels.”\nThe biggest risk from rates is a fast move higher in yields that catches the market off guard, as opposed to breaching a specific level, Delwiche said.\nBut if the benchmark 10-year tops 3 percent, that could cause some fear for stock investors, said Brian Shepardson, portfolio manager for the James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund, in Alpha, Ohio.\n“If higher rates are what caused the market to pull back, that is still a concern,“ Shepardson said. ”Nothing has changed fundamentally within the market.”\nReporting by Lewis Krauskopf; additional reporting by Megan Davies; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:49:39.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
