Acquisitions accounted for a 3 percent increase in revenue. Net income attributable to TransUnion was $245 million, compared with $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share was $1.29, including the impact from U.S. tax reform, compared with $0.27 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increases in net income attributable to TransUnion and diluted earnings per share were significantly impacted by the estimated tax provision benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $196 million, an increase of 16 percent (15 percent on a constant currency basis) compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.8 percent, the same as the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share was $0.50, an increase of 13 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share exclude the estimated one-time tax provision benefit of $174 million due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other certain other adjustments.\n“TransUnion reported a solid fourth quarter to cap a strong year in 2017,” said Jim Peck, President and CEO. “In fact, this marks the third consecutive year in which we’ve delivered double-digit revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS growth. Over those three years, our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by about 400 basis points.\n“We delivered these strong results by executing a strategy built on innovation, expansion in attractive vertical and geographic markets and an ongoing focus on enabling and empowering consumers while fully leveraging our enterprise capabilities.\n“We have also allocated capital strategically and prudently. That strategy continues to evolve with today’s announcement that our Board of Directors has approved a dividend policy. At the same time, we will be opportunistic in using the remainder of our share buyback authorization.\n“What is not changing is our top priority to always fully invest in the robust pipeline of organic and inorganic opportunities which have been essential to our growth and will be for the long term.\n“With a track record of strong performance and sound capital allocation, we believe that TransUnion is very well positioned for further success in 2018 and beyond.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Segment Results\nU.S. Information Services (USIS)\nUSIS revenue was $312 million, an increase of 16 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOnline Data Services revenue was $200 million, an increase of 18 percent over the prior year.

Diluted earnings per share was $2.32 compared with $0.65 for the full year of 2016.

Cash used in investing activities was $481 million compared with $496 million in 2016, due primarily to slightly lower cash used for acquisitions and purchases of other investments. Capital expenditures were $135 million compared with $124 million in 2016. Cash used in financing activities was $54 million compared with a source of cash of $154 million in 2016. The change was due primarily to cash used for our stock buy-back program and lower borrowings in 2017 compared with 2016.\n2018 Full Year Outlook\nFor the full year of 2018, revenue is expected to be between $2.12 billion and $2.14 billion, an increase of 9 to 10 percent on a constant currency basis.

This allows financial results to be evaluated without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This earnings release also presents Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, segment Adjusted Operating Income, segment Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share. These are important financial measures for the Company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. We present these financial measures as supplemental measures of our operating performance because we believe they provide meaningful information regarding our performance and provide a basis to compare operating results between periods. We present Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income as supplemental measures of our operating performance because these measures eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. Also, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours. In addition, our board of directors and executive management team use Adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure. Furthermore, under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is tied to a ratio based on Adjusted EBITDA. These financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of GAAP. Other companies in our industry may define or calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, including operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate, net income (loss) attributable to the Company, earnings per share or cash provided by operating activities. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the attached Schedules.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion plus net interest expense, plus (less) provision (benefit) for income taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, plus stock-based compensation, plus mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and business optimization expenses, plus technology transformation expenses, plus (less) certain other expenses (income). Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income plus stock-based compensation, plus mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and business optimization expenses, plus technology transformation expenses, plus (less) certain other expenses (income), plus amortization of certain intangible assets. Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as adjusted provision for income taxes divided by adjusted income before income taxes. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion plus stock-based compensation, plus mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and business optimization expenses, plus technology transformation expenses, plus (less) certain other expenses (income), plus amortization of certain intangible assets, plus or minus the related changes in provision for income taxes, less the one-time tax provision benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The above definitions apply to our calculations for the historical periods shown on schedules 1 through 6 and for the periods covered by our guidance shown on Schedule 7.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
