They haven’t decided who the seller will be yet, but they are accepting bids from registered contractors until February 5, 2018.\nThese flutes must be Lillian Burkart Flutes with French leather covered cases. They must be new items, no remanufactured or previously used flutes accepted. Further specifications can be found by searching Solicitation ID 0011087634 on the federal business opportunities website or by using the Advanced Procurement Portal .\nOfferors should keep in mind that shipping will be included in the offered price and a lower bid must be $100 better than the last offer. The buyer (Mission and Installation Contracting Command) expects delivery within thirty days after the award determination to Virginia Beach, VA.\nThe bids will be placed on Fedbid.com , a third-party site that manages some of the government’s procurement processes. All businesses must be resisted to submit bids on Fedbid and registered in the government’s System for Award Management (SAM). Third-party registration firms are also available for assistance with SAM registration.\nUS Federal Contractor Registration (USFCR) is the world’s largest third-party government registration firm. They not only register companies on their behalf in SAM, but also have pioneered the Advanced Procurement Portal (APP). From learning about how to bid, to finding opportunities, to managing the timeline on a specific opportunity such as this one, APP provides it all. Active and historical federal business opportunity information sits in the same place as a list of active federal buyers and vendors. The synthesis of this data paired with easy access will simplify the federal procurement process for businesses who may then dedicate their complete effort toward their performance on the contract instead of the acquisition of it.\nIf you would like more information please contact David Rockwell at (877) 252-2700 ext.750 or by email at drockwell@usfcrgov.com .
