New York, Florida and the remaining states pay somewhere in between.\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo is among the lawmakers already weighing a move to the higher \"fair\" wage.\nROC's national day of action on Tuesday included rallies in Philadelphia, Seattle, and Oakland, as well as actions in Washington, D.C., Detroit, New Orleans and Oakland, California.\nThe restaurant industry, which employs half of American women at some point in their lives, has an advantage over other industries when it comes to addressing sexual harassment because it was already advocating for a clear policy solution when the #MeToo social media movement against harassment gained momentum late last year, said Jayaraman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T14:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T17:02:15.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
