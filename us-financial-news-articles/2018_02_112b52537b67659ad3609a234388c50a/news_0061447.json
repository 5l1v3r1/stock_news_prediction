Against the yen, the euro hit a five-month low of 130.82 yen and was last down 0.3 percent at 130.96 yen.\nAnalysts have said the euro could be subject to potential swings in price as Italians prepare to vote in a national election on Sunday, and the leading political parties in Germany decide on a coalition deal that could secure Angela Merkel a fourth term as chancellor.
