Several aftershocks hit the area but there was no word of any tsunami warning. \nThe government said 214 people had been injured. \nHualien is home to about 100,000 people and streets were buckled by the force of the quake. \n“The president has asked the cabinet and related ministries to immediately launch the ‘disaster mechanism’ and to work at the fastest rate on disaster relief work,” President Tsai Ing-wen’s office said in a statement. \nPremier William Lai said the government was urgently repairing a major highway damaged by the quake.
