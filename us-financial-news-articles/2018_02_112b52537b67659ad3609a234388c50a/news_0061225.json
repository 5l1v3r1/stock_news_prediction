I said that this reconstruction could take the city five or six years,” Mancera said on the sidelines of a Women4Climate conference in the city on Monday.\nImproving air quality remains a key priority, said Mancera in an interview held in the city center museum, as Greenpeace activists outside carried a banner reading “In Mexico City the air is killing us”.\nCleaning up industry remains a major hurdle, as does plugging the leaks responsible for the loss of at least 35 percent of the city’s water as it travels through 12,000 kms (7,500 miles) of pipes, he said.\nEngineers are drilling 2-kilometre-deep wells to find new water sources, said Mancera, who noted greater investment in the network and more water reuse could alleviate shortages.\nDespite the lack of water in the capital - where aquifer depletion is causing subsidence - Mancera dismissed any possibility that Mexico City could run dry and face its own “day zero” like South Africa’s Cape Town.\n“I don’t think we’ll reach ‘day zero’ but we need more investment and we also need to reuse water - it’s another very important point that should be on government agendas,” he said.\nReporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Robert Carmichael.
