Futures markets <0#YIB:> are not fully pricing in a 25 basis point hike until early 2019.\nThe RBA cautioned that a rising Australian dollar AUD=D4 could also dampen the outlook. The Aussie climbed 8.7 percent in 2017 and is already up about 1 percent so far this year.\nReporting by Swati Pandey and Wayne ColeEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T04:26:06.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
