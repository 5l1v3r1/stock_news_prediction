Bozdag told reporters the justice, interior and foreign ministries were working for Muslim’s extradition.\nMuslim was co-chair of the PYD, the major component of the coalition that runs autonomous parts of northern Syria. Ankara sees the PYD as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK, which has waged a three-decade insurgency on Turkish soil.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T00:00:12.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
