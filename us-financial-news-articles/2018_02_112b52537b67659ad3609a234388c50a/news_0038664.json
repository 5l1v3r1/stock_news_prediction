For the week, the contract has risen about 4 percent after losing nearly 10 percent last week.\nLondon Brent crude LCOc1 was up 25 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $64.58 after settling down 3 cents. Brent is up nearly 3 percent for the week after falling more than 8 percent last week.\n“Oil is getting support from a rebound in global stock markets and a weak dollar, but the upside is limited due to a projection for rising U.S. production,” said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo.\n“The market is quiet due to a slew of holidays in Asia.”\nThe dollar slipped to a three-year low against a basket of currencies on Friday. A weaker dollar often boosts prices for oil and other dollar-denominated commodities.

[nL4N1Q615R]\nOil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia aim to draft an agreement on a long-term alliance by the end of this year, United Arab Emirates energy minister Suhail al-Mazroui said on Thursday.\nOPEC and non-OPEC producers including Russia have been restraining production by a total 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in a bid to prop up prices under a deal that is to expire at the end of 2018.\nThe move comes at a time when Asian demand is on the rise. India imported a record 4.93 million bpd in January to feed its expanded refining capacity and meet rising demand, data showed.\nOil won support earlier in the week after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC hopes to keep limiting crude output to leave the market tight.\nHowever, surging U.S. production is offsetting OPEC’s efforts to curb supplies. U.S. crude output hit a record 10.27 million barrels per day last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday, making it a bigger producer than Saudi Arabia.\nReporting by Osamu TsukimoriEditing by Richard Pullin and Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T06:01:10.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
