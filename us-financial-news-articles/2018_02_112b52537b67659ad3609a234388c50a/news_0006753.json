Broadcom’s previous $70 per share offer consisted of $60 per share in cash and $10 per share in stock.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nBroadcom also plans to offer Qualcomm a higher-than-usual breakup fee in the event regulators thwart the deal, according to the sources. Typically, such break-up fees equate to approximately 3 percent to 4 percent of a deal’s size. \nThe sources cautioned that Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan may decide to significantly change the terms at the last minute. \nThe sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Broadcom and Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Additional reporting by Liana B.
