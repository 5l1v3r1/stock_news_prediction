The value of the deal has since been revised to $63.5 billion as Monsanto reduced its debt load.\nThe companies are waiting for approval of the deal in jurisdictions including the European Union and the United States, where final rulings are still pending.\nFILE PHOTO: A Monsanto logo is pictured in the company headquarters in Morges, Switzerland, May 25, 2016. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo In Brazil, the transaction faced fierce opposition from soy and cotton growers as well as seed producers who thought it would give the combining companies excessive market power.\nRachel Mendonça, an attorney who represented three associations against the deal, highlighted Cade’s imposition of limits on licensing and sales practices by the new company, but conceded she had lost the argument for more asset sales in Brazil.\nEarlier this week, Bayer said in a statement it had proposed solutions to allay antitrust concerns in the EU. Bayer had agreed to sell seed and herbicide businesses to BASF for 5.9 billion euros ($7.24 billion). It emerged this week the offer would also involve divestments of vegetable seeds business in some EU countries, a source familiar with the matter said.\nMost of Cade’s board said those measures would be enough to address antitrust concerns laid out by its technical staff in October, when it recommended the deal be blocked or approved with conditions.\n($1 = 0.82 euro)\nReporting by Bruno Federowski and Leonardo Goy; Additional reporting by Ana Mano in São Paulo; Writing by Bruno Federowski and Ana Mano; Editing by Tom Brown and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T05:39:40.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
