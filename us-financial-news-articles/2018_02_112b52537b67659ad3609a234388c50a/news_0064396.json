The Company also provided its full-year 2018 net sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance.\n“Our rare disease medicines generated better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, with net sales increasing 60 percent for the full year, underscoring the value of our diversification initiatives over the last several years,” said Timothy P. Walbert, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Horizon Pharma plc. “We made significant progress in 2017, doubling the KRYSTEXXA commercial organization and expanding our pipeline with the acquisition of teprotumumab, our late-stage fully human monoclonal antibody candidate for the treatment of thyroid eye disease.”\nAdded Walbert, “In 2018, we expect continued strong performance of our rare disease medicines, and we are advancing our strategy to build a pipeline of clinically differentiated medicines and maximize the growth of KRYSTEXXA. We are increasing our investment in R&D to support our Phase 3 confirmatory teprotumumab trial and new rheumatology development programs, as well as investing further in KRYSTEXXA to support our significant growth expectations. These investments, combined with our focus on commercial execution, position us well for strong and sustainable long-term growth.”\nFinancial Highlights (in millions except for per share amounts and percentages) Q4 17 Q4 16 % Change FY 17 FY 16 % Change Net sales (1) $ 274.2 $ 310.3 (12 ) $ 1,056.2 $ 981.1 8 Non-GAAP adjusted net sales (1) 274.2 310.3 (12 ) 1,056.2 1,046.1 1 Net loss (46.4 ) (130.5 ) 64 (410.5 ) (166.8 ) (146 ) Non-GAAP net income 48.4 106.4 (55 ) 194.8 354.4 (45 ) Adjusted EBITDA 102.7 136.4 (25 ) 389.7 470.7 (17 ) Net loss per share - diluted (0.28 ) (0.81 ) 65 (2.52 ) (1.04 ) (142 ) Non-GAAP earnings per share - diluted 0.29 0.64 (55 ) 1.18 2.16 (45 )\n(1) On Sept. 26, 2016, Horizon Pharma agreed to pay Express Scripts $65 million as part of a litigation settlement, which was recorded as a one-time reduction to GAAP net sales for the full-year 2016 in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The exclusion of the $65 million settlement from GAAP net sales is the only adjustment reflected in full-year 2016 non-GAAP adjusted net sales. Fourth-Quarter and Recent Company Highlights\nTotal Net Sales: Fourth-quarter net sales were $274.2 million, driven by continued strong growth from the Company’s orphan and rheumatology business units.\nRare Disease Medicines Net Sales : Fourth-quarter net sales of medicines for rare diseases, which include KRYSTEXXA ® , RAVICTI ® , PROCYSBI ® , ACTIMMUNE ® , BUPHENYL ® and QUINSAIR™, increased 36 percent year over year and represented 58 percent of fourth-quarter 2017 total net sales compared to 38 percent of fourth-quarter 2016 non-GAAP net sales. Net sales of KRYSTEXXA, one of the Company’s key growth drivers, increased 48 percent year over year.\nNew Head of R&D and Chief Scientific Officer : Shao-Lee Lin, M.D., Ph.D., joined Horizon Pharma in January 2018 as executive vice president, head of research and development (R&D) and chief scientific officer. Dr. Lin is an accomplished pharmaceutical executive, physician and scientist with more than 20 years of academic and clinical research experience and will accelerate the development of a robust pipeline to drive the Company’s next phase of growth.\nOrphan Pipeline : In late 2017, the first patient was enrolled in the Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial for teprotumumab, the Company’s fully human monoclonal antibody IGF-1R-inhibitor being studied for the treatment of thyroid eye disease (TED), a rare eye disease.\nRheumatology Pipeline : In January 2018, the Company announced two next-generation uncontrolled gout development programs to support and sustain the Company’s market leadership in uncontrolled gout (chronic gout that is refractory to conventional therapies). HZN-002, a novel dexamethasone conjugate, was also added to the pipeline.\nRAVICTI : In late February 2018, the Company submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to expand the age range for chronic management of urea cycle disorders (UCDs) to birth and older from the current age range of two months of age and older. PROCYSBI : In December 2017, the Company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to expand the age range to include children one year of age and older living with nephropathic cystinosis.\nClinical Development Update\nOrphan Candidates and Programs :\nTeprotumumab: In late 2017, the Company announced enrollment of the first patient in the teprotumumab Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial. Titled OPTIC (Treatment of Graves’ O rbitopathy (Thyroid Eye Disease) to Reduce P roptosis with T eprotumumab I nfusions in a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, C linical Study), the pivotal confirmatory study will evaluate teprotumumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active TED. The study is expected to enroll 76 patients across the United States, Germany and Italy.\nIn early January 2018, following additional analysis of the addressable TED patient population and market opportunity for teprotumumab in the United States, the Company increased its estimated peak annual net sales expectation to more than $750 million from more than $250 million, assuming U.S. FDA approval.\nACTIMMUNE: Three investigator-initiated cancer-combination trials with ACTIMMUNE continue to advance. These studies are evaluating cancer treatment therapies for advanced breast cancer patients, cutaneous T-Cell lymphoma and certain other cancerous solid tumors.\nRheumatology Pipeline Candidates and Programs:\nIn early January 2018, the Company announced several developments in its growing rheumatology pipeline, designed to enhance KRYSTEXXA and the Company’s market leadership in uncontrolled gout, as well as augment its rheumatology business unit.\nHZN-003: A potential next-generation biologic for uncontrolled gout, HZN-003 is a pre-clinical, genetically engineered uricase derivative with optimized uricase and optimized PEGylation technology that has the potential to improve the response rate to the biologic as well as patient convenience through subcutaneous dosing.\nPASylated Uricase Technology : The Company recently entered into a collaboration agreement with XL-protein GmbH to identify clinical-stage product candidates that could use PASylation technology to construct a next-generation gout biologic. The intention is to extend the half-life of uricase to improve the response rate of the biologic as well as patient convenience through subcutaneous dosing.\nHZN-002 : HZN-002 is a pre-clinical, novel dexamethasone conjugate and has potential to address inflammatory diseases through its targeted delivery technology.\nIn addition to the rheumatology development programs, two investigator-initiated trials will evaluate the use of immunomodulatory therapies to enhance the response rate for KRYSTEXXA. The studies will use two different immunomodulators that are commonly used by rheumatologists.\nRECIPE Investigator-Initiated Trial: The RE du C ing I mmunogenicity to P egloticas E (RECIPE) study will evaluate the use of the immunomodulator mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with KRYSTEXXA to improve the response rate to the medicine. The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate if a 12-week course of immunomodulating therapy with daily MMF can safely and meaningfully prevent the incidence of an immune response to KRYSTEXXA.\nTRIPLE Investigator-Initiated Trial: The T olerization R educes I ntolerance to P egloticase and Prolongs the Urate L owering E ffect (TRIPLE) study will evaluate the use of the immunomodulator azathioprine with KRYSTEXXA to improve the response rate to the medicine. An exploratory, open-label adaptive trial with multiple patient cohorts, TRIPLE will include a cohort to evaluate the impact of adding the immunomodulator azathioprine for a two-week run-in period, followed by daily azathioprine and KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks for a total of 13 doses.\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Business Unit Net Sales Results\n(in millions except for percentages) Q4 17 Q4 16 % Change FY 17 FY 16\n% Change Orphan $ 116.6 $ 88.1 32 $ 466.8 $ 299.3 56 RAVICTI ® 51.9 32.9 57 193.9 151.5 28 PROCYSBI ®(1)(2) 33.2 25.3 31 137.7 25.3 445 ACTIMMUNE ® 26.8 24.2 11 111.0 104.6 6 BUPHENYL ® 4.6 4.7 (3 ) 20.8 16.9 23 QUINSAIR ™(1)(2) 0.1 1.0 (87 ) 3.4 1.0 231 Rheumatology 61.4 41.6 48 214.0 142.7 50 KRYSTEXXA ® 43.8 29.5 48 156.5 91.1 72 RAYOS ® 15.6 11.3 38 52.1 47.4 10 LODOTRA ® 2.0 0.8 148 5.4 4.2 29 Primary Care 96.2 180.6 (47 ) 375.4 604.1 (38 ) PENNSAID ® 2% 50.0 96.6 (48 ) 191.0 304.4 (37 ) DUEXIS ® 28.2 50.9 (45 ) 121.2 173.7 (30 ) VIMOVO ® 16.6 31.6 (47 ) 57.7 121.3 (52 ) MIGERGOT ® 1.5 1.5 1 5.5 4.7 18 Litigation settlement (3) - - - - (65.0 ) (100 ) Total GAAP net sales (3) $ 274.2 $ 310.3 (12 ) $ 1,056.2 $ 981.1 8 Total non-GAAP adjusted net sales (3) $ 274.2 $ 310.3 (12 ) $ 1,056.2 $ 1,046.1 1\n(1) PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR were acquired on Oct. 25, 2016. (2) On June 23, 2017, Horizon Pharma completed the divestiture of a European subsidiary that owned the marketing rights to PROCSYBI and QUINSAIR in Europe, the Middle East and Africa to Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. Horizon Pharma retains marketing rights for the two medicines in the United States, Canada, Latin America and Asia. (3) On Sept. 26, 2016, Horizon Pharma agreed to pay Express Scripts $65 million as part of a litigation settlement, which was recorded as a one-time reduction to GAAP net sales for the full-year 2016 in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The exclusion of the $65 million settlement from GAAP net sales is the only adjustment reflected in full-year 2016 non-GAAP adjusted net sales. Orphan Business Unit: Fourth-quarter net sales for the orphan business unit were $116.6 million, an increase of 32 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRAVICTI net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $51.9 million, an increase of 57 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The results were driven by continued conversion from older-generation nitrogen-scavenger therapies, as well as the addition of treatment-naïve patients, in part due to the April 2017 update of the RAVICTI label, which expanded the use of the medicine to patients older than two months of age, from two years of age and older.\nPROCYSBI net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $33.2 million. PROCYSBI net sales no longer include revenues from the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions following the sale of those geographic marketing rights to Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. in June 2017. In October 2017, the Company launched PROCYSBI in Canada, and it is the only cystine-depleting agent approved in Canada for treatment of nephropathic cystinosis.\nACTIMMUNE net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $26.8 million. Rheumatology Business Unit: Fourth-quarter net sales for the rheumatology business unit were $61.4 million, an increase of 48 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nKRYSTEXXA net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $43.8 million, an increase of 48 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was driven by continued strong year-over-year vial demand and does not reflect any material benefit from the recently expanded commercial organization, described below.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company completed the expansion of its rheumatology business unit to nearly 200 employees from more than 100 to increase awareness of uncontrolled gout among physicians and patients, given the clear unmet need that exists for thousands of people with uncontrolled gout. The objective of the expansion is to reach more physicians – both rheumatologists and now nephrologists, kidney specialists who also treat gout. Given the significant commercial expansion, and following additional analysis of the addressable patient population and market opportunities for KRYSTEXXA, in January 2018, the Company announced that it increased its estimated peak annual net sales expectations for KRYSTEXXA to more than $750 million from more than $400 million. Primary Care Business Unit: Fourth-quarter net sales for the primary care business unit were $96.2 million, a decrease of 47 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, in line with expectations and due to the impact of the Company’s new contracting model with pharmacy benefit managers that was implemented in 2017.\nFourth-Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNote: For additional detail and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the tables at the end of this release.\nGross Profit: Under U.S. GAAP, the fourth-quarter 2017 gross profit ratio was 44.8 percent compared to 51.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. The non-GAAP gross profit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 89.3 percent compared to 91.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating Expenses: In the fourth-quarter 2017, total operating expenses were 72.3 percent of net sales on a GAAP basis and 51.7 percent of net sales on a non-GAAP basis. R&D expenses were 11.3 percent of net sales on a GAAP basis and 5.6 percent of net sales on a non-GAAP basis. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 61.1 percent of net sales on a GAAP basis and 46.1 percent of net sales on a non-GAAP basis.\nIncome Tax Rate: The income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 56.6 percent on a GAAP basis and 37.6 percent on a non-GAAP basis, including a one-time tax benefit associated with adjusting deferred tax balances as a result of U.S. tax legislation enacted in December 2017.\nNet (Loss) Income: The Company generated a net loss of $46.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income was $48.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $102.7 million.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share: On a GAAP basis, fourth-quarter 2017 diluted loss per share was $0.28, compared with diluted loss per share of $0.81 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 were $0.29 and $0.64, respectively. Weighted average shares outstanding used for calculating GAAP diluted loss per share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 were 164.0 million and 166.9 million, respectively.\nCash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet Highlights\nFourth-quarter 2017 operating cash flow was $143.2 million on a GAAP basis and $157.9 million on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $751.4 million.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, total principal amount of debt outstanding was $2.021 billion, which was composed of $846 million in senior secured term loans due 2024; $475 million senior notes due 2023; $300 million senior notes due 2024; and $400 million exchangeable senior notes due 2022. As of Dec. 31, 2017, net debt was $1.269 billion, and the net debt to last-12-months adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.3 times.\nHorizon Pharma Provides 2018 Guidance\nThe Company expects full-year 2018 net sales to range between $1.150 billion and $1.180 billion, driven by strong growth in its orphan and rheumatology business units. The Company continues to expect full-year 2018 net sales growth for KRYSTEXXA of more than 50 percent. This projection incorporates assumptions of strong vial growth, the positive impact of the recently expanded KRYSTEXXA commercial organization, as well as the potential impact of a July 1, 2018, implementation of a U.S. government rule related to 340B entity drug pricing.\nFull-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $370 million and $395 million, reflecting the Company’s increased level of investment in 2018 in its pipeline, including teprotumumab Phase 3 clinical trial and commercial manufacturing costs, as well as incremental promotional investment in KRYSTEXXA. A higher level of R&D and SG&A investment is anticipated in the first half of 2018.\nWebcast\nAt 8 a.m. EST / 1 p.m. IST today, the Company will host a live webcast to review its financial and operating results and provide a general business update.

Horizon Pharma provides certain other financial measures such as non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net sales, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP gross profit and gross profit ratio, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP operating cash flow, each of which include adjustments to GAAP figures. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information on Horizon Pharma’s performance, operations, expenses, profitability and cash flows. Adjustments to Horizon Pharma's GAAP figures as well as EBITDA exclude acquisition/ divestiture-related expenses, charges related to the discontinuation of ACTIMMUNE development for Friedreich’s ataxia, gain from divestiture, an upfront fee for a license of a patent, a litigation settlement, loss on debt extinguishment, costs of debt refinancing, drug manufacturing harmonization costs, restructuring and realignment costs, as well as non-cash items such as share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, royalty accretion, non-cash interest expense, intangible and other non-current asset impairment charges, impacts of contingent royalty liability remeasurements and other non-cash adjustments. Certain other special items or substantive events may also be included in the non-GAAP adjustments periodically when their magnitude is significant within the periods incurred. Horizon maintains an established non-GAAP cost policy that guides the determination of what costs will be excluded in non-GAAP measures. Horizon Pharma believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP figures, can enhance an overall understanding of Horizon Pharma's financial and operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are included with the intent of providing investors with a more complete understanding of the Company’s historical and expected 2018 financial results and trends and to facilitate comparisons between periods and with respect to projected information. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the indicators Horizon Pharma's management uses for planning and forecasting purposes and measuring the Company's performance. For example, adjusted EBITDA is used by Horizon Pharma as one measure of management performance under certain incentive compensation arrangements. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Horizon Pharma has not provided a reconciliation of its full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA outlook to an expected net income (loss) outlook because certain items such as acquisition/divestiture-related expenses and share-based compensation that are a component of net income (loss) cannot be reasonably projected due to the significant impact of changes in Horizon Pharma's stock price, the variability associated with the size or timing of acquisitions/divestitures and other factors. These components of net income (loss) could significantly impact Horizon Pharma’s actual net income (loss).\nThis press release contains , including, but not limited to, statements related to Horizon Pharma's full-year 2018 net sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance, expected growth of certain medicines, estimated peak annual net sales of certain of Horizon Pharma’s medicines and pipeline candidates, expected financial performance in future periods, expected timing and scope of clinical trials, including the Phase 3 clinical trial of teprotumumab and TRIPLE clinical trial of KRYSTEXXA, expected increases in investment in Horizon Pharma’s rare disease medicine pipeline and the impact thereof, potential market opportunity for Horizon Pharma’s medicines in approved and potential additional indications, and business and other statements that are not historical facts. These on Horizon Pharma's inherently involve significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such as a result of these risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation, risks that Horizon Pharma’s actual future financial and operating results may differ from its expectations or goals; Horizon Pharma’s ability to grow net sales from existing products; the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing from government and third-party payers and risks relating to Horizon Pharma’s ability to successfully implement its business strategies; risks inherent in developing novel medicine candidates, such as teprotumumab, and existing medicines for new indications; risks related to acquisition integration and achieving projected benefits; risks associated with regulatory approvals; risks in the ability to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel; competition, including potential generic competition; the ability to protect intellectual property and defend patents; regulatory obligations and oversight, including any changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which Horizon Pharma operates and those risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in Horizon Pharma's filings and reports with the SEC. Horizon Pharma undertakes no duty or obligation to update any contained in this press release as a result of new information.\nContacts: Investors:\nTina Ventura\nSenior Vice President,\nInvestor Relations\ninvestor-relations@horizonpharma.com U.S. Media:\nGeoff Curtis\nSenior Vice President,\nCorporate Affairs & Chief Communications Officer\nmedia@horizonpharma.com Ruth Venning\nExecutive Director,\nInvestor Relations\ninvestor-relations@horizonpharma.com Ireland Media:\nRay Gordon\nGordon MRM\nray@gordonmrm.ie\nHorizon Pharma plc Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands, except share and per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\n2016\n2017 2016 (Unaudited) Net sales $ 274,219 $ 310,349 $ 1,056,231 $ 981,120 Cost of goods sold 151,492 149,751 546,275 393,272 Gross profit 122,727 160,598 509,956 587,848 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 30,872 23,961 224,962 60,707 Selling, general and administrative 167,423 200,745 677,363 608,308 Impairment of in-process research and development -
