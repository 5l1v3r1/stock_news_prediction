A majority of our Canadian operations were reclassified into the FSS International reportable segment beginning in fiscal 2018. The prior-year period was restated to conform to the current period presentation.\nConsolidated sales were $4.0 billion in the quarter, an organic increase of 5% over the prior-year period, driven by revenue growth across all three segments.\nThe Company continued to drive productivity improvements in United States and International base accounts, while reinvesting in technology and capabilities. In the United States, these improvements were more than offset by start-up costs associated with onboarding of multiple new accounts. Uniform income was impacted from lapping prior-year pricing actions.\nFIRST QUARTER SUMMARY\nOn a GAAP basis, sales were $4.0 billion, operating income was $219 million, net income attributable to Aramark stockholders was $292 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.16. This compares to the first quarter of 2017 where, on a GAAP basis, sales were $3.7 billion, operating income was $244 million, net income attributable to Aramark stockholders was $125 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.50. First quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 132% year-over-year, driven by a $184 million net benefit to the income tax provision related to tax reform.\nAdjusted net income was $148 million or $0.59 per share, versus adjusted net income of $139 million or $0.55 per share in the first quarter of 2017. A weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by approximately $55 million, and had a positive impact on adjusted operating income of $3 million as well as a $0.01 positive impact on adjusted earnings per share.\nSTRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS\nThe Company completed the acquisition of Avendra LLC on December 11, 2017. Due to the short stub period, there was an immaterial impact on revenue and income in the quarter related to the Avendra acquisition. On January 19, 2018, the Company also completed the acquisition of AmeriPride Services LLC.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE & LIQUIDITY\nTotal trailing 12-month net debt to covenant adjusted EBITDA was 4.5x at the end of the quarter, a 70 basis point increase versus the prior year measurement. During the quarter, the Company borrowed a total of $1.3 billion to finance the acquisition of Avendra and related fees and expenses. At quarter-end the company had approximately $700 million in cash and availability on its revolving credit facility.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nThe Company provides its expectations for full-year adjusted EPS and full-year free cash flow on a non-GAAP basis, and does not provide a reconciliation of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments that could be made for the impact of the change in fair value related to certain gasoline and diesel agreements, severance and other charges and the effect of currency translation.\nThe Company is increasing its outlook for 2018 adjusted EPS by 5-10 cents to a range of $2.15 to $2.30 per share, which includes 1-2 cents of currency benefit. This outlook now includes approximately 20 cents expected benefit related to tax reform, partly offset by 10-15 cents expected dilution due to the acquisitions. The Company continues to expect full-year free cash flow of greater than $400 million, which has not yet been updated to reflect the benefits of tax reform and the acquisitions.\nCONFERENCE CALL SCHEDULED\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call at 10 a.m. ET today to discuss its earnings and outlook. This call and related materials can be heard and reviewed, either live or on a delayed basis, on the Company's web site, www.aramark.com on the investor relations page.\nAbout Aramark\nAramark (NYSE: ARMK) proudly serves Fortune 500 companies, world champion sports teams, state-of-the-art healthcare providers, the world’s leading educational institutions, iconic destinations and cultural attractions, and numerous municipalities in 19 countries around the world.

The Company also uses Net Debt for its ratio to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as total long-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to Aramark stockholders adjusted to eliminate the change in amortization of acquisition-related customer relationship intangible assets and depreciation of property and equipment resulting from the 2007 LBO; the impact of changes in the fair value related to certain gasoline and diesel agreements; severance and other charges; share-based compensation; the effects of refinancings on interest and other financing costs, net; the impact of tax reform and other items impacting comparability, less the tax impact of these adjustments. The tax effect for adjusted net income for our U.S. earnings is calculated using a blended U.S. federal and state tax rate. The tax effect for adjusted net income in jurisdictions outside the U.S. is calculated at the local country tax rate.\nAdjusted Net Income (Constant Currency)\nAdjusted Net Income (Constant Currency) represents Adjusted Net Income adjusted to eliminate the impact of currency translation.\nAdjusted EPS\nAdjusted EPS represents Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment, client contract investments and other. Management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it represents a measure of cash flow available for distribution among all the security holders of the Company.\nWe use Adjusted Sales (Organic), Adjusted Operating Income (including on a constant currency basis), Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (including on a constant currency basis), Adjusted EPS (including on a constant currency basis) and Free Cash Flow as supplemental measures of our operating profitability and to control our cash operating costs. We believe these financial measures are useful to investors because they enable better comparisons of our historical results and allow our investors to evaluate our performance based on the same metrics that we use to evaluate our performance and trends in our results. These financial metrics are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Our presentation of these metrics has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. You should not consider these measures as alternatives to sales, operating income, net income, or earnings per share, determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Sales (Organic), Adjusted Operating Income, Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow as presented by us, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies use identical calculations.\nExplanatory Notes to the Non-GAAP Schedules\nAmortization of acquisition-related customer relationship intangible assets and depreciation of property and equipment resulting from the 2007 Leveraged Buy-out - adjustments to eliminate the change in amortization and depreciation resulting from the purchase accounting applied to the January 26, 2007 going-private transaction executed with investment funds affiliated with GS Capital Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC and J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC, Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and Warburg Pincus LLC as well as approximately 250 senior management personnel.\nShare-based compensation - adjustments to eliminate compensation expense related to the Company's issuances of share-based awards and the related employer payroll tax expense incurred by the Company when employees exercise in the money stock options or vest in restricted stock awards.\nSeverance and other charges - adjustments to eliminate severance expenses and other costs incurred in the applicable period such as consulting costs related to streamlining initiatives ($6.5 million for the first quarter of 2018).\nMerger and Integration Related Charges - adjustments to eliminate merger and integration related charges to the Avendra and AmeriPride acquisitions, including deal costs, costs for transitional employees, other acquired employee related costs, and integration related consulting costs ($19.4 million for the first quarter of 2018).\nGains, losses and settlements impacting comparability - adjustments to eliminate certain transactions that are not indicative of our ongoing operational performance, primarily for income from prior years' loss experience that were favorable under our casualty insurance program ($12.9 million gain for the first quarter of 2018 and $6.3 million gain for the first quarter of 2017), multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charges ($1.6 million for the first quarter of 2018) and the impact of the change in fair value related to certain gasoline and diesel agreements ($1.8 million gain for the first quarter of 2018 and $4.7 million gain for the first quarter of 2017).\nEffect of currency translation - adjustments to eliminate the impact that fluctuations in currency translation rates had on the comparative results by presenting the periods on a constant currency basis. Assumes constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the rates in effect for the prior year period being used in translation for the comparable current year period.\nEffect of refinancing on interest and other financing costs, net - adjustments to eliminate expenses associated with refinancing activities undertaken by the Company in the applicable period such as third party costs and non-cash charges for the write-offs of debt issuance costs.\nEffect of tax reform on provision for income taxes - adjustments to eliminate the impact of tax reform that is not indicative of our ongoing tax position based on the new tax policies and certain other adjustments.\nTax Impact of Adjustments to Adjusted Net Income - adjustments to eliminate the net tax impact of the adjustments to adjusted net income calculated based on a blended U.S. federal and state tax rate for U.S. adjustments and the local country tax rate for adjustments in jurisdictions outside the U.S.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that reflect our current views as to future events and financial performance with respect to, without limitation, conditions in our industry, our operations, our economic performance and financial condition, including, in particular, statements under the heading \"2018 Outlook\" and including with respect to, without limitation, the benefits and costs of our acquisitions of each of Avendra and AmeriPride and related financings, as well as statements regarding these companies’ services and products and statements relating to our business and growth strategy. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as \"outlook,\" \"aim,\" \"anticipate,\" \"are or remain confident,\" \"have confidence,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"will be,\" \"will continue,\" \"will likely result,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"see,\" \"look to\" and other words and terms of similar meaning or the negative versions of such words.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. All statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates, financial results and our estimated benefits and costs of our acquisitions are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions.

Some of the factors that we believe could affect our results or the costs and benefits of the acquisitions include without limitation: unfavorable economic conditions; natural disasters, global calamities, sports strikes and other adverse incidents; the failure to retain current clients, renew existing client contracts and obtain new client contracts; a determination by clients to reduce their outsourcing or use of preferred vendors; competition in our industries; increased operating costs and obstacles to cost recovery due to the pricing and cancellation terms of our food and support services contracts; the inability to achieve cost savings through our cost reduction efforts; our expansion strategy; the failure to maintain food safety throughout our supply chain, food-borne illness concerns and claims of illness or injury; governmental regulations including those relating to food and beverages, the environment, wage and hour and government contracting; liability associated with noncompliance with applicable law or other governmental regulations; new interpretations of or changes in the enforcement of the government regulatory framework; currency risks and other risks associated with international operations, including Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption law compliance; continued or further unionization of our workforce; liability resulting from our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans; risks associated with suppliers from whom our products are sourced; disruptions to our relationship with, or to the business of, our primary distributor; the inability to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or increases in labor costs; healthcare reform legislation; the contract intensive nature of our business, which may lead to client disputes; seasonality; disruptions in the availability of our computer systems or privacy breaches; failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls; our leverage; the inability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness; debt agreements that limit our flexibility in operating our business; our ability to successfully integrate the businesses of Avendra and AmeriPride and costs and timing related thereto, the risk of unanticipated restructuring costs or assumption of undisclosed liabilities, the risk that we are unable to achieve the anticipated benefits (including tax benefits) and synergies of the acquisition of AmeriPride and Avendra including whether the proposed transactions will be accretive and within the expected timeframes, the availability of sufficient cash to repay certain indebtedness and our decision to utilize the cash for that purpose, the disruption of the transactions to each of Avendra and AmeriPride and their respective managements; the effect of the transactions on each of Avendra's and AmeriPride's ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties, our ability to attract new or maintain existing customer and supplier relationships at reasonable cost, our ability to retain key personnel and other factors set forth under the headings Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" Item 3 \"Legal Proceedings\" and Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on November 22, 2017 as such factors may be updated from time to time in our other periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and which may be obtained by contacting Aramark's investor relations department via its website www.aramark.com .
