A trainer would put Vonn on the force plate and record her technique and form, then forward the data and video to her orthopedic specialist to observe progress before allowing her to get back on skis. Fast-forwarding therapy with VR tech \nLast year the COE teamed up with Strivr Labs , based in Palo Alto, California, to build out a virtual reality system that digitally recreates the Olympic downhill courses in Pyeongchang, right down to the location of the gates and shapes of the turns the racers will navigate. The process began by affixing a 360-degree camera on top of a skier's helmet as he zipped down the actual mountain in Korea to capture footage of real-world conditions, complete with wind whooshing past the microphone. \nBack at the COE, the video was paired with Strivr's customized VR software. It's all linked to VR headsets the athletes don while straddling a pair of balance boards, adding real movements to the virtual scenes. Performed over and over, the technology benefits skiers by enabling them to repeat practice runs that improve their reaction times, theoretically leading to better decision-making and overall performance. \"Improved data analysis is a key focus of the USOC to drive sports medicine, as well as high-performance outcomes.\" -Dr. Bill Moreau, vice president of sports medicine at the U.S. Olympic Committee \nBy the time they enter the starting gates at Pyeongchang's Jeongseon Alpine Centre, located in the Taebaek Mountains about 90 miles east of Seoul, the skiers will have relived the exact courses as many times as they want, in a VR environment that their brain responds to in a similar manner to real skiing. The VR experience complements an indoor ski simulator, designed by Los Angeles-based SkyTechSport, another tech tool that approximates real-world race conditions. Retraining the brain \nA different type of groundbreaking visual technology, called strobe glasses , is employed at COE to aid recovery from knee injuries like Vonn's. Yet different from physical therapy that helps the athlete relearn how to move the knee, strobe glasses retrain the brain. Their use grew out of research in neuroplasticity training at Ohio State University, which studied how athletes rehab ACL damage. \nBy comparing MRI scans, researchers could see the difference in brain activity in healthy adults, versus those recovering from ACL injuries, when extending and flexing the knee. \"The brain fundamentally changed in how it processes information from an injured knee,\" said Dustin Grooms, who led the study and is now at Ohio University. \"We think those changes play a big role in why people who recover from ACL injuries don't trust their knees entirely and tend to move them differently,\" potentially putting them at risk for reinjury. \nDuring therapy sessions, the athlete puts on the strobe — or formally stroboscopic — glasses, which resemble dark sunglasses. They naturally obscure vision, but even more so by emitting rapid bursts of light, creating an effect that interferes, distorts and forces the body to move instinctively rather than by sight.

Advancements in sports medicine such as those offered to Olympians at the COE are becoming available to the general public. That's reassuring for weekend warriors, many of whom are keeping their fingers crossed that Vonn and her Team USA mates going for the gold in Pyeongchang stay on course and injury-free. \n— By Bob Woods, special to CNBC.com Bob Woods Special to CNBC.com Related Securities", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:43:10.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
