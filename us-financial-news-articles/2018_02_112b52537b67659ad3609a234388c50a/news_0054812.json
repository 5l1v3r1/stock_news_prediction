That helped pull down net imports to the lowest level on record of below 5 million bpd.\nThe trade swings in the world’s biggest oil consuming country put prices under pressure on Friday, traders said.\nU.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA was virtually unchanged at 10.27 million barrels per day (bpd), close to levels of top producer Russia and more than OPEC-kingpin Saudi Arabia pumps.\nOverall, however, oil markets remain well supported due to demand-growth coinciding with production restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia.\nReporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2EtJgen", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T08:27:08.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
