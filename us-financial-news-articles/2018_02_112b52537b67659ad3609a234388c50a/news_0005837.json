They fell as much as 23.2 percent on Thursday and were down 15.5 percent at 224.4 pence at 1539 GMT.\nIWG confirmed that discussions had ended and said it remained confident in its prospects as an independent company.\nThe bid approach came after IWG warned on full-year profit in October, citing a weaker London market and disruption due to natural disasters in the United States.\nIn a separate trading update on Thursday, IWG said it saw an improvement in its business in the final months of 2017 and it expected its results for the year ended Dec. 31 to be in line with previous guidance.
