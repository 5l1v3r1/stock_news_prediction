The assets could have been valued at more than $8 billion at the time. (http://reut.rs/2f5y6R4)\n\"We expected that AT&T would sell it (DirecTV Latin America stake) rather than publicly list it, this could presumably mean they weren't able to find a buyer,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said, raising concerns over the valuation of the assets.\nCable service providers have been facing stiff challenges as the industry battles with cord-cutting, where people are moving towards on-demand video streaming services such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Prime.\nThe Latin America business, excluding Mexico, has been AT&T's best candidate to divest, as the region is largely non-strategic and \"didn't fit very well with any of their other significant initiatives\", Moffett said.\nAT&T, which acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015, reported about 13.6 million video connections for Latin America as of Dec. 31, 2017, an addition of 1.1 million from a year earlier.
