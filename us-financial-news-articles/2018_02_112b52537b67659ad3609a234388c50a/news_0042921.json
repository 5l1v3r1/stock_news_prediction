This included a 4.3 percent contribution to the PSP retirement plan and a 2.25 percent cash bonus. This is the 18 th consecutive year of Ohio National offering a cash bonus to eligible associates.\n“Ohio National experienced another positive financial year in 2017, and it’s our culture to share that success with our associates,” said Gary T. “Doc” Huffman, chairman, president and chief executive officer, at a meeting with all associates today. “In a time when our industry is facing external headwinds due to increased regulations and prolonged low interest rates, we are still growing and achieving positive results. This success would not be possible without the hard work of our associates. They are highly committed to serving our company, our customers and our community.”\nOhio National provides financial services through the production and administration of insurance and investment products distributed through a network of independent financial professionals throughout the U.S. At its Board of Directors meeting Feb. 9, Ohio National announced a 2.7 percent increase in core earnings and its highest levels of GAAP equity and assets under management, along with other positive sales and financial results.\n“We’ve been hearing a lot of recent buzz around the new tax law and companies sharing profits with their employees. This is something that Ohio National has been doing every year for the last 50 years,” Huffman continued. “I’m proud of what our associates do every day – and so is our Board of Directors. Our associates make Ohio National a great place to work.”\nEstablished in 1967, the PSP is available for all qualifying part-time and full-time associates. PSP payments have been made to the plan every year since its establishment and an additional cash bonus has been paid every year since 2000.\nThrough the PSP, associates share in Ohio National’s financial success and plan for a secure retirement. In addition to the PSP, eligible associates also receive a 3 percent contribution to their 401(k) plan), regardless of whether they personally contribute.\nOhio National was recognized as a Top Workplace in Cincinnati by Enquirer Media for the eighth year in a row in 2017.
