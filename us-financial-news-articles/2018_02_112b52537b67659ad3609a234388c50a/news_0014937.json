All but one of the 169 Russians invited to the Games by the IOC accepted the invitation. \nRussian athletes competing in Pyeongchang must follow a code of conduct that prevents them from wearing their country colors and advises them against posting national symbols on social media. \n“With a cold head, I can say that the flag, the anthem and all these things, it’s not so important if you have it in your heart and your brain,” former pairs figure skater Maxim Trankov, who won two gold medals in Sochi along with partner Tatiana Volosozhar, told Reuters as he visited the Sports House. \n“We are all Russian patriots, all athletes. It doesn’t matter how we are called: Olympic Athletes from Russia or Team Russia. It doesn’t matter because our homeland, it’s Russia.” \nOn the walls of the Sports House, sketches of Russian nesting dolls known as ‘matryoshki’ clutch hockey sticks, snowboards and traditional musical instruments. \nRussian pop songs blare from speakers as women in short dresses twirl through the room. Fans wearing Russian sports jerseys brandish their country’s tricolor flags. \nThe venue, which uses ‘Russia in My Heart’ as a slogan for the team, also puts Russian and Soviet sporting prowess on display. \nCardboard cutouts of hockey players from the legendary Soviet team and pictures of current and retired Russian athletes hang throughout the premises. \nThe athletes, who were not allowed by the IOC to compete at the Games, were also not forgotten. \nA picture of a jubilant short-track speed skater Viktor Ahn, a six-time Olympic gold medalist, crossing the finish line first at the Sochi Games found place. \nEarlier on Friday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) dismissed 47 appeals from Russian athletes and coaches, including Ahn, to participate in the Games.
