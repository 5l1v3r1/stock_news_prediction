It is something we want to do with Bolivia,” he told a gathering of Japanese business leaders.\nRepresentatives of YPFB, Bolivia’s state-run oil company, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nBolivia’s Energy Ministry said in response the country has an active contract with Argentina that YPFB “fulfills and will continue to fulfill.”\nArgentina, once a net energy exporter, currently imports around 20 percent of its natural gas needs, Redondo said. Most comes from Bolivia, with the remainder coming from around 70 shipments of LNG per year and some re-gasified LNG piped across the border from Chile.\nLNG suppliers to Argentina include Royal Dutch Shell, BP Plc and Vitol [VITOLV.UL].\nRising natural gas output in its Belgium-sized Vaca Muerta shale play could let Argentina export excess gas to Chile in the summer, Redondo said.\n“We think that because of the development of Vaca Muerta, Argentina will be able to supply 100 percent of the country’s demand in 2021, except the winter months,” he said.\nSince taking office in December 2015, President Mauricio Macri has sought to lower labor costs and improve infrastructure to attract foreign investment to the Patagonian shale formation.\nBut investment in the play has remained well below the $10 billion per year needed, Redondo said, leaving Argentina - home to the world’s second-largest shale gas reserves - unable to cover demand that boomed under former populist President Cristina Fernandez, who implemented generous gas subsidies.\nReporting by Luc Cohen; Additional reporting by Daniel Ramos in La Paz; Editing by Lisa Shumaker, G Crosse\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T04:29:27.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
