The process will also make it easier for Bon-Ton to renegotiate its leases or ask for rent reductions. \nThe department store chain recently reported a dismal holiday season, despite many of its peers, including J.C. Penney , Kohl's and Macy's , doing well against a strong economic backdrop. \nBon-Ton has said it plans to invest more in private-label brands, refreshing the overall store layout, ditching excess inventory and strengthening its e-commerce business. \n\"The harsh reality is that while Bon-Ton's management put in great effort to make the business sustainable, they were always running up a down escalator,\" GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders said. \n\"A scaled-down business may have a chance of survival,\" Saunders said. But Bon-Ton must resolve the fact that its products are \"undifferentiated, unclear and have become increasingly irrelevant to consumers.\" \nMore than 20 retailers, including Toys R Us, Hhgregg, Gymboree and RadioShack, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017. And with another load of retail debt coming due this year, several others could do so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T11:32:05.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
