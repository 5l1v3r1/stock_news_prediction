It told them 21 states had been targeted and some had been breached, NBC News reported.\nSix of the seven states that were breached continued to deny it, citing their own cyber investigations, NBC News reported. It said the systems in the seven states were compromised in a variety of ways, including entry into state websites and penetration of voter registration databases.\nAll of the state and federal officials agreed that no votes were changed and no voters were removed from voter roles as a result of the activity by Russian operatives, NBC News reported.\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials and states have frequently disagreed on the extent of Russian intrusion into their systems during the 2016 election cycle.\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nWhile DHS acknowledges that 21 states experienced a level of initial probing by suspected Russian hackers, it has only previously said publicly that a small subset of those states witnessed any actual compromise of their networks.
