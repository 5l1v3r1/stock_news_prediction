Anything much beyond that, however, may draw a swift sell-off in the markets.\nFor all India budget stories, see: TAKE A LOOK.\nInvestors were already spooked this week after India’s Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, in an economic survey ahead of the budget, suggested “a pause” in the fiscal consolidation path, while the government attempts to reinvigorate growth.\nIndian shares fell for a second consecutive session on Wednesday, as investors opted to book profits ahead of the budget, with markets trading near all-time highs.\nThe benchmark 10-year bond yield closed flat at 7.60 percent on Wednesday, but it is up 13 basis points from its close on Friday after Subramanian’s comments.
