You can call it a head-and-shoulders bottom of sorts,\" Worth said. A 'head-and-shoulders' pattern refers to when a stock makes a high, rallies to a higher high and declines back to the lower high. \n\"This is the beginning of an important move higher, even though we've already move quite nicely again from the lows of September,\" Worth explained. \nLooking at the same chart, Worth noted that gold has also broken out of a wedge pattern. When there is a breakout from a wedge, technicians often look to that as a bullish sign of an upward trend. \"That is also a very constructive set up on a technical basis,\" Worth said. \nFinally, looking back 20 years, Worth compared the performance of gold to the S&P 500 Index, and S&P 500 total return. \"What you see there is quite remarkable. Not only is gold beating the S&P on a 20-year basis, it's kept up with dividends reinvestedâ€¦by my work, there's more to come on the upside,\" Worth said. \n\"I think [gold] will be at $1,400\" by the end of the year, Worth added.
