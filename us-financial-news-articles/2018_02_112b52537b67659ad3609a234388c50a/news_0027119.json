That brought me a lot in the end. Halfway during the race I was one second slower but I could bring it down to two laps in a positive way.”\nKramer is the second male speed skater to win four Olympic medals in a single event, following in the footsteps of compatriot Bob de Jong, who got four medals in the men’s 10,000m.\nBloemen, the world record holder in both the 5,000m and 10,000m, edged out Pedersen for silver in a dramatic photo finish.\nDutch-born Bloemen, who is eligible to race for Canada through his father, switched allegiance in 2014 and is only the second Canadian to win an Olympic medal in the 5,000m, after William Logan won bronze in the event in 1932 Olympics at Lake Placid.\n”It wasn’t the perfect race where you get into a flow and just fly to the finish,“ he said. ”It doesn’t always happen and it didn’t happen today but I made the most out of it and I got everything out of myself that I had.\n“I‘m a little bit disappointed that I didn’t have more to give today but overall I‘m really happy and really proud to be on the podium.”\nKramer and Bloemen will face each other again in the men’s 10,000m on Thursday in what promises to be a fascinating battle.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford and Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:43:15.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
