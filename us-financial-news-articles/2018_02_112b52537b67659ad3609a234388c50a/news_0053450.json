REUTERS/John Sibley BRONZE AGAIN After matching their bronze from 2010, Swiss skip Peter De Cruz said the success of their compatriots in other sports had made things difficult.\n“It added a little pressure that whenever you went into the dining hall you see all these athletes showing off their medals to their friends and families,” he said.\nSlideshow (8 Images) ”That really gave me a lot of pressure, feeling like, well this seems like a huge mountain to climb.\n“But we wanted to make them throw some difficult shots, some shots to win the game, some shots to stay in the game and I think we did that.”\nCanada’s Mac Kennedy said the failure of both Canadian teams in Pyeongchang should be seen as a reflection of improving standards elsewhere.\n“I can tell you that we could have used some more misses this week, if teams were a little bit crappier,” he said.\n”But they’re not, they’re damn good. They’ve learned how to win and it’s tough to keep up.\n“As a Canadian that wants to win everything, it sucks. But I‘m a fan of the sport it’s wonderful so if other countries are getting to finals and winning, then it’s awesome because I love curling more than anything.”\nSweden will play the United States in the final on Saturday with both seeking to win gold for the first time.\nReporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T11:55:38.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
