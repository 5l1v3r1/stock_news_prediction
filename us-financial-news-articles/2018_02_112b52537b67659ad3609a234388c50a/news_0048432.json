While these companies have tried to promote their healthier products, they have often failed to gain the sort of popularity their traditional products enjoyed.\n\"We are seeing in the short-term (specifically in the first quarter) some headwinds that will cause near-term sales to be below run rate consumption,\" Chief Financial Officer Paulo Basilio said.\nSales in the company's U.S. business fell 1.1 percent to $4.79 billion, declining for the seventh straight quarter.
