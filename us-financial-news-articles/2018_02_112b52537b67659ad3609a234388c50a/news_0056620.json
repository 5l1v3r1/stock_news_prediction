The tax would be a temporary measure until a more comprehensive solution to fair digital taxation is approved, the Commission said.\n($1 = 0.8129 euros)\nReporting by Francesco Guarascio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T19:12:54.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
