No other information was provided.\n“We basically believe that the returns and the structure and the time is such that we would rather exit than stick it out. It’s pretty much as simple as that,” Roth said on Tuesday.\nRoth said in August 2017 that the fate of the 41-story flagship property of Kushner Cos, a developer and landlord founded by Jared’s father, was still being debated. Jared sold his interests in the realty company to a family trust in January.\nKushner Cos acquired the building with a full block of prime Fifth Avenue retail frontage in 2006 for $1.8 billion, the most ever paid for a New York office tower at the time.\nThe 1.4 million square foot tower ran into difficulties during the recession and Kushner later refinanced $1.215 billion in debt, which comes due in February 2019.\nVornado acquired its minority stake in 2011, when it helped recapitalize the tower with $70 million. A year later it bought retail space for $707.8 million.
