He said that the companies have grain supplies to last for one or two days should shipments halt completely.\nIn the Rosario port complex, responsible for exporting 80 percent of agricultural products, 56 percent fewer trucks arrived on Monday than had a week earlier, according to the Rosario Grains exchange.\nArgentina is the world’s top exporter of soy meal and soy oil, the No. 3 corn producer and a main provider of wheat.
