NetApp makes additional adjustments to the non-GAAP tax provision for certain tax matters as described below. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP results can be found at http://investors.netapp.com . NetApp’s management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance.\n2 GAAP net loss per share is calculated using the basic number of shares and excludes common stock equivalents because the impact would be anti-dilutive.\n3 GAAP net income per share is calculated using the diluted number of shares.\n4 Non-GAAP net income per share is calculated using the diluted number of shares for all periods.\nNetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement NetApp’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), NetApp provides investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and free cash flow, and historical and projected non-GAAP earnings per diluted share.\nNetApp believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rates, and non-GAAP earnings per share data when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. NetApp believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which it defines as the net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment, to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in its business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on its common stock. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.\nNetApp’s management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors’ operating results and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making.\nNetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures when applicable:\nA. Amortization of intangible assets. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.\nB. Stock-based compensation expenses. NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period.\nC. Litigation settlements. NetApp may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements. NetApp excludes these charges and benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results.\nD. Acquisition-related expenses. NetApp excludes acquisition-related expenses, including (a) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges and (b) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are not related to our ongoing business or cost base and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.\nE. Restructuring charges. These charges consist of restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.\nF. Asset impairments. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.\nG. Gains/losses on the sale of properties. These are gains/losses from the sale of our properties. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going business and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning or forecasting.\nH. Income tax adjustments . NetApp’s non-GAAP tax provision is based upon a projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The non-GAAP tax provision also excludes, when applicable, (a) tax charges or benefits in the current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal periods that are a result of events such as changes in tax legislation, authoritative guidance, income tax audit settlements and/or court decisions, (b) tax charges or benefits that are attributable to unusual or non-recurring book and/or tax accounting method changes, (c) tax charges that are a result of a non-routine foreign cash repatriation, (d) tax charges or benefits that are a result of infrequent restructuring of the Company’s tax structure, (e) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a change in valuation allowance, and (f) tax charges resulting from the integration of intellectual properties from acquisitions. Management believes that the use of non-GAAP tax provisions provides a more meaningful measure of the Company’s operational performance.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NetApp believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. NetApp management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and projected results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures.\nNETAPP, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions)\n(Unaudited)\nJanuary 26,\n2018 April 28,\n2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 5,619 $ 4,921 Accounts receivable 754 731 Inventories 98 163 Other current assets 295 383 Total current assets 6,766 6,198 Property and equipment, net 741 799 Goodwill and purchased intangible assets, net 1,845 1,815 Other non-current assets 435 681 Total assets $ 9,787 $ 9,493 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 458 $ 347 Accrued expenses 739 782 Commercial paper notes 632 500 Current portion of long-term debt — 749 Short-term deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue 1,719 1,744 Total current liabilities 3,548 4,122 Long-term debt 1,540 744 Other long-term liabilities 973 249 Long-term deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue 1,550 1,598 Total liabilities 7,611 6,713 Stockholders' equity 2,176 2,780 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 9,787 $ 9,493\nNETAPP, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 26,\n2018 January 27,\n2017 January 26,\n2018 January 27,\n2017 Revenues: Product $ 920 $ 784 $ 2,450 $ 2,154 Software maintenance 237 240 711 723 Hardware maintenance and other services 366 380 1,109 1,161 Net revenues 1,523 1,404 4,270 4,038 Cost of revenues: Cost of product 468 435 1,238 1,170 Cost of software maintenance 6 7 19 22 Cost of hardware maintenance and other services 108 111 336 369 Total cost of revenues 582 553 1,593 1,561 Gross profit 941 851 2,677 2,477 Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 423 381 1,268 1,228 Research and development 193 181 580 588 General and administrative 72 64 209 201 Restructuring charges — 52 — 52 Gain on sale of properties (218 ) (10 ) (218 ) (10 ) Total operating expenses 470 668 1,839 2,059 Income from operations 471 183 838 418 Other income (expense), net 14 — 25 (1 ) Income before income taxes 485 183 863 417 Provision for income taxes 991 37 1,058 98 Net income (loss) $ (506 ) $ 146 $ (195 ) $ 319 Net income (loss) per share: Basic $ (1.89 ) $ 0.53 $ (0.72 ) $ 1.15 Diluted $ (1.89 ) $ 0.52 $ (0.72 ) $ 1.13 Shares used in net income (loss) per share calculations: Basic 268 274 269 277 Diluted 268 281 269 282 Cash dividends declared per share $ 0.200 $ 0.190 $ 0.600 $ 0.570\nNETAPP, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 26,\n2018 January 27,\n2017 January 26,\n2018 January 27,\n2017 Cash flows from operating activities: Net income (loss) $ (506 ) $ 146 $ (195 ) $ 319 Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash\nprovided by operating activities: Depreciation and amortization 48 56 150 173 Stock-based compensation 38 46 125 149 Deferred income taxes 214 45 258 73 Gain on sale of properties (218 ) (10 ) (218 ) (10 ) Other items, net (3 ) 7 (8 ) (8 ) Changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions of businesses: Accounts receivable (157 ) (56 ) (8 ) 208 Inventories 10 (28 ) 65 (27 ) Accounts payable 81 26 115 13 Accrued expenses 126 17 58 (121 ) Deferred revenue and financed unearned services\nrevenue 81 31 (102 ) (148 ) Long-term taxes payable 721 (9 ) 723 (16 ) Changes in other operating assets and liabilities, net (15 ) (36 ) 21 16 Net cash provided by operating activities 420 235 984 621 Cash flows from investing activities: Redemptions (purchases) of investments, net (226 ) (188 ) (178 ) 2 Purchases of property and equipment (32 ) (45 ) (97 ) (137 ) Proceeds from sale of properties 210 — 210 — Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired — — (75 ) — Other investing activities, net (6 ) 3 (1 ) 2 Net cash used in investing activities (54 ) (230 ) (141 ) (133 ) Cash flows from financing activities: Proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee\nstock award plans 100 51 157 112 Payments for taxes related to net share settlement of stock\nawards (7 ) (6 ) (67 ) (42 ) Repurchase of common stock (150 ) (284 ) (450 ) (576 ) Proceeds from (repayments of) commercial paper notes,\nnet (86 ) 392 132 392 Issuance of long-term debt, net — — 795 — Repayment of short-term loan — — — (850 ) Repayment of long-term debt (750 ) — (750 ) — Dividends paid (53 ) (52 ) (161 ) (157 ) Other financing activities, net (5 ) (4 ) (6 ) (7 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (951 ) 97 (350 ) (1,128 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 24 (2 ) 37 (15 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (561 ) 100 530 (655 ) Cash and cash equivalents: Beginning of period 3,535 2,113 2,444 2,868 End of period $ 2,974 $ 2,213 $ 2,974 $ 2,213\nNETAPP, INC.

Additionally, each adjustment presented in the reconciliation was computed using basic shares. However, because we reported net income on a non-GAAP basis, non-GAAP net income per share was computed using diluted shares of 276 million. As a result of the difference in the number of shares, the summation of GAAP net loss per share and the adjustments does not equal non-GAAP net income per share.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP TO GAAP GROSS MARGIN ($ in millions) Q3'FY18 Q2'FY18 Q3'FY17 Gross margin-GAAP 61.8 % 63.4 % 60.6 % Cost of revenues adjustments 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.9 % Gross margin-Non-GAAP 62.6 % 64.3 % 61.5 % GAAP cost of revenues $ 582 $ 520 $ 553 Cost of revenues adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets (10 ) (9 ) (8 ) Stock-based compensation (3 ) (3 ) (4 ) Non-GAAP cost of revenues $ 569 $ 508 $ 541 Net revenues $ 1,523 $ 1,422 $ 1,404\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP TO GAAP PRODUCT GROSS MARGIN ($ in millions) Q3'FY18 Q2'FY18 Q3'FY17 Product gross margin-GAAP 49.1 % 50.6 % 44.5 % Cost of product revenues adjustments 1.1 % 1.2 % 1.1 % Product gross margin-Non-GAAP 50.2 % 51.8 % 45.7 % GAAP cost of product revenues $ 468 $ 399 $ 435 Cost of product revenues adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets (10 ) (9 ) (8 ) Stock-based compensation — (1 ) (1 ) Non-GAAP cost of product revenues $ 458 $ 389 $ 426 Product revenues $ 920 $ 807 $ 784\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP TO GAAP HARDWARE MAINTENANCE AND OTHER SERVICES GROSS MARGIN ($ in millions) Q3'FY18 Q2'FY18 Q3'FY17 Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin-GAAP 70.5 % 69.3 % 70.8 % Cost of hardware maintenance and other services revenues adjustment 0.8 % 0.5 % 0.8 % Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin-Non-GAAP 71.3 % 69.9 % 71.6 % GAAP cost of hardware maintenance and other services revenues $ 108 $ 115 $ 111 Cost of hardware maintenance and other services revenues adjustment: Stock-based compensation (3 ) (2 ) (3 ) Non-GAAP cost of hardware maintenance and other services revenues $ 105 $ 113 $ 108 Hardware maintenance and other services revenues $ 366 $ 375 $ 380\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP TO GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE Q3'FY18 Q2'FY18 Q3'FY17 GAAP effective tax rate 204.3 % 22.2 % 20.2 % Adjustments: Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (12.1 )% (2.8 )% (1.6 )% Tax reform (176.5 )% — % — % Non-GAAP effective tax rate 15.7 % 19.4 % 18.6 %\nRECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP) (In millions) Q3'FY18 Q2'FY18 Q3'FY17 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 420 $ 314 $ 235 Purchases of property and equipment (32 ) (29 ) (45 ) Free cash flow $ 388 $ 285 $ 190 Some items may not add or recalculate due to rounding.\nNETAPP, INC.
