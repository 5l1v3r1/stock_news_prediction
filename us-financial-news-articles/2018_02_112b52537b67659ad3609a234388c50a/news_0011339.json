REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya/File Photo Bradley-Martin’s research was instrumental in China’s decision to ban its legal rhino horn trade in 1993. It also pressured China to end legal ivory sales, a ban that came into force on January 1.\n“His work revealed the scale of the problem and made it impossible for the Chinese government to ignore,” said Kahumbu.\nSlideshow (2 Images) He was an expert on the prices of ivory and rhino horn, leading undercover investigations into markets in China and Southeast Asia.\nHe is the second prominent conservationist to die in East Africa in the past year. South African Wayne Lotter, whose work targeted ivory smuggling from Africa to Asia, was shot dead in Tanzania in August.\nThere was no immediate comment from police.\nReporting By Maggie Fick; Additional reporting by Humphrey Malalo; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T13:21:40.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
