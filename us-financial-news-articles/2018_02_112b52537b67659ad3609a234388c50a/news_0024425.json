He generally sees times of market turmoil as occasions to buy the MTUM.\n\"Historically one of the better performing styles over the last 30 years, we view market weakness as an opportunity to buy the iShares Momentum ETF (MTUM) because we see it as a positive tell that MTUM's relative profile has ticked higher through the ETF's 10 percent pullback,\" Wald wrote in a note to clients Saturday.\nThe fund, which has risen 32 percent in the last year, outperforming the broader market more than twofold in the same time, is most heavily weighted by J.P. Morgan , Microsoft, Apple , Boeing and Bank of America, respectively. The basket of stocks, most exposed to technology and financials, rolled over with the broader market in the last week.\nBank of America looks particularly attractive here, Wald said on \"Trading Nation,\" noting the stock is coming off a new high.\nOther market participants are less optimistic on momentum as a trade.\nThe MTUM specifically looks attractive as the market bounces off its recent lows, though not in the long term as the broader market environment has shifted fundamentally, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. He cited a broad, fundamental shift in the market environment.\n\"I think 'buy the dip' has now changed to 'sell the rally.' We're in a regime change, in my opinion, as far as the market goes. Until we take out fresh highs, and are proven otherwise, I believe the much better trade now is to sell the rally. So I'm very cautious about trying to buy momentum,\" Schlossberg said Monday on \"Trading Nation.\"\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
