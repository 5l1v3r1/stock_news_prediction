It is reducing its staff while focusing on digitizing its back office and expanding its retail customer base.\n“So far we made good progress in 2017,” Chief Executive Martin Zielke said in a statement. “However, it is also clear that we still have some work ahead of us before we can achieve the profitability we are aiming for.”\nFor the full year of 2017, the bank posted a net profit of 156 million euros, down 44 percent from a year ago, but making good on its own promise to eke out a “slightly positive” net profit.\nIn a sign of the bank’s improving financial health, its Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio rose to 14.1 percent from 13.5 percent at the end of the third quarter.\nZielke said the bank aimed to resume dividend payments for 2018.\nReporting by Tom Sims; Editing by Douglas Busvine\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:37:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
