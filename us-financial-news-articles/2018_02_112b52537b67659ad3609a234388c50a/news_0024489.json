Couture buried his attempt to enable the Sharks to move into sole possession of second place in the Pacific Division with 68 points.\nJones finished with 25 saves for San Jose, while John Gibson made 37 saves for Anaheim. The Ducks missed a chance to join the Sharks and the Calgary Flames in a three-way tie for second in the division.\nSan Jose forced overtime when Timo Meier bagged his 14th marker of the season at 19:06 of the third period. Meier worked his way to the goalmouth and was able to tip Couture’s shot from the right circle past a helpless Gibson.\nOndrej Kase gave the Ducks the lead just 2:39 into the game, taking advantage of a lapse by Jones to pot his 15th goal of the season. Kase took a wrister from below the right faceoff dot that squeaked through Jones’ pads and barely crossed the goal line.\nThe Sharks dominated the second period, outshooting Anaheim 14-2, but Gibson stood tall and kept his team in the lead. Gibson also came up with a huge save early in the third period, stoning Pavelski on a backhander at the doorstep.\nShortly after that, Ducks defenseman Cam Fowler made it 2-0 with his seventh goal at 6:28. Kase tried a shot that appeared to go off a San Jose stick. Fowler picked up the puck near the left post and chipped it over Jones and off the crossbar.\nCouture brought the Sharks back into contention with his 23rd goal of the season at 10:56 of the third period. Off assists from Tomas Hertl and Marc-Edouard Vlasic, Couture ripped a slapper by Gibson’s glove hand into the upper right corner.\nNick Ritchie assisted on both Anaheim goals.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:41:05.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
