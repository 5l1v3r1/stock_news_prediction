Slideshow (8 Images) \nLiverpool, who featured three former Southampton players in their starting lineup and also brought on former Saints Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren late on, could have added more in the second half as the hosts offered precious little. \nLiverpool have 54 points to Unitedâ€™s 56 with Tottenham Hotspur on 52 and champions Chelsea, who play bottom club West Bromwich Albion on Monday, on 50 as the battle for Champions League spots hots up. \nSouthampton are third from bottom, a point behind 17th-placed Huddersfield Town who won earlier on Sunday.
