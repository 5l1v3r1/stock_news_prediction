The spectators cheered loud and often for the Korean team, with roars of “Let’s go!” and “Good job!” in unison erupting regularly throughout. \nThe festive atmosphere did nothing to slow down the Swedes on the ice, however. \nMaja Nylen Persson put Sweden up 1-0 with a powerplay goal in the first period. \nThey added three more by goals by the end of the first period to carry a 4-0 lead into the intermission.

Japan fell in a 3-1 loss to Switzerland earlier on Monday, and both teams are 0-2 in Olympic play. \n“The players are extra excited,” Murray said. “They want to beat Japan. I think more than just the history of the two teams and the two countries, it’s just that we want to be the best in Asia, and so the girls are looking forward to that.” Reporting by Dan Burns, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T17:49:02.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
