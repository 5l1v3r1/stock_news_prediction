Based on its Feb. 14 closing price, a 41 percent stake would have been valued at about HK$3.1 billion ($392 million).\nWhile levels of borrowing by share pledging do vary, typically lenders advance funds worth 30 percent of the shares pledged.\nThe HNA unit said it may pledge more shares as collateral to PAG if the loan-to-value ratio falls below a prescribed threshold. A spokesman for PAG declined to comment.\nReporting by Donny Kwok Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T05:53:49.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
