In the process, it highlighted a potential conflict of interest for MTA Chairman Joe Lhota, who is a director of the company that runs Madison Square Garden.\nMr. Lhota voted to approve the spending on the stations that are directly below the entertainment arena that hosts the NBA’s Knicks, the NHL’s Rangers and dozens of major concerts each year.\nSpeaking after the MTA board vote, Mr. Lhota said he was careful to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest. He said Madison Square Garden didn’t benefit financially or otherwise from the subway-station improvements, which are “a block away.”\nThe authority’s general counsel, Thomas Quigley, said that both he and the MTA’s chief ethics officer believed there was no conflict of interest.\nMr. Lhota’s dual role as MTA chairman and Madison Square Garden board member was recently the subject of a conflict-of-interest complaint. The arena sits above Penn Station, where several subway lines connect with a terminus for one of the MTA’s commuter rail lines, the Long Island Rail Road.\nJohn Kaehny, director of the watchdog group Reinvent Albany, filed a complaint this month with a state regulator, the Authorities Budget Office, contending that Mr. Lhota’s board-member position at Madison Square Garden Co. poses a conflict of interest with his role at the MTA. The complaint seeks to find out whether Mr. Lhota’s Madison Square Garden role interfered with his official MTA duties in violation of New York state law.\n“The simple answer is that there are no clear bright lines between Penn Station and Madison Square Garden’s interests,” said Mr. Kaehny on Thursday.\nJeffrey Pearlman, the director of the Authorities Budget Office, a state watchdog, confirmed that his unit received the complaint. Citing office policy, he declined to comment whether an investigation will be conducted.\nMr. Lhota, who assumed the MTA chairman’s post last summer, previously came under scrutiny from another watchdog group that questioned his role as a lobbyist for NYU Langone Health. Mr. Lhota has said he checked with New York State’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics, which found he has a right to work for Langone.\nMr. Lhota earns a minimum of $160,000 in total annual compensation from Madison Square Garden Co., according to regulatory filings. The company, which is publicly traded, has a board of 15 members. “We believe Joe is a valued independent member of our board who acts with the highest integrity,” a company spokeswoman said.\nMr. Lhota also earns a salary of $1.6 million as a full-time executive at Langone.\nThe MTA pays him an annual salary of $1 for his role running the nation’s largest transit system.\nThe two Penn subway stations, for the A,C,E and the 1,2,3 lines, were among a group of eight stations that will be refurbished following the MTA board’s approval of contracts totaling $213 million. It is part of a broader program to upgrade 32 subway stations at a cost of almost $1 billion.\nThree MTA commissioners who represent New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio voted against the contracts.\nThey have challenged the way the stations were selected and question why the improvements don’t include facilities for people with disabilities. They also asked whether the funds could be better spent on upgrading equipment and infrastructure that regularly causes delays, such as signal systems.\nThe vote on the contracts was supposed to take place in January. But it was postponed to give the MTA’s new subway leader, Andy Byford, time to assess the program and to report back to the board.\nThis week, Mr. Byford told commissioners he was satisfied that the program is necessary. He said it includes work to repair degraded platforms, walls and stairways, as well as some cosmetic improvements.\nMr. Byford added that the MTA allocated $4 billion for station initiatives as part of its most recent five-year capital spending plan. He said that included $1 billion to make stations accessible for people with disabilities.\nWrite to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T05:56:03.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
