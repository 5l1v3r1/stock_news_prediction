It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everybody can support, as opposed to - you know - 15 bills, everybody’s got their own bill.”\nSeven senators and representatives were invited to Wednesday’s session, a mix of Republicans and Democrats espousing a wide spectrum of views on how to stop school shootings.\nPrevious discussions - all open to television cameras - included students and parents, law enforcement officials, and state governors. Trump also met privately with top officials from the NRA and has suggested training and arming some teachers.\nOn Wednesday, the discussion included Republican Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who have proposed legislation to fix holes in the background check system for gun buyers, and their Democratic co-sponsors.\nTrump has backed Cornyn’s bill but has been silent on other background check proposals. He urged senators to add more items to the bill to make it more comprehensive.\nReporting by Roberta Rampton, Ayesha Rascoe, Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T20:53:22.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
