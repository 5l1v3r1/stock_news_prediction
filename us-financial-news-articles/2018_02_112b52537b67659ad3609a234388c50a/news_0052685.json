Meeker is co-founder of BarkBox, a subscription service where dog and pig owners receive a monthly box of two toys, two treats and a chew toy. \n\"We've walked into so many meetings where people say, 'The pet industry, what a joke,'\" Meeker said Friday on CNBC's \" Power Lunch .\" \"[But] it's huge.\" \nIn fact, the pet industry is expanding at a record pace as companies in other sectors jump into the market. Last year, packaged foods in the U.S. grew 1.2 percent, while retail pet foods grew more than three times as fast, according to the research firm Euromonitor. The larger pet products industry is also expanding. In 2013, Americans spent approximately $55.7 billion on pet products, according to the American Pet Products Association . That number jumped to $66 billion in 2016 and is estimated at nearly $70 billion in 2017, with $29 billion to $30 billion spent on pet food alone. \nWhen BarkBox was launched in 2012, most subscribers were women, urban residents or millennials, people who treated their dog \"like a child\" or \"as family members,\" Meeker said. But as the product line and reach expands, people in rural areas have begun subscribing. In 2017, BarkBox began selling toys and treats at Target .

Food companies that specialize in packaged and ready-made foods are looking for other sources of revenue â€” and are betting on the booming pet industry. \nOn Friday, General Mills , the company famous for ready-made foods, such as cereals and yogurt, announced it would buy the Wilton, Connecticut-based company Blue Buffalo Pet Products for about $8 billion in cash . Blue Buffalo is known for its natural pet foods. \n\"In pet food, as in human food, consumers are seeking more natural and premium products,\" General Mills Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said in a statement. \nOther brands that already have a stake in the pet industry include Mars Inc., which owns Pedigree Petfoods, Iams, Whistle and Royal Canin. Nestle, famous for its hot chocolate, owns Purina. The iconic jam and jelly company Smucker's owns Meow Mix, Kibbles 'n Bits, Natural Balance and Milk-Bone. And Hill's Science Diet is owned by the Colgate-Palmolive Company . \nMeeker said he's excited about the Blue Buffalo acquisition. \"This is a recognition that [the pet industry] is meaningful,\" he said.
