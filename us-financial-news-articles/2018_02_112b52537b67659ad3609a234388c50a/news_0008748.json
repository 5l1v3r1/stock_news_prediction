VTB Capital, another Russian brokerage, also rates Kcell as “sell”.\nUnder Kazakh corporate law, if Kazakhtelecom takes over Kcell, it will have to offer to buy the remaining outstanding shares at the market price.\nThe 75-percent stake belongs to Telia and Fintur, Telia’s joint venture with Turkcell. Telia has said it planned to sell its assets in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Moldova.\nIf successful and approved by the antitrust committee, Kazakhtelecom’s bid would make it a major shareholder in companies which together control about 66 of the local mobile telecommunications market.\nThe oil-rich country’s sovereign wealth fund, Samruk-Kazyna, has a 51.0 percent stake in Kazakhtelecom, part of which it plans to sell this year in its large-scale privatization drive.\nAdditional reporting by Mariya Gordeyeva in Almaty, Raushan Nurshayeva in Astana and Olof Swahnberg in Stockholm.
