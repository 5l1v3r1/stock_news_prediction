Also with (IAAF male athlete of the year) Mutaz Essa Barshim jumping, it is going to be very exciting competition,” he added.\nThe high jump events for men and women will begin at the same time and participants will start their run-ups from the bend of the track with two mats placed on the infield.\nAs the field reduces, men and women will jump alternatively to allow fans to focus on one jumper at a time.\nThursday’s opening session of the March 1-4 championships will end with the women’s 3,000 meters final with defending champion Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia and Britain’s Laura Muir in action.\n“We also wanted to have one final on the track so with Laura Muir in the women´s 3000m that will be very attractive for the locals,” Cohen added.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T21:13:47.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
