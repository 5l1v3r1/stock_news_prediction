It earned $93 million on revenue of nearly $2 billion in 2017, down from $199 million on $4.8 billion in 2016.\nGE Chief Executive John Flannery last month said the conglomerate was looking at restructuring options “including separately traded assets” after it announced more than $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws.\nThe Wall Street Journal had earlier reported the sale.\nReporting by Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T01:46:17.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
