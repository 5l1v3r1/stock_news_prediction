All her close contacts did not have any symptoms during the medical surveillance period,” the Hong Kong government said.\nIt cited the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention as saying the virus’ genes “were determined to be of avian origin”.\nThe H7N9 strain is far more common in China for humans.\nSince 2013, at least 600 people have died in China and more than 1,500 people have fallen sick as a result of H7N9 bird flu virus. Some 40 percent of people hospitalized with the virus die.\nChina recorded just a single human case of H7N9 last month. Last year 192 people contracted the H7N9 strain, 79 of whom died.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T05:35:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
