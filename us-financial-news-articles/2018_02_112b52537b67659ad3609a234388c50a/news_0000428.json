The boards of both companies decided on Thursday to begin a formal process to explore the deal through special committees. \nThe deal would pair CBS’s broadcast network, television studios and Showtime cable network with Viacom’s Paramount Pictures, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV. \nThat could help CBS’ streaming service compete with Netflix Inc and boost the combined company’s leverage with cable and satellite distributors. \nIt also could provide an edge with advertisers, UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a research note. CBS would gain access to Viacom technology that uses data to help brands better target their messages, and the combined company could sell packages across the broadcast and pay TV networks. \n“Increased scale in ratings would allow the combined company to go into the ad market with a larger inventory across a broader demographic,” Hodulik said, “potentially allowing for higher overall ad rates by selling across properties.” \n“We expect a transaction to be a positive development for both sets of shareholders in the near term,” he added.
