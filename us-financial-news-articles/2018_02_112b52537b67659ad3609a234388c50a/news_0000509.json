OPEN QUESTION \nBlockchain technology is already used in the diamond industry. Gems are given a digital fingerprint that is then tracked by blockchain as gems are sold, giving a forgery-proof record of where the stones have come from. \nThe cobalt supply chain is far more complex but the developers of the pilot hope blockchain - a decentralized online database in the form of a distributed ledger - can at least track some of the stages that are a major worry for end users. \nSheila Warren, head of blockchain policy at the World Economic Forum, said it was an open question how well it could work in Congo given the prevalence of conflict, lawlessness and an opaque legal system. \n“We are prototyping, iterating, testing, scaling,” said Warren, who is working with experts to see how blockchain can improve mineral supply chains. “The technology is not the hard part.” \nAmnesty International, which detailed the extent of child labor in cobalt mining in Congo in a 2016 report, said it was looking at blockchain, especially with a view to tracing payments to middlemen. \n“You have to be wary of technological solutions to problems that are also political and economic, but blockchain may help. We’re not against it,” said Amnesty researcher Mark Dummett. \nCongo holds half the world’s cobalt reserves and demand for the main mineral component of lithium-ion batteries is set to surge as electric cars proliferate. In 2016, Congo mined 54 percent of the 123,000 tonnes of cobalt produced worldwide. \nCarmakers such as Volkswagen are trying to secure long-term cobalt supplies to sustain electric car production, and they are asking suppliers to ensure no child labor was used in the supply chain.

REUTERS/Kenny Katombe/File Photo BAGGED AND TAGGED \nThe plan for the Congo pilot scheme is to give each sealed bag of cobalt produced by a vetted artisanal miner a digital tag which is entered on blockchain using a mobile phone, along with details of the weight, date, time and perhaps a photo. \nAt the next stage, a trader buying the bag would record the details on blockchain, and the process would be repeated until the ore gets to the smelter - leaving an immutable record of the cobalt’s journey for downstream buyers or third parties to view. \nThe pilot will involve organizations throughout the supply chain, from on-the-ground monitors checking that sites are not using child labor, through the refining process to end users, according to people helping to develop the scheme. \nOne potential risk in the supply chain is that cobalt mined by children gets mixed with “clean” cobalt before processing. \nThe industry is experimenting with options such as indelible marks that survive the refining process, a mass balance approach as used for Fairtrade certification of products such as cocoa, or bolting blockchain onto computer technology already used by refiners to monitor material as it moves through their plants.
