Nash has left the company’s board and been replaced by Tony Tianyu Hou, who is also the firm’s chief financial officer.\nA Sea spokeswoman said the company had no immediate plans to appoint a new president.\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley, who are overweight on the stock, said that while the results overall were better than expected, there remained some risks to the outlook.\n“Intensifying e-commerce competition from global leaders may sustain marketing spend per order, widen losses in the medium term, and prolong the trajectory to profitability,” they said in a note to clients.\nTotal revenue for the December quarter rose 41 percent on a year earlier to $124.6 million as it launched new games and offered older ones in new markets.\nIt forecast 2018 full-year revenue of $730 million to $770 million.\nTotal adjusted revenue rose 72.8 percent to $164.5 million for the quarter, slightly above analysts’ average estimate of $156.3 million. Adjusted revenue for 2017 came in at $553.6 million, slightly ahead of its own forecast of $540 million to $550 million.\nSea posted an adjusted net loss of $251.6 million for the quarter, larger than the $201 million estimated by an average of three analysts according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe quarterly net loss attributable to Sea was $262.7 million, or 90 cents per share, from $72.2 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier.\nReporting by Tamara Mathias and Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru and Aradhana Aravindan in Singapore; Writing by John Geddie; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T07:00:17.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
