Adherence to (the) agreement has been relatively good,” Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ bank, said in a report on Thursday.\nReporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T09:25:22.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
