The previous IBRD 10.5-year sale in April 2026 raised A$150m. HIGH-QUALITY BOOK The latest 10.5-year offering from the World Bank funding arm confirmed the broadening real-money investor base.\nCentral banks and official institutions, which traditionally focus on the five-year segment, bought 64%, with asset managers and insurance companies taking 20%, while banks and corporates picked up the remaining 16%. Asia was allocated 88%, Australia 8% and Europe 4%.\nAsian banks, central banks and official institutions are looking to diversify portfolios overseas, away from local markets where property, resource and bank credits tend to dominate. In doing so, they are drawn to the recent back-up in yields and relative cost of funding advantages at the long end of the Kangaroo curve. The larger, more liquid, deals now being printed further adds to their allure.\nThe African Development Bank priced a A$360m 3.35% 10.5-year Kangaroo on January 30 at a yield of 3.38%, a decent pick-up over the 3.1575% to 3.21% yield range for taps of its July 2027s between April and October last year.\nIn absolute yield terms, the ACGB/Treasury spread had narrowed from around 30bp a year ago, but remained positive at 10bp–20bp during January, whereas the five-year ACGB fell to flat to Treasuries, having offered 40bp more juice in early 2017.\n“The US dollar market is compelling in the three-year to five-year segment, while the 10-year-plus Kangaroo segment is attractive on a comparative cost of funding basis. We expect this to remain the case unless yields retreat and/or the cross-currency swap basis narrows significantly,” White said.\nOverall, SSA Kangaroo supply is unlikely to reach 2014’s recent annual high point of A$26.0bn, especially if five-year offering remains in the doldrums. This seems likely in the near term as the five-year ACGBs/Treasury spread had fallen to negative 15bp last Thursday as US yields ratcheted higher. The 10-year spread tightened to just positive 2bp.\nThree-year to four-year issuance withered after 2011, when the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority left Kangaroos off its list of high-quality liquid assets for Basel III purposes, thereby depleting the natural bank-balance-sheet demand for this short-term paper.
