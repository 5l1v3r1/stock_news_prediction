But the biggest boost came from the tech sector, which gained 0.8 percent. Microsoft and Facebook were both up more than 1 percent ahead of their results after the bell.\nThe blue-chip Dow suffered its biggest two-day drop since September 2016 over Monday and Tuesday as U.S. Treasury yields surged to near four-year highs on expectations of global central banks lowering stimulus.\nThe stock market has been hit by the pace of the increase, rather than the rise in yields itself, which raises borrowing costs for firms and gives traders another investment option.\nThe Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting ends on Wednesday and its statement at 2 p.m. ET (1900 GMT) could shed light on the central bank’s economic and interest rate hike outlook.\nCurrently, the markets have priced in three rate hikes this year, and while analysts do not expect the first of them to come this month, they expect the Fed to strike a more hawkish tone.\n“We’re not expecting any changes today, but we may get some insight into whether the new tax reforms have altered the views of policy makers,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n“A slight change in the statement can get quite a reaction in the markets, so traders as ever will be looking for any signs that future rate hikes are under-priced, given the recent changes.”\nAt 9:37 a.m. ET, the Dow was up 252.68 points, or 0.97 percent, at 26,329.57, the S&P 500 was up 15.72 points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,838.15. The Nasdaq Composite was up 48.13 points, or 0.65 percent, at 7,450.62.\nU.S. stock index futures drifted higher late on Tuesday as Trump gave his State of the Union address.\nAmong other comments, Trump said he wanted legislation to generate at least $1.5 trillion for infrastructure spending and revisited a campaign promise to lower drug prices.\nAn ADP report showing the U.S. private sector added much more jobs in January than expected, 234,000 vs. 185,000, also boost sentiment ahead of the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data on Friday.\nAmong stocks, chipmaker AMD rose 4.5 percent, while Electronic Arts jumped 7.7 percent after their upbeat quarterly reports.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,146 to 461. On the Nasdaq, 1,806 issues rose and 554 fell.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 16 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 38 new highs and six new lows.
