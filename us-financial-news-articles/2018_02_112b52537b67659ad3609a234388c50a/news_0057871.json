Data on Tuesday showed German price growth underperformed expectations in February as it eased to a 15-month low.\nWhile the ECB has signalled concern over the volatility of the euro against the dollar and its potentially negative impact on inflation, Weidmann noted that the effect of exchange rate movements on inflation has appeared to diminish in recent years.\nAlthough central bank activity is not focused on earning a profit, quantitative easing and a negative deposit rate, which forces banks to pay to park cash at the central bank, have been highly profitable.\nThe Bundesbank will therefore pay 1.9 billion euros worth of its profit into the German federal budget, up from 399 million a year earlier, the bank said.\nReporting by Balazs Koranyi and Frank Siebelt; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T15:17:06.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
