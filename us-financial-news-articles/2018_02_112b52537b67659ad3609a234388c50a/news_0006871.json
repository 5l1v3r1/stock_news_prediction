It seems like I am on the good road now to full recovery,” he posted on Instagram. \nThe 12-time grand slam champion had hoped the extended break he took last year might solve the problem but said he decided on more drastic action after still experiencing pain in Melbourne. \n“I’ve been carrying this injury for the past two years, and during this time I’ve been seeing many doctors,” said Djokovic, who before last month had not competed since losing at Wimbledon last year. \n“I took six months off last season hoping to come back fully recovered, but unfortunately I still felt pain,” he said. \n”It’s quite a journey this one, I have to say. I‘m learning a lot and for that I‘m grateful. I’ve always taken care of my body and looked for the most natural ways to heal, and my body has rewarded me with some incredible years on tour. \n“I am super positive and excited to follow my recovery through so I can come back to the place I love the most. The court.” \nDjokovic thanked his fans for their support and said he would keep them posted as to his progress. \nDjokovic’s rival, Britain’s Andy Murray, is also recovering from surgery, to his hip, after also finding that rest did not cure his long-term injury.
