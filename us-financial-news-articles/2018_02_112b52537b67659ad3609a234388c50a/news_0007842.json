Ltd and Russia’s Sodrugestvo Group SA are also customers, the source said.\nBased on the current terms of Hidrovia’s take-or-pay contracts, it will collect total revenue of about 11.1 billion reais ($3.5 billion) through end-2039, the bond prospectus said. The sum includes revenue from contracts with COFCO. Those had to be amended after the Chinese company, which acquired the global assets of Nidera BV and Noble Group, struggled to originate the amount of grains expected under the original agreements, the source said.\nOn Jan. 8, Hidrovias said it had extended the duration of the COFCO contracts until 2031, while raising the maximum volume contracted by 9.630 million tonnes of grains.\nCOFCO did not immediately reply to a comment request.
