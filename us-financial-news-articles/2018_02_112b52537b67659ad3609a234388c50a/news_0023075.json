I feel confident. I feel really good. The jumps have been going really well. Hopefully it shows up in the competition here.”\nFernandez said at the Europeans that he was not looking for perfection but for improvement.\nAlongside his Canadian coach Brian Orser, he has worked on pacing himself throughout the season in the hope of peaking in Pyeongchang.\n“You cannot peak in every competition 100 percent,” Fernandez said. “You have to save a little bit for the biggest.”\nHe has also adjusted his training schedule to adapt to the early start times in Pyeongchang.\nFor his practice on Tuesday, Fernandez said he woke up at 4:55 am local time (1955 GMT).\n“I’ve been training in the morning every day, instead at noon as we usually train,” he said. “I‘m kind of used to it.”\nFernandez made history last month when he became the first man since Karl Schaefer in 1936 to win six successive European titles.\nIn Pyeongchang, he has another chance to make history. If he steps on the podium in his third Olympics, he would end Spain’s 26-year-old Winter Olympic medal drought.\nThe country has won two medals at the Winter Olympics -- a gold in the men’s slalom in 1972 and a bronze in the women’s slalom in 1992 won by siblings Francisco and Blanca Fernandez Ochoa.\nGerman-born cross-country skier Johann Muehlegg won three golds for Spain at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games but was disqualified for doping.\nAfter a disappointing fourth-place finish at the 2014 Sochi Games, Fernandez’s podium hunger grew stronger.\nSince Sochi, he won successive world titles, four European titles and two Grand Prix Final silver medals.\nFernandez knows that success in Pyeongchang will have profound repercussions on the sport in his native country, but he faces stiff competition from Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu, Nathan Chen of the United States and Canada’s Patrick Chan.\n“After Europeans, I got letters sent to my home and federation from all of them,” Fernandez said of the Spanish authorities.\n”But you know, after this competition is done, we will see what has happened.\n“It will be important for the country, for the sport in my country, but I still have to do it.” (Editing by Greg Stutchbury)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T16:04:37.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
