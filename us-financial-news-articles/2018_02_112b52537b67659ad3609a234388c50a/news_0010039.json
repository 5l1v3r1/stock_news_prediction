The 2018 Pegasus World Cup Invitational in Florida had a $16-million purse.\nReporting by Stephen KalinEditing by Andrew Torchia and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T15:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T13:38:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
