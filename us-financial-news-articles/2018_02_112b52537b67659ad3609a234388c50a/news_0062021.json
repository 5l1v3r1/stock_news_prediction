The build-up reflects the continued growth of the U.S. apartment industry and the nation's voracious appetite for hyper-focused journalism.\n\"Apartment investments will maintain a positive outlook,\" states Marcus & Millichap's 2018 Multifamily forecast; a sentiment shared by most analysts. As rentals expand to a wider selection of products, classes and locations, the sector will continue its steady growth as profit centers for operators and their suppliers. The industry generated an estimated $163 billion in revenue from 2012-2017, with an annual growth of 4.3 percent according to an IBIS industry market report.\n\"The business of rentals has long fought for its own voice,\" said Linda Hoffman, publisher of Multihousing Pro. \"This counter culture⎼⎼independent of the campaign for homeownership⎼⎼has gathered a massive, dedicated group of owners and operators. Landlords need a focused source of the best methods for profitability and cash flow. Value-driven content, honest and equitable, is critical to today's rental operation, and essential to effectively navigating the changing commercial landscape.\"\nWhile the general print market has experienced compression, localized and industry-focused titles have expanded according to Folio, an industry group focused on media trends. Multihousing Pro has doubled both its digital and print circulation in the last months and will expand its special interest titles/supplements.\nThe organization has also brought in John Clemens as National Sales Manager. Clemens is a second-generation print media rep. He will leverage the magazine's loyal readership into value streams for industry suppliers seeking to offer products and services that elevate multifamily businesses.\nAbout Multihousing Pro\nCirculated to 25,000 professionals in the U.S. apartment and housing rental industry, Multihousing Pro delivers content on relevant trends, notable deals, products and services identified to increase profit and cash flow for owners and operators.
