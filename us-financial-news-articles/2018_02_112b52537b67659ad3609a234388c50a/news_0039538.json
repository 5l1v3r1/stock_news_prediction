They weren’t aware of any factors like that. They made the call themselves on the data.”\nLowe said he had no concerns about how well the Russian, only his country’s third Formula One driver after now-departed Vitaly Petrov and Daniil Kvyat, would perform.\nHe said Sirotkin, who first appeared on Formula One’s radar when he joined Swiss-based Sauber in 2013 as a 17-year-old development driver, had served a “fantastic apprenticeship” in the junior series.\n“I think he couldn’t be in better shape to hit the ground running as a new driver in Formula One,” added the technical head.\nSirotkin, who has been spending five days a week at the Williams factory since the start of the year, told reporters he was ready to deliver when the season starts in Australia on March 25.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T15:49:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
