But one market strategist is arguing that on a technical basis, the Russell 2000 index is holding up well relative to its large-cap peers and is well-positioned going forward. \nWhile the Dow Jones industrial average , S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have all fallen around 5 percent in the last week, the small-cap stock index has declined a little more than 4 percent. On Wednesday, the Russell 2000 closed the day barely positive while the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500 and Dow all closed in the red. \nMatt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, said the Russell 2000 should be positioned to outperform. Here are his reasons. \n• The small-cap index is generally composed of domestically centered companies, which makes it particularly sensitive to moves in the U.S. dollar index. \n• After a 14-month decline, the dollar index is finally starting to see a bit of a bounce. This comes on the heels of extremely oversold conditions, and sentiment has become quite bearish around the greenback. \n• During this week's broad market decline, the Russell managed to bounce strongly off its 200-day moving average. That line proved great support for the index last year, so this resilience is positive on a technical basis. \n• The technical picture, coupled with an expected bounce in the U.S. dollar, says the Russell is an index that outperforms going forward. \nBottom line: The Russell 2000 index could be well-positioned going forward as it appears to be holding up better than its large-cap peers amid a broader market sell-off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:30:39.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
