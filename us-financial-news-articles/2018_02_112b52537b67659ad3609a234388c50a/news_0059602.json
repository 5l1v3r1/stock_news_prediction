There are pros and cons. We're just looking at those ranges of options.\"\nPalmer also said Aston Martin was applying to have the new Vantage licensed by a regulator in the European Union rather than in Britain due to uncertainty over vehicle rules after Brexit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T12:52:27.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
