In 2016, Televisa’s license for some content with Netflix lapsed as it launched its own streaming service, blim.\n“They were trying to foster their own platform,” de Legarreta said. “The trouble with this is that they lack the scale that players like Netflix and Amazon have.”\nTelevisa said it will produce programming from an “original content” division with presences in Los Angeles and Mexico City.\nThe broadcaster will eventually bring the programming to free and cable networks in Mexico as well as the United States through Univision, the U.S.-based Spanish-language network. Televisa has a large stake in Univision.\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nThe partnership is expected to help Amazon as it seeks to improve its position in Mexico and Latin America more broadly.\nThe tech giant has invested heavily in Mexico, leasing a 1 million square-foot warehouse near Mexico City and promoting its Prime delivery service. Amazon is also eyeing a large warehouse in Brazil, Reuters reported.\nReporting by Julia Love; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Paul Simao, Christian Plumb and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:40:17.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
