About 300 people had evacuated but were now returning to their homes, Butler said. Many people remained without clean, running water. \nU.S. President Donald Trump declared emergency status for American Samoa, authorising the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts.
