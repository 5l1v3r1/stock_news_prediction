Additionally, we are introducing a range for 2019 revenue growth.\nFourth Quarter 2018 Guidance:\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, constant currency revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 28% to 29% and revenue is expected to be in the range of $71.1 million to $71.8 million. Our guidance is based on exchange rates as of January 31, 2018 and includes a positive impact of $3.9 million related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $5.4 million to $6.4 million.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance:\nFor the full year 2018, revenue is expected to be in the range of $259.6 million to $260.3 million or 36% growth in constant currency. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations are positively impacting this guidance by an estimated $4.9 million related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar with respect to the British Pound and the South African Rand versus the prior year. Relative to the prior annual guidance we provided in November, foreign exchange rate fluctuations are positively impacting this guidance by an estimated $3.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $23.9 million to $24.9 million.\nGAAP net loss is the most comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA differs from GAAP net loss in that it excludes depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, interest income and interest expense, the provision for income taxes and foreign exchange (expense) income. Mimecast is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Mimecast has not provided guidance for GAAP net loss or a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nMimecast will host a conference call to discuss these financial results for investors and analysts at 4:30 pm EDT (UTC-05:00) on February 12, 2018.

Mimecast intends all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 21E of the Exchange Act and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors including those risks, uncertainties and factors detailed in Mimecast’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mimecast is providing the information in this press release as of this date and assumes no obligations to update the information included in this press release or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.\nRevenue Constant Currency Growth Rate. We believe revenue constant currency growth rate is a key indicator of our operating results. We calculate revenue constant currency growth rate by translating revenue from entities reporting in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars using the comparable foreign currency exchange rates from the prior fiscal period. To determine projected revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, expected revenue from entities reporting in foreign currencies will be translated into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s monthly average foreign currency exchange rates.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin . We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key indicators of our operating results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, interest income and interest expense, the provision for income taxes and foreign exchange (expense) income predominantly related to the elimination of intercompany balances. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA over revenue in the period.\nNon-GAAP net income. We define non-GAAP net income as net loss less share-based compensation expense and the related income tax effects of excluding share-based compensation expense. We consider this non-GAAP financial measure to be a useful metric for management and investors because it excludes the effect of share-based compensation expense and related income tax effects so that our management and investors can compare our recurring core business net results over multiple periods. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP net income versus net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP. For example, as noted above, non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense and related income tax effects. In addition, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP net income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and evaluating non-GAAP net income together with net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFree cash flow . We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow facilitates management’s comparisons of our operating results to competitors’ operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating our company is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and in the liquidity and capital resources discussion included in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nMIMECAST LIMITED\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nThree months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue $ 67,272 $ 48,333 $ 188,496 $ 134,154 Cost of revenue 17,728 13,144 49,523 36,860 Gross profit 49,544 35,189 138,973 97,294 Operating expenses Research and development 10,005 5,889 26,188 15,986 Sales and marketing 31,190 25,336 88,904 69,665 General and administrative 9,478 6,994 26,629 20,047 Total operating expenses 50,673 38,219 141,721 105,698 Loss from operations (1,129 ) (3,030 ) (2,748 ) (8,404 ) Other income (expense) Interest income 301 164 854 307 Interest expense (56 ) (61 ) (156 ) (244 ) Foreign exchange (expense) income (864 ) (81 ) (2,059 ) 6,734 Total other income (expense), net (619 ) 22 (1,361 ) 6,797 Loss before income taxes (1,748 ) (3,008 ) (4,109 ) (1,607 ) Provision for income taxes 845 362 1,723 1,216 Net loss $ (2,593 ) $ (3,370 ) $ (5,832 ) $ (2,823 ) Net loss per ordinary share Basic and diluted $ (0.05 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.10 ) $ (0.05 ) Weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding: Basic and diluted 57,505 54,949 56,944 54,625 MIMECAST LIMITED\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nAs of December 31, As of March 31, 2017 2017 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 75,990 $ 51,319 Short-term investments 52,905 60,347 Accounts receivable, net 53,796 44,358 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 10,269 10,054 Total current assets 192,960 166,078 Property and equipment, net 86,894 32,009 Intangible assets, net 10,279 1,590 Goodwill 5,612 5,363 Other assets 1,564 312 Total assets $ 297,309 $ 205,352 Liabilities and shareholders' equity Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 5,989 $ 3,558 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 28,755 20,713 Deferred revenue 102,740 84,159 Current portion of capital lease obligations 1,180 233 Current portion of long-term debt 187 1,725 Total current liabilities 138,851 110,388 Deferred revenue, net of current portion 16,684 11,189 Long-term capital lease obligations 2,766 245 Construction financing lease obligation 36,776 -- Other non-current liabilities 5,797 1,538 Total liabilities 200,874 123,360 Commitments and contingencies Shareholders' equity Ordinary shares, $0.012 par value, 300,000,000 shares authorized;

The key performance indicators that we monitor are as follows:\nThree months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) (dollars in thousands) Revenue constant currency growth rate (1) 36 % 39 % 40 % 36 % Revenue retention rate (2) 111 % 112 % 111 % 112 % Total customers (3) 29,200 24,900 29,200 24,900 Gross profit percentage 74 % 73 % 74 % 73 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 6,732 $ 3,653 $ 18,528 $ 8,248\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA and revenue constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and revenue constant currency growth rates to the nearest comparable GAAP measures, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. (2) We calculate our revenue retention rate by annualizing constant currency revenue recorded on the last day of the measurement period for only those customers in place throughout the entire measurement period. We include add-on, or upsell, revenue from additional employees and services purchased by existing customers. We divide the result by revenue on a constant currency basis on the first day of the measurement period for all customers in place at the beginning of the measurement period. The measurement period is the trailing twelve months. The revenue on a constant currency basis is based on the average exchange rates in effect during the respective period. (3) Reflects the customer count on the last day of the period rounded to the nearest hundred customers. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. A customer is typically a parent company or, in a few cases, a significant subsidiary that works with us directly.
