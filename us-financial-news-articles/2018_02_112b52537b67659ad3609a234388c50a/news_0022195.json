North America and Europe make up the bulk of Britain’s international business in general insurance. \nABI’s proposals include relaxing foreign ownership rules so insurers can take controlling stakes in companies in those countries, looser regulations on data transfer and the inclusion of pension and savings products in any trade deals. \nMajor British insurers such as Prudential ( PRU.L ) and Standard Life Aberdeen ( SLA.L ) have joint ventures in China and India. \nForeign firms cannot now take majority stakes in insurers in those countries, although China has said it plans to relax the rules. \nBritain’s insurance and long-term savings sector is the fourth largest in the world, the ABI said. It contributes 35 billion pounds to the UK economy annually and employs 324,000 people. \n“Since a number of our members have been operating internationally for decades, we have access to unique expertise to help shape the terms and conditions of future trade deals that would apply to us,” said Savill, a former trade negotiator.
