She did not identify the suspect, and said the suspect’s condition and a possible motive for the shooting were unknown. \nThe names of the slain officers have not been released, pending notification of relatives. The shootings are being investigated by Columbus police, the spokeswoman said. \nThe Ohio police shootings came a day after a Georgia police officer was shot and killed and two sheriff’s deputies were wounded by a gunman who was then killed.
