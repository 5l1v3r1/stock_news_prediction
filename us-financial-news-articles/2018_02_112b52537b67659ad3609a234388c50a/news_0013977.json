The dividend is payable March 28, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2018. In addition, the board of directors authorized a $500-million increase to Anadarko's previously announced $2.5 billion share-repurchase program, bringing the total repurchase program to $3.0 billion. As of Feb. 5, 2018, the company had completed $1.6 billion of repurchases under the program totaling more than 30 million shares. In addition, Anadarko intends to reduce outstanding indebtedness by more than $1 billion by retiring 2018 and 2019 debt maturities at par.\n\"These actions to materially increase the dividend payout and expand our share-repurchase program continue to demonstrate our focus on enhancing shareholder value,\" said Al Walker, Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO. \"In light of our commitment to capital efficiency demonstrated by investing within cash flow in a $50 oil and $3 natural gas environment, our substantial cash flow from the Western Gas franchise, and ample liquidity, we have the confidence to quintuple our dividend and increase our share-repurchase plan by $500 million to a total current program of $3 billion. As market conditions permit, we will continue to pursue opportunities to repurchase additional shares and improve our dividend. Beyond these actions to increase direct cash returns to shareholders, we are committed to debt reduction, as demonstrated by our intent to retire at par more than $1 billion of near-term maturities, while looking for economic opportunities to pursue additional liability-management activity for future maturities.\"\nThe level of future dividends for Anadarko common stock will be determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis depending upon the company's earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. The share-repurchase authorization extends through the end of 2018, and in accordance with applicable securities laws, repurchases will be made from time to time in open market or private transactions, depending on market conditions, and may be discontinued at any time.\nCONFERENCE CALL TODAY AT 8 A.M.
