It denies opposition and witness accounts that its planes target civilians, market places, medical centres and residential areas away from frontlines.\nSyrian media made no mention of the strikes.\nA major Syrian army offensive, begun earlier this year in southern Aleppo and eastern Idlib, has allowed it to take control of a large amount of territory from rebel forces.\nThe advances have caused an exodus of thousands of civilians to the relative safety of territory further north towards the Turkish border.\nAir raids have struck several cave hospitals and exacerbated a refugee crisis along the Turkish frontier, where camps now house tens thousands of displaced people.\nThe army confirmed new gains on Saturday, saying it had seized a string of villages from al Qaeda fighters, state television said, quoting a military source.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by Andrew Bolton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T16:29:16.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
