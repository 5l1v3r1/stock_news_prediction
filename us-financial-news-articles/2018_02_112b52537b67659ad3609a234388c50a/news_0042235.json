We’re not sure of the volumes, but if they are looking for anything more than a couple of years, they might be disappointed.”\nA Bloomberg report, citing an anonymous source, said the iPhone maker was seeking contracts to buy several thousand metric tonnes of cobalt for five years or longer.\nIndustry sources said Apple had spoken to miners such as Glencore, a top producer, which said late last year it would produce around 39,000 tonnes of cobalt this year.\nAsked on a results call with reporters on Wednesday about the company’s relationship with Apple, Glencore’s Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg said: “We have not signed any deals,” adding that Glencore would not sign any long-term deals because the company did not want to lock in cobalt prices.\nTalking to reporters in London last December, Glasenberg said the company had held talks with Apple, Tesla and Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) as part of ongoing discussions with industrial clients.\nSources told Reuters last year that Germany’s Volkswagen had asked producers to submit proposals on supplying cobalt for up to 10 years from 2019.\nCobalt prices on the London Metal Exchange, at around $80,000 a tonne, have climbed from near $20,000 in January 2016.\nGlobal demand this year is estimated at more than 110,000 tonnes, of which more than 65 percent is expected to come from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is a byproduct of copper production.\nRights group Amnesty International said last year about a fifth of Congo’s cobalt production is mined by hand by informal miners including children, often in dangerous conditions.\n“Responsible sourcing has become the be all and end all, especially in the DRC and especially after the Amnesty report,” a cobalt trading source said.\nThe DRC is the richest source of cobalt but smaller deposits are also found in countries ranging from Finland to Canada.\nReporting by Pratima Desai, Barbara Lewis and Stephen Nellis; Additional reporting by Mekhla Raina and Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T09:19:43.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
