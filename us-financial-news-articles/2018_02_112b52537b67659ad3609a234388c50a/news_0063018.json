That would in turn hurt corporate earnings, clouding the outlook for what had been expected to be another solid year of global economic growth.\n“Today’s comments appear to open the door for others on the (Fed) Committee to revise their forecast as they see fit, and that Powell himself may be inclined to look for four hikes this year,” JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli said in a note.\nThe Fed moved three times in 2017 and is seen as certain to do the same or more this year, with the first move expected as early as March.\nCURRENCIES The dollar held on to gains after rallying against most major currencies on Tuesday.\nIt hovered near a recent 1-1/2 month top against the Australian dollar and held near a three-week high on the euro at $1.2221.\nHowever, it did not fare well against the Japanese yen, a perceived safe haven. The dollar was last down 0.2 percent at 107.10 yen.\nDollar bulls were wrongfooted after the Bank of Japan announced it would trim the amount of super long Japanese government bonds it offered to purchase at its regular debt-buying operation.\nAnalysts are predicting a stronger yen this year despite faster U.S. rate rises, although speculators and Japanese retail investors have built huge short positions in yen futures setting the scene for a massive shakeout.\nIn commodities, oil prices extended declines on weak output data from China and Japan and as an industry data showed an increase in U.S. crude stockpiles.\nBrent crude futures fell 40 cents to $66.23 a barrel, while U.S. crude was last down 33 cents at $62.68.\nSpot gold eased to $1,317.61 an ounce, not far from Tuesday’s $1,313.26 which was the lowest in three weeks.\nReporting by Swati Pandey Editing by Eri Meijer and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:44:07.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
