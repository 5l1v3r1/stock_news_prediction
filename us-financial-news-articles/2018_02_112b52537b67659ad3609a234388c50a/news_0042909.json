Ahead of the final run, the fastest five pilots were separated by a quarter of a second. Kripps and brakeman Alexander Kopacz clocked two minutes, 27.58 seconds over their three runs, with Germany’s four-times world champion Francesco Friedrich 0.06 seconds behind. Friedrich’s team mates Johannes Lochner and brakeman Christopher Weber were in third place. After leading heats one and two, a slow run by Germany’s Nico Walther sent the 27-year-old down to fifth place at the Olympic Sliding Centre.

If a German pair wins in Pyeongchang, the country will equal Switzerland’s Olympic record five golds in the event.
