But the plan was developed and approved by Republican lawmakers with minimal White House involvement. It was the Republican-controlled Congress’ only major accomplishment of 2017.\nSo some Republicans may feel free to leave Trump out of their tax-cut message. Portman, a centrist who is not up for re-election in November, did just that on Friday and Saturday.\n“We have seen over 350 companies make positive announcements ... they all have a positive story to tell about how they are taking the tax savings and plowing it back into their business,” Portman said at GKM Auto Parts on Friday.\nPortman said a month before the 2016 election that he could not support Trump and said afterward he did not vote for him.\nBefore a small group of business people, GKM owner Kelly Moore praised Portman for helping craft the tax bill that she said let her reinstate healthcare coverage for her employees.\nU.S. Senator Rob Portman asks small business owners about how the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act effects their business during his tour of Ohio in Zanesville, Ohio, U.S., February 23, 2018.

REUTERS/Kim Palmer On his “Results for the Middle Class Tax Reform Tour,” Portman has hosted several other tax-focused events, including ones on Saturday in Cleveland and Mentor. Reports on his official website from the two events made no mention of Trump.\nDEMOCRATIC CHALLENGE Portman is seeking to promote the tax cuts as a benefit for working Americans, but that view is strongly challenged by Democrats, who say the tax changes mainly benefit corporations and the rich.\nU.S. Senator Rob Portman talks to local media during his tour of Ohio business affected by Tax Cuts & Jobs Act in Zanesville, Ohio, U.S., February 23, 2018.

A Feb. 13-22 Reuters/Ipsos poll found a range of views about the tax legislation, with only 3 percent of respondents saying they had received an actual benefit, like a raise or bonus.\nOhio’s other U.S. senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, is seeking re-election this November, with the state likely to be a major electoral battleground as the two parties fight for control of Congress. Portman and Trump are both backing Representative Jim Renacci in the Republican primary race to choose a challenger to Brown.\nOhio Democrats accused Portman of skirting questions about the tax bill by staging “PR events with captive audiences.”\n”Portman conveniently forgets to mention that companies Trump touted for giving bonuses have been simultaneously laying off workers,” said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper.\nBut some Republican strategists said talks like the one Portman gave in Zanesville were helping the party shrink the Democrats’ advantage in a generic poll as to which party is favored by voters in congressional elections.\nThe tax cuts are much friendlier territory for Republicans than Trump’s tweets, said John Feehery, a lobbyist and former senior Republican aide in the House of Representatives.\n“If we are talking about President Trump and his character, it’s probably not a winner for Republicans,” Feehery said.\nAdditional reporting by Susan Cornwell in Washington and Chris Kahn in New York; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:56:12.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
