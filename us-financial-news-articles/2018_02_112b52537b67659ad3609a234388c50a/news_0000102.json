The meeting included Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and the three leaders discussed trade issues and the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear program. \nThe relationship between Trump and Turnbull got off to a rocky start. Trump spoke to Turnbull a few days after the U.S. president took office in January 2017, but Trump broke off what was supposed to be an hour-long conversation after a tense 25 minutes. \nThe Republican president became irritated that he was expected to honor an agreement made by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, to accept 1,250 refugees. In the end, Trump decided to honor the agreement. \nTrump and Turnbull apparently smoothed over their differences in a face-to-face meeting in New York in May, with Trump declaring they “get along great.” Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Eric Walsh and Peter Cooney", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T04:26:53.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
