ENLK fourth-quarter 2017 results are expected to be at the high-end of previously disclosed annualized adjusted EBITDA run-rate guidance range of $925 million to $950 million. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is explained in greater detail under \"Non-GAAP Financial Information.\" ENLK is projecting to grow net income by 116 percent and projecting to increase adjusted EBITDA midpoint by nearly 15 percent in 2018 as compared to 2017 guidance midpoint. EnLink projects Oklahoma volumes and segment profit to grow between 30 to 40 percent during 2018, as compared to annualized reported results for the third quarter of 2017.\n\"EnLink's growth outlook is robust, as sustained producer activity and increased drilling efficiencies are expected to drive cash flow and volume growth across our systems,\" said Michael J. Garberding, EnLink President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our near-term growth in key supply basins translates directly into growth for our demand-driven position along the Gulf Coast, and we are focusing our 2018 organic projects on investing highly-efficient capital to expand in our most active areas.\"\nENLK 2018 Guidance\nNet income is projected to range from $255 million to $315 million. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to range from $950 million to $1.02 billion, representing a nearly 15 percent increase in the 2018 midpoint of $985 million compared to the 2017 guidance midpoint affirmed on October 31, 2017. Distributable cash flow is projected to range from $630 million to $680 million. Distributable cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is explained in greater detail under \"Non-GAAP Financial Information.\" Distribution coverage is projected to range from 1.00x to 1.10x, assuming unchanged distributions throughout 2018. Debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is projected to range from 4.20x to 3.70x. ENLK has no debt maturities in 2018, and less than $500 million of long-term debt maturities over the next five years (not accounting for its revolving credit facility). ENLK remains committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and strong liquidity position. Oklahoma segment profit and average gas gathering, transmission and processing volumes are projected to increase by 30 percent to 40 percent as compared to annualized segment profit and volumes for the third quarter of 2017 as reported on October 31, 2017. Growth capital expenditures funded exclusively by ENLK are projected to range from $585 million to $715 million, and are primarily forecasted to be driven by ongoing investments in the company's key growth regions, including Oklahoma, the Permian Basin, and Louisiana. ENLK expects to realize adjusted EBITDA multiples on organic capital investments in the mid-single-digit range, reflecting attractive returns in-line with historical levels. Total growth capital expenditures, including contributions from joint venture partners and ENLC, are projected to range from $700 million to $860 million. Both ENLK and total growth capital expenditure ranges exclude the final $250 million installment payment, paid in early January 2018, related to the completed acquisition of the Central Oklahoma assets in 2016.\nENLC 2018 Guidance\nNet income is projected to range from $233 million to $291 million. Cash available for distribution is projected to range from $230 million to $240 million, representing an increase of approximately seven percent compared to previously announced 2017 midpoint guidance affirmed on October 31, 2017. Cash available for distribution is a non-GAAP measure and is explained in greater detail under \"Non-GAAP Financial Information.\" Distribution coverage is projected to range from 1.16x to 1.22x, assuming ENLC's previously announced guidance of five percent annual growth in declared distributions for 2018, as compared to declared distributions for 2017. Distribution coverage guidance includes the impact of funding assumptions further described below. Cash available for distribution contribution from ENLC's 16 percent ownership in EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing, LP (\"EnLink Oklahoma T.O.\") is projected to range from $40 million to $50 million. Growth capital expenditures funded exclusively by ENLC are projected to range from $45 million to $55 million. ENLC is projecting to self-fund approximately 75 percent of these growth capital expenditures with excess cash after giving effect to expected distribution growth, with the remaining 25 percent expected to be funded with debt.\nEnLink's 2018 financial and operational guidance assumes a West Texas Intermediate crude oil average price of $60 per barrel and a Henry Hub average price of $3 per million British Thermal Units. Net income and adjusted EBITDA ranges assume commodity price movement, as well as business opportunities and risks. EnLink's 2018 guidance information is projected and, accordingly, remains subject to changes that could be significant.

Visit www.EnLink.com for more information on how EnLink connects energy to life.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures that we refer to as adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow available to common unitholders (\"distributable cash flow\"), and the General Partner's cash available for distribution.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, impairments, unit-based compensation, (gain) loss on non-cash derivatives, (gain) loss on disposition of assets, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, successful acquisition transaction costs, accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations, reimbursed employee costs, non-cash rent and distributions from unconsolidated affiliate investments, less payments under onerous performance obligations, non-controlling interest and (income) loss from unconsolidated affiliate investments.\nWe define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA (as defined above), net to the Partnership, less interest expense (excluding amortization of the EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing LP (together with its subsidiaries, \"EnLink Oklahoma T.O.\") acquisition installment payable discount), litigation settlement adjustment, adjustments for the redeemable non-controlling interest, interest rate swaps, current income taxes and other non-distributable cash flows, accrued cash distributions on Series B Preferred Units and Series C Preferred Units paid or expected to be paid, and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding maintenance capital expenditures that were contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities.\nThe General Partner's cash available for distribution is defined as net income (loss) of the General Partner less the net income (loss) attributable to the Partnership, which is consolidated into the General Partner's net income (loss), plus the General Partner's (i) share of distributions from the Partnership, (ii) share of EnLink Oklahoma T.O. non-cash expenses, (iii) deferred income tax (benefit) expense, (iv) corporate goodwill impairment, (v) acquisition transaction costs attributable to its share of the EnLink Oklahoma T.O. acquisition, less the General Partner's interest in maintenance capital expenditures of EnLink Oklahoma T.O. and less third-party non-controlling interest share of net income (loss) from consolidated affiliates.\nThe Partnership's Distribution Coverage is calculated by dividing distributable cash flow by distributions declared to the General Partner and the unitholders. The General Partner's Distribution Coverage is calculated by dividing cash available for distribution by distributions declared by the General Partner.\nGrowth capital expenditures generally include capital expenditures made for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our asset base, operating income or operating capacity over the long-term.\nMaintenance capital expenditures include capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of the assets and to extend their useful lives.\nSegment profit (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, (gain) loss on disposition of assets, impairments and (gain) loss on litigation settlement. Segment profit (loss) includes non-cash compensation expenses reflected in operating expenses. See \"Item 1. Financial Statements– Note 14 Segment Information\" in ENLK's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, for further information about segment profit (loss).\nThe Partnership and General Partner believe these measures are useful to investors because they may provide users of this financial information with meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-reported results and a meaningful measure of the Partnership's and the General Partner's cash flow after satisfaction of the capital and related requirements of their respective operations. In addition, adjusted EBITDA achievement is a primary metric used in the Partnership's credit facility and short-term incentive program for compensating its employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash available for distribution, as defined above, are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. They should not be considered in isolation or as an indicator of the Partnership's and the General Partner's performance. Furthermore, they should not be seen as a substitute for metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for the periods that are presented in this press release are included in the following tables. See ENLK's and ENLC's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
