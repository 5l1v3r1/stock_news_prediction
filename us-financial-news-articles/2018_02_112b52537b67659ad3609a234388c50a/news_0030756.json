Defending champion Jorrit Bergsma of the Netherlands had to settle for silver and Italian Nicola Tumolero took the bronze medal. Sochi silver medalist Sven Kramer of the Netherlands, one of the favorites for gold, finished in a disappointing sixth place as his curse in the longest Olympic distance struck again. Bloemen, the world record holder, faced a daunting task as Bergsma, who raced in the pair before him, shaved 2.46 seconds of the Olympic record he set in Sochi.

At the Vancouver Games eight years ago, Kramer finished first but was disqualified for choosing the wrong lane after his coach gave him the wrong instructions.
