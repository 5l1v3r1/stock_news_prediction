Both countries know any move to join the alliance would create a backlash in Moscow, which opposes any expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nTrump has been a frequent critic of NATO, accusing member countries of not spending enough on defense and of owing “massive amounts of money” to the United States and NATO.\nFinland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland agreed in November to step up defense cooperation and exchange more air surveillance information, part of a broader effort to build up their defenses to counter Russian activities.\nReporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:34:55.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
