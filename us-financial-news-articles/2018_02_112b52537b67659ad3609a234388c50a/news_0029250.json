(“iFresh” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ:IFMK), a leading Asian American grocery supermarket chain and online grocer, today reported unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal 2018 Third Quarter Highlights:\nTotal net sales increased $0.9 million, or 3% to $35.9 million, from $34.9 million in the prior year period.\nGross profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased by 2%, to $7.5 million, compared to $7.4 million in the prior year period.\nMr. Long Deng, Chairman of the board of directors and CEO of iFresh, commented, “We are pleased to see an increase in total net sales in the quarter ended December 31, 2017. We reported a net loss this quarter mainly due to the impact of Hurricane Irma and the additional expenses related to four newly acquired stores, three of which are in the process of being renovated and are not yet generating revenue. In addition, due to the warehouse dispute with the landlord of our Ming’s warehouse, sales have been limited due to the lack of warehouse space.\nThe rent dispute with the landlord of Ming’s warehouse went to trial and concluded on August 29, 2017 with a jury verdict in favor of the Company. The verdict awarded Ming's damages of almost 2 million dollars, with another $2,250 each month. The verdict is subject to appeal.\nWe remain committed to driving sales within existing stores and actively pursuing expansion opportunities in strategic geographies. In the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we acquired two new stores, New York Mart CT, Inc. and New York Mart N. Miami Inc. The two stores are expected to open in the first quarter of 2018 after renovation. Once finished, NYM N. Miami will become one of the largest Asian supermarkets in South Florida.\nFor the coming Chinese New Year, we are ready to capture opportunities with iFresh’s unique products and integrated supply chain. We look forward to updating you on our performance in the near future,” concluded Mr. Deng.\nThird Quarter 2018 Results\nNet Sales\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net sales were $35.9 million, an increase of $0.9 million, or 3%, from $34.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This was driven by a retail segment net sales increase of 1%, to $28.2 million, from $27.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and a wholesale segment net sales increase of $0.7 million, to $7.7 million, from $7.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased by 2%, to $7.5 million, compared to $7.4 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 21.0% and 21.2% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expense was $7.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $6.5 million in the same period of the last fiscal year, which was mainly attributable to increased payroll expenses and the additional expenses related to four stores acquired in July and October, 2017, three of which are in the process of being renovated and are not yet generating revenue.\nNet Income (loss)\nNet loss was $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 146%, from $0.6 million of net income for the three months ended December 31, 2016, mainly attributable to impact of Hurricane Irma, increased general and administrative expenses and higher interest expenses.\nCash, Liquidity and Financial Position\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.9 million, compared to $2.5 million as of March 31, 2017. Working capital was $8.4 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $13.4 million as of March 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $1.2 million of bank loans due within one year.\nFor the nine months ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $ 0.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $3.8 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.8 million.\nAbout iFresh, Inc.\niFresh Inc., headquartered in Long Island City, New York, is a leading Asian American grocery supermarket chain and online grocer.
