For the week, the benchmark index was up 0.4 percent.\nConstruction companies Kajima Corp and Taisei Corp climbed 2.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, and Tokyo Electric Power Co rose 1.8 percent.\nMining stocks also gained, with Inpex and Japan Petroleum Exploration both surging 2.0 percent after oil prices rose to two-week highs.\nExporters were mixed. Some investors hesitated to take positions, on caution the U.S. share market could see volatility again.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.4 percent to 1,753.98.
