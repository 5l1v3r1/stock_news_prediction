They had good profits in the last fiscal year, but will that be a norm?” said Raymond Spencer, an analyst at Moody‘s. “The first nine months of this year says no. It continues to be volatile.” \nNomura bought Lehman Brothers’ equities and investment banking business in Europe and Asia in 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis, in a bid to expand from its domestic stronghold. \nNomura said it would book pretax income of around 9 billion yen in the year to March after selling its stake in Asahi Fire & Marine Insurance Co Ltd to e-commerce firm Rakuten Inc. $1 = 109.3500 yen Editing by Jacqueline Wong", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T08:42:43.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
