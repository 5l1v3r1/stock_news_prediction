UK extradition laws prohibit UK from extraditing Roach to Singapore in the absence of such an assurance,” Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement.\n“The provision of the assurance is being done to try and ensure that Roach does not escape justice, and does not affect the general position taken by Singapore on corporal punishment. The UK Courts will decide whether to extradite Roach.”\nThe rare bank robbery in Singapore sparked a flurry of debate about whether the country has grown too complacent about security.\nSingapore has very low levels of crime, thanks in part to decades of strict policing and tough punishments, ranging from death for drug trafficking and murder to prison and caning for lesser crimes.\nReporting by John Geddie; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T17:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:20:57.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
