Babis denies wrongdoing.\nANO has given backing to the referendum initiative but does not want it to cover foreign policy issues like EU membership.\n“We maintain our position that the subject of a referendum should not be exiting the EU,” ANO Senator Helena Valkova said after talks.\nANO is meeting the far-right, anti-EU SPD party, the far-left Communists, and the protest Pirates party on the referendum legislation, which would need three-fifths support in the lower house and backing in the Senate that is not certain.\nTalks will continue next week and face questions over what turnout would be needed to validate a referendum and how many signatures are needed to initiate a vote.\nSPD leader Tomio Okamura, who has pushed referendum legislation, said the question of EU membership was an obstacle in talks but there was a willingness to move forward.\nPresident Milos Zeman, who has courted stronger ties with Russia and China, has also backed referendum legislation and holding a vote on EU membership, but says he would vote to stay in the bloc.\nWhile ANO took a tough line against Brussels before the election, Babis - the country’s second richest person whose firms have also benefited from EU development funds - has praised the EU’s role as guarantor of a peaceful Europe and calls himself a pro-European politician.\nANO won 78 of 200 seats in the house in the last election, more than three times as many as its nearest challenger, with the rest of the seats divided among eight other groups.\nMainstream parties reject a government led by Babis while he faces police allegations. His party has held talks about getting support for a single-party government from the SPD and Communists. Some ANO members are against relying on the SPD for government support.\nANO also wants talks with its former ruling partners the Social Democrats but is waiting until new leadership of the party is elected at a convention later this month.\nReporting by Jason Hovet and Jan Lopatka; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:26:35.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
