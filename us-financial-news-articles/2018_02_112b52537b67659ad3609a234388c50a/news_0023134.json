(“BNL”), a privately offered real estate investment trust (“REIT”) managed by Broadstone Real Estate, LLC, announced that on February 9, 2018, its Board of Directors and Independent Directors Committee (the “IDC”) approved several items with regard to investments in BNL’s common shares and membership units in Broadstone Net Lease, LLC (the “Operating Company”).\nThe Board increased the REIT’s monthly distribution rate by 3.6%, from $0.415 per share and unit of membership interest in the Operating Company (other than BNL) to $0.43 per share. Distributions for the next three months will be paid on or before March 15, 2018, April 13, 2018, and May 15, 2018, to holders of record as of February 27, 2018, March 29, 2018, and April 27, 2018, respectively. Based on the REIT’s current Determined Share Value of $81.00, the distribution represents an annualized cash yield of 6.4%, or 6.7%, assuming reinvestment of monthly distributions in BNL’s Distribution Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”). BNL has been paying distributions on at least a quarterly basis since May 2008, and on a monthly basis since June 2014. The IDC voted to maintain BNL’s Determined Share Value at $81.00 per share, for investments to be made between February 1, 2018 and April 30, 2018. Shares of BNL’s common stock are sold in BNL’s ongoing private offering at a price equal to the Determined Share Value, which is established quarterly based on the net asset value of the REIT’s portfolio, input from management, and such other factors as the IDC may determine. The Determined Share Value was last increased in November 2017. The Company maintained the previously announced $15 million cap on new and additional investments at BNL’s monthly equity closings. The cap applies to new or additional investments and does not apply to DRIP investments or equity capital received in connection with UPREIT transactions. The cap will apply to new and additional investments to be made for the months of February 2018, March 2018, and April 2018, and will next be reviewed in May 2018.\n“We are pleased to continue our practice of paying and increasing distributions to our investors,” said Chris Czarnecki, BNL’s Chief Executive Officer. “The increased distribution rate announced today reflects the continued success of our strategy of making accretive investments in rental properties, and the inherent rent growth embedded in our portfolio. 2017 was a record year for new acquisitions, and this distribution increase is in part a result of those acquisition activities. Our continued efforts in growing our portfolio while strengthening and diligently managing our balance sheet and capitalization structure has allowed us to offer this increased distribution to investors.”\nAbout Broadstone Net Lease, Inc.\nBNL invests in freestanding, single-tenant, net leased commercial properties located throughout the United States, primarily via sale and leaseback, lease assumption, and UPREIT transactions.
