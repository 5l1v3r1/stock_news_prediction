SFO CONSIDERS OPTIONS Slideshow (2 Images) \nThe SFO, which does have recent history of pursuing retrials in some cases, said it was considering it options. \n“It is not simply a question of wasted costs on all sides, but the devastating effect on the lives of the defendants,” Alison Geary, counsel in WilmerHale’s UK investigations & criminal litigation practice, said. \n“The SFO will now need to decide whether a retrial is appropriate,” she added \nThe Tesco case centred on its September 2014 announcement to the stock exchange that its profit forecast had been overstated by 250 million pounds, mainly due to booking commercial deals with suppliers too early. \nTesco’s disclosure, made three weeks after current CEO Dave Lewis replaced Philip Clarke, wiped 2 billion pounds off its market value and plunged the company into the worst crisis in its near 100-year history. \nThe trial, which began on Sept. 29, had been nearing a conclusion with the judge due to deliver her summing up, but the jury of seven men and four women were told on Monday it had been halted due to Rogberg’s illness. \n“It would not be right and proper in the circumstances to continue with this trial,” the judge told the jury, thanking them for their “diligence and good humour”. \nThe trial had originally been expected to finish by Christmas but was delayed due to legal argument, the judge falling ill and a juror taking a pre-planned holiday. \nBush did not comment beyond saying in a statement: “All my thoughts are with Carl and his family and I wish him a speedy recovery.” \nScouler’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
