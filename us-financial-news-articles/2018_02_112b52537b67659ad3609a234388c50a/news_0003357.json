There were no injuries or evacuations. \nThe damaged Seneca Lateral, part of Tallgrass’ Rockies Express (REX) pipeline, feeds gas from Utica shale producers onto the REX pipe after processing at the MarkWest Seneca facility. \nIn addition to Tallgrass’ Seneca Lateral, the incident also affected the flow of gas to the Rover pipeline, which has its own, separate Seneca Lateral. The REX Seneca Lateral and the Rover Seneca Lateral are different pipes. \nIn a notice to customers on Wednesday, REX did not say when it would complete repairs on its Seneca Lateral but noted it was mobilizing crews. \nOfficials at Energy Transfer Partners LP, which owns Rover, said the pipe was operating safely. \nThomson Reuters projected output in the lower 48 U.S. states would fall to 75.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Thursday from a recent high of 77.3 bcfd on Tuesday. \nOne bcfd is enough gas to fuel about 5 million homes. \nFlows of gas from Seneca to Rover fell to zero on Thursday from an average of about 0.3 bcfd over the past couple of weeks. That cut the amount of fuel moving on the Rover pipe to about 0.8 bcfd, down from an average of about 1.1 bcfd over the past couple of weeks, the Reuters data showed. \nFlows on the REX pipeline were not hindered much by the incident because there had not been any gas flows at the MarkWest Seneca-Noble point over the past couple of weeks, according to Reuters data. \nPrior to this incident, U.S. gas production had mostly been rising as the weather warmed following the brutally cold start of the year when some production wells froze in several states. \nOutput fell to as low as 71.1 bcfd on Jan. 1 as frozen wells cut the amount of gas that drillers could pull out of the ground by as much as 8 percent from a record of 77.6 bcfd on Dec. 18. \nMPLX LP’s MarkWest Energy unit owns the MarkWest Seneca processing plant in Ohio.
