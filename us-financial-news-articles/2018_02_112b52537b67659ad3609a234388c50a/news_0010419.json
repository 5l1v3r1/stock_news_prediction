Its closely-‎watched gross merchandise volume (GMV), the value of transactions carried out by third-‎party sellers on the company's platforms, rose 35 percent to 27 billion yuan.‎\nNew York-listed shares of Alibaba nearly doubled in 2017 as ‎investors have bet on the company's recovery, which is currently ‎valued at $523 billion reported Shinhan Dachi Daiwa .\nAlthough it seeks to grow overseas business ‎and diversify outside e-commerce, but growing competition from ‎rivals in key retail business, such as Amazon, are anticipated to drag on ‎expansion's plans.‎\nShinhan Dachi Daiwa International strategists wrote in a note this week: ‎\"Overall, Alibaba will probably not be able to enjoy the same ‎high growth rate after the November 11 shopping festival as it ‎did in the past one or two years.\"\nAlibaba also continues to make a string of investments, recently ‎announcing it would acquire a 33 percent stake in its payment affiliate Ant ‎Financial. as it tries to develop beyond its traditional e-commerce ‎business into a broader Internet company. Last year, it closed a ‎multi-billion-dollar deal to buy the shares of China's equivalent ‎of YouTube.\nCommenting on the results, Shinhan Dachi Daiwa trader said: \"Alibaba had ‎another great quarter driven by the continued strength of the Chinese ‎consumer and the wide and innovative range of services we provide for ‎merchants and consumers.\"\nAbout Shinhan Dachi Daiwa International: Since 2007 Shinhan Dachi Daiwa have been putting clients' success above all else, we have managed to grow the amount of capital that we have under management substantially, and are now proud to manage 7.8 billion dollars of assets under management which is a responsibility we do not take lightly.\nSOURCE Shinhan Dachi Daiwa", "external_links": ["https://sddinternational.com/"], "published": "2018-02-06T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:56:30.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
