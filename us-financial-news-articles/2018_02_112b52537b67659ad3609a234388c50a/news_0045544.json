(NASDAQ: LOPE), a comprehensive regionally accredited university that offers over 225 graduate and undergraduate degree programs and certificates across nine colleges both online and on ground at its over 275 acre campus in Phoenix, Arizona, today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nGrand Canyon Education, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017:\nNet revenue increased 10.9% to $271.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $244.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. End-of-period enrollment increased 10.2% to 90,297 at December 31, 2017, from 81,908 at December 31, 2016, as ground enrollment increased 9.2% to 18,842 at December 31, 2017, from 17,262 at December 31, 2016 and online enrollment increased 10.5% to 71,455 at December 31, 2017, from 64,646 at December 31, 2016. Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $91.3 million, an increase of 19.1% as compared to $76.7 million for the same period in 2016. The operating margin for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 33.7%, compared to 31.3% for the same period in 2016. The tax rate in the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 25.5% compared to 37.2% in the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate effective January 1, 2018. Therefore, the University's net deferred tax liability was required to be revalued as of December 22, 2017, resulting in the University recording a $10.7 million income tax benefit. Excluding the revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in 2017, our effective income tax rate would have been 37.2% for the quarter. Additionally, the University continues to benefit from the adoption of the share-based compensation standard, which resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards that vested or settled in 2017 in the consolidated income statement. The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax expense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation awards are dependent on our stock price at the date the restricted awards vest, our stock price on the date an option is exercised, and the quantity of options exercised. Net income increased 42.3% to $68.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $48.0 million for the same period in 2016. Diluted net income per share was $1.41 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.01 for the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.5% to $108.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $93.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017:\nNet revenue increased 11.5% to $974.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $873.3 million for the same period in 2016. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $282.8 million, an increase of 19.2% as compared to $237.2 million for the same period in 2016. The operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.0%, compared to 27.2% for the same period in 2016. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding contributions in lieu of state income taxes of $2.0 million, was $284.8 million and 29.2%, respectively. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2016, excluding contributions in lieu of state income taxes of $4.0 million and lease termination costs of $3.5 million, was $244.7 million and 28.0%, respectively. The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 28.3% compared to 37.1% in the same period in 2016. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the new tax law and our adoption of the share-based compensation standard in the first quarter of 2017. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, the corporate federal tax rate was reduced from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate effective January 1, 2018. The University's net deferred tax liability was revalued as of December 22, 2017, and the University recorded a $10.7 million income tax benefit related to the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. Excluding the revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in 2017, our effective income tax rate would have been 32.1% for the year. Additionally, the University benefited in 2017 from the adoption of the share-based compensation standard, which resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits of $16.5 million from share-based compensation awards that vested or settled in 2017 in the consolidated income statement. The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax expense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation awards are dependent on our stock price at the date the restricted awards vest, our stock price on the date an option is exercised, and the quantity of options exercised. These decreases were slightly offset by a decrease in the contributions made in lieu of state income taxes to school sponsoring organizations. Our contributions decreased from $4.0 million in 2016 to $2.0 million in 2017. Net income increased 36.9% to $203.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $148.5 million for the same period in 2016. Diluted net income per share was $4.22 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.15 for the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.6% to $354.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $304.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nThe University financed its operating activities and capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 primarily through cash provided by operating activities. Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and investments were $242.7 million and $108.6 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our restricted cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $94.5 million and $84.9 million, respectively. In December 2012, we entered into a new credit agreement, which increased our term loan to $100 million with a maturity date of December 2019. Additionally, this facility, as amended in January 2016, provided a revolving line of credit in the amount of $150 million through December 2017 to be utilized for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by our assets and is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. We did not renew our revolving line of credit at December 31, 2017 as we do not believe we need this additional liquidity at this time.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $304.9 million and $237.8 million, respectively. Cash provided by operations in 2017 and 2016 resulted from our increased net income plus non-cash charges for provision for bad debts, depreciation and amortization, timing of income tax and employee related payments and student deposits and changes in other working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $152.1 million and $216.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our cash used in investing activities is primarily related to the purchase of short-term investments and capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the sale or maturity of short-term investments. Purchases of short-term investments, net of proceeds of these investments, was $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Proceeds from investment, net of purchases of short-term investments, was $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures were $113.6 million and $178.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017, capital expenditures primarily consisted of the construction of an additional dormitory, other ground campus building projects and land acquisitions adjacent to our campus to support our growing traditional student enrollment, as well as purchases of computer equipment, other internal use software projects and furniture and equipment to support our increasing employee headcount. Included in off-site development for 2017 is $10.4 million we spent to finish the off-site student services center and parking garage that is in close proximity to our ground traditional campus. Employees that worked in two leased office buildings in the Phoenix area were relocated to this new building by the end of 2016. In 2016, capital expenditures primarily consisted of ground campus building projects that started in late 2015 such as three more apartment style residence halls, a 170,000 square foot classroom building for our College of Science, Engineering and Technology, a student service center, and a fourth parking structure, as well as land purchases adjacent to or near our Phoenix campus, and purchases of computer equipment, other internal use software projects and furniture and equipment to support our increasing employee headcount. Included in off-site development during 2016 is $60.7 million primarily related to the off-site student services center and parking garage.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities was $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

During 2016, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of net proceeds received from the revolving line of credit of $25.0 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $13.2 million, partially offset by $15.4 million used to purchase treasury stock in accordance with the University's share repurchase program and $4.7 million used to purchase common shares withheld in lieu of income taxes resulting from restricted share awards and principal payments on notes payable, repayments on our notes payable and capital lease payments totaled $7.2 million.\n2018 Outlook\nQ1 2018:\nNet revenue of $274.0 million; Target Operating Margin 31.5%; Diluted EPS of $1.39 using 48.6 million diluted shares; student counts of 91,500\nQ2 2018:\nNet revenue of $235.0 million; Target Operating Margin 23.2%; Diluted EPS of $0.85 using 48.6 million diluted shares; student counts of 80,900\nQ3 2018:\nNet revenue of $254.0 million; Target Operating Margin 24.9%; Diluted EPS of $0.98 using 48.7 million diluted shares; student counts of 98,400\nQ4 2018:\nNet revenue of $291.0 million; Target Operating Margin 33.0%; Diluted EPS of $1.47 using 48.9 million diluted shares; student counts of 97,100\nFull Year 2018:\nNet revenue of $1,054.0 million; Target Operating Margin 28.5%; Diluted EPS of $4.69 using 48.7 million diluted shares\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" which include information relating to future events, future financial performance, strategies expectations, competitive environment, regulation, and availability of resources.
