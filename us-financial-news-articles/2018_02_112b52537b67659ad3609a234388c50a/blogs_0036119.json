That more than doubled to $60.9 billion in 2011, and then hit a whopping $115 billion in 2017.\n\"The growth rate between 2011 and 2016 was double the rate observed between the previous five years,\" the report said.\nPresident Donald Trump , in a budget proposal released Monday, called for $17 billion in opioid-related spending. Of that, $13 billion is proposed for the Health and Human Services Department to use \"to combat the opioid epidemic by expanding access to prevention, treatment and recovery support services, as well as support for mental health.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T13:26:35.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
