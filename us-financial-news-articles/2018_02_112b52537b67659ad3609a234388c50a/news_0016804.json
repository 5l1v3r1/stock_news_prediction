That would replace a measure to keep the government funded through March 23, which lawmakers hoped to adopt on Thursday. \n“We haven’t gotten consensus within the stakeholder community on the language, but we have I think probably as good as we’re going to get at a solution,” the South Dakota Republican said. \nHe declined to disclose details of the prospective solution. \nThune and other Republican lawmakers from grain states have been working to find a solution with interested parties for about six weeks. \n“What we found was trying to satisfy co-ops and private grain operators was a challenge, and trying to get both of them to agree on final language has been a real challenge,” Thune said. \nLobbyists initially expected an agreement to be attached to one of the short-term funding bills that Congress has considered this year. \nBut Thune said it could find a home in a longer term spending measure, if Congress can agree on a proposed two-year spending plan now before lawmakers. \n”It’ll give us a little more time to perfect it. But I think ... we’ve got it about as good as we can,” he added.
