He is fast. Every time Patchell looks up he is going to see JJ in his vision, It’s not a great sight. We will use Ben Te’o as a finisher this week,” Jones said. \nPatchell makes his second Six Nations start for the Welsh and Jones highlighted the inexperience of the 24-year-old, who is playing because of injuries to Dan Biggar and Rhys Priestland and will be earning a seventh cap. \n“He is a young guy, inexperienced, he is their third-choice 10. It is going to be different to playing against Scotland. Scotland couldn’t cope with the expectation. He’s got to cope with the expectation of playing well,” the Australian said. \n“He has got to find guys willing to help him, because he is going to be under some heat.” \nThere was also a warning about Welsh expectations, which have increased considerably on the back of a 34-7 thrashing of Scotland in their Six Nations opener in Cardiff. \n“They played really well in that game,” Jones said. “But it’s going to be different on Saturday. They had no expectation on them last weekend. This week they come full of expectation. Everyone has been telling them how well they played. \n“They are playing in front of 82,000 people at Twickenham, they are playing against a side that loves to play at Twickenham. The 82,000 is like our 24th man. They are going to be full of energy, full of passion,” Jones said. \nEngland won the last game between the teams at Twickenham two years ago and have won five of their last eight home matches against Wales who beat England at Twickenham in the 2015 World Cup.
