The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes stood at 2.811 percent in Asian trade, compared with its U.S. close of 2.843 percent on Wednesday.\nThe benchmark yield rose as high as 2.885 percent on Monday, its highest since January 2014, after stronger inflation data led investors to fear that the Federal Reserve may raise rates more often than previously expected.\nSan Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams sought to assuage some of those fears on Wednesday.\nHe said at an event in Honolulu that the U.S. central bank will stick to its plan for “steady, gradual” interest rate increases even though recent U.S. economic data has been stronger than some have expected and the labour market has tightened.\nAlso weighing on U.S. debt, U.S. congressional leaders on Wednesday reached a two-year budget deal to raise government spending by almost $300 billion.\nThe New Zealand dollar, meanwhile, skidded to four-week lows after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept interest rates steady at a record low on Thursday.\nIt said volatility in equity markets this week was a warning that global markets were nervous about the risk of higher inflation and rising interest rates.\nThe kiwi currency was down 0.4 percent at $0.7216 after falling as low as $0.7201 earlier, its lowest since Jan. 11.\nReporting by Lisa Twaronite; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T06:09:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
