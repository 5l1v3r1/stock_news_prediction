Marciano also separately denied the claims. \nThe fashion retailer had then said it would investigate Upton’s claims “once they are known to determine if they have any merit.” \nThe committee will be made up of two independent directors, the company said in a statement on Friday. \nReuters has not independently confirmed the claims.
