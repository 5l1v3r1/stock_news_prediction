Exxon reports earnings on Friday.\nThe rise was driven by a sharp recovery in oil prices in the second half of 2017, as the benchmark Brent price reached a three-year high of $70 a barrel.\nBut it was also due to a sector-wide drive to reduce costs to adapt to a world of “lower for longer” oil prices, as Shell and others cut thousands of jobs and lowered spending.\nAs a result Shell can now generate more cash than it did with oil prices above $100 a barrel and in November it raised its cash flow outlook from $25 billion to $30 billion by 2020, assuming an oil price of $60 a barrel.\nFree cash flow -- cash available to pay for dividends and share buybacks -- rose to $27.6 billion from a negative $10.3 billion in 2016.\nOn a quarterly basis, however, Shell’s cash flow was down 21 percent at $7.25 billion, lower than expected, Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets said in a note.\n“Shell has had a good year overall and we don’t want to read too much into one set of numbers,” he said.\nShell in the fourth quarter scrapped its scrip dividend, in a sign that it is confident of being able to maintain around $15 billion in annual dividend payments without resorting to scrip or borrowing after a three-year oil price downturn.\nASSET SALES Shell’s oil and gas production in the fourth quarter rose from the previous quarter to 3.756 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) from 3.657 million boed, but on a yearly basis, it fell 4 percent as a result of asset sales.\nProduction was expected to come down by 270,000 boed in 2018 as a result of divestments, including the sale of a North Sea portfolio to Chrysaor and its stake in Woodside Petroleum.\nShell announced the sale of its stake in the Bongkot gas field and adjoining acreage offshore Thailand to PTT Exploration & Production PCL for $750 million on Wednesday and is on track to hit a $30 billion asset sale target.\nCapital expenditure in 2017 was $24 billion, slightly lower than the $25-$30 billion range Shell set until 2020.\nOn a quarterly basis, Shell’s profit, based on a current cost of supplies (CCS) and excluding identified items, rose by 140 percent to $4.3 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts.\nShell said its gearing dropped to 24.8 percent from a peak of 29.2 percent in the third quarter of 2016 as it cut its debt to $74.65 billion.\nAnd while it took a $2 billion charge due to new U.S. tax rules, Shell expects a longer-term boost.\nReporting by Ron Bousso; editing by Jason Neely and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T11:31:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
