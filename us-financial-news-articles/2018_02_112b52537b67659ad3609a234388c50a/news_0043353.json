In fact, I want America first for the American people, I want Britain first for the British people and I want France first for the French people,” she said.\n“I came here today to tell you there is a youth ready for this fight in Europe today,” she told thousands of activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland.\nMarechal-Le Pen, who is more socially conservative and economically liberal than her aunt, did not say if or when she was planning to return to an active role in French politics, instead mentioning her plans to open a management and political science school, which she said should train tomorrow’s leaders.\nMarion Marechal-Le Pen, niece of right-wing populist French politician Marine Le Pen, speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., February 22, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque But the reception for Marechal-Le Pen, who has been praised by right-wing U.S. media such as Breitbart, was in contrast to her aunt’s visit to Trump Tower in New York in January last year, during the French presidential campaign.\nMarine Le Pen, who has long aimed to burnish her credentials with foreign appearances, did not meet either Trump or anyone from his team during that visit and was photographed having coffee in a public area of the building.\nSlideshow (4 Images) While Le Pen has over the past months softened her anti-EU, anti-euro comments, Marechal-Le Pen lambasted the bloc, which she said was “slowly killing” ancient nations.\nBlaming immigration and political correctness, she said in a speech delivered in English: “France is in the process of passing the eldest daughter of the Catholic church to the little niece of Islam.”\nMarine Le Pen is hoping that a National Front congress mid-March will help her reassert her authority.\nBut in the complicated Le Pen family, whose rows have made French headlines for years, another possible problem for her is her father, who she expelled from the party but who said he would gate-crash the congress.\nMeanwhile her niece told the activists: “Let us build on what you have achieved here so that on both sides of the Atlantic, conservatism may prevail.”\nWriting by Ingrid Melander in Paris; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T22:57:42.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
