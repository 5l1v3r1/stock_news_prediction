Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Thursday he hoped the U.N. Security Council would agree a resolution to end fighting in the besieged Syrian enclave of eastern Ghouta, but said it would not be easy. “I hope it will. But it’s uphill. But I hope it will. It is very urgent,” he told Reuters as he arrived at the United Nations in Geneva. Asked what would happen if there were no deal, he said: “Then we will have to push for it to take place as soon as possible because there is no alternative but a ceasefire and humanitarian access.” Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Gareth Jones", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T10:42:12.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
