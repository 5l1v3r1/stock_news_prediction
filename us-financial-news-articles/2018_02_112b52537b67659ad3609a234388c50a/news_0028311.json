Despite uncertainties around Brexit, the pound has been propped up by rising expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates to curb inflation.\nThe revival of risk appetite dented the yen, with the dollar changing hands at 108.70 yen, recovering from Friday’s five-month low of 108.05 yen.\nGlobal stock markets staged a strong rebound since a brutal sell-off that began late January on worries about rising inflationary pressure.\nHigher inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten its policy faster than expected. Alternatively, if the Fed doesn’t act fast enough and falls behind the curve on policy, it could end up pushing up long-term bond yields. In either scenario, traders worry that U.S. growth could be hampered.\nThere were some indications such fears are beginning to subside, with Wall Street shares rebounding strongly on Monday and MSCI’s all-country world index of stock performance rising 1.2 percent.\nStill, market players are not convinced the worst is over.\nThe 10-year U.S. bond yield hit a four-year high of 2.902 percent while the 30-year yield rose to 11-month high of 3.199 percent.\n“Rise in long-term bond yields lifts mortgage lending costs and is likely to cool the economy,” said Minori Uchida, chief FX analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\nUchida said the dollar is likely to remain under pressure against the yen.
