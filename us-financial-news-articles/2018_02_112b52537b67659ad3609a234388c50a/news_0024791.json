Who will be up on the podium - that will be decided by a hundredth of a second,” Mayer predicted. “The fastest guys are all here and the best will win tomorrow.” \nChristof Innerhofer of Italy and Kjetil Jansrud of Norway, the silver and bronze medallists in Sochi four years ago, are very much in the hunt this time. \nInnerhofer was fastest in the second day of training, while Jansrud was the most consistent over all three practice runs, placing second each time as he looked to find the right line to become Norway’s first Olympic downhill champion. \nCanada’s Manuel Osborne-Paradis was quickest on day one, while Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria set the pace on day three. \nJansrud’s team mate Aksel Lund Svindal, aged 35, stands second in the World Cup downhill rankings this season and is looking to go one better than the silver medal he won in the downhill at Vancouver eight years ago. \nOthers to watch include Beat Feuz of Switzerland and Italy’s Dominik Paris, respectively first and third in the World Cup, and young German Thomas Dressen, who scored a surprise win on the spectacular Kitzbuehel run in Austria last month. \n“It will ski quick, racers can adapt to these conditions and for me the best guy for this is Kjetil Jansrud,” Innherhofer told reporters. \n“I saw Mayer in really good shape and Osborne-Paradis can ski really smooth, for sure these will be the guys to beat.” \nThe Jeongseon course, designed by former Olympic champion Bernhard Russi, is 2,852 metres long, with a vertical drop of 825 metres, and is relatively easy compared with some others on the circuit. \nThat could mean that victory is decided by the fewest mistakes, the sleekest aerodynamics and the most precise line down the mountain, rather than out-and-out risk-taking. \n“I think the mistakes will come from pushing too hard, because when it becomes difficult to win, guys try to take too much risk to try to gain that little bit extra,” said Bode Miller, the most-decorated American Olympic skier, who is working as a broadcaster during the Games.
