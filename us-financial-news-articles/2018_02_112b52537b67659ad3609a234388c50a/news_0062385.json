A winner was declared in each of five categories, ranging from everyday and grubby, to red-haired, women’s and juniors. The highly coveted award for the ‘best mullet of all’ went to Shane ‘Shag’ Hanrahan, who began growing his mane in 1986. “I don’t know what to say, I’ve got stage fright,” said Hanrahan, whose hairstyle seemed to be his preferred mode of self-expression. The festival is expected to return next year, as the Hunter Valley town of 4,000 people is dependent on the tourist dollar after losing its largest employer, an aluminium smelter, in 2012.
