Wealthy teams get cities to build them new stadiums on the cheap, then pick up and move elsewhere for more subsidies, he said.\nGeneration Opportunity's main goal is to rally citizens around the problem and demand that politicians curb special handouts and bonuses to otherwise rich corporations, Barnes said.\nThe leader of the group, which consists mainly of 18- to 34-year-olds, even said that he would not shy away from working with Democrats to prevent Amazon from receiving subsidies.\nEchoing Democratic sentiments of merit-based, un-incentivized business competition, Barnes said his group would \"absolutely\" join hands with Democrats to push its policy goals forward.\n\"Whether it's Amazon or Foxconn or Carrier , any of these different examples where you have governments picking one industry that they want to get in and giving them special deals ... just doesn't make sense. It's not fair,\" Barnes said.\n\"As a millennial organization, our generation really opposes these kinds of handouts and special deals,\" he said.\nWATCH: Koch-backed group leader bashes Amazon tax breaks show chapters States should be more competitive for all businesses not just Amazon: Generation Opportunity 4 Hours Ago | 05:12 Sign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
