Soybean futures dipped into negative territory.\nUSDA’s monthly supply and demand report pegged U.S. corn ending stocks for the 2017/18 marketing year at 2.352 billion bushels, down from its January estimate of 2.477 billion bushels.\nThat fell below the low end of analysts’ forecasts that ranged from 2.425 billion bushels to 2.550 billion bushels, according to a Reuters survey.\nUSDA boosted its U.S. corn export forecast for the year by 125 million bushels to 2.050 billion bushels.\nSoybean ending stocks were seen at 530 million bushels, USDA said, up from the government’s January outlook for 470 million bushels. The government lowered its U.S. soy export forecast to 2.100 billion bushels from 2.160 billion bushels.\nEstimates given in a Reuters poll for soybean ending stocks ranged from 460 million bushels to 535 million bushels.\nUSDA also raised its U.S. wheat ending stocks view to 1.009 billion bushels from 989 million bushels due to lower exports.
