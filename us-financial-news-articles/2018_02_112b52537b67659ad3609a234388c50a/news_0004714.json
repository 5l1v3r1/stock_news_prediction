They can either switch into a cheaper loan which would lower their monthly payment, or borrow against the value of their homes through “cash-out” refinancing.\nAs mortgage rates rise, refinancing activity slows as this funding option becomes less viable for homeowners.\nAverage interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages, or loans whose balances are $453,100 or less, rose to 4.41 percent, up 5 basis points from the previous week. This was highest since 4.46 percent in week of March 17.\nOther 30-year mortgage rates on average were up 3 basis points on the week, while average 15-year mortgage rates climbed to 3.85 percent, the highest since April 2011.\nHome loan rates have risen in step with U.S. bond yields.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR touched a near four-year peak of 2.746 percent on Wednesday, underpinned by bets on faster global economic growth and reduced stimulus from central banks.\nThe latest increase in mortgage rates also crimped application volume to buy homes.\nMBA’s mortgage purchase index, seen a proxy on future home sales, was down 3.4 percent to 255.5 in the Jan. 26 week. It was up about 11 percent from its year-ago levels.\nIt was unclear whether the decline in purchase applications is an omen for home sales in the spring, which is the annual boom season for the real estate market.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors said its index on pending home sales, another future sales gauge, rose for a third straight month in December.\nThe drop in both refinancing and purchase requests knocked overall mortgage activity from a four-month peak set the week before.\nMBA’s total mortgage application index fell 2.6 percent to 413.4.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:56:37.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
