New Zealand songstress Lorde was honored as the best international solo artist, while Haim, a trio of sisters from California, were named best international band. British rapper Stefflon Don was named best new artist at the event. “We feel really good being here because it does feel like a lot of women are nominated but I definitely feel like the majority of awards shows are not representing females,” Danielle Haim told Reuters. Shirley Manson, lead singer of British band Garbage, who was also honored at the event, welcomed the recent focus on the treatment of women in the entertainment industry, spearheaded by the #MeToo campaign on social media.

It worries me a little that it’s a lot talk and little action,” she said. U.S. pop star Ariana Grande, was also honored for her “One Love Manchester” concert, held weeks after a suicide bombing killed 22 people shortly after one of her concerts in the city in May 2017.
