In his new role, Aho is responsible for ensuring the healthcare organization’s mission is integrated throughout its culture and within the communities it serves.\nADVENTIST HEALTH PROMOTES DUSTIN AHO TO VP OF MISSION INTEGRATION\n“We are proud to promote Dustin Aho to a position he greatly deserves,” said Adventist Health chief executive officer, Scott Reiner. “Dustin’s dedicated service will undoubtedly advance our goal of providing comprehensive whole-person care, expanded healthcare access and a human touch that is rarely felt in this industry—all while ensuring we remain fully committed to our mission, vision and values.”\nWith a mission of “living God’s love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope,” Adventist Health is focused on whole-person health, wellness and a get-well process that continues beyond the hospital walls. As vice president of mission integration, Aho plans on improving the way Adventist functions by deepening its ties to the community and ensuring that everything it does is fully aligned with its core values.\n“The future of healthcare is much more than the physical treatment of the ill inside the four walls of a hospital,” said Aho. “It will be an intentional partnership with the community to create a better place for everyone to live—including the homeless and those in low-income households. Adventist Health is at the forefront of this incredible change, building tools, resources, programs and methodologies that engage people from all walks of life and offer them increased opportunities to live productive, happy and healthy lives.”\nPrior to his promotion, Aho served as associate vice president of community mission at Adventist Health. Previously, he was an executive administrator at Loma Linda University Church. He holds a bachelor’s degree in business management with an emphasis on entrepreneurship from Southern Adventist University, along with an MBA in non-profit studies from La Sierra University. Born in Kenya, Aho was raised in an international mission setting which became a building block for his others-oriented work at Adventist Health. “This position combines my core belief system with a community-service style of outreach that complements my life-long aspiration to create meaningful change in the healthcare industry,” he adds. “I could not be more proud to take on this role.”\nAbout ADVENTIST HEALTH: Adventist Health is a faith-based, non-profit integrated health system serving more than 75 communities on the West Coast and Hawaii.
