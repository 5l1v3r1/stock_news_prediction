Its coverage of the government’s war on drugs, which has resulted in thousands of deaths, has brought the newspaper repeated complaints from Duterte over perceived bias.\nThe newspaper has rejected accusations of bias.\nReporting by Karen LemaEditing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:45:59.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
