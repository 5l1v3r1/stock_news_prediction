Activists have been campaigning for a ban on iron ore mining in the state on environmental grounds. \nCourt action against illegal mining shut the industry in Goa for more than two years from 2012. Goa had exported about 50 million tonnes of iron ore a year before the ban was imposed. \nThe latest ban is a blow for companies such as Vedanta Resources that have mines in the state. \nMost of Goa’s iron ore is exported to China as Indian steel companies do not have the technology to use them.
