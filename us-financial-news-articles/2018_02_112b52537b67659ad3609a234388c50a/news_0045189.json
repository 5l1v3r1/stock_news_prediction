The century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium.\nThe project was initiated by Danny Hillis in 1989. Bezos said he's been \"helping Danny with the project for the last half dozen years.\"\n\"Building a Clock inside a remote mountain is a big task. Construction is under way, and we're making progress every day,\" the post reads.\nSource: Long Now Foundation. Prototype of the Long Now Foundation 10,000 year clock.
