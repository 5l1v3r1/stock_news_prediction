Net trade dragged on growth in most quarters of 2017, though it was positive on the year.\nThe BoE said earlier this month that it expected the economy would grow by 1.8 percent this year, faster than its previous forecast of 1.6 percent, mostly because of the strength of the global economy.\nReporting by David Milliken; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:10:07.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
