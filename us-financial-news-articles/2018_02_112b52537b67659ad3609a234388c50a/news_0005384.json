In diagnostics (China) is already the second most important market for us, it's still a bit smaller on the pharmaceutical side, but there is no doubt the market is strongly growing,\" Schwan said.\n\"We are investing in China and we want to make sure that we bring our solutions, diagnostic tests and medicines increasingly to patients in China,\" he added.\nRoche announced Thursday a net income drop of 9 percent in 2017 as the Swiss drugmaker took charges for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as well as amortization of intangible assets.\nIFRS net income dropped to 8.8 billion Swiss francs ($9.45 billion) from 9.7 billion francs a year earlier.
