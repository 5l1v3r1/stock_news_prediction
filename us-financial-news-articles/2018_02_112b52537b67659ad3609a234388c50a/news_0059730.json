They should carry their own reusable bags. If they do so, the ban will work,” Yasin said.\nMore importantly, the country needs to stop making polythene, he added.\nSeveral other shopkeepers the Thomson Reuters Foundation spoke to agreed.\n“If the government is serious about stopping the use of polythene, it should ban its manufacturing. That will force people to carry their own bags,” said Abdul Rashid, a shopkeeper in Srinagar’s commercial hub, Lal Chowk (Red Square).\nIndia’s plastics industry employs about 4 million people, and has more than 30,000 processing units, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation, set up by the government to promote “Made in India” products internationally.\nDomestic consumption of plastic is expected to reach 20 million metric tonnes per year by 2020, while exports of plastic products were worth $7.64 billion in 2015-16.\nWEAK ENFORCEMENT Srinagar Deputy Commissioner Syed Abid said the Jammu and Kashmir government was committed to stamping out plastic bags.\n“We have constituted special squads for enforcing the ban, and we are also seizing polythene wherever we find it in use,” he said in an interview.\nSome environmental experts say carrying plastic bags should be punishable by law.\n“As of now, only the traders or shopkeepers are penalized - which doesn’t affect people who compel the shopkeepers to provide them with plastic bags,” said Samiullah Bhat, assistant professor in the environmental science department at the University of Kashmir.\nRiyaz Ahmad Wani, the commissioner of Srinagar Municipal Corporation, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the authority may consider imposing fines on those who carry polythene bags under a new policy for solid waste management now being drafted.\nIn March 2016, the Karnataka state government issued a circular stipulating that no one should use plastic products, including bags, banners, bunting, flags, plates, cups, spoons, cling film and table cloths.\nIt also said those items should not be manufactured, supplied, stored, transported, sold or distributed.\nMegha Shenoy, a fellow at the Bangalore-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), said the ban has had “some impact” there but enforcement is patchy.\nCivil servants in several departments are tasked with putting it into practice, but proof of their work needs to be collected and verified independently, said Shenoy.\nWithout such a system, responsibility gets shunted between departments, “leading to dilution of enforcement”, she said.\nMoreover, several political parties – including the ruling party – often use banners, bunting and other plastic products, as bureaucrats struggle to implement the rules, she added.\nHUMANS, COWS AT RISK As far back as 2012, two Indian Supreme Court judges warned “the next generation will be threatened with something more serious than the atom bomb” in the absence of “a total ban on plastic”. But progress towards that aspiration is slow.\nA 2015 report by the Central Pollution Control Board said Indian cities produced more than 15,000 tonnes of plastic waste every day. Of this, 9,000 tonnes were collected and processed, while the rest littered the streets and drains, or was dumped in landfill.\nAbout two-thirds of the plastic waste was a mix of polythene bags and food packaging, mainly from residential areas, it said.\nIn 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted that cows – a sacred animal for many Indians - were dying after consuming plastic, and urged those concerned about their welfare to stop it happening.\nAccording to a June 2017 study published in the journal Nature Communications, 20 rivers - mostly in Asia - carry into the sea about two-thirds of the plastic in the world’s oceans, with the River Ganges crossing India and Bangladesh responsible for the second-highest amount among them.\nGREEN ALTERNATIVES Swati Singh Sambyal, program manager for environmental governance at the New Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment, said a ban on plastic bags would only work if their manufacture was stopped and cheaper alternatives made available.\n“A jute bag or a cloth bag is way beyond the reach of a vendor - only big malls or shops can use them,” she said.\nCharging for polythene bags is another way to incentivize shoppers to bring reusable bags, while shopkeepers who give out plastic bags should be fined, she added.\nMeanwhile, she urged cities to start information campaigns. “Behavior change through mass awareness is imperative,” she said, adding few efforts of this kind have been made so far.\nATREE’s Shenoy said citizens could help enforce the ban by using cameras on their smartphones and data collection apps, while the authorities should report publicly on progress.\nThe government could also support start-up businesses that offer sustainable alternatives to plastics, she added.\nSome companies, for example, are making bags, bin liners and packaging from natural starch, vegetable oil derivatives and vegetable waste, which they say are biodegradable and non-toxic to flora and fauna, although they are still more expensive than their plastic equivalents.\nReporting by Athar Parvaiz; editing by Megan Rowling.
