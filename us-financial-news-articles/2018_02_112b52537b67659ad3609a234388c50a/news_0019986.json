We’re definitely benefitting a bit from that,” Stephens told Reuters.\nNormalised or underlying profit for the six months-ended Dec. 31 was NZ$90.3 million ($65.2 million) compared to NZ$83.7 million a year ago. Revenue rose about 4 percent to NZ$545 million.\nTurnover from the company’s international business grew about 9 percent, with about half of that typically coming from Chinese customers.\nSkyCity said international turnover is expected to improve in the second half of fiscal 2018 and it continues to target NZ$10 billion in total turnover for 2018 due to positive bookings for the Chinese New Year period.\n“We’re reasonably confident we can still deliver on the guidance for the full year, which was modest growth,” Stephens said.\n“The swing factor in that will be the international business again, and that will come down to the next month or two with Chinese New Year.”\nStephens said he was comfortable with the international business accounting for around 10 percent of earnings, even up to 15 percent, but did not want to be overly reliant on it.\n“It’s very volatile ... so we wouldn’t want to be too exposed,” he said\nAt 1212 GMT, shares in SkyCity were down 0.25 percent to NZ$4.02, outperforming a main index loss of 1.4 percent after another day a large falls on Wall Street.\nAUCKLAND PROJECT SkyCity, which owns and operates casinos, restaurants, hotels and convention centres, said there had been improvements in the construction of the New Zealand International Convention Centre and Hobson Street hotel projects over the last six months.\nThe convention centre is one of two major Fletcher Building Ltd projects where delays and cost over-runs have hurt New Zealand’s biggest builder, and losses from the jobs prompted it to warn on Thursday it expects to breach some of its loan covenants.\nStephens said there were no indications that Fletcher’s troubles would affect the project’s completion date, which had previously been delayed by six months to the middle of 2019.\nSkyCity announced an interim dividend of 10 New Zealand cents per share, unchanged from a year earlier.\n$1 = 1.3841 New Zealand dollars Reporting by John Mair in Wellington and Chandini Monnappa in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:30:50.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
