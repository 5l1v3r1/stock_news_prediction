Other involved in the scheme had been arrested in Russia, while one of the leaders of the plot was still on the run, Bullrich said.\nReporting by Julian Castilla; writing by Hugh Bronstein; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T00:22:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
