Another 15 people were injured.\nLuis Cabrera, a civil protection official at the scene, said authorities were still investigating the cause of the crash.\nThe 7.2 magnitude quake knocked out electricity in Santiago Jamiltepec, about 28 miles (45 km) from the tremor’s epicenter, leaving the town in darkness Friday night.\nCoffins with bodies of the victims are pictured inside a home after a military helicopter, carrying Mexico's interior minister and the governor of the southern state of Oaxaca, crashed on top of two vans in an open field while trying to land in Santiago Jamiltepec, Mexico February 17, 2018. REUTERS/Jorge Luis Plata A journalist on board the flight told local TV that the helicopter had flown in over a clearing next to homes, raising a huge dust cloud before it crash landed.\nAt a home near the accident site, family members gathered to mourn their loved ones after officials returned their bodies. Many lashed out in anger at authorities.\nSlideshow (6 Images) “The governor was supposedly coming to help, but what was the help, the aid, we received? This was the aid,” said Eduardo Juarez, a relative of one victim.\nMexico’s defense minister, General Salvador Cienfuegos, arrived at the scene on Saturday and spoke with locals, offering apologies for the accident, local TV showed.\nThe earthquake left nearly a million homes and businesses without power in Mexico City and the south and damaged at least 50 homes in Oaxaca.\nThe state, along with Mexico City, is still reeling from earthquakes in September that killed at least 471 people and caused widespread damage.\nWriting by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T17:49:12.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
