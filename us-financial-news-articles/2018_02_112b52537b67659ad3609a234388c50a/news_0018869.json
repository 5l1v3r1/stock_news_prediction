It’s a great opportunity to get, I mean, a new set of eyes on what I’ve been doing with Kathy,” Williams told reporters after the draw ceremony where it was determined she would play with world number 62 Lauren Davis. \n“Also just hitting with different people, just seeing different balls, seeing lots of different things. I think it actually is a really perfect opportunity to try to come back.” \nWilliams owns a 13-0 singles record and 3-1 doubles record in Fed Cup competition. She and Davis will face world number 165 Lesley Kerkhove and Demi Schuurs, who is ranked 32nd in doubles. \nRinaldi did not rule out the chance of Williams playing singles on Sunday, saying only that adjustments to the current lineup, if any, would only be made after Saturday’s action. \nThe United States beat Belarus last year for a record-extending 18th Fed Cup title, their first in 17 years, and are heavy favourites to beat the Netherlands. \nPlay begins on Saturday with seven-times grand slam champion Venus Williams facing world number 124 Arantza Rus followed by a clash between American world number 17 Vandeweghe and world number 108 Richel Hogenkamp. \nReverse singles matches followed by the doubles match are scheduled for Sunday. \nThe winner advances to the April 21-22 semi-finals.
