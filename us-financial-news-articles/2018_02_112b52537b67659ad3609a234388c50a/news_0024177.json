( bit.ly/2ElcknF )\nA high court in the capital Juba handed Gatdet the death sentence on Monday, as well as a combined 21 years for incitement and conspiracy against President Salva Kiir’s government.\nMonyluak Alor Kuol, Gatdet’s former lawyer who resigned last month in protest against the case’s handling, said the sentencing violated a ceasefire signed in December, which called for the release of all prisoners and detainees.\n“I am disappointed. Such trials are not supposed to take place at this time,” Kuol told Reuters.\nGatdet was charged alongside William John Endley, a South African national who was one of Macher’s advisers.\nJames Gatdet Dak, a former spokesman of rebel leader Riek Machar, sits inside the dock in the High Court in Juba, South Sudan February 12, 2018.

An internationally backed ceasefire monitoring team said it was sending a team to investigate the violence in the next 24 hours.\nWriting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T16:52:45.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
