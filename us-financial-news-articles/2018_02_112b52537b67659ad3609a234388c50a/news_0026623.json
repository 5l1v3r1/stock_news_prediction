They insist on calling the stretch of water the “Arabian Gulf”. \nBahrain’s education ministry, the news report said, had commissioned an unnamed “overseas establishment” to print the books for third-grade schoolchildren and provided it with “correct material to include in the book, including the Arabian Gulf map”. \n“The discrepancy was spotted at the time of distributing the textbooks to students ... The establishment was obliged to re-print 17,000 copies of the textbook after correction of the error,” BNA quoted a ministry official saying. \nU.S. President Donald Trump infuriated Iran last October when he appeared to break from more traditional diplomatic parlance by using the term “Arabian Gulf” in a policy speech to describe the waterway.
