He has denied the allegations. \nDirector Christopher Wray told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that the FBI last year gave multiple updates to the White House on its findings about Porter. After sharing a partial report on Porter in March, the FBI provided its completed background check on Porter to the White House in July, Wray said. The White House asked follow-up questions, he said, and the FBI provided answers to those in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T19:53:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
