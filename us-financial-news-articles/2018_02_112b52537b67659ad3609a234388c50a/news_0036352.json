This compares with adjusted net income of $64 million, $0.16 per diluted share, in the prior quarter, excluding $1.48 billion of net unfavorable items primarily related to the retirement of six floaters; Cash flows from operating activities were $257 million, down from $384 million in the prior quarter; and Contract backlog was $12.8 billion as of the February 2018 Fleet Status Report.\nSTEINHAUSEN, Switzerland, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) today reported net loss attributable to controlling interest of $111 million, $0.28 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 results included net unfavorable items of $18 million, $0.04 per diluted share, as follows:\n$20 million, $0.04 per diluted share, in discrete tax expense; and $6 million, $0.01 per diluted share, loss on the early retirement of debt.\nThese net unfavorable items were partially offset by:\n$6 million, $0.01 per diluted share, gain on disposal of assets; and $2 million associated with other favorable items.\nAfter consideration of these net unfavorable items, fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net loss was $93 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.\nContract drilling revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017, decreased $110 million sequentially to $589 million. The decline was primarily due to fewer operating days and lower revenue efficiency. The lower revenue efficiency was primarily driven by the Petrobras 10000 , which is returning to work in the first quarter of 2018. The quarter results were also impacted by lower dayrates on the Deepwater Invictus . These decreases were partly offset by the commencement of operations of the ultra-deepwater newbuild drillship Deepwater Pontus .\nOther revenues were $40 million, which included $25 million of early termination fees associated with the Discoverer Clear Leader . This compares with $109 million in the prior quarter, which included $99 million of early termination fees.\nOperating and maintenance expense was $389 million, compared with $323 million in the prior quarter. The anticipated sequential increase was the result of the reactivation and contract preparation costs related to the Development Driller I and Deepwater Nautilus ; and the commencement of operations of the Deepwater Pontus . The quarter results were also impacted by timing from the prior quarter of scheduled maintenance costs and recycling costs associated with previously announced floater retirements.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $43 million compared with $39 million in the third quarter of 2017. The sequential increase was primarily due to anticipated IT system enhancements and other corporate costs.\nDepreciation expense was $184 million, down from $197 million in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the previously announced floater retirements.\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was $123 million, compared with $112 million in the prior quarter. The increase in interest expense was largely due to the senior unsecured notes issued during the fourth quarter of 2017, partly offset by the company’s early debt retirements. Capitalized interest decreased $6 million sequentially to $25 million primarily due to the commencement of operations of the Deepwater Pontus . Interest income was $9 million, compared with $21 million in the prior quarter, which included interest associated with an award on a customer-terminated drilling contract in 2015.\nThe Effective Tax Rate (2) was 8.3 percent, up from (14.7) percent in the prior quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2017, income tax expense included a $66 million charge associated with the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”). Offsetting this charge was a decrease in the U.S. valuation allowance totaling $31 million. The U.S. Tax Reform also includes a one-time tax on unrepatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Due to the complexities associated with the repatriation tax analysis, the company has elected to defer estimating this amount until 2018. The Effective Tax Rate excluding discrete items (3) was 25.4 percent, compared with 56.5 percent in the previous quarter.\nCash flows from operating activities decreased $127 million sequentially to $257 million primarily due to an award in the prior quarter that was not repeated in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 capital expenditures of $111 million were primarily related to the newbuilds, Deepwater Poseidon and Deepwater Pontus , including milestone shipyard payments. This compares with $128 million in the previous quarter.\n“Despite challenging market conditions, Transocean made great progress in 2017,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Thigpen. “Just recently, we upgraded our fleet with the newbuild additions of the Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon , both of which are backed by ten-year contracts. We announced the acquisition of Songa Offshore, adding seven semisubmersibles to our fleet, including four harsh environment high-specification floaters with $3.7 billion of backlog. We divested our jackup fleet; and, we retired another nine assets, including five older, less competitive ultra-deepwater rigs.”\nThigpen added: “In addition to enhancing our fleet, we continued to operate at a high level for our customers, delivering full year 2017 revenue efficiency of just over 96%. This consistently strong performance helped us to secure 25 new floater awards throughout the year, adding almost $900 million to our industry-leading backlog.”\n“As we enter 2018, our ongoing balance sheet management has provided us the means to continue carrying out our strategic objectives, while extending our liquidity runway,” said Thigpen. “We are encouraged by the upward momentum we continue to see in oil prices, and the resulting increase in demand for our assets and services. In the harsh environment market, we are experiencing strong demand for high-specification semisubmersibles, resulting in a meaningful year-over-year improvement in dayrates. While demand in ultra-deepwater is not as strong, we are encouraged to see customers seeking multi-year fixtures for assets in various basins around the world.”\nFull Year 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net loss attributable to controlling interest totaled $3.13 billion, or $8.00 per diluted share. Full year results included $3.10 billion, $7.94 per diluted share, of net unfavorable items as follows:\n$1.59 billion, $4.07 per diluted share, loss on divestiture of the jackup fleet and three midwater floaters; $1.50 billion, $3.84 per diluted share, loss on impairment associated with the retirement of six floaters and the midwater floater asset group; and $55 million, $0.14 per diluted share, loss related to the early retirement of debt.\nThese net unfavorable items were partially offset by:\n$37 million, $0.10 per diluted share, in discrete tax benefits; and $2 million, $0.01 per diluted share, in favorable litigation matters and other costs.\nAfter excluding these net unfavorable items, adjusted net loss for 2017 was $24 million, or $0.06 per diluted share.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present our operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). We believe certain financial measures, such as Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Normalized EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures, provide users of our financial statements with supplemental information that may be useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that such non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our operating results presented under U.S. GAAP, can be used to better assess our performance from period to period and relative to performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure. Such non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAll non-GAAP measure reconciliations to the most comparative U.S. GAAP measures are displayed in quantitative schedules on the company’s website at: www.deepwater.com .\nAbout Transocean\nTransocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells.
