Their current personal best score for that program is 119.90.\nThe pair, who won bronze at the Four Continents Cup in Taiwan last month, embraced each other and their coaches in the kiss and cry area, jumping up and down with joy.\n“There have been no inconveniences whatsoever when it comes to the life here in the South area,” Kim said in translated televised comments before the pair sped past the mixed zone where a horde of reporters were waiting for them.\n“You could really feel the power and the energy of the Korean people.”\nNorth Korea agreed to compete in Pyeongchang after the South and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) encouraged the heavily sanctioned state to participate as a peace gesture.\nThe skaters were the first North Koreans to qualify for the Games after they finished in the top six at a competition in Germany in September\nNorth Korea did not have any athletes at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games. They have sent 22 athletes to compete in Pyeongchang, including 12 ice hockey players in a combined North and South Korean women’s team.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Additional reporting by Soyoung Kim; Editing by John O'Brien and Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:46:24.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
