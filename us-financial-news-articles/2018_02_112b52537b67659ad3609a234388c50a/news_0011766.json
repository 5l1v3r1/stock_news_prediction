The figure stood at 8.8 percent in the first half of 2017. \nImproving the quality of drinking water is also one of the major priorities in coming years, and China would ensure that more than 80 percent of its water is grade III or better - and fit for human consumption - by the end of the decade. \nA groundbreaking five-year action plan against smog was completed at the end of last year and Chinese environmental officials confirmed last week they were now drawing up targets for 2018-2020. \nAs part of the new three-year plan, China would aim to raise the proportion of “good air days” to 80 percent in 338 major cities, minister Li said on Saturday. Other cities would also be under pressure to cut 2015 rates of PM2.5, a key smog indicator, by 18 percent by the end of the decade. \n($1 = 6.2984 yuan)", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T02:37:46.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
