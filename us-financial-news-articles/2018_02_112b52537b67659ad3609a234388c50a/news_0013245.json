A big knee injury is probably the worst injury you can have as a ski racer,” he told Reuters. \nSvindal certainly is back. \nHe sits second in the World Cup downhill standings -- behind Switzerland’s Beat Feuz -- and also faces a strong challenge from in-form 24-year-old German Thomas Dressen, who won the prestigious Kitzbuehel downhill last month. \nThe Norwegian, however, remains focused on getting the one prize that has so far eluded him. \n“If I could choose one race to win this year, it would be the Olympic downhill,” he said.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger BOUNCING BACK \nSvindal’s last two seasons have ended prematurely due to knee injuries. \nThose came on top of an absence of nearly a year following a massive crash in 2007 and another long layoff four years ago with an Achilles tendon injury he sustained kicking a ball around with his team mates. \nNothing epitomises the courage and durability that Svindal has shown throughout his career than the way he turned the Colorado venue of Beaver Creek from being the scene of a nightmare to one of his favourite courses. \nIn November 2007, Svindal was at his peak when he tumbled dramatically down the piste after misjudging a jump in training while racing along at 120 km per hour on the tricky Golden Eagle section. \nHe was left unconscious on the slope, with a deep gash in his left buttock caused by one of his skis. He also broke a bone in his back and had several fractures to his face. \nHe was rushed to hospital where he was to spend three weeks and it was a full 10 months before he returned to action. \nYet returning to Beaver Creek, a year after that bloody crash, Svindal put the bad memories aside and won both downhill and Super-G in spectacular style and set up a season where he regained his overall World Cup crown. \nAs if to emphasise his mental strength, the Norwegian has since won three more downhill World Cup races at Beaver Creek. \nHaving lost his mother, who died in childbirth when he was eight years old, the popular Norwegian’s friendly demeanour has sometimes masked his steely determination. \nThe key to his ability to keep bouncing back is, he says, an ability to concentrate purely on the task ahead. \n“I don’t like to get hurt. But I like the challenge of returning from injury,” he said. \nOn Sunday, on the Gariwang mountain, he will have the biggest stage of all to show that at 35, he can still be the world’s fastest man on skis.
