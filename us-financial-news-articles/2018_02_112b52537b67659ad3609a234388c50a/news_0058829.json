[nL9N1OF02Q]\nAsked whether Aston Martin will have to seek a British vehicle license for its new model alongside its EU one, Palmer said it was one of many areas that needed to be clarified.\n“That is a very good question but probably the answer is yes. And regrettably I have to answer you with ‘probablys’ because nobody really knows,” he said.\nObtaining approval in Britain and the EU would lead to extra costs, he added.\n($1 = 0.7169 pounds)\nReporting by Costas Pitas; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:19:40.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
