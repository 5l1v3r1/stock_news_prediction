A 77-year-old Winchester man who tried to intervene was stabbed in the arm but not seriously hurt, Ryan said.\nPolice arrested Yao at the library. He was charged with murder and assault and jailed without bail pending arraignment on Monday. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney.\nPolice are seeking a motive in the attack. The slain woman has not been identified pending notification of relatives.\nThe library said on its Twitter feed that it would remain closed until Monday afternoon.\nReporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T00:44:17.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
