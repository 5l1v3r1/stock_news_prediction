He heard a sound \"so loud that a lot of people came out of the building because people thought the building was getting hit.\"\nThere were about 110 passengers and five crew members aboard the aircraft, Southwest Airlines said in a statement. The passengers were put on another plane to Los Angeles.\nSouthwest said the pilots returned to the airport after they received a cockpit indicator of \"a potential performance issue\" with one of the jet's engines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T22:55:57.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
