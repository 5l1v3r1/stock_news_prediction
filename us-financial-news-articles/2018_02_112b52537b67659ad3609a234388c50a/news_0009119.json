It it will be available in China near the end of 2019, with the United States and Europe to follow.\nFirst models will be partially autonomous, providing advanced driver assistance systems, with full autonomy to be enabled from 2020 through a software upgrade, Byton has said.\nByton Chief Executive Carsten Breitfeld told Reuters in September that current carmakers, for the most part, have not built vehicles taking full advantage of consumer electronics.\n“Apple created a platform and profits from every transaction made with their objects. We will offer content for our consumers,” Breitfeld said, adding that designing a car where drivers and passengers can watch movies, make conference calls or surf the internet is his goal.\n“For this you need a completely different architecture and computing power,” Breitfeld said.\nThe company opened a North American headquarters in Silicon Valley in December and has already announced it is working with global auto suppliers Bosch [ROBG.UL] and Faurecia SA on powertrain and braking systems, and interiors, respectively.\nAdditional reporting By Edward Taylor in Frankfurt; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T20:55:15.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
