The company confidentially filed for its IPO in October, but the information didn't become publicly available until Friday.\nThe filing reveals Dropbox has lost more than $1 billion since its inception. That includes a loss of $112 million on revenue of $1.1 billion last year.\nDropbox boasts about 500 million registered users, but most of them don't pay for its service. Only 11 million users pay for premium version of Dropbox's service, a figure that the company is aggressively trying to increase.\nThat won't be easy, given the fierce competition it's facing. Its rivals in online file storage include three of the world's most powerful companies — Google, Microsoft and Amazon. A smaller competitor, Box Inc., went public at $14 per share two years ago and the stock shot to $23.23 in its first day of trading. It closed Friday at $23.32.\nDropbox hasn't yet disclosed how much of its stock will be sold in the IPO, nor the price for each share. That will occur during the next few weeks as its bankers gauge investor demand. The IPO is likely to attract a lot of attention because Dropbox's service is so widely used.\nThe stock will trade on the Nasdaq exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T02:46:28.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
