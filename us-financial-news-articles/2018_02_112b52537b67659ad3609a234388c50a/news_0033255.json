CLS, a major settler of trades in the foreign exchange market, said the average daily traded FX volumes submitted to it had risen to $1.805 trillion in January, up 24 percent from a year earlier and rising 15.6 percent from December’s levels. In the first four days of last week, Feb. 5 to Feb. 8, volumes had risen a further 14 percent over January’s numbers to $2.054 trillion, CLS added.
