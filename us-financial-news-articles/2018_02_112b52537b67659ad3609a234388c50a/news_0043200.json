He and his wife Cassandra finished building the five-bedroom Holmby Hills house less than a year before he died, according to Stephen Shapiro of Westside Estate Agency, who is listing the property with Linda May of Hilton & Hyland. \nMs. May noted that it is unusual for a newly built home to be listed so soon after the homeowners moved in. If it weren’t for Mr. Grey’s death, “something like this would never come on the market,” she said.\nDesigned by California architect Howard Backen, the house has two kitchens, a den with a bar and an outdoor swimming pool. Photo: Simon Berlyn Located on roughly 2.2 acres, the estate includes a main house of about 12,800 square feet with a “contemporary farmhouse” aesthetic, Mr. Shapiro said. Designed by California architect Howard Backen, the house has two kitchens, a den with a bar and an outdoor swimming pool. Another structure on the property contains a gym, Pilates studio, steam room and sauna.\nMr. Grey bought the property in 2010 for $18.5 million, according to public records. Singer Frank Sinatra lived on the property with his first wife and their children in the late 1940s, according to Nancy Sinatra’s book “Frank Sinatra, My Father.” \nMore Private Properties \nLate Designer Vince Camuto’s Hamptons Estate Fetches $49 Million February 16, 2018 Bruce Willis Downsizes in Manhattan February 15, 2018 Cary Grant’s History-Steeped Former Home to Hit the Market February 13, 2018 The Greys put the property on the market in late 2011 for $23.5 million. They later demolished the former Sinatra house and relisted the property for $19.995 million, and then decided to build on the land instead, Mr. Shapiro said.\nMs. Grey, founder of the beauty company Violet Grey , is moving with the couple’s son to a smaller house, Mr. Shapiro said. She could not be reached for comment.\nWrite to Candace Taylor at Candace.Taylor@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T20:28:11.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
