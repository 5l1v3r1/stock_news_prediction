Collectively EIC & EBD are hereinafter referred to as “Elite” in this document.\nAbout Elite\nEIC is an insurance company domiciled and regulated in Gibraltar, which previously distributed its products through third party intermediaries located in UK and Europe. On the 5th July 2017, Elite announced that it had ceased writing new business. As of 31 st March, 2017, the gross reserves associated with the run-off business of Elite were in excess of £250m.\nTransaction Insight\nAs part of the change of control of Elite, an Armour affiliate - Armour Risk Management Limited is taking operational management of Elite and is assuming key members of staff with in depth knowledge of the business.\nThe Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) has approved and was supportive of the change of control and the concurrent change in operational management from Elite to Armour. The submission for the approval of the transaction was made to the GFSC on the basis that the transfer will provide on-going professional run-off management and appropriate corporate governance for Elite. Armour and its affiliates bring professional run-off management with significant experience and operational scale, which will benefit the policyholders of Elite.\nAbout Armour Group Ltd\nArmour is a Bermuda based group of insurance and service companies which specialize in the creation and implementation of solutions and acquisitions within the run-off and other specialty sectors of the global insurance and reinsurance marketplace.
