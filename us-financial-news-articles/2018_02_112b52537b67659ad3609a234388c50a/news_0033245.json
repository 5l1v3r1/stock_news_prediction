In Fluoroproducts, the combination of increased adoption of Opteon™ refrigerants, higher demand for our fluoropolymers, and higher base refrigerant pricing led to significant segment-level growth. Chemical Solutions profitability improved on strong demand in most product lines, which, along with lower costs, more than made up for the impact from the 2016 divestitures and site closure. Finally, we saw customer preference for our Ti-Pure™ TiO 2 translate into higher volumes in Titanium Technologies. At the same time, we worked closely with our customers to price our Ti-Pure™ pigment toward the value-in-use we believe it should reflect.\"\n\"With 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion and our net leverage position below 2 times, we believe our annual performance illustrated the success of our transformation plan, surpassing our earnings improvement targets by over $300 million and our leverage target by more than a turn of Adjusted EBITDA,\" continued Vergnano.\n\"This positive momentum enabled us to begin executing on our new capital allocation strategy immediately. Following our December investor day through January 2018, we repurchased approximately $150 million of shares under our $500 million share repurchase authorization, demonstrating our current financial strength and confidence in our future,\" commented Vergnano. \"We have ample flexibility to continue repurchasing the balance of our shares and pursue accretive growth investments across the company.\"\nFourth quarter net sales were $1.6 billion, a 19 percent increase from $1.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. Higher prices, primarily for Ti-Pure™ titanium dioxide, added 10 percent to revenue, while volume across all segments grew revenue by 8 percent. Favorable currency in the quarter resulted in a 2 percent revenue increase. Fourth quarter net income of $228 million increased $458 million in comparison to last year's fourth quarter net loss of $230 million. The fourth quarter of 2016 was impacted by the $335 million legal settlement charge. Fourth quarter 2017 diluted earnings per share was $1.19, compared to a loss of $1.26 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter, which also reflected the impact of last year's legal settlement charge. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $394 million, a 65 percent increase from $239 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This improvement reflected the same factors that drove revenue increases in the quarter.\nFull-year 2017 net sales were $6.2 billion, a 15 percent increase from $5.4 billion in 2016. Volume growth across all segments, added 11 percent to revenue, driven primarily by the adoption of Opteon™ refrigerants. Higher prices, primarily for Ti-Pure™ titanium dioxide, increased revenue by an additional 8 percent. Currency was negligible on a year-over-year basis, while portfolio effects of divestitures and site closure within Chemical Solutions were a 4 percent headwind in 2017. Full-year 2017 net income of $746 million increased $739 million in comparison to net income of $7 million in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for 2017 was $3.91, compared to $0.04 per diluted share in 2016. Last year's net income and diluted earnings per share included a gain of $254 million from the sale of businesses in the Chemical Solutions segment recorded during 2016, but were also unfavorably impacted by the legal settlement charge recorded during the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $1.4 billion, a 73 percent increase compared to $822 million in 2016. This improvement was primarily the result of higher prices and increased volume across all businesses, partially offset by higher spending on transformation activities, performance-based compensation, and certain higher raw material costs.\nFluoroproducts\nFluoroproducts segment sales in the fourth quarter were $656 million, an increase of 15 percent versus the prior-year quarter. Volume increased compared to last year's fourth quarter due to continued adoption of Opteon™ refrigerants and greater demand for base refrigerants and fluoropolymers. Higher average prices of base refrigerants and favorable year-over-year pricing for fluoropolymer products were mostly offset by Opteon™ contractual pricing adjustments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $159 million, up 43 percent versus the prior-year quarter, a result of higher prices and volume.\nFor the full year, Fluoroproducts segment sales were $2.7 billion, a 17 percent increase versus the prior year. Strong adoption of Opteon™ refrigerants and increased demand for fluoropolymers drove the volume increase. Higher average prices of base refrigerants were partially offset by lower average price of Opteon™ mobile refrigerants and fluoropolymer products. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $669 million, up 50 percent versus the prior year, reflecting higher price and increased volumes, modestly offset by higher expenses related to transformation initiatives, increased performance-based compensation, and water treatment costs.\nChemical Solutions\nChemical Solutions segment sales in the fourth quarter 2017 were $134 million, a 3 percent increase versus the prior-year quarter. Strong demand for Performance Chemicals & Intermediates products was partially offset by lower Mining Solutions volume due to planned maintenance during the quarter. Higher pricing was driven by improvements in the Performance Chemicals & Intermediates businesses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $20 million compared to $9 million in the prior-year quarter with the increase primarily related to higher volume of retained businesses, lower fixed costs, and higher licensing income.\nFor the full year, Chemical Solutions segment sales were $571 million, a 26 percent decline versus the prior year. Higher demand for Mining Solutions and Performance Chemicals & Intermediates products and modestly higher pricing for Performance Chemicals & Intermediates products were offset by a reduction of sales associated with divestitures and site closure in 2016. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $57 million compared to $39 million in 2016 with the increase primarily related to lower costs across the segment and improved profitability at the Belle, West Virginia facility.\nTitanium Technologies\nIn the fourth quarter, Titanium Technologies segment sales were $785 million, a 26 percent increase versus the prior-year quarter, driven by higher global average selling prices, as well as increased year-over-year volume for Ti-Pure™ titanium dioxide. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $261 million, a 66 percent year-over-year improvement, also a result of higher Ti-Pure™ titanium dioxide pricing and volume.\nFor the full year, Titanium Technologies segment sales were $3.0 billion, an increase of 25 percent versus the prior-year, driven by increased global average selling prices and higher demand for Ti-Pure™ titanium dioxide. Higher pricing and volumes also contributed to an 85 percent increase in segment Adjusted EBITDA to $862 million. These results were partially offset by an increase in certain raw material costs, higher distribution expenses, and higher expenses related to transformation initiatives and performance-based compensation.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other represented a negative $46 million of Adjusted EBITDA, $8 million higher than last year's fourth quarter. This increase was primarily related to higher environmental and transformation-related spending and performance-based compensation. For the full year, Corporate and Other represented a negative $166 million of Adjusted EBITDA versus a negative $128 million in the prior year, a result of higher legal defense costs, transformation-related costs and performance-based compensation costs.\nThe company realized a cash tax rate of approximately 8 percent during the fourth quarter, and 9 percent for the 2017 fiscal year. The impact of recent US tax reform was immaterial in 2017 as we recognized a benefit from the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability, which was almost fully offset by the net impact of the \"toll charge.\" The company now expects a moderately lower effective tax rate going forward.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, gross consolidated debt was approximately $4.1 billion. Debt, net of $1.6 billion cash, was approximately $2.6 billion, resulting in a net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.8 times on a trailing twelve-month basis.\nCash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $303 million, versus $269 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Free Cash Flow (FCF) for the fourth quarter was $138 million versus the previous year quarter of $166 million. The lower FCF was primarily related to higher capital spending in 2017 versus 2016.\nFor the full year 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $639 million, reflecting the $335 million legal settlement payment completed in August 2017. This was in comparison to $594 million in 2016, which included a $190 million benefit of the prepayment received from DuPont. Full-year Free Cash Flow was $228 million, $28 million lower than the previous year. Excluding the 2016 DuPont prepayment and the 2017 settlement payment, 2017 Free Cash Flow of $563 million represented a $497 million improvement versus the previous year.\nOutlook\nThe company expects to deliver 2018 Adjusted EBITDA within a range of $1.7 to $1.85 billion, a 25 percent increase at the midpoint over 2017. Additionally, the company anticipates Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow to benefit from the recent United States tax reform. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be within a range of $4.95 to $5.60, and Free Cash Flow is expected to be greater than $600 million.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, Chemours will hold a conference call and webcast on Thursday, February 15, 2018 at 8:30 AM EST.

For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the adjustment is primarily attributable to a benefit for the net impact of U.S. tax reform, which amounted to $3. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustment is primarily attributable to a benefit of $20 related to windfall benefits on the Company's share-based payments, the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions for $6, and a $3 benefit for the aforementioned net impact of U.S. tax reform, which are partially offset by the tax implications of foreign exchange gains and losses for $5. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, the adjustment is primarily attributable to a benefit of $4 related to windfall benefits on the Company's share-based payments and the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions for $6. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the adjustment is primarily attributable to $18 for the tax implications of foreign exchange gains and losses.\n(6) The income tax impacts included in this caption are determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which income or expense occurred and include both current and deferred income tax (benefit) expense based on the nature of the non-GAAP financial measure.\n(7) Total provision for (benefit from) income taxes reconciles to the amount reported in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for the three months ended September 30, 2017.\nThe Chemours Company\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAdjusted Earnings per Share to GAAP Earnings per Share Tabular Reconciliations\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
