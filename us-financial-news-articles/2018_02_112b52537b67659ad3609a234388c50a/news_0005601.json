Power was being restored to the mine but there was not yet enough to bring the miners to the surface.\nThe National Union of Mineworkers said 65 mineworkers had been rescued but more than 1,000 remained underground.\n“There is no electricity there, so they are using a generator to power the cage to take workers to the surface,” NUM spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu told Reuters.\n“The problem is they are rescuing one mineworker at a time. It is very slow. It is worrying. Some of our members have chronic conditions and they don’t have medication down there.”\nReporting by Ed Stoddard; Editing by Joe Brock, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:08:01.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
