United host Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday to kick off a run of four home games in their next five matches. Mourinho’s side start next month with a league trip to Crystal Palace before welcoming top-four rivals Liverpool. A Champions League last-16, second-leg fixture against Sevilla and a home FA Cup quarter-final against Brighton & Hove Albion wrap up the busy period, and Mourinho remains confident ahead of United’s decisive spell in the campaign. “I think the next few weeks at Old Trafford will be amazing,” he told MUTV.
