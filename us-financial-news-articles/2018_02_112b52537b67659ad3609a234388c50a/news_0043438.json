She also withdrew from the super-G.\n”As much as I wanted to compete in the Olympic downhill, with the schedule change it’s important for me to focus my energy on preparing for the combined,” Shiffrin said in a statement issued by United States Snow and Skiboard.\n“I’m looking forward to cheering on our girls racing in the downhill and to compete myself in Thursday’s combined,” added Shiffrin, who was 16th fastest in downhill practice.\nAustria’s Stephanie Venier was quickest in Monday’s second practice session but race favorites Sofia Goggia of Italy and American Lindsey Vonn were close behind.\nThe combined event was brought forward because of strong winds forecast for Friday.\nThe men’s slalom, in which Austria’s Marcel Hirscher could win his third gold medal of the Games, will take place as scheduled on Thursday at the Yongpyong mountain.\nThree of the first four races on the Alpine schedule were postponed because of winds gusting up to 72 kilometers per hour which closed the gondola taking the competitors to the top of the mountain.\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney/Mitch Phillips, editing ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T14:17:56.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
