The Bears were held under 60 points for the eighth time in conference play this season.\nNowell used 13-for-14 success at the free throw line to accumulate a majority of his points for the Huskies, who shot 45.7 percent from the field and outscored Cal 21-12 on 3-pointers.\nMatisse Thybulle did all his scoring on 3-pointers, hitting three for nine points.\nDickerson had a game-high nine rebounds to complement his 16 points for Washington, which allowed the fewest points in any of its games this season.\nMcNeill made three 3-pointers for Cal, but his teammates combined for just one during a 4-for-17 team performance.\nJustice Sueing added 12 points for Cal, while Coleman finished with a game-high four assists to go with eight points.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T19:59:09.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
