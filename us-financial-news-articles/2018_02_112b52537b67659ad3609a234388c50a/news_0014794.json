It also enables investors to rent land for up to 99 years. \nThe government has also introduced relaxed visa measures for foreign professionals and also invoked executive powers to help speed investment approval. \nThe EEC project has already attracted attention at home. \nThe country’s largest petrochemical company, PTT Global Chemical ( PTTGC.BK ) announced a $985 million olefins plant in the EEC in January. \nTop industrial estate developer, Amata Corporation Pcl ( AMATA.BK ) increased its sales target last year in the EEC, anticipating more investors. Amata also partnered with Swedish Saab AB ( SAABb.ST ) to study the development of an aerospace city. \nThe EEC drew $9.3 billion of promised investment in 2017, according Thailand’s investment agency. \nThe industrial east is already home to foreign auto manufacturers such as Toyota ( 7203.T ), Honda ( 7267.T ) and Ford ( F.N ), that gave Thailand the moniker, “Detroit of the East”, and also houses petrochemical and electronic companies.
