Companies from China, whose influence is growing in the region, are vying for the project, but there will also be bids from Japanese firms, as well as South Korean companies. \nChina Railway Corporation would lead a consortium of Chinese companies, while Japan’s JR East would head another including Sumitomo Corporation, Hitachi Ltd, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and NEC Corp, Reuters reported last month. \nSouth Korea’s consortium would include Hyundai Rotem Co and Hyundai Engineering and Construction. \nMalaysia and Singapore are jointly tendering the work, with the tender due to close on June 29.
