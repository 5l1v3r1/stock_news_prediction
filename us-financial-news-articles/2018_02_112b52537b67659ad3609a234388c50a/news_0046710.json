Trump has also regularly expressed irritation with Time Warner's CNN because of its coverage of his campaign and administration.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWATCH: Judge says AT&T hasn't shown it was singled out for suit show chapters Judge says AT&T hasn't shown it was singled out for suit      53 Mins Ago | 01:27", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T21:19:34.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
