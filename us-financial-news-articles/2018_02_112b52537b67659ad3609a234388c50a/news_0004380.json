The multinational e-commerce retailer fits in best with what we believe in,” chief executive Hari Menon said.\nBengaluru-headquartered BigBasket, which researcher Forrester estimates accounts for roughly 40 percent of India’s $750 million online grocery market, is competing with SoftBank-backed ( 9984.T ) Grofers and Amazon’s India unit for a bigger slice of the market.\nFounded in 2011, BigBasket has more than 6 million registered customers and operates across 26 Indian cities.\nAlibaba, through its units, holds various investments in India’s fast-growing online retail space, including a stake in the parent of top digital wallet firm Paytm.\nSands Capital Pvt Growth Ltd, International Finance Corp and Abraaj Basket I Pvt Ltd also invested a total of $50.8 million in BigBasket as part of the latest round, according to the filing.\nIt was not immediately known who invested the remainder of the total $300 million.\nBigBasket and Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.\nReporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Devidutta Tripathy and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:32:02.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
