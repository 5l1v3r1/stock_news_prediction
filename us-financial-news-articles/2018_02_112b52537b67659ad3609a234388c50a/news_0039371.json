The 2018 guidance looks net positive,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note following the results.\nCapgemini said it expects revenue growth of 6 to 7 percent at constant exchange rates in 2018.\nIts 2017 revenue rose four percent at constant currencies to 12.79 billion euros ($16 billion), mainly driven by a 24 percent rise in Digital and Cloud revenues.\nCapgemini’s operating margin for 2017 stood at 1.49 billion euros or 11.7 percent of revenues in 2017, slightly below analysts’ estimate of 1.51 billion euros.\nCapgemini pointed to a business slowdown in the second half of the year in Britain and Ireland “with notably longer client decision cycles”. Revenues in these countries dropped 9.6 percent.\nThe group also proposed a dividend increase of 10 percent to 1.70 euros per share.\nShares in the company rose 2.8 percent to 104.9 euros at 0829 GMT.
