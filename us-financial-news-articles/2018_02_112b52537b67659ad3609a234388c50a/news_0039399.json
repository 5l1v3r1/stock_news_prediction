But Zargaran said this was not a trend that was expected to grow.\n“Our policy is not really to export, though, it is for self-sufficiency,” he said.\nReporting By Maha El Dahan; Editing by Alison Williams and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T13:44:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
