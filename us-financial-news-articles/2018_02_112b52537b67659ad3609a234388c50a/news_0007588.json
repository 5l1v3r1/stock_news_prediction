People were not willing to build inventory,” Nambiath said. \nThe expectation of the duty cut in January prompted traders to offer the highest discount in four months over official domestic prices. \nHowever, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley kept the import tax unchanged in the annual budget presented on Feb. 1. \nThe rebound in overseas prices also kept buyers on the sidelines, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bank. \n“Jewellers were not comfortable with the spike in prices. They were expecting a correction,” he said. \nAfter falling to the lowest level in five months in December, gold prices surged to the highest level in 17 months in January. \nIndian banks aggressively imported gold in December taking advantage of lower prices and a lot of the unsold bullion was available to fulfil January demand, said a Chennai-based bullion dealer. \nThe country’s overseas gold purchases in December stood at 80.4 tonnes, up 61 percent from a year ago, GFMS data showed. \nIndia’s gold imports surged 69 percent in 2017 from the previous year to 863.2 tonnes. \nIn February, imports could rise above 50 tonnes as jewellers have been replenishing inventory, the private bank dealer said.
