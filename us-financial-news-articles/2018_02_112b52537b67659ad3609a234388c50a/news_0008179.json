It says the entire city is its eternal, indivisible capital. It pulled out of Gaza in 2005.\nU.S.-led peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. A bid by Trump’s administration to restart negotiations has shown no real signs of progress.\nReporting by Ali Sawafta; Additional reporting by Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T23:32:16.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
