(Nasdaq:ADMS) today reported recent achievements and financial results for the fourth quarter and full- 2017.\n“I’m very proud of the accomplishments made by the Adamas team in 2017, especially the approval and commercial availability of GOCOVRI™, the first and only FDA-approved treatment for dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy,” said Gregory T. Went, Ph.D., Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “Parkinson’s disease is a particularly burdensome and costly disease, not only for patients, but also for their care partners and the healthcare system, which is why it was so important to bring to market a medicine that delivers substantial benefit in dyskinesia as well as a secondary benefit in OFF time. We are encouraged by the initial weeks of GOCOVRI’s full commercial launch and are pleased with the reaction we are receiving from physicians, patients, care partners and payers as we continue to educate them on the unique benefits of GOCOVRI.”\nDr. Went continued, “In addition, we are now capitalized to advance our clinical programs based upon our time-dependent biology approach and look forward to initiating the first Phase 3 study for ADS-5102 in multiple sclerosis patients with walking impairment early in the second quarter of 2018, and finalizing the clinical development pathway for ADS-4101 in epilepsy patients with partial onset seizures.”\nRecent Achievements\nGOCOVRI™ (amantadine) extended release capsules for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications\nCommenced full U.S. commercial launch of GOCOVRI with 59 neurology account specialists in January 2018 Received prescriptions for GOCOVRI from over 300 distinct prescribers as of February 16, 2018, up from 100 distinct prescribers as of December 31, 2017 Published GOCOVRI open-label subgroup analysis in Movement Disorders Clinical Practice and presented two posters at scientific conferences Received approval of a supplemental New Drug Application for manufacturing GOCOVRI at a second commercial site\nADS-5102 (amantadine) extended release capsules in development for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis\nPublished Phase 2 proof-of-concept data in Multiple Sclerosis Journal\nADS-4101 (lacosamide) modified release capsules in development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy\nPresented ADS-4101 Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical data, as well as pre-clinical rotarod data at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting in December 2017 Scheduled a meeting with the FDA to discuss development program\nCorporate\nConcluded 2017 with $176.4 million in cash and investments, which includes $65 million in funding from HealthCare Royalty Partners in the fourth quarter of 2017, as part of the $100 million royalty-backed debt agreement executed in May 2017 Raised $134.1 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and transaction costs, through a public offering of 3,450,000 shares of common stock at a price of $41.50 per share in January 2018\nAnticipated Milestones in the First Half of 2018\nInitiate the first Phase 3 study for ADS-5102 (GOCOVRI) in multiple sclerosis patients with walking impairment Present GOCOVRI and ADS-4101 clinical data at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting Report topline GOCOVRI data from EASE LID 2 long-term Phase 3 open-label study Review ADS-4101 development program with the FDA Report first full quarter of revenues for GOCOVRI\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial Results\nAdamas recorded net product sales of GOCOVRI of $0.6 million for both the fourth quarter and full- 2017. GOCOVRI was made commercially available on October 20, 2017 and the full commercial launch occurred on January 8, 2018. The company recognizes revenue using a sell-in method when products are delivered to the specialty pharmacy. No product revenues were recorded in 2016.\nAdamas reported a net loss of $29.4 million, or $1.27 per share, basic and diluted, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $15.0 million, or $0.68 per share, basic and diluted, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the 2017, Adamas reported a net loss of $89.5 million, or $3.97 per share, basic and diluted, compared to a net loss of $60.1 million, or $2.77 per share, basic and diluted, for the year ended 2016.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $6.4 million, including $1.0 million in stock-based compensation expense, compared to $7.0 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, which included $0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense. For the full-year 2017, R&D expenses were $27.2 million, including $3.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, compared to $31.2 million for the full-year 2016, which included $2.9 million in stock-based compensation expense. R&D expenses for the full-year were primarily for the ongoing open-label safety study for GOCOVRI, pre-approval manufacturing costs, and development work for ADS-5102 (GOCOVRI) in development for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis and for ADS-4101 in development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $23.0 million, including $2.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, compared to $8.3 million for the same quarter in the prior year, which included $2.1 million in stock-based compensation expense.

The increase in SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter and full-year was primarily due to growth in commercial and administrative expenses in preparation for the commercial launch of GOCOVRI.\nOn December 31, 2017, Adamas had $176.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, which includes $65 million in funding the company received from HealthCare Royalty Partners (HCR) in the fourth quarter of 2017 as part of the $100 million royalty-backed debt agreement the company executed in May 2017. In January 2018, the company raised $134.1 million net proceeds in a public offering.\n2018 Guidance\nFor 2018, Adamas expects full-year R&D expenses to be between $45 million and $50 million, reflecting the completion of the GOCOVRI open-label study, initiation of the ADS-5102 Phase 3 trials in multiple sclerosis patients with walking impairment as well as preparation work for the ADS-4101 Phase 3 trial in epilepsy patients with partial onset seizures. Additionally, the company expects full-year SG&A expenses to be between $115 million and $125 million, in support of GOCOVRI commercialization.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nAdamas will host a conference call and webcast today, February 22, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
