One of the things I‘m curious about is that Norway had a runaway success here and they really did a great job preparing their athletes and I really admire them for that.\n”I admire their athletes as well. I want to find out some things about what they’re up to.\n”I really want to sit down and get the feedback from the athletes about what sort of things they see in the field in the preparation of their competitors so we can learn from that and focus on some of those things, whether that’s in the areas of coaching, better training, better technology and innovation, more competition opportunities.\n“You’ve just got to look at all those things as you go into this.”\nSeeking a silver lining, Ashley pointed to the U.S. team’s depth, and what that means for the future.\n”I‘m actually more encouraged now than I’ve ever been,“ he said. ”Even though people can say ‘well, you know, you didn’t hit your medal count, you didn’t get to the right level’, look at the depth of our team.\n”Look at the number of individuals who were, like, fourth through sixth. I mean we had 35 individuals that were four through six, we had some incredibly close calls.\n“I want to basically look at this and say this is an opportunity for us. We have this amazing depth, we have these incredible medalists and how do we basically continue to compete at an even higher level and give them what they need going forward.”\nEditing by: Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T09:03:10.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
