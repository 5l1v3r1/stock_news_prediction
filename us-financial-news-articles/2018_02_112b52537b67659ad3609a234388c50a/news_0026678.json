But we feel it was the best decision in the interest of our safe and reliable operations,” IndiGo said in a statement.\nPassengers have also been offered refunds, IndiGo said.\nReporting by Promit Mukherjee, Editing by Tim Hepher\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T12:42:33.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
