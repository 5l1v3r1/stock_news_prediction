This rare occurrence of bond yields rising even as stock markets decline was a feature in 1987 and 1994,\" he added. \"What these periods had in common was Fed tightening concerns, jitters over economic overheating and an ever-flatter yield curve. One of these years had a huge correction and one had massive volatility and rolling corrections. Pick your poison.\"\nIn terms of the \"huge correction\" reference, he is referring to the \"Black Monday\" stock market crash when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 23 percent on Oct. 19, 1987.\nRosenberg is chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T19:25:22.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
