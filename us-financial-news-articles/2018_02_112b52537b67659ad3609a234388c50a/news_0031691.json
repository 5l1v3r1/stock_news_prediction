The battle between the winners of South America’s two biggest cup competitions veered Gremio’s way after 21 minutes when Luan took advantage of a poor pass out of defence to give the visitors the lead. The Brazilians, winners of the 2017 Copa Libertadores, were given more help six minutes later when Independiente’s Emmanuel Gigliotti was sent off for elbowing an opponent. However, the home side, winners of the Copa Sudamericana, the continental equivalent of the Europa League, fought back to equalise when Bruno Cortes deflected a free kick past his own keeper after 33 minutes. The second leg will take place next Wednesday in Porto Alegre.
