( prn.to/2ospIR0 )\nLiberty is willing to finance working capital needs once iHeart has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy through a debtor-in-possession financing facility, according to the document.\nIn return, Liberty will receive 40 percent of the new shares of the company along with its majority held subsidiary Sirius XM Holdings Inc ( SIRI.O ).\nReporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T04:31:13.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
