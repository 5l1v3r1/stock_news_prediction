Ten-year Treasury yields hit new four-year highs around 2.90 percent, while German yields, the benchmark for Europe, hovered just below 0.8 percent, the 2-1/2-year high touched last week .\n“People are nervous after the shock of the past week but it doesn’t feel like there is a crisis around the corner. But never say never,” said Grant Lewis, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London.\nGiven solid world economic growth, Lewis said the falls were more likely a wobble than a full-blown correction to the nine-year long equity bull market as bond investors priced in an improved economic outlook.\n“Even at 2.90 percent, 10-year Treasury yields are still low,” he added.\nU.S. equity futures rose 1 percent .\nData from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed equity funds had cut long positions in S&P 500 futures, reducing exposure to a market which has fallen about 8 percent from Jan. 26 record highs.\nINFLATION, DOLLAR While equity markets attempt to recover, the question is whether they can withstand another sharp move up in bond yields - something will be put to the test by economic data this week.\nIn China, banks extended a record amount of new yuan loans in January, blowing past expectations, which is likely to support growth not only in China but underpin liquidity globally.\nAnalysts forecast U.S. consumer price inflation, to be released on Wednesday, to have slowed to 1.9 percent in January from a year earlier, while the core measure is seen ticking down to 1.7 percent.\nGiven it was fears of faster inflation - and more aggressive rate rises - that triggered the global rout in the first place, an above-forecast figure could well spark a fresh selloff in stocks and bonds.\nCentral bankers have not exhibited much concern over the equity rout, indicating they intend to push on with plans to tighten monetary policy this year.\nOn currency markets, traders had cut net short positions in the dollar last week, CFTC data showed, but speculators returned on Monday to short the dollar, pushing it 0.2 percent lower versus a basket of currencies.\nSociete Generale said the risk bounce was being countered by the steeper U.S. bond curve but the soft dollar showed the former currently had the upper hand.\nThe gap between short- and long-dated U.S. yields is at the widest in more than three months - the so-called curve steepening which indicates higher inflation expectations and economic activity.\n“If a better risk mood just encourages 10-year Treasuries to spike up through 2.9 percent, it seems unlikely that we will see equities bounce too far and by the same token, it’s too early to sell dollars,” Societe Generale warned clients.\nThe euro rose around 0.2 percent, after losing 1.8 percent last week, while the yen eased off five-month highs hit last week amid the flight to safe-havens.\nSterling meanwhile inched higher, off last week’s three-week lows but Britain’s shaky economy and rocky Brexit process kept it fragile.\nMonday’s more cheerful market mood also lifted commodities, with Brent crude futures rising two percent after last week’s 9 percent fall, copper bouncing off two-month lows and gold up 0.2 percent, well off five-week troughs.\nReporting by Sujata Rao; additional reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and Ritvik Carvalho in London; Wayne Cole in Sydney; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:47:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
