the Kuwait Investment Authority with a 5.33 percent stake; and the Renault-Nissan alliance with 3.1 percent, according to German regulator BaFin’s website.\nAt 1220 GMT, Daimler shares were down 2 percent at 69.31 euros amid a global sell-off in equities.\nReporting by Edward Taylor in Frankfurt Norihiko Shirouzu in Beijing and Joe White in Duisburg;
