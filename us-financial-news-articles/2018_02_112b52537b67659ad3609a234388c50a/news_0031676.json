Barry committed no crime and was justified in his actions,” SBA President Ed Mullins said in the statement.\nBarry entered Danner’s Bronx apartment on Oct. 18, 2016. He arrived after other police officers and paramedics had already arrived on the scene, responding to a neighbor who had called the police to say Danner was acting irrationally and screaming in the hallway, prosecutors said.\nBarry had testified that he shot her as she swung a baseball bat at him in her bedroom. Danner was hit twice through the torso.\nBronx District Attorney Darcel Clark said he was disappointed by the verdict, but said the incident still illustrates the need to improve police procedures for dealing with mentally disturbed people.\n“There must be serious reforms to improve access to treatment so the situation does not rise to a crisis,” Clark said in a statement. “Mental health professionals should be part of the response to emotionally disturbed persons.”\nReporting by Peter Szekely; editing by Frank McGurty and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:40:28.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
