Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index led losses in the region, down 1.34 percent in afternoon trade. Among the biggest drags on the exchange were shares of Petróleo Brasileiro SA, which have fallen amid a decline in oil prices. Mexico's IPC fell 0.58 percent, extending losses from Tuesday when markets opened to the news of Wall Street's biggest sell-off in six years. Analysts said they were also discouraged by early reports from companies during earnings season. UBS Wealth Management investment strategist Ronaldo Patah said the Brazilian market would continue to be volatile until new U.S. economic data is released, particularly regarding inflation. Nonetheless, he remains bullish about the market. \"At the start, we view (the declines) as a correction, an opportunity to buy,\" he said. Among currency markets, the Chilean peso rose 0.11 percent after the central bank posted a January trade surplus of $1.21 billion, up 7 percent from the previous year as prices for key export copper improved. The Mexican, Colombian and Argentine peso currencies all slid slightly in the face of a strengthening global dollar.
