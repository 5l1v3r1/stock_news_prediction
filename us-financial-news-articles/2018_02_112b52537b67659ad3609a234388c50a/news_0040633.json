I am confident they can be cleared soon,” Mario Centeno told a news conference after a regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers. The next tranche of loans is of 5.7 billion euros (5.05 billion pounds), Centeno said, adding that it is up to euro zone states now to do what necessary to unlock the funds.
