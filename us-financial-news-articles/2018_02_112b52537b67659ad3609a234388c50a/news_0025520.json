Honda and Dongfeng plan to resolve the issue by updating the engine’s gasoline injection control software.\nHonda officials said there had been no reports of accidents. They said the engine oil issue doesn’t affect the engine or the car’s performance.\nThe measure comes after CR-V and Civic owners turned to the Weibo microblog - China’s Twitter equivalent - and other means to air their complaints since mid January.\nA man walks past Honda Motor Co. cars outside a showroom in Tokyo January 30, 2008. REUTERS/Michael Caronna/Files The recall points to an emerging pattern in China where customer complaints spiral out of control as they are aired out on Weibo, forcing an automaker to respond.\nYears ago the kind of recall Honda announced on Monday could have been dealt through a so-called customer service action, industry officials and experts say. That refers to what the auto industry calls a “quiet recall”, which is less damaging financially and image-wise, where an automaker fixes a non-safety issue, often free of charge, whenever the customer comes to the dealership.\n“Without Weibo, it would have gone on for years,” said James Chao, chief automotive analyst for IHS Markit in the Asia-Pacific region. “That’s the way it was for the industry in the pre-Weibo, pre-Twitter era.”\nHonda did not say the scale of the move in its statement, but a Beijing-based spokesman and other company officials said Honda and its joint venture partner are likely to call back roughly 350,000 vehicles. “We’re still trying to determine the precise number of cars affected,” the spokesman said.\nNormally un-combusted petrol ends up accumulated in the lubricant oil pan but evaporates under heat from the engine. Such evaporated petrol is by design put back into the engine combustion chamber as fuel.\nThe issue involving the CR-V and the Civic has occurred in northern China where temperatures can dip well below the freezing point and when drivers of the affected vehicles drive short distances frequently.\nOn short runs, Honda engineers believe the engine doesn’t warm up enough to help un-combusted petrol accumulated in the lubricant oil pan to evaporate.\nReporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Keith Weir and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T13:52:43.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
