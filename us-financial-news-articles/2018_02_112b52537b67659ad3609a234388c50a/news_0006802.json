Guess was not immediately available to comment. \n\nShoppers walk by a Guess store in Golden, Colorado, December 3, 2014. REUTERS/Rick Wilking Marciano responded to Upton’s allegations through celebrity news website TMZ, saying he never touched Upton, and has never been alone with her. He said he would not apologize as he had done nothing wrong, TMZ reported. \n“If she has a claim, there’s one place to tell the truth and that’s in court or to the police,” he told TMZ. \nMarciano could not be reached by Reuters for comment. \nGuess shares were down 14.1 percent at $15.77 on Thursday, wiping about $200 million off the company’s market value. \nReporting by Uday Sampath, Nandita Bose and Bernie Woodall; Editing by Bill Rigby\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T22:05:08.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
