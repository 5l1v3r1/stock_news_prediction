At the time, representatives for Chipotle told CNBC they had not been informed of any widespread food-safety incidents. \nAccording to Geigor, 37 percent of the more than 1,600 customers polled online by UBS said they ate Chipotle less frequently because of food safety concerns. \n\"Chipotle is a case study in what happens when a brand loses the trust of its consumers,\" David Henkes, principal at Technomic, told CNBC via email. \"The market is too competitive right now, and consumers have so many choices, that once that bond is broken, it's hard to get consumers back.\" \nChipotle is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings after the bell on Feb. 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:06:40.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
