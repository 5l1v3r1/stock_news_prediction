They urged the government to present a new electoral calendar.\nThe statement stopped short of saying the group would not recognize the results of the election, though several members, including Venezuela’s neighbor Colombia, have already done so.\nPeru’s Foreign Minister Cayetana Aljovin also told a news conference that Maduro would not be welcome at the Summit of the Americas to be held in Lima on April 13 and 14.\nVenezuela’s foreign minister had recently tweeted that Maduro planned to attend. The Lima Group statement said the group respected Peru’s decision.\nThe Lima Group also pledged to coordinate efforts to confront an exodus of Venezuelans that is putting pressure on the country’s neighbors.\nColombia and Brazil tightened border controls last week as both nations grappled with a mounting influx of hundreds of thousands of desperate migrants.\nReporting by Marco Aquino; Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Sandra Maler and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T03:33:11.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
