The result leaves the Kings at 71 points, two out of a playoff spot with 20 games left in their season.\nSlepyshev put Los Angeles in a hole only 51 seconds into the game with his fourth goal of the season. Michael Cammalleri and Ryan Strome cycled to keep the puck in the Kingsâ€™ zone until Strome gained possession behind the net. He fed Slepyshev in the slot and goalie Jonathan Quick had no chance.\nDraisaitl made it 2-0 at 6:16 of the second period, scoring his 19th goal of the season. Cammallieri again figured into the marker, this time picking up the primary assist as he fed Draisaitl in the high slot. Draisaitl wired a wrister by Quick.\nToffoli put Los Angeles on the board at 14:26, notching his 20th tally. After taking the puck away from Edmonton near the blue line, Toffoli passed to Nate Thompson. Toffoli then took a return pass in the slot, deked to the backhand side and flicked the puck past Talbot.\nKhaira made it 3-1 at 17:04 with his 10th goal. Drake Caggiula got him the puck just past center ice and Khaira split defensemen as he went through the zone, zipping a wrister past Quick.\nRieder, who was picked up on Wednesday from Arizona, paid dividends in his second game with the Kings. He scored at 7:51 of the third period, managing to chip the rebound of a Derek Forbort point shot into a mostly empty net.\nStrome scored into an empty net at 19:01, with Cammalleri bagging his third assist. Brown answered back at 19:42 with his 18th goal, but all that did was make it closer.\nQuick stopped 21 of 24 shots in the losing cause.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:54:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
