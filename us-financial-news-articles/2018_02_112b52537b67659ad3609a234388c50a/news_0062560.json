They say it is a complex phenomenon caused by a number of factors.\nThe industry lobby said that while it allows that there may be a risk to bees, EFSA has overstated it. It argued that any risk can be managed and a ban would cause further harm by forcing farmers to extend agricultural lands.\n“Farmers need access to a broad range of tools to protect their crops,” Graeme Taylor of the European Crop Protection Association said.\nTwo major field studies in Europe and Canada published last year that sought to examine real-world effects gave mixed results. They found some negative effects after exposure to neonicotinoids in wild and honeybee populations, and also some positives, depending on the environmental context.\nEnvironmental campaigners said the study confirmed regulators should act to ban the use of neonicotinoids.\n“National governments must stop dithering ... to prevent the catastrophic collapse of bee populations,” said Franziska Achterberg, Greenpeace EU food policy adviser.\nWednesday’s EFSA report looked in detail at three specific neonicotinoids - clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam –and assessed bee exposure to them via three routes: residues in bee pollen and nectar, dust drift during sowing or application of treated seeds, and water consumption.\nSome scenarios, such as when the pesticides are used on crops inside glass greenhouses, present a low risk to bees, Tarazona told Reuters. But others, such as using neonicotinoids on flowering field crops that attract bees, are high risk.\nHe said EFSA’s findings would now be shared with European Commission risk managers and then with EU member States, who will decide on any potential changes to current restrictions.\nReporting by Kate Kelland; Additional reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel in Brussels; Editing by Jon Boyle; Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:48:10.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
