It is scheduled to hold a call with analysts and investors later on Wednesday.\nCarlyle’s fourth-quarter economic net income per adjusted unit came in at $1.01, well ahead of analysts’ expectations for 62 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Economic net income reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on Carlyle’s portfolio, and is a key earnings metric for U.S. private equity firms.\n“We had record activity across several dimensions during 2017, deploying $22 billion into new investments and raising $43 billion of capital across the platform,” co-Chief Executives Kewsong Lee and Glenn Youngkin, who took over from co-founders David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D‘Aniello in January, said in a statement.\nDistributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - totalled $155.8 million in the quarter, up from $7.4 million a year ago. The firm said its board of directors approved a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per common unit.\nPrivate equity firms are coming off of a bumper year for fundraising, with the industry attracting a record $453 billion from investors in 2017. Washington DC-based Carlyle was no exception, as its assets under management reached $195 billion at the end of 2017, up from $174.4 billion the previous quarter.\nCarlyle, whose assets span private equity, real estate and credit funds, also said it had taken a net charge of $42 million in the quarter on its deferred tax assets and tax receivable agreement liability due to the new U.S. tax rules passed by Congress late last year.
