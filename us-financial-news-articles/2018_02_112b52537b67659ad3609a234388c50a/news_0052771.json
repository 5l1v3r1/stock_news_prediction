In the meantime, the province will proceed with the other measures around oil spill preparedness, response, and compensation.\n($1 = 1.2698 Canadian dollars)\nReporting by Julie Gordon; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T01:46:23.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
