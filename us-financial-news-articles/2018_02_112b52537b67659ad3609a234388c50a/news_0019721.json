Blockchain is the technology that underpins them, but can have many other business applications as a ledger for recording transactions. \n“Crypto is a bubble in the sense that there are a lot of people wanting to buy the asset, but blockchain also in terms of the huge amounts on investment – a lot of that won’t have short-term economic returns,” said Nguyen Trieu. \nFrance Telecom, since rebranded as Orange, wasn’t the only company to benefit from the market’s enthusiasm for all things tech at the turn of the century. \nIn December 2001, a study by academics at Purdue University found that the 95 companies that added “.com”, “.net” or “internet” to their names saw their share price increase by 74 percent in the 10 days surrounding the announcement day. \nAnd if the current crypto-crash continues, companies have one more name-change trick available. \nA study by the University of Illinois in 2002 found that when many of the same companies changed their names again after the bubble burst to remove traces of their dotcom past, their shares rallied by a similar amount.
