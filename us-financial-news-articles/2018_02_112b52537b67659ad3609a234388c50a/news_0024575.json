The sites were zoned for residential development.\nThe Asian financial hub has one of the most expensive housing markets in the world, with private home prices shattering historic records for 13 months in a row and rising almost 200 percent since 2008.\nThe sale comes as HNA faces financing strains following a $50 billion acquisition spree over the past two years, which has sparked scrutiny of its opaque ownership and use of leverage.\nHNA has over the past few months focused on scaling back its offshore real estate investments, which Beijing has targeted with capital controls.\nGroup CEO Adam Tan has said the company would not invest in areas that were not backed by the central government.\nLate last month, HNA said it had reached a deal to sell a building in Sydney for A$205 million ($166 million).\nReporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T02:57:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
