A special train had been prepared just for the visitors, a Blue House pool report said.

Dozens of South Koreans at the airport tried to snap photographs of her on their mobile phones. \nShe is the first member of North Korea’s ruling family to visit the South, while Kim Yong Nam is the most senior North Korean official to make a cross-border trip. \nThe pair will have lunch with Moon on Saturday, Moon’s office said.

It is a blessed day. I like the reconciliatory mood and I have high expectations,” said Kim Sang-yoon, a 44-year-old businessman who drove nearly five hours to see the opening ceremony with his wife and two sons. \nNearly 500 North Koreans have arrived in South Korea for the Olympics, which run through to Feb. 25.
