Metro claimed not to know the stockbroker at the time.\n“A guilty plea alone is not necessarily determinative of sentencing accountability,” Circuit Judge Kent Jordan wrote.\nMatthew Reilly, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito in New Jersey, whose office handled the case, said prosecutors will review their legal options.\nLawrence Lustberg, Metro’s lawyer, said he will seek his client’s release from prison, and “a sentencing that really reflects his conduct and not the unknown conduct of others.”\nMetro is not scheduled to be released from prison before May 2019, federal records show.\nProsecutors said Metro passed tips about corporate mergers and other transactions involving Simpson Thacher clients to Frank Tamayo, a mortgage broker he knew from law school, at midtown Manhattan bars or coffee shops.\nTamayo wrote down the relevant stock ticker symbols, passed the tips to Morgan Stanley stockbroker Vladimir Eydelman at Grand Central’s main clock, and then chewed up the papers on which the tips were written, prosecutors said.\nThe scheme ran from 2009 to early 2014, and Metro made $168,000, prosecutors have said.\nEydelman and Tamayo also pleaded guilty, and Tamayo cooperated with prosecutors. They were sentenced to three years and one year in prison, respectively.\nThe appeals court said U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp in Trenton, New Jersey, must determine how close Metro and Eydelman were before resentencing Metro.\nThe case is U.S. v. Metro, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-3813.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T19:30:23.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
