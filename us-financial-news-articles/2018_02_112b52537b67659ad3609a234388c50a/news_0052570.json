(NYSE: AYI) who purchased shares between October 15, 2015 and April 3, 2017. The action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleges that the Company violated federal securities laws.\nIn particular, the complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that (1) known trends were negatively impacting sales of Acuity’s products; (2) Acuity’s ability to achieve profitable sales growth was overstated; and (3) as a result, defendants’ positive statements about Acuity’s current and future business and financial prospects lacked a reasonable basis.\nShareholders have until March 5, 2018 to petition the court for lead plaintiff status.
