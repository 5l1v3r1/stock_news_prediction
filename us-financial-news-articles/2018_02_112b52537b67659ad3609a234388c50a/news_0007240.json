But we are probably going to lose him for a few weeks, but I cannot say how long at the moment,” Mourinho said. \nHeading into the weekend, Mourinho has conceded the title to runaway leaders Manchester City for the first time, adding United must now strive to be “first of the last” this season. \nUnited are in second place, 15 points behind City with 13 matches left. \n“The game is important because we need points to be the first of the last. We have to try to finish second,” he said. \n“We are better than last season in every aspect -- points, position, number of goals scored, conceded -- so we have to try to stay there.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T18:08:15.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
