That airport is being expanded and plans call for it eventually to be even bigger than Dubai International.\nDubai International operated with one runway for 80 days in 2014 because of upgrade and repair work on both its runways. That closure cost the Emirates Group an estimated $467 million in lost revenue, according to its financial statements.\nThe airport has projected a 2.4 percent increase in passengers this year to 90.3 million.
