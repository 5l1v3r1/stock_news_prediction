Energy Fuels spokesman Curtis Moore said the company is considering restarting the La Sal complex because of its vanadium resources, which are currently more valuable.\n“We are evaluating the potential,” he told Reuters by email.\nThe Interior Department has placed both vanadium and uranium on a draft list of “critical minerals” deemed important for national security and which should be produced in higher quantities in the United States.\nVanadium is used in jet engines, steel and increasingly in high-capacity batteries used for renewable energy storage. Uranium is mainly used in nuclear power.\nThe idled Daneros mine had applied to the Bureau of Land Management for an expansion in July 2016. Ore from that mine would have been transported through the former Bears Ears monument to Energy Fuels’ mill near Blanding, on the former monument’s western border.\nEnergy Fuels sent a letter to the Interior Department last year requesting that the monument be reduced to accommodate its operations. But the company said the Daneros mine is now unlikely to restart without a major market shift.\n“In order to restart mining at the Daneros Project, we’ll need higher uranium prices,” Moore said.\nReporting By Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T02:15:37.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
