A photo of the British embassy worker, Rebecca Dykes, is seen during a candlelight sit-in organised by activists in Beirut, Lebanon December 23, 2017. REUTERS/Isam Abdallah \nBraidi called for Houshieh to face the death penalty. Lebanese investigative judges routinely call for death sentences in cases of murder, but the country has an unofficial moratorium and has not carried one out since 2004, according to the monitoring group Human Rights Watch. \nA memorial service for Dykes was held in Beirut on Wednesday. Britain will award a scholarship under Dykes’ name each year to a Lebanese or Palestinian woman for a masters degree in Britain, the British embassy said. \nHer family has set up a charitable foundation to help refugees, with a particular focus on preventing violence against women.
