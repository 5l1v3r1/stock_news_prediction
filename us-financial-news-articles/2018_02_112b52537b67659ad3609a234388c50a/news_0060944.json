It also seeks punitive damages. \nRepresentatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They have previously denied similar allegations in other cases. \nOpioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths natiionwide in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nHundreds of lawsuits by states, counties and cities have accused drugmakers of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing and wholesale distributors of failing to report suspicious drug orders. \nDeWine previously in May 2017 sued Purdue Pharma LP, Endo International Plc, Johnson & Johnson, Allergan Plc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd , accusing them of deceptively marketing opioids. They have denied wrongdoing. \nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T22:23:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
