When Donald Trump’s candidacy gained strength, Romney urged Republicans not to support him, an effort that fizzled as the New York real estate magnate went on to win the nomination and the November election.\nTrump had considered Romney for the position of U.S. secretary of state, but picked oil executive Rex Tillerson instead.\nThe president had urged incumbent Republican Senator Orrin Hatch to run for re-election in Utah, but Hatch opted not to do so, opening the door to Romney’s candidacy.\nRomney, a wealthy former governor of Massachusetts, has homes in Utah and California.\nAdditional reporting by Eric Walsh in Washington; Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T03:27:09.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
