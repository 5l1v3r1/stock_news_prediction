(OTCMKTS:DATI), a specialized tech accelerator leveraging the Public Accelerator-Incubator (PAI) model, announced today that the Company is in talks to acquire a strategic stake in a SEC registered and FINRA member, crowdfunding portal, where both accredited and non-accredited investors can invest in high-growth high-tech startup businesses.\n“Several meetings with a number of companies and investors in the blockchain / crypto space, caused us to rethink the ‘why’ in our pursuit of aligning DATI with a FINRA approved crowd funding portal; then to justify those means with the ‘how,’” said Digital Arts Media Network CEO, Ajene Watson. “I had to look no further than the recent success of StartEngine, which is a fairly young accelerator co-founded by Howard Marks (founder of Activision Games).\n\"StartEngine has raised approximately $35M for their clients, currently has an estimated valuation of approximately $65M dollars and leverages both Regulation D and Regulation A+. Most important for us however, is that StartEngine also seems to leverage Regulation CF; just like the portal we have targeted to acquire a stake in. This portal will give us the framework to truly offer end-to-end services to those startup and early-stage companies seeking traditional but accelerated capital formation, and/or, that wish to fully and legitimately leverage the ‘crypto’ market space.”\nDATI and the targeted company have been in discussions regarding this acquisition since just before the new year [2018]. This crowd funding portal has seen an increase in ‘new issuers’ [prospective clients] needing financial assistance to effectively develop a Regulation CF compliant offering. DATI believes that the timing is critical as the targeted company has also seen a rise of ‘new issuers’ seeking to leverage the emerging crypto markets – TGE and ICO (Token Generated Events and Initial Coin Offerings) – and are turning to regulated crowd funding platforms to assist with securing the capital required to pursue these endeavors.\nDigital Arts Media Network believes that its Public Accelerator-Incubator (PAI) model, aligned with a crowdfunding portal, will firmly position DATI to assist a startup and early-stage company, that is properly organized and operated, with their development needs. The acquisition of a crowd funding portal, especially one already in the line of sight of the startup and crypto communities, is a perfect way for DATI to achieve a competitive advantage.\nMr. Watson concluded, “The acquisition of the initial equity stake will be made as part of our Invest+ program. We will likely also have the opportunity to incorporate Angels+ to bring additional operational capital to the crowdfunding portal after the transaction is completed. I strongly believe this portal will become a centerpiece of our business model – in how we onboard and initially fund companies, market and test a company’s market acceptance and support the launch of properly developed blockchain and crypto related companies and projects.”\nABOUT Digital Arts Media Network, Inc.\nDigital Arts Media Network, Inc. (OTCMKTS:DATI) is the first company to utilize the Public Accelerator-Incubator (PAI) model, with the intent to follow the global success of accelerators and incubators around the world, adding niche opportunities to both the microcap and startup communities. As a PAI, Digital Arts Media Network will develop and acquire innovations that solve problems through digital platforms and other electronic applications.\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DigitalArtsDATI\nLinkedIn: https:// www.linkedin.com/in/digital-arts-media-network\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DigitalArtsMediaNetworkDATI/\nMedium: https://medium.com/@DigArtsMedNet\nForward Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute \"forward-looking statements.\" Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other unknown factors that could cause the Company's actual operating results to be materially different from any historical results or from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
