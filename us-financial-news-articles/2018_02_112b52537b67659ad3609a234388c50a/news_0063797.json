New York Community Bank had no immediate comment.\nLast year Kushner resigned from Kushner Cos and sold his stake to a family trust as part of an effort to avoid conflicts of interests in his White House role. The private real estate company owns or partially owns buildings in New York and New Jersey.\nKushner, who had a broad portfolio in the White House, including leading Middle East peace negotiations and an effort to modernize and reduce the size of some government programs, lost his interim top-secret security clearance, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\nKushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, has not received his full security clearance because of his extensive financial links, which have taken a long time to examine, officials said.\nHis lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement on Tuesday that Kushner “has done more than what is expected of him in this process.”\nReporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Bill Rigby and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T20:53:55.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
