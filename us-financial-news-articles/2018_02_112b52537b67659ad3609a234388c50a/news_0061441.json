Net sales for the full year 2016 were $656.3 million. Net sales during 2017 were unfavorably impacted by $1.0 million as a result of currency fluctuations, including a weaker Renminbi partially offset by a stronger Euro.\nEarnings for full year 2017 were $4.34 per diluted share, compared to $2.65 per diluted share for full year 2016. On an adjusted basis, earnings were $5.76 per diluted share, compared to $3.72 for full year 2016.\nFull year 2017 net income was $80.5 million, compared to $48.3 million for full year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $189.7 million for full year 2017, versus $130.1 million for full year 2016.\nGross margin was 38.8% in 2017, compared to 38.0% in 2016. Operating margin was 15.9% for full year 2017, compared to 12.8% in the full year of 2016. Adjusted operating margin was 18.5% in the full year of 2017, compared to 15.2% in the full year of 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017\nThe Company reported 2017 fourth quarter net sales of $209.0 million, which were within the Company's previously announced guidance of $200 to $210 million, compared to 2016 fourth quarter net sales of $173.0 million. Currency exchange rates favorably impacted 2017 fourth quarter net sales by $4.5 million due to strengthening in the Euro and Renminbi.\nEarnings for the 2017 fourth quarter were $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $0.65 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings per diluted share were below the Company's guidance range of $1.18 to $1.28. On an adjusted basis, earnings were $1.36 per diluted share, compared to adjusted earnings of $0.94 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings were within the Company's guidance of $1.35 to $1.45 per diluted share.\nFourth quarter 2017 net income was $7.0 million, compared to $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $38.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $32.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross margin was 36.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 38.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Adjusted operating margin was 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 14.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\"In 2017, Rogers set full-year performance records for both revenue and profitability, successfully achieving strong growth across all of our business segments,” stated Bruce D. Hoechner, Rogers' President and CEO. “Our robust revenue growth continued in Q4, although we did have temporary operating challenges during the quarter that are being addressed. We are optimistic about the outlook for 2018 given Rogers' strong leadership position in our core markets and our ability to execute.\"\nBusiness segment discussion\nAdvanced Connectivity Solutions (ACS)\nAdvanced Connectivity Solutions reported 2017 fourth quarter net sales of $75.5 million, a 5.3% increase compared to 2016 fourth quarter net sales of $71.7 million. The increase in 2017 fourth quarter net sales was largely driven by growth in high frequency circuit materials for automotive advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and portable electronics, partially offset by lower demand for wireless 4G LTE applications. Fourth quarter 2017 net sales were favorably impacted by $0.7 million due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nElastomeric Material Solutions (EMS)\nElastomeric Material Solutions reported 2017 fourth quarter net sales of $76.0 million, a 34.0% increase compared to 2016 fourth quarter net sales of $56.7 million. The 2017 fourth quarter included a $13.5 million increase in net sales from recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, EMS net sales increased $5.9 million, or 10.4%, on higher demand across all segments, with particularly strong growth in portable electronics and automotive applications including electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates favorably impacted net sales by $0.8 million in the 2017 fourth quarter.\nPower Electronics Solutions (PES)\nPower Electronics Solutions reported 2017 fourth quarter net sales of $52.0 million, a 33.4% increase compared to 2016 fourth quarter net sales of $39.0 million. The 2017 fourth quarter increase was due to broad based demand across markets, including renewable energy, electric and hybrid electric vehicles, variable frequency motor drives and laser diode coolers. Fourth quarter 2017 net sales were favorably impacted by $3.2 million due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOther\nOther reported 2017 fourth quarter net sales of $5.5 million, down $0.1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 sales of $5.6 million.\nBalance sheet and other highlights\nCash position\nRogers ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $181.2 million, a decrease of $46.6 million from $227.8 million at December 31, 2016. The primary drivers of the lower cash balance were debt and long-term lease payments of approximately $110.7 million in 2017, and an acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2017 for approximately $60.2 million, partially offset by net cash provided from operating activities of $139.0 million.\nCash flow\nNet cash provided from operating activities was $139.0 million in 2017, an increase compared to $117.0 million in 2016. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by higher 2017 net income partially offset by an increase in working capital due to growth. Capital spending was $27.2 million in 2017, an increase compared to $18.1 million in 2016.\nEffective tax rate\nRogers' effective tax rate for 2017 was 39.5%, including the impact of tax reform in the United States (U.S. Tax Reform), compared to 41.3% in 2016. The 2017 rate decrease was primarily due to lower foreign tax impact on remitted and unremitted foreign earnings and profits, equity compensation excess tax deductions recognized in 2017 and increased international tax rate benefits due to earnings mix. This was substantially offset by our provisional estimate of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, a decrease in reversal of reserves associated with uncertain tax positions and a change in valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets that are capital in nature. Excluding the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, our effective tax rate for 2017 was 29.2%.\nFinancial outlook\nRogers guides its 2018 first quarter net sales to a range of $208 to $218 million. Rogers guides its 2018 first quarter earnings to a range of $1.15 to $1.30 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings are guided to a range of $1.30 to $1.45 per diluted share.\nRogers is in the process of reviewing the full impact of U.S. Tax Reform and the impact it will have on the Company's ongoing tax rate. Currently, based on the information available and analysis performed to date, Rogers guides its 2018 first quarter normalized effective tax rate to be approximately 28-30%.\nFor the full year 2018, Rogers expects capital expenditures to be in a range of $50 to $60 million.\nAbout Rogers Corporation\nRogers Corporation (NYSE:ROG) is a global leader in engineered materials to power, protect, and connect our world.

and\n(3) Adjusted operating margin, which the Company defines as operating margin excluding acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets and Discrete Items.\nManagement believes each of these measures is useful to investors because they allow for comparison to the Company’s performance in prior periods without the effect of items that, by their nature, tend to obscure the Company’s core operating results due to the potential variability across periods based on the timing, frequency and magnitude. As a result, management believes that adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating margin enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in the Company’s business and evaluate the Company’s performance relative to peer companies. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or solely as alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are set forth below.\nReconciliation of GAAP earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year:\n2017 2016 Earnings per diluted share Q4 YTD Q4 YTD GAAP earnings per diluted share $ 0.37 $ 4.34 $ 0.65 $ 2.65 Restructuring, severance, impairment and other related costs 0.03 0.13 0.02 0.04 Acquisition and related integration costs 0.02 0.11 0.12 0.13 Tax expense primarily related to U.S. tax reform 0.69 0.69 — — Tax expense related to repatriation of earnings from prior years — — — 0.49 Asbestos-related charges 0.12 0.12 — — Environmental accrual adjustment — — — (0.03 ) Purchase accounting inventory adjustment — 0.05 0.03 0.03 Loss (gain) on sale of long-lived assets — (0.19 ) — 0.01 Total discrete items $ 0.86 $ 0.91 $ 0.17 $ 0.67 Earnings per diluted share adjusted for discrete items $ 1.23 $ 5.25 $ 0.82 $ 3.32 Acquisition intangible amortization 0.13 0.51 0.12 0.40 Adjusted earnings per diluted share $ 1.36 $ 5.76 $ 0.94 $ 3.72\nReconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and full year*:\n2017 2016 (amounts in millions) Q4 YTD Q4 YTD Net income $ 7.0 $ 80.5 $ 11.9 $ 48.3 Interest expense, net 1.3 6.1 0.9 3.9 Income tax expense 13.5 52.5 4.8 34.0 Depreciation 7.6 29.3 7.0 26.6 Amortization 3.8 14.8 3.2 11.2 Tax items — — — 0.8 Environmental accrual adjustment — — — (0.9 ) Restructuring, severance, impairment and other related costs 0.8 3.6 0.6 1.3 Acquisition and related integration costs 0.7 3.2 3.4 3.8 Asbestos-related charges 3.4 3.4 — — Loss (gain) on sale of long-lived assets — (5.3 ) — 0.2 Purchase accounting inventory adjustment — 1.6 0.9 0.9 Adjusted EBITDA $ 38.1 $ 189.7 $ 32.7 $ 130.1 *Values in table may not add due to rounding.\nReconciliation of GAAP operating margin to adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter and full year*:\n2017 2016 Operating margin Q4 YTD Q4 YTD GAAP operating margin 9.1% 15.9% 10.3% 12.8% Environmental accrual adjustment —% —% —% (0.1)% Restructuring, severance, impairment and other related costs 0.4% 0.4% 0.3% 0.2% Acquisition and related integration costs 0.3% 0.4% 2.0% 0.6% Asbestos-related charges 1.6% 0.4% —% —% Loss (gain) on sale of long-lived assets —% (0.6)% —% —% Purchase accounting inventory adjustment —% 0.2% 0.5% 0.1% Total discrete Items 2.3% 0.8% 2.8% 0.8% Operating margin adjusted for discrete items 11.4% 16.7% 13.1% 13.6% Acquisition intangible amortization 1.8% 1.8% 1.7% 1.6% Adjusted operating margin 13.2% 18.5% 14.8% 15.2% *Percentages in table may not add due to rounding.\nReconciliation of GAAP earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance for the 2017 fourth quarter:\nGuidance\nQ4 2017\nGAAP earnings per diluted share $1.18 - $1.28 Discrete items $0.04 Acquisition intangible amortization $0.13 Adjusted earnings per diluted share $1.35 - $1.45\nReconciliation of GAAP earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance for the 2018 first quarter:\nGuidance\nQ1 2018 GAAP earnings per diluted share $1.15 - $1.30 Discrete items $0.01 Acquisition intangible amortization $0.14 Adjusted earnings per diluted share $1.30 - $1.45\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180227006384/en/\nRogers Corporation\nJack Monti, 480-917-6026\njack.monti@rogerscorp.com\nhttp://www.rogerscorp.com\nSource: Rogers Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rogerscorp.com%2Fir&esheet=51765492&newsitemid=20180227006384&lan=en-US&anchor=www.rogerscorp.com%2Fir&index=2&md5=4dd76426efe1e0d66183b58a76be31e4", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rogerscorp.com%2F&esheet=51765492&newsitemid=20180227006384&lan=en-US&anchor=Rogers+Corporation&index=1&md5=e5310a18586f61c7472e965f10d878bc", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180227006384/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rogerscorp.com&esheet=51765492&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rogerscorp.com&index=3&md5=48c9e3e7a767af977d13ab9f7bd8629a"], "published": "2018-02-28T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:54:43.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
