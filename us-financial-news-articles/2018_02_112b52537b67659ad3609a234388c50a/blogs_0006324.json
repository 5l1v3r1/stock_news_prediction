Apple revealed the number in its earnings report, which just crossed the wire. \nWall Street was looking for 80 million iPhones sold for the quarter, according to a FactSet consensus estimate. A year ago, Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones during the quarter. \nThis is the first report to include iPhone X sales in the overall figure, since pre-orders for the device opened in late October and the phone hit store shelves on November 3. Apple did not break down the number of iPhone X units it sold versus other models, however.
