Current rents average $1,043 per month, and the complex is currently 96% occupied.\nThe community’s amenities include a swimming pool, clubhouse, business center, fitness center, grilling and picnic areas, car-care center, and detached and attached garage parking. Each apartment home features central air conditioning and heat, vaulted ceilings, fully equipped kitchens, walk-in closets, and washer/dryer hook-ups.\nRK Properties is implementing an improved marketing and value-add campaign to reposition the Property with improved rents and management. The Company will immediately implement interior upgrades including faux hardwood flooring, stainless steel appliance packages, new finishes, and washers and dryers in all units. It believes these upgrades will justify average rent increases of $75 to $125 per month, depending on unit sizes. Planned exterior building enhancements include the pool area, fitness center and office upgrades, and roof replacement.\nRK Properties has been successful in upgrading units in this manner at other RK-owned and operated assets in similar submarkets, and intends to follow the same successful formula of high quality components and attention to detail to achieve optimum rent premiums at the Property.\nRK Properties has a 40-plus year track record, dating back to 1976, in the multifamily apartment market. To date, the Company has purchased and managed over $1.5 billion in assets across the country.\nPress contacts: Steve King RK Properties 562-240-1023 steve@rkprop.com\nSource:RK Properties", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c7ec77be-3fa9-4a97-a848-57bcfee7d2c9", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sIE2ur5_lSDAw7a0A1SCUztQPCH-v6C6XuvX8NS9GpBoU5t-OmYE83kRJq2gWAXV32q42GrC74mrxiN7McBXQw=="], "published": "2018-02-06T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T16:45:42.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
