REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo \nRussia’s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday it was very disappointed by the content of the document, which, it said, has a confrontational feel and anti-Russian orientation. \nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the U.S. decision showed “the spiral of a new nuclear arms race is already under way” and added that Europe was, much like during the Cold War, especially vulnerable. \n“That’s why we need to start new initiatives in Europe for arms control and disarmament,” Gabriel said in a statement, adding that developing new weapons sent the wrong message and risked triggering an arms race. \nZarif also said in his tweet: “(U.S. President Donald)Trump’s obduracy in killing the #JCPOA (Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers) stems from the same dangerous imprudence”. \nTrump gave the Iran nuclear deal, negotiated before he took office, a final reprieve last month but warned European allies and Congress they had to work with him to fix “the disastrous flaws” in the pact or face a U.S. exit. \nHe said he would waive sanctions against Iran that were lifted as part of the international deal for the last time unless his conditions were met. \nThe ultimatum put pressure on European Union powers - key backers and parties to the 2015 international agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear programme – to satisfy Trump, who wants the pact strengthened with a separate agreement.
