(Nasdaq: HMST) (\"HomeStreet\", the \"Company\" or the \"Bank\"), today announced that it intends to nominate two highly qualified candidates for election to the HomeStreet Board of Directors (the \"Board\") and make two substantive corporate governance proposals at the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nCharles W. Griege, Jr, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of BLC, said, \"We have always believed that HomeStreet has tremendous potential to generate significant value for shareholders and the communities it serves. Unfortunately, numerous strategic missteps, inadequate corporate stewardship, and poor financial performance have eroded shareholder confidence, destroyed shareholder value and hurt the Bank's ability to serve its customers.\"\nHomeStreet has the lowest price-to-tangible book value multiple among its peers and regularly underperforms those peers on virtually every key operating metric, as BLC demonstrated in its presentation to the HomeStreet Board (available here: https://tinyurl.com/y8mpemcw ) on December 21, 2017. This poor performance is not new: over the five years ending December 31, 2017, the total return for shareholders was 16%, significantly lower than the performance of its banking peers, the bank indices and the broader market as a whole.\nBLC believes that HomeStreet will continue on its suboptimal strategic path without improved Board oversight and significant participation from independent board members acting as strong advocates for shareholders. BLC firmly believes that the Company, given the right leadership and governance structure, can generate substantial and lasting value for shareholders.\nBLC was founded in 2005 and invests in undervalued securities with asymmetric risk/reward profiles. In its 12-year history, BLC has never publicly campaigned for change at any of its portfolio investments. BLC is neither an activist investor nor a shareholder with a short-term orientation. To the contrary, BLC is a committed, long-standing investor that first invested in HomeStreet during the Bank's initial public offering because of the Company's differentiated business opportunities.\nOver the course of this past year, in a determined effort to encourage positive changes, BLC has initiated multiple conversations with the Company's management and the Board with the hopes that a costly proxy contest could be avoided.\n\"Unfortunately, our desire to reach an amicable resolution that is in the best interests of all HomeStreet shareholders has not been embraced equally by the Company,\" Mr. Griege continued. \"Like many other HomeStreet shareholders, we believe that the Board bears ultimate responsibility for the Bank's long-running underperformance. In our opinion, the Board, as currently composed, is either unable or unwilling to take the meaningful corrective actions necessary to implement a cost-conscious and thoughtful competitive strategy. In our view, this Board has failed shareholders. And despite our best efforts to drive positive change through an engaged, constructive dialogue, we have thus far been unsuccessful from outside the boardroom.\"\nAccordingly, BLC is nominating two independent director candidates who will bring the fresh perspective needed to help generate long-term sustainable value for all shareholders.\nBLC also believes that HomeStreet's corporate governance structure has reduced management's accountability to the Board and the Board's accountability to shareholders. Accordingly, BLC intends to propose a binding change to the Company's bylaws that would require that the roles of Chairman and CEO be separate. Today, HomeStreet's bylaws permit one person to serve in both capacities. BLC believes that one person with the combined role of Chairman and CEO diminishes the CEO's accountability to the Board and the ability of the Board to independently oversee management.\nBLC will also propose that the Board take the steps necessary to declassify the Board, so that all directors are elected each year. BLC believes that one-year director terms increase the Board's accountability to shareholders.\nBLC's nominees are:\nRonald Tanemura . Mr. Tanemura is presently a private investor. Since March 2012, Mr. Tanemura has served as a director of post-reorganization Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and, since March 2011, as a director of TPG Specialty Lending, Inc., an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act.
