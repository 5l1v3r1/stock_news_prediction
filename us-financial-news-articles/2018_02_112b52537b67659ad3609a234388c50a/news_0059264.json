You’re welcome here any time,” Virginia Governor, Democrat Ralph Northam, wrote on Twitter to his 125,000 followers.\nDelta did not respond to requests for comment.\nOn Monday, Georgia Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, a Republican, wrote on Twitter he would “kill any tax legislation” that benefits Delta, unless the carrier reinstated its relationship with the NRA, which advocates for the Second Amendment right for Americans to bear arms. [nL2N1QG1RM]\n“Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Cagle wrote.\nDelta is one of Georgia’s largest private employers with 33,000 employees statewide.\nThe Georgia legislator is considering a jet fuel sales tax exemption designed to benefit Delta that would save the airline some $40 million per year.\nCagle is running for governor in the 2018 race, and rival Republicans in the race have said they will not support the measure unless Delta reinstates its relationship with the NRA.\nThe NRA has been under renewed fire since the Feb. 14 massacre of 17 students and educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, by a gunman with a legally purchased semiautomatic rifle reignited the nation’s long-running debate over gun rights. [nL2N1QG18N]\nMore than a dozen corporations have cut ties with the NRA since last week, including rival United Airlines, car rental companies Enterprise Rent-A-Car and Alamo Rent a Car, MetLife insurance and others. [nL4N1QG3WY]\nGovernor of New York Andrew Cuomo and the Lieutenant Governor Cyrus Habib of Washington also extended welcomes to Delta to relocate to their respective states.\n“While Georgia politicians may disagree with the airline’s principled stand, we here in the Empire State welcome Delta with open arms, and invite them to move their headquarters here,” Cuomo said in a Tuesday statement.\nThe NRA did not comment.\nReporting by Alana Wise; Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:20:50.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
