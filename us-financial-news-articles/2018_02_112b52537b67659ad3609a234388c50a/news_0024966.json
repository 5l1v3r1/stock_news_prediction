If there is culture, knowledge and hygiene, then our prosperous live can resolve these difficulties and then how can there be any ghosts?” Xi added. \nThe Yi, who speak a language distantly related to Burmese and have their own unique script, are one of China’s 55 officially recognised minority peoples. \nThe official Xinhua news agency and state television showed pictures of Xi inspecting dried meats, chatting with villagers wearing colourful traditional costumes and being shown housing improvement projects. \nAt one point, Xi was given a traditional white Yi cloak to wear, which he put on his shoulders over a thick green padded jacket. \nXi will likely make visits to other parts of the country ahead of and possibly during the holiday.
