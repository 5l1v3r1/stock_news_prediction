Bayer’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at 1.78 billion euros (1.57 billion pounds) for the quarter, slightly lower than the average forecast by analysts of 1.8 billion euros. It said 2018 adjusted EBITDA would be at the prior-year level, held back by a burden of about 300 million euros from a warning letter by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
