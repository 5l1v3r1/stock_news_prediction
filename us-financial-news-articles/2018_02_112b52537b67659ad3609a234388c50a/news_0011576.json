The Dalai Lama fled into exile in India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, though the Nobel Peace Prize winning monk says he simply seeks genuine autonomy for his Himalayan homeland.\n\"We will promptly take steps to deepen our understanding of Chinese culture and values, our international staff included, to help standardize our actions to ensure this sort of issue doesn't happen again,\" the Daimler -owned company said in the statement.\nForeign brands in China are trying to court Chinese shoppers who have growing purchasing power, but consumers and regulators are increasingly willing to challenge brands over actions that go against what Beijing deems appropriate.\nLast month, firms including Delta Air Lines and Spanish apparel maker Zara were reprimanded by authorities for listing Taiwan and Tibet as countries on their websites. China claims sovereignty over both areas.\nMarriott International had its website in China shut down by regulators after it caused a similar uproar, inviting boycotts from Chinese consumers.\nChina is the biggest overseas market for many international brands and the government is pivoting to a new economic growth model that is driven more by consumption rather than manufacturing and investment.\nâ€”CNBC contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T05:40:05.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
