The appointment was made during the 13th General Assembly of the RSPO, in Bangkok, in November 2016, and he replaced Marcello Brito, General Manager of Agropalma, Brazil.\nMontenegro has had a long and active participation in the RSPO working groups, mainly in the Emissions Reduction Working Group (RED Task Force) and has successfully led the RSPO certification of Agrocaribe in Guatemala. In addition, Jose Roberto is Co-Chairman of the RSPO Consultative Group for Latin America - CGLA, representing the Latin American producers.\nThe RSPO Directory is composed of a Board of Governors made up of 16 members; four of them represent the palm oil sector, and of these four, two are from Indonesia and Malaysia, one is from the small productive sector and the other position represents the \"rest of the world,\" which Mr. Montenegro is occupying. These positions are appointed by the General Assembly.\nThe Board of Governors is responsible for the overall management of the RSPO, in collaboration with the CEO of the organization. In addition, it works together with the staff of the Secretariat to discuss the activities of the association, monitor their quality and financial viability. The members of the Board of Governors are elected for a two year period.\nThe Guatemalan palm oil company Agrocaribe , which Mr. Montenegro represents, was the first palm oil company in Central America to be RSPO certified, the fifth at the Latin American level and the fourth in the world to be RSPO certified with the Identity Preserved (IP) model, which guarantees full traceability from the seed to shipment.\n\"Since its beginning in 1997, Agrocaribe focused on sustainable palm oil production in Guatemala, which is why in 2010 we became the first palm oil company in the world to obtain Rainforest Alliance certification, and in 2011, the first one to obtain the Business Alliance for Secure Commerce (BASC) certification,\" said Montenegro.\nMore info about Agrocaribe:\n(502) 2207-3000\nVÃ­a 5, 4-50 Zona 4, Edificio Maya Of. 409, Guatemala\nwww.agrocaribe.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-general-manager-of-agrocaribe-in-guatemala-has-been-elected-as-a-member-of-the-board-of-governors-of-the-international-organization-roundtable-on-sustainable-palm-oil---rspo-300596630.html\nSOURCE Agrocaribe", "external_links": ["http://www.agrocaribe.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-general-manager-of-agrocaribe-in-guatemala-has-been-elected-as-a-member-of-the-board-of-governors-of-the-international-organization-roundtable-on-sustainable-palm-oil---rspo-300596630.html", "http://www.rspo.org/about/who-we-are/board-of-governors"], "published": "2018-02-12T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T19:17:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
