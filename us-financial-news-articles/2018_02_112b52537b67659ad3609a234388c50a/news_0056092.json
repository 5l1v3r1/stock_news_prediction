The approval was expected after a panel recommended it last month. The drug was already approved in the United States last year. Hemlibra is among the new medicines that the Basel-based pharmaceuticals maker hopes will offset falling sales of its three biggest drugs, Rituxan, Avastin and Herceptin. Some analysts expect peak Hemlibra sales of more than $4 billion a year. ‍​", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T19:58:31.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
