REUTERS/Charlie Saceda But Duterte warned that may not be the case for much longer because of what he said were piles of uncollected garbage just 20-25 meters from the beach and sewage flowing into the sea.\n“You created a disaster there,” Duterte said in a speech on Cebu, another central island.\nDuterte said he was holding the local government and Boracay residents responsible for being “overzealous” with development, allowing structures to be built up to the beach without proper sewage and water treatment facilities.\n“I will charge you for serious neglect of duty making Boracay a fishpond or a sewer pool,” he said. “There will be a time that no more foreigners will go there.”\nReporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T12:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T13:10:44.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
