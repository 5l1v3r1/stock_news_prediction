(OTCQX: LTRE) announced today its revenues and results of operations for its first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which ended December 29, 2017.\nIn its first quarter of fiscal year 2018, Learning Tree reported revenues of $17.2 million, income from operations of $0.3 million, and a net income of $0.4 million, or $0.03 per share. These results compare with revenues of $18.6 million, loss from operations of $(0.5) million, and net loss of $(0.4) million, or $(0.03) per share, in Learning Tree’s first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 include restructuring charges totaling $0.3 million related to our Toronto and Reston facilities. The 7.3% decline in revenues for our first quarter of fiscal year 2018 when compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, was offset by a 14.1% reduction in cost of revenues. Total operating expenses decreased 8.1% quarter over quarter, from $8.5 million to $7.8 million.
