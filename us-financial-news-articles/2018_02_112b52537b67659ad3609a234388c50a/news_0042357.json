REUTERS/Etienne Laurent/Pool Macron did not specify which investments he was referring to but French farming groups and media have cited Chinese fuel services group Hongyang as the buyer of the land acquired in 2016 and 2017.\nThe previous government of Francois Hollande tried to increase oversight of land sales after the first of the cropland deals in 2016 showed a loophole in vetting of farmland sales, but the move was blocked by France’s constitutional court.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Hongyang could not be immediately reached for comment.\nMacron said access to land for young French farmers was a vital issue as the country faced the prospect of 40 percent of today’s farmers retiring by 2020.\nThe president organized Thursday’s reception in a gesture to the farming world ahead of the annual Paris farm show this weekend, and as the government faces discontent among farmers over issues including trade talks with South American countries.\nReporting by Gus Trompiz and Marine Pennetier, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:06:11.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
