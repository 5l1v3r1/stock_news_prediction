If these issues become central in the election campaign, we can expect attempts at Russian influence.”\nStenling declined to say if his force had already seen evidence of such attempts.\nRussia - which has faced accusations of trying to affect the outcome of voting in the United States, France and Germany - has repeatedly denied meddling in elections in the West.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin attends a wreath laying ceremony during an event to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the battle of Stalingrad in World War Two, at the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex in the city of Volgograd, Russia February 2, 2018.

The Kremlin has warned of unspecified consequences if it did.\nThe Social Democrats, the senior party in the current minority coalition government, have ruled out joining NATO.\nThe security service said Sweden’s decentralized, manual electoral system was difficult to manipulate, but the use of fake social media accounts and distribution of inaccurate news were also channels that could be used to influence opinion.\nPrime Minister Stefan Lofven has, along with many European colleagues, previously voiced concerns about possible foreign meddling and Sweden has set up a“psychological defense” agency.\nReporting by Johan Ahlander; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T18:31:23.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
