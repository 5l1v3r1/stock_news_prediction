These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at exchange rates as of January 31, 2018. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound (£) of $1.42 to £1 and for the euro (€) of $1.25 to €1.\nMoody’s expects full year 2018 revenue to increase in the low-double-digit percent range.

Both ranges include an approximate $0.65 benefit resulting from U.S. tax reform, as well as an estimated $0.20 benefit related to the tax accounting for equity compensation, in line with the benefit recognized in 2017. The majority of the latter benefit is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2018.\nFree cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion.

Management believes that such adjusted financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company's performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors' operating results and provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These adjusted measures, as defined by the Company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. Furthermore, these adjusted measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other GAAP measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the Company.\nTable 8 - Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin\nThe Company presents Adjusted Operating Income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of Moody’s. Adjusted Operating Income excludes depreciation and amortization, Acquisition-Related Expenses, restructuring and the Settlement Charge. Depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets. Acquisition-Related Expenses consist of expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk and are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multi-year integration effort. Acquisition related expenses from previous acquisitions were not material. Restructuring charges are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies. The Settlement Charge is a material non-recurring event that is not expected to recur in the future at this magnitude. Management believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, Acquisition-Related Expenses, restructuring and the Settlement Charge, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the Company’s operating results from period to period and across companies. The Company defines Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted Operating Income divided by revenue.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating income (loss) $ 462.8 $ (473.1 ) $ 1,809.1 $ 638.7 Restructuring - - - 12.0 Depreciation & amortization 49.9 32.9 158.3 126.7 Acquisition-Related Expenses 5.8 -\n22.5 - Settlement Charge - 863.8 - 863.8 Adjusted operating income $ 518.5 $ 423.6 $ 1,989.9 $ 1,641.2 Operating margin 39.7 % (50.2 %) 43.0 % 17.7 % Adjusted operating margin 44.5 % 45.0 % 47.3 % 45.5 %\nTable 9 - Adjusted Operating Expenses\nThe Company presents adjusted operating expense because management deems this metric to be a useful additional measure of assessing period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operating expenses.

The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow is a useful metric in assessing the Company’s cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Management deems capital expenditures essential to the Company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of Moody’s operational capabilities. Accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of Moody’s cash flow.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 747.5 $ 1,259.2 Capital expenditures (90.6 ) (115.2 ) Free cash flow $ 656.9 $ 1,144.0 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (3,420.0 ) $ 102.0 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 1,607.2 $ (1,042.9 )\nTable 11 - Organic Revenue and Growth Measures\nThe Company presents the organic revenue and growth for the MA segment and RD&A LOB because management deems this metric to be a useful measure which provides additional perspective in assessing the revenue growth of the Company's MA segment and RD&A LOB excluding the revenue impacts from Bureau van Dijk, a material acquisition. The organic revenue and growth for MA in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 also exclude two months of revenue from GGY, which was acquired in March 2016. The Company calculates organic revenue and growth by excluding from the fourth quarter and full year $62 million and $92 million, respectively, in revenue from Bureau van Dijk (which is net of a $22 million and $36 million reduction, respectively, to revenue due to a $52 million fair value adjustment, as part of acquisition accounting, to acquired deferred revenue) from the global MA revenue and RD&A revenue.

Management believes that the exclusion of these items, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the Company’s effective tax rate from period to period and across companies.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, Amounts in millions 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Income before provision for income taxes $ 407.7 $ (465.5 ) $ 873.2 $ 1,786.8 $ 558.0 $ 1,228.8 Settlement Charge - 863.8 (863.8 ) - 863.8 (863.8 ) Adjusted Income before provision for income taxes 407.7 398.3 9.4 1,786.8 1,421.8 365.0 Provision for income taxes $ 379.2 $ (40.0 ) $ 419.2 $ 779.1 $ 282.2 $ 496.9 Transition tax related to U.S. tax reform (1) (247.3 ) - (247.3 ) (247.3 ) - (247.3 ) Net Impact of U.S./European tax rate changes on deferred taxes (1) 1.7 - 1.7 1.7 - 1.7 Tax Impact on Settlement Charge - 163.1 (163.1 ) - 163.1 (163.1 ) Total Impact (245.6 ) 163.1 (408.7 ) (245.6 ) 163.1 (408.7 ) Adjusted Provision for income taxes $ 133.6 $ 123.1 $ 10.5 $ 533.5 $ 445.3 $ 88.2 Effective tax rate-GAAP 93.0 % 8.6 % 43.6 % 50.6 % Transition tax related to U.S. tax reform (1) (60.6\n%) - (13.8 %) - Net Impact of U.S./European tax rate change on deferred taxes (1) 0.4 % - 0.1 % - Tax Impact on Settlement Charge 22.3 % (19.3 %) Total Impact (60.2 %) 22.3 % (13.7 %) (19.3 %) Effective tax rate adjusted 32.8 % 30.9 % 29.9 % 31.3 % (1) The U.S. impacts are pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted into law in December 2017 and the change in Europe relates to a lower prospective statutory tax rate in Belgium.\nTable 13 - Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS Attributable to Moody's Common Shareholders\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2017, the Company modified this adjusted measure to exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different ages and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies. Also, management believes that excluding acquisition-related amortization expense provides additional perspective when comparing operating results from period to period, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.\nFurthermore, U.S. tax reform as well as changes in tax laws in Europe were both enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in significant adjustments to the tax provision. The Company modified the adjusted measures to exclude these adjustments to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted EPS from period to period and across companies.\nIn addition to excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the effects of U.S. tax reform as well as changes in the tax laws in Europe, current and prior-year adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the CCXI Gain, the Purchase Price Hedge Gain, Acquisition-Related Expenses, restructuring charges and the Settlement Charge. The Company excludes these items to provide additional perspective on the Company’s operating results from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods. Additionally, the Acquisition-Related Expenses are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multi-year integration effort relating to Bureau van Dijk. Acquisition-Related Expenses from previous acquisitions were not material.\nBelow is a reconciliation of this measure to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP amount.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Amounts in millions 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income attributable to Moody's common shareholders $ 25.5 $ (428.6 ) $ 1,000.6 $ 266.6 Transition tax related to U.S. tax reform 247.3 - 247.3 - Net Impact of U.S./European tax change on deferred taxes (1.7 ) (1.7 ) CCXI Gain - - (59.7 ) - Pre-Tax Purchase Price Hedge Gain $ - $ - $ (111.1 ) $ - Tax on Purchase Price Hedge Gain - - 38.8 - Net Purchase Price Hedge Gain - (72.3 ) - Pre-Tax Acquisition-Related Expenses $ 5.8 $ - $ 22.5 $ - Tax on Acquisition-Related Expenses (2.0 ) - (3.6 ) - Net Acquisition-Related Expenses (1)\n3.8 - 18.9 - Pre-Tax Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expenses $ 25.5 $ 8.7 $ 61.4 $ 34.2 Tax on Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expenses (6.3 ) (2.5 ) (16.2 ) (9.8 ) Net Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expenses 19.2 6.2 45.2 24.4 FX gain on liquidation of a subsidiary - (34.8 ) - (34.8 ) Pre-Tax Restructuring - - - 12.0 Tax on Restructuring - - - (3.9 ) Net Restructuring - - - 8.1 Pre-Tax Settlement Charge $ - $ 863.8 $ - $ 863.8 Tax on Settlement Charge - (163.1 ) - (163.1 ) Net Settlement Charge - 700.7 - 700.7 Adjusted net income attributable to Moody's common shareholders $ 294.1 $ 243.5 $ 1,178.3 $ 965.0 (1) Certain Acquisition-Related Expenses are not deductible for tax.

These assumptions are subject to some degree of uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Moody’s guidance, which is presented in the table below, assumes foreign currency translation at exchange rates as of January 31, 2018. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound (£) of $1.42 to £1 and for the euro (€) of $1.25 to €1.\nFull Year 2018 Moody's Corporation Guidance as of February 9, 2018 MOODY'S CORPORATION Revenue increase in the low-double-digit percent range Operating expenses increase in the low-double-digit percent range Depreciation & amortization approximately $200 million Operating margin 43% - 44% Adjusted operating margin (1) approximately 48% Effective tax rate 22% - 23% Diluted EPS $7.20 to $7.40 Adjusted diluted EPS (1) $7.65 to $7.85 Capital expenditures approximately $120 million Operating cash flow approximately $1.7 billion Free cash flow (1) approximately $1.6 billion Share repurchases approximately $200 million (subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions) Full Year 2018 Moody's Corporation Guidance as of February 9, 2018 MIS MIS global increase in the mid-single-digit percent range MIS U.S. increase in the low-single-digit percent range MIS non-U.S. increase in the high-single-digit percent range CFG increase in the high-single-digit percent range SFG increase in the mid-single-digit percent range FIG increase in the mid-single-digit percent range PPIF decrease in the low-single-digit percent range MA MA global (2) increase in the mid-twenties percent range MA U.S. increase in the low-double-digit percent range MA non-U.S. increase in the mid-thirties percent range RD&A (2) increase approximately 40% ERS increase in the low-single-digit percent range PS increase in the high-single-digit percent range (1) These metrics are adjusted measures.
