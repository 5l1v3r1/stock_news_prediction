The 2017 results include the effects of the $2.02 million non-cash tax expense related to the revaluation of the company’s Deferred Tax Asset (“DTA”) as a result of the corporate tax code change in December 2017 and a small amount of transaction related expenses related to the recently announced definitive agreement to acquire First Federal of Northern Michigan Bancorp, Inc. (“FFNM”). The 2016 results included expenses related to the acquisitions of Niagara Bancorporation, Inc. (“Niagara”) and First National Bank of Eagle River (“Eagle River”) that had an after-tax impact of $2.05 million on earnings. Adjusted core net income for 2017 was $7.57 million (net of the DTA adjustment and FFNM expenses) or $1.20 per share while 2016 (exclusive of all Niagara and Eagle transaction-related expenses) was $6.53 million, or $1.05 per share. On a per share basis, actual earnings growth was 20% while adjusted earnings growth was 14% year-over-year.\nThe DTA adjustment negated earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 resulting in a nominal $20 thousand loss for the period ($0.00 per share), compared to earnings of $1.70 million, or $0.27 per share, in the prior year period. Exclusive of the DTA adjustment and transaction related expenses, the adjusted core net income of 2017 was $2.07 million, or $0.33 per share.\nTotal assets of the Corporation at December 31, 2017 were $985.37 million, compared to $983.52 million at December 31, 2016. Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2017 totaled $81.40 million, compared to $78.61 million at December 31, 2016. Book value per share equated to $12.95 compared to $12.55 per share a year ago. Tangible book value at yearend 2017 was $73.78 million or $11.72 per share compared to $70.74 million or $11.29 per share for 2016. Market price on the last trading day of the year was $15.90 in 2017 and $13.47 in 2016. Weighted average shares outstanding totaled 6,288,791 for year-end 2017 compared to 6,236,067 for the same period in 2016.\nKey highlights:\nmBank, the Corporation’s primary asset, recorded net income of $6.92 million in 2017, compared to $6.05 million, in 2016. The DTA revaluation resulted in a non-cash tax expense totaling $2.02 million. Adjusted core net income for 2017 was $8.95 million compared to 2016 (exclusive of $1.754 million in transaction related expenses) of $7.80 million. Adjusted bank net income grew approximately 15%.\nIn early 2018 the Corporation announced the execution of a definitive agreement to acquire First Federal of Northern Michigan through an all-stock merger of FFNM with and into a subsidiary of the Corporation. The aggregate value of the transaction is estimated at approximately $41.8 million, subject to MFNC’s closing price on the day the deal closes. The transaction remains subject to various approvals with an expected closing date late in the second quarter 2018.\nTotal interest income of $44.38 million for 2017 compared to $37.98 million for the same period in 2016.\nNet Interest Margin remains strong at 4.20%, consistent with the 2016 margin of 4.19%.\nCredit quality at the bank remains solid with a Texas Ratio of 7.77% compared to 11.76% one year ago, and nonperforming assets of $6.13 million, or .62% of total assets, compared to $8.91 million, or .91% of total assets for the same period in 2016.\nLoan Growth and Production\nTotal loans at yearend 2017 were $811 million, a $29 million increase, equating to 4%, from $782 million at December 31, 2016. In addition to the balance sheet totals, the Corporation services $198 million of sold mortgage loans and $57 million of sold SBA and USDA loans. Total loans under management equal approximately $1.07 billion.\nTotal new loan production for 2017 was $275 million. Commercial production accounted for $140 million, aggregate mortgage (mainly 1-4 family) and consumer production was $112 million and production from Mackinac Commercial Credit (“MCC”), the asset based lending division of mBank, was $23 million. The Upper Peninsula region contributed $127 million, Northern Lower Peninsula $50 million, Southeast Michigan $46 million, Wisconsin $29 million and MCC $23 million. Commenting on new loan production and overall lending activities, Kelly W. George, President and CEO of mBank, stated, “Our product mix and geographic diversification has allowed us to remain consistent in our loan production year-over-year and to prudently grow our loan portfolio organically. 2017 was a highly competitive year for good earning assets which impacted overall market loan pricing and caused us to pass on some opportunities where pricing and/or structure did not meet our requirements for that loan type. Specifically, from a macro portfolio management standpoint, we slowed the origination of non-owner occupied real estate loans given their higher risk profile compared to our preferred portfolio composition. While we could have increased our production totals, we will remain steadfast in our credit process and profitability requirements for long term balance sheet strength. We are also very excited about the markets that we will gain through the pending FFNM transaction as well as the complementary granularity of their loan portfolio and mortgage business. The transaction augments our organic production capacity even further and the scale will allow us to aggressively compete in the new markets and the Northern Lower Peninsula region in general.”\nCredit Quality\nNonperforming assets totaled $6.13 million, .62% of total assets at December 31, 2017, down from 2016 balances of $8.91 million or .91% of total assets. Total loan delinquencies greater than 30 days resided at a nominal .66%, or $5.40 million. Mr. George, commenting on credit quality, stated, “Our credit quality metrics remain strong with no systematic issues within our loan book as we remain vigilant to ensure continued prudent underwriting standards and not stretch for loans that do not meet our policy guidelines. The slight increase in metrics due to the acquired loan portfolios through our 2016 acquisitions have normalized in 2017 through proactive resolution of some of those troubled credits resulting in even stronger asset quality metrics and desired accretion. We remain comfortable with our remaining purchase accounting marks. We’ve applied the same rigorous diligence process to our evaluation of the FFNM loan portfolio prior to executing the definitive agreement, and expect to experience similarly reliable results.”\nMargin Analysis\n2017 net interest income and net interest margin were $37.94 million and 4.20%, compared to $33.10 million and 4.19%, for 2016. The increase in net interest income was due to organic growth as well as scale achieved through the Niagara and Eagle River acquisitions. The Corporation also had continued net interest contribution due to the accretive attributes associated with the purchase accounting adjustments related to the three acquisitions completed since December 2014. Mr. George stated, “We have been successful in maintaining our strong net interest margin which is akin to my loan production commentary regarding disciplined loan pricing and proactive review and pricing of in-market deposits. We have also worked to employ targeted wholesale funding strategies that support the long-term structural integrity of our balance sheet composition in an increasing rate environment we have not operated in some time.”\nDeposits\nTotal deposits of $818.00 million at December 31, 2017 remained mostly flat compared to deposits of $823.51 million on December 31, 2016. Mr. George, commenting on overall deposits and liquidity, stated, “The company maintains a strong liquidity position with many different funding sources to support loan growth and operations. We remain committed to growing core deposits in our local communities through a very competitive product and service mix. The main impetus behind the slightly lower level of deposits was the loss of a couple acquired high-priced depository relationships that required pledging of bank investments for uninsured balances. One of the key reasons for the business combination with FFNM is the positive impact we expect on our overall deposit base with a large amount of long tenured low-cost core deposits which will enable us to remove some higher priced more volatile brokered CD’s. This balance sheet repositioning on the liability side will provide a more stable funding source for loan growth, and significantly reduce our funding costs in total”.\nNoninterest Income/Expense\nNoninterest income, at $4.04 million for 2017, remained consistent with the $4.15 million earned in 2016. The slight decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to a small decrease in gain on sales of secondary mortgage loans and SBA loans. Income from sold secondary mortgages totaled $1.37 million compared to $1.58 million in 2016 while SBA gains were $.87 million compared to $.90 million in 2016. Noninterest expense, at $30.34 million in 2017, increased a nominal $451 thousand from 2016. The 2016 amount included some acquisition costs, most notably the Eagle River data processing termination fee of roughly $1.7 million. There were also customary increases in salaries and benefits given additional employees and increased occupancy expense given the acquired branch offices. Consistent with management’s operating diligence prior to both acquisitions, the Corporation has reached the expected levels of overall efficiencies.\nAssets and Capital\nTotal assets of the Corporation at December 31, 2017 were $985.37 million, up $2 million from the $983.520 million reported at year-end 2016. The Corporation is “adequately” capitalized and the Bank is “well-capitalized” with Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets at the Corporation of 9.29% and 11.74% at the Bank.\nPaul D. Tobias, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation commented, “We continue to execute our strategy of organic and selective acquired growth to build scale, earnings and shareholder value. We believe our adjusted 2017 earnings show continued progress in achieving our goals. We are very pleased with the integration and contribution levels of our 2016 acquisitions and believe our recently announced transaction will yield similar results. We remain committed to being a community bank and supporting local individuals, businesses, and civic organizations to help them grow and prosper.”\nMackinac Financial Corporation is a registered bank holding company formed under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 with assets in excess of $985 million and whose common stock is traded on the NASDAQ stock market as “MFNC.” The principal subsidiary of the Corporation is mBank.
