UPS on Thursday said network bottlenecks that delayed some deliveries during the key holiday season cost about $125 million, while it spent roughly $60 million on new technology and automated capacity.\nThe rapid rise in e-commerce has been a boon for shipping demand, but UPS has struggled to bring down the extra costs of making more smaller deliveries to individual consumers.\nThe investments show UPS is betting that if it can handle more volume it can increase the number of packages it delivers to households, and eventually improve margins and profitability, versus pushing for higher prices and less volume, said Stephens analyst Jack Atkins.\n“If they can’t get the delivery density - to date we haven’t seen a yearly improvement in density - that’s going to be a big problem,” Atkins said.\nFILE PHOTO - A United Parcel Service (UPS) truck on delivery is pictured in downtown Los Angeles, California October 29, 2014. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo The issue of costs and the 2018 earnings outlook overshadowed fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations.\nAnalysts on a call to discuss the results pushed UPS executives on when investors will see improved margin growth at its core U.S. business and why the company had not increased prices more.\n“We expect 2018 to have some challenges, because of the investment dollars,” Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz said on the call.\nUPS said it would invest $6.5 billion to $7 billion in 2018, part of that on buying 14 Boeing 747-8 cargo jets and four Boeing 767s for its fleet. It plans 18 new or retrofitted facilities this year, including adding three U.S. ground hubs.\nThe hubs will be in areas where a surge in holiday online shopping orders overwhelmed its system, when UPS topped its own forecasts by delivering 762 million packages.\nUPS pegged its 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share at $7.03 to $7.37, with the lower end of that range falling short of the $7.16 per share analysts had been expecting on average.\nReporting by Eric M.
