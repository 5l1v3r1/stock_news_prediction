Broadcom, however, labels Qualcomm’s proposals “engagement theater”.\nFeb. 21, 2018\nBroadcom cut its bid for Qualcomm by $3 to $79 per share after Qualcomm raises its offer for NXP Semiconductors.\nFeb. 20, 2018\nQualcomm deals a blow to Broadcom’s raised bid by increasing its offer for NXP Semiconductors to $127.50 per share in cash from $110 per share.\nFeb. 14, 2018\nRepresentatives of Broadcom and Qualcomm meet for the first time to discuss a potential combination; Qualcomm later calls the meeting “constructive”.\nFeb. 13, 2018\nFILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017.
