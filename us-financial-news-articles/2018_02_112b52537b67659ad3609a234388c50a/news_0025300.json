The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 327,540 contracts on Feb. 6, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data. This was the most speculative net shorts in 10-year T-note futures since 409,659 in the week of Feb. 28, 2017. A week earlier, speculators held 215,600 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures. On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.885 percent, the highest since December 2014, after a strong payrolls report released a week ago showed the biggest annual wage increase in more than 8-1/2 years in January. Among other bond contracts, speculators dialed back the record level of net shorts on two-year T-note futures to 210,758 contracts on Tuesday. Speculative net shorts in ultra bond futures hit a record amount at 145,544 contracts earlier this week. Net shorts among speculators on Eurodollar futures grew to 3.16 million contracts, the most since the week of May 14.
