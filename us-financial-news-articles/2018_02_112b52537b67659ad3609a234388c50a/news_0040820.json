Two told Reuters those talks had stalled. SLA declined to comment on the talks.\nMeanwhile, Scottish Widows has been expanding in corporate pensions and parent Lloyds also has broader ambitions in insurance after buying Zurich Insurance's UK workplace pensions and savings business in October.\n\"We are disappointed by this decision in context of strong performance and good service we have delivered,\" Keith Skeoch and Martin Gilbert, Standard Life Aberdeen's co-chief executives, said in a statement announcing the review.\nshow chapters Earnings showed increased diversification of our flows: Standard Life CEO 2:57 AM ET Tue, 8 Aug 2017 | 02:02 The mandate, to invest in largely lower margin passive equity and fixed income assets, makes up less than 5 percent of SLA's revenues, but could still leave a hole of up to 140 million pounds in SLA's revenues to be filled, analysts said.\nScottish Widows and Lloyds said in a statement they had given notice to SLA of their plans to terminate the deal, kick-starting a 12-month process to find a replacement provider or providers. SLA said it planned to participate in the process.\nSLA said it would take a one-off impairment charge of 40 million pounds and its shares were the weakest performer on the blue-chip FTSE 100 at 1052 GMT, falling 4.9 percent.\n\"The real question ... will be the extent to which Standard Life Aberdeen can shed costs to offset the likely loss of revenue,\" Bernstein analyst Edward Houghton said in a note.\nExane analyst Arnaud Giblat said the relative underperformance of SLA shares ahead of the Lloyds move, and the small chance it could retain the mandate at a lower margin, would act to cushion the fall.\nThe decision to terminate the deal comes a week before Lloyds updates the market on its next three-year strategic plan on Feb. 21 and SLA's full-year results on Feb. 23.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T15:27:03.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
