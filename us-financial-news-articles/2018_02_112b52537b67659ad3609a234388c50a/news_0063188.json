It also says the U.S. is training European countries to use these weapons.\nLast April, the foreign ministry issued a statement in which it said that \"Washington's approach to compliance with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is still of great concern. The U.S. and its non-nuclear NATO allies continue their nuclear skill training as part of the so-called \"nuclear sharing\",\" it said .\n\"This is a serious violation of Articles I and II of the NPT,\" the ministry said.\nArticle I of the NPT prohibits nuclear states from transferring nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or control over such weapons or explosive devices, to any recipient whatsoever, directly or indirectly. Article II prohibits non-nuclear states from receiving the transfer, directly or indirectly.\nBut Lavrov repeated Russia's position on the matter on Wednesday.\n\"Everyone understands that this way, the U.S. military prepares the military of European countries for the use of nuclear weapons against Russia,\" he said.\nRussia, he added, had not deployed any nuclear weapons and did not test them. On the contrary, the U.S. had taken an \"aggressive position\" he said.\n\"These initiatives we see on the part of the U.S. do not promote non-proliferation, they promote the deterioration of the full implementation of it (the treaty).\"\nRussia has also long-objected to the deployment of a U.S.-commanded NATO missile defense system in eastern Europe, saying it is not designed to prevent a possible ballistic missile attack from Iran but designed to undermine and neutralize Moscow's nuclear arsenal. NATO and the U.S. deny that accusation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T12:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:57:42.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
