In the last seven years, he has had 14 layoffs of 10 days or more. \nHe now has four months to show Germany coach Joachim Loew that he will be fit and in form for the World Cup in Russia. \nDortmund have already expressed confidence in his recovery by saying that they want to offer him a significant contract extension. \n“Our goal remains that Marco Reus stays here in the long-term,” sporting director Michael Zorc told Bild newspaper on Tuesday. \n“It would be negligent on our part not to want such a player in our ranks, especially when he comes from Dortmund and has a strong identification with the club.” \nStoeger, however, warned against expecting too much of the player. \n“We shouldn’t expect marvels from him,” said the Austrian coach. “I don’t want him to carry the burden of thinking he has to decide every match for us.” Writing by Brian Homewood in Zurich; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T16:33:49.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
