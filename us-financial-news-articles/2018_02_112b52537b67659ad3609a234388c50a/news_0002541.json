A police spokesman said he was not aware of his detention.\nThe arrest follows that of opposition politician Miguna Miguna, who was detained in a dawn raid on his Nairobi home on Friday and that of another opposition leader a day earlier.\nMiguna was released on bail of 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($500).\nMiguna stood beside Odinga at Tuesday’s rally and declared himself the “general” of Odinga’s National Resistance Movement, which authorities have designated a “criminal group” because of its stated intent to establish a parallel government.\nKenya’s ban on three private television stations defied a court order to lift the move. The media crackdown has been criticized by the United Nations and the United States.\nThe arrests and broadcast bans have shocked many Kenyans used to a freewheeling media and irreverent political culture that has taken root since 2002.\nWriting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T14:42:36.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
