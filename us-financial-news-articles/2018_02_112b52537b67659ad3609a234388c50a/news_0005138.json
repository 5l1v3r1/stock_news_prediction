NDAQ, +0.57% for corporate issuers. \nWynn -- the founder, chairman and chief executive of the casino company -- is an investor in IEX and a vocal supporter of its crusade against aggressive high-speed trading strategies. He told a business conference in 2014 that he wanted to list Wynn Resorts on IEX, although his representatives have since said he is just “considering” whether to make the switch. \nWynn Resorts, a member of the S&P 500, is listed on Nasdaq. IEX had expected the casino operator to be among the initial batch of companies to switch to the new exchange, people familiar with IEX’s listings effort said. \nIEX declined to comment.
