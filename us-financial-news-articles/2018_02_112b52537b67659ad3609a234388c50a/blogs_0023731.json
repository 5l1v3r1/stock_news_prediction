Analysts surveyed by Reuters on average expect the USDA to raise its forecast of U.S. 2017/18 soybean ending stocks, reflecting a sluggish export pace. \n\"U.S. soybean exports proved weaker than had been hoped in recent months. For one thing, they have faced competition from Brazilian soybeans. And for another, quality problems with the most recent U.S. crop have been reported,\" Commerzbank said in a daily market update. \nThere are concerns over grain and oilseed supplies from Argentina, a leading exporter of farm goods. \nA strike by Argentine truck owners aimed at forcing an increase in hauling rates has halted grain unloading at some of the country's terminals, Guillermo Wade, manager of the Chamber of Port and Maritime Activities, said on Wednesday.
