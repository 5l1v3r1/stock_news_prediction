Ties will be played over one day with matches using a best-of-three-set format.\nSixteen World Group nations will automatically qualify for the Finals, with a further two nations to be selected.\nThe eight teams failing to qualify for the quarter-finals would then play off against the eight zonal Group One qualifiers to try to qualify for the following year’s Finals.\nZonal Groups I and II home-and-away ties will continue to be played during the traditional three weeks of the calendar.\nReporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T17:25:31.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
