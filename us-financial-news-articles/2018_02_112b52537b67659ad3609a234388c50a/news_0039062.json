When adjusted for inflation, their pay fell 13% from the previous generation, reports Bloomberg . \nIn the United States, the study says that millennials made minimal generation-on-generation gains. Typical incomes in the U.S. for those aged 45-49 are no higher than they were for those born in the early 1920s when adjusted for inflation. Meanwhile, Generation X saw a 54% pay increase from the Baby Boomer generation before it.
