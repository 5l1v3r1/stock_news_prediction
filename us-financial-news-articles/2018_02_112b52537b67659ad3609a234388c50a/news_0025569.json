BGEO Investments will continue to invest in Georgian businesses and hold BGEO’s property and casualty insurance operations. \nGeorgia’s economy expanded by 4.8 percent year-on-year in 2017, up from 2.2 percent the previous year, and Governor Koba Gvenetadze has said current economic indicators showed that 2018 “will be a continuation of the economic recovery which started last year”. \nBGEO’s Bank of Georgia unit has more than a third of the market share of Georgian banks based on total assets, loans, deposits and shareholder equity. \nOwning a 19.9 percent stake in Bank of Georgia gives Georgia Capital “improved access” to capital and an increased ability to capture investment opportunities by monetising its stake, Tbilisi-based BGEO said in a statement on Monday. \nGeorgia Capital expects to gradually reduce its holding in Bank of Georgia to under 10 percent in the “medium term”, the statement added.
