The increase floated by the president would presumably put the gasoline tax at 43.4 cents and diesel tax at just under 50 cents. \nTrump endorsed raising the gasoline tax by a quarter at a White House meeting with members of his administration and Congress, two sources told Axios. Sen. Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, told CNN Trump is open to a 25-cent hike for both the diesel and gasoline tax. @KilloughCNN: Democratic Sen. Tom Carper says Trump was open to a one-time, 25 cent increase in gas and diesel taxes today in the WH meeting w/ lawmakers. \"He said he knew it was a difficult thing for legislators to support and said that he would...provide the political cover to do that.\" \nThe White House said it would not comment on Trump's discussions in closed door meetings. \nThe president has communicated to staff that he is open to raising the gas tax for weeks, ever since the U.S. Chamber of Commerce proposed it, CNBC can confirm. \nThe federal government has not raised the gas tax since 1993. Funds raised through the charge pay for road construction and investments in mass transportation through the Highway Trust Fund. \nIn the roughly 25 years since the last hike, inflation has whittled down the buying power of dollars raised through the tax. Vehicles on the road have also become more fuel efficient, further diminishing the levy's ability to fund highway repairs. \nThe issue has been on the table at least since May, when Trump suggested he might support raising the federal fuel levy. The White House tamped down reports of his support, but top economic adviser Gary Cohn later told lawmakers would get a chance to debate a hike during infrastructure negotiations. \nEarlier this month, Cohn revisited the idea in a meeting with Republicans, where some GOP lawmakers supported the idea, while others raised concerns, Axios reported. \nThe opponents include Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who expressed his opposition in a private donor retreat hosted by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch. \nOn Monday, nearly 30 conservative groups opposed raising the gas tax in a letter to lawmakers. \n\"Raising the gas tax is a bad idea,\" the signatories wrote. \"It will make the burden of government on families and businesses heavier. A higher gas tax means higher prices not just on gas, but on goods and services throughout the economy.\" \nâ€” CNBC's Kayla Tausche, Ylan Mui and John Schoen contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T22:49:47.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
