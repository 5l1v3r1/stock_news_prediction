SLIMMING DOWN \nAccording to the government, Australia’s big four are still among the most profitable banks in the world, earning net profit margins of 36.4 percent in the June quarter of 2017.

REUTERS/Steven Saphore/File Photo \nYears of economic growth and a booming property market had encouraged executives to focus on lifting sales rather than trimming operations. \n“Top line revenue growth is going to be a struggle, so they need to look closely at their cost lines really seriously,” said Brad Potter, head of Australian equities at Nikko Asset Management, which owns shares in the major banks. \n“This is just early stages for banks,” Potter said. “There needs to be a massive reengineering of back-offices to cut costs.” \nLast week, CBA’s outgoing chief executive, Ian Narev, warned that over the next five years, “the level of competition in this industry will simply not sustain the cost structures we’ve got today.” Slideshow (2 Images) \nNarev will leave CBA in April as it fights accusations by the country’s anti-money laundering agency that it allowed thousands of suspicious transactions to pass through its systems. \nJob cuts could prove hard for banks given the trust they have lost in recent scandals, according to Julia Angrisano, national secretary of the Australian Finance Sector Union. \n“Rather than going through this stage with a sledge-hammer to shed tens of thousand of jobs, we think that this is an opportunity for banks to deal with disruption in the right way, re-skilling and re-training their workforce,” Angrisano said. \nNAB last year said it would cut 6,000 jobs over the next three years in a bid to save A$1 billion by 2020 through automating processes while also creating 2,000 new staff positions over the same period. \nBranches are a key focus for cost-sensitive executives as more people bank online. \n“It’s likely we will see branch layouts, sizes and experiences evolve, but they continue to play a pivotal role in the experience our customers have,” NAB’s chief operating officer, Antony Cahill, said in an email to Reuters. \nA spokeswoman for Westpac said the bank believed staffing numbers would fall, but that it was taking a gradual approach. \nANZ representatives did not respond to emailed questions about staff cuts. A spokesman for CBA declined to comment beyond Narev’s remarks last week. Reporting by Paulina Duran in SYDNEY.
