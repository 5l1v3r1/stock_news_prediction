Caldwell-Pope also matched Teague for game-high assist honors with six.\nIsaiah Thomas, in just his third game for the Lakers since being acquired from Cleveland last week, shot just 3-for-15 and finished with seven points.\nThe Lakers led for nearly the entire first 42 minutes of the game, but every time they appeared to be taking control, the Timberwolves rallied.\nLos Angeles went up by as many as 15 points in the second quarter, only to see Minnesota close within 65-62 by halftime.\nAnd after the Lakers re-established a 12-point lead in the third, the Timberwolves scratched, getting within 91-84 headed into the fourth period and setting up their 35-20 fourth-quarter finish.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T12:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:17:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
