Nasdaq Dubai began trading single-stock futures for shares in some of the United Arab Emirates’ biggest companies in late 2016.\n“This is one of the templates for stock markets in the UAE and how they can complement each other,” Hamed Ahmed Ali, chief executive of Nasdaq Dubai, told reporters on Sunday.\nTrading volumes in many of the single-stock futures have been modest since they were launched. However, Ali said investors’ response to them had been encouraging, with 17 UAE-listed companies currently covered, up from an original seven, and the number of brokerages involved rising to nine from four.\nNasdaq Dubai’s website showed Dubai index futures, due to expire on June 21, trading at 3,328 on Sunday morning, while the underlying index was down 0.6 percent at 3,310 points. Abu Dhabi index futures were at 4,560 while the index was up 0.2 percent at 4,586 points.
