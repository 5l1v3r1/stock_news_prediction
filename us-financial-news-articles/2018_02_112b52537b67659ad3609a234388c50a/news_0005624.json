While China is still a key outlet, particularly for Angolan oil, its buyers have a wide range of options, and turning away even slightly makes more of it available to others.\n“Demand for some grades was down from more regular buyers, so Angolan had to be priced low to move,” one trader said.\nThis in part helped drive some of the Indian buying, sources said. While IOC is a regular buyer of West African oil, typically via tenders, Essar and Reliance tend to opt for the region’s crude only when it is particularly competitive.\nTraders said a rush to clear out February-loading cargoes, along with some length in Angolan barrels as Chinese buyers backed away, helped lure the refineries.\nThe cargoes will also arrive in March and April, around the time refineries are concluding spring maintenance and looking to run full steam, traders said. ExxonMobil also booked West African oil to sail to Australia.\nTotal loadings of West African oil to Asia slid to 2.17 million bpd as a result of the slowdown from China, down from a record 2.39 million bpd in January.\nReporting by Libby George; Editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T19:19:20.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
