(“Momentive” or the “Company”) (OTCQX: MPMQ) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“We are pleased to report another year of strong growth and margin expansion,” said Jack Boss, Chief Executive Officer and President. “Our continued momentum is reflective of the underlying attractiveness and versatility of silicones technology, the breadth of our applications and a clearly defined strategy to accelerate profitable growth and transform our global operations. We continue to improve our portfolio mix by focusing our investments in our higher margin specialty products, as well as driving ongoing cost and productivity initiatives. As we look out into 2018, we see continued strong demand, solid and improving industry fundamentals and significant upside in the capital investments we have made in our specialty product portfolio over the last several years.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNet Sales. Net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $599 million, an increase of 10% compared with $544 million in the prior year. The increase in net sales was driven by volume gains in Momentive’s Performance Additives segment and the specialty portion of the Company’s Formulated and Basic Silicones product portfolio. Volume gains were driven by increased demand in consumer, automotive and personal care end markets.\nNet Income (Loss). Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $19 million compared with a net loss of $118 million in the prior year period.\nSegment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $83 million, an increase of 28% compared with $65 million in the prior year period. The increase in Segment EBITDA was driven by volume growth in the specialty portion of the Company’s Formulated and Basic Silicones product portfolio, operating leverage within the Quartz Technologies segment and strategic capital investments. Subsequent to quarter end, Momentive implemented price increases across its entire product portfolio which are expected to benefit the Company in fiscal year 2018.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nNet Sales. Net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $2.33 billion, an increase of 4% compared with $2.23 billion in the prior year. The increase in net sales was driven by volume gains in Momentive’s Performance Additives segment and the specialty portion of the Company’s Formulated and Basic Silicones product portfolio, partially offset by Momentive’s strategic decision to deemphasize the sale of lower margin products. Volume gains were driven by increased demand in consumer, automotive and electronics end markets.\nNet Income (Loss). Net Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $0 compared with a net loss of $163 million in the prior year period.\nSegment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $293 million, an increase of 23% compared with $238 million in the prior year period.

Segment EBITDA is an important measure used by the Company's senior management and board of directors to evaluate operating results and allocate capital resources among segments. Segment EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net (loss) income or other results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See Schedule 4 to this release for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Segment EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash and certain non-recurring items and other adjustments calculated on a pro-forma basis, including the expected future cost savings from business optimization or other programs and the expected future impact of acquisitions, in each case as determined under the governing debt instrument. The Company believes that including the supplemental adjustments that are made to calculate Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about the Company’s ability to comply with its financial covenants and to obtain additional debt in the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition, liquidity or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to net (loss) income determined in accordance with GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not take into account certain items such as interest and principal payments on the Company’s indebtedness, depreciation and amortization expense (because the Company uses capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of the Company’s costs and ability to generate revenue), working capital needs, tax payments (because the payment of taxes is part of the Company’s operations, it is a necessary element of the Company’s costs and ability to operate), non-recurring expenses and capital expenditures. Fixed Charges under the indentures should not be considered as an alternative to interest expense. See Schedule 5 to this release for a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nCertain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements related to our transformation and restructuring activities, growth and productivity initiatives, anticipated cost savings, growth, and market recovery, the impact of work stoppage and other incidents on our operations and competitiveness.
