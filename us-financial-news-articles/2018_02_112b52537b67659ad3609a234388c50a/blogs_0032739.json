The funding blueprint also calls for cutting $237 billion from Medicare ; rolling back Medicaid expansion; and gutting Obamacare .\nWomack argued that a Republican willingness to add to budget deficits does not represent a shift in the party's message, which holds fiscal conservatism as a core principle.\n\"We're still the party that believes in a very strong national defense posture. National security is very important to a lot of us,\" he said. \"Building the nation's infrastructure is a key to helping jump-start an economy that's been in some anemic growth pattern for the past several years.\"\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
