Larsson had two assists and Robin Lehner stopped 35 shots.\nJonathan Ericsson and Justin Abdelkader scored for the Red Wings, who have lost three straight by identical 3-2 scores. Howard was credited with 27 saves.\nBuffalo had 23 blocks, compared to eight for Detroit. Both teams went 1-for-3 on the power play.\nRistolainen scored his sixth goal 3:39 into the contest. He flicked a shot from the point that found its way past a screened Howard and into the net.\nEricsson tied it 3:42 into the second period with his third goal. Ericsson skated past the blue line to pick up a loose puck and fired it in just inside the right post.\nKane’s power-play goal put the Sabres on top 2-1 at the 13:09 mark of the second period. Kane skated into the Detroit zone along the left boards, circled behind the net and jammed the puck between Howard’s skate and the post.\nKane also scored during a 3-2 loss to Washington on Monday. His name has been mentioned prominently in trade rumors with the Sabres sitting at the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings.\nWith Larsson in the penalty box for tripping, the Red Wings scored the tying goal with 1:25 remaining in regulation. Henrik Zetterberg won a faceoff and Frans Nielsen was stopped on a point-blank shot by Lehner. Abdelkader pounced on the rebound and scored his 10th goal into an open net.\nThe Sabres lead the season series 2-1. They’ll meet once more in Buffalo on March 29.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:44:24.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
