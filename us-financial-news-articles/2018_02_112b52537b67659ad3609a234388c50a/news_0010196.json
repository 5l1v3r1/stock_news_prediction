Spotify said on Twitter in January that it had 70 million subscribers. \nAccording to the report, the number of subscribers to both services are often boosted by individual users who are on family plans and users with discounted subscriptions that come in a bundle along with other services. \nSpotify is due to carry out a highly anticipated initial public offering in the first half of 2018. \nThe company has confidentially filed for an IPO with U.S. regulators, according to a source familiar with the matter. \nNote: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy.
