Voice4Net solutions are currently in production with both small and large customers at numerous sites throughout North America, and deliver a robust set of capabilities including support for omni-channel, voice-only and IVR (interactive voice response) seats.\nAdding a proven omni-channel customer engagement technology to CoreDial’s newly developed UC and Mobile applications provides the company’s more than 800 MSPs, VARs and IT Solution Providers—and over 23,000 SMB customers—with feature-rich and flexible options. These include a pre-integrated solution with CoreDial’s full-featured hosted unified communications services and a stand-alone contact center service connecting with existing premise-based communications solutions.\nThe Voice4Net acquisition follows through on CoreDial’s commitment to address the wants and needs of its channel partners, many of which requested a mobile and contact center solution to meet their end users’ demands.\n“This acquisition is an integral part of CoreDial’s strategy to build upon the company’s cloud communications service delivery platform and add a robust set of end user features for our channel partners and their customers,” said Alan Rihm, CoreDial’s chief executive officer. “The addition of award-winning Contact Center and IVR capabilities to our new UC and Mobile applications enables our channel partners to deliver even more value to their end-user customers. This also helps expand their addressable market to larger customers, as well as many horizontal and vertical implementations. We’re very excited to have Rick McFarland, who served as chief executive officer of Voice4Net, and his team, join CoreDial on this next phase of our journey. We believe the combined entity provides maximum value to our channel partners and their customers.”\nCoreDial believes that deploying a single platform will enable end users to maximize productivity and communications efficiency, all while receiving service from their local trusted provider. Partners will benefit from the ability to provide sophisticated customer engagement solutions to their customers who demand it, and pursue new business opportunities. This gives the channel the opportunity to strengthen relationships with existing customers, and expand the addressable market.\n“We see this as a market-making acquisition for CoreDial’s partners,” said McFarland. “There is significant opportunity within the channel, where there is high demand to buy a robust, fully integrated Contact Center solution from a trusted local technology provider. It further reinforces that fact that CoreDial is listening to its channel partners and honoring its commitment to deliver value to them--early and often.”\nAbout CoreDial\nCoreDial is a leading SaaS platform provider that empowers more than 800 channel partners to deliver cloud communications solutions to more than 23,000 SMBs with close to 300,000 seats in the U.S. CoreDial’s proven platform enables the channel to quickly and cost-effectively provide end users with high-quality reliable services such as UCaaS, CCaaS, hosted PBX, mobility, SIP trunking, and SD-WAN.
