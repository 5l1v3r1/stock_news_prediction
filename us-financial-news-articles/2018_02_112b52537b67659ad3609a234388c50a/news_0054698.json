The Cavaliers also hit 50 percent (8 of 16) from 3-point range, and outrebounded the Panthers 37-24.\nVirginia, which leads the nation in scoring defense (52.7 points per game entering Saturday’s matchup), held an opponent under 40 points for the third time this season.\nThe Cavaliers, who have clinched the ACC regular-season crown with a 15-1 record and two games to go, moved to 26-2 by holding the Panthers to 23.9 percent shooting.
