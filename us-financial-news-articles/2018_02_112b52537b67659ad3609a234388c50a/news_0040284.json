Sand is the most sought-after proppant used in fracking.\n“We got multiple sand operators whose operations in the region were impacted and from which we purchase about one-third of our total sand volumes,” Weber said, adding that the delays would have an impact on Halliburton’s operating efficiencies and utilization.\nThe company has been facing delays of up to 72 hours since February, Weber said.\nMost other pressure pumpers will likely see similar headwinds, further hampered by the cold weather Texas experienced in January, said Evercore ISI analyst James West in a note.\nWest believes the impact will be limited to the first quarter and said earnings should return to normal as the company exits the quarter.\nTudor Pickering analyst Byron Pope, however, said the delays would not affect other oilfield services companies. “This feels to me as though it’s more of a Halliburton-specific issue.”\nThe company is expected to report first-quarter results in April.\nReporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Shailesh Kuber\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T18:19:32.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
