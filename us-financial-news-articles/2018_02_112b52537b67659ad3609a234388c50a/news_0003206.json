The corporation also announced an increase in the share repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization to $500 million.\n“We had an outstanding close to a solid year for USG. The combination of focused operational performance by our manufacturing facilities and a high level of service to our customers enabled us to profitably grow our business, with net sales increasing by 13 percent and adjusted operating profit by 10 percent,” said Jennifer F. Scanlon, president and chief executive officer of USG Corporation. “We continued to invest in the commercialization of recently launched products and progressed on our advanced manufacturing initiatives in the fourth quarter.”\nOn a consolidated basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales were $831 million, compared to $734 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating profit increased to $87 million from $59 million, while adjusted operating profit increased to $106 million from $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nUSG recorded $62 million in net loss, or $0.44 loss per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $307 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 includes $138 million of income tax expense resulting from the Tax Cut and Reform Bill whereas 2016 net income includes $279 million of gain on sale of discontinued operations stemming from the sale of L&W Supply. On an adjusted basis, net income of $77 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased from $65 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. A full reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted metrics is set forth on an attached schedule.\nThe U.S. Wallboard & Surfaces segment generated $80 million of operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2017. On an adjusted basis, operating profit of $81 million in the U.S. Wallboard & Surfaces segment improved by $8 million over the fourth quarter of 2016. Wallboard volumes in the United States increased approximately 14% while wallboard price was down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2016. On a sequential basis, wallboard price decreased 1% from the third quarter due to increased freight. Surfaces products drove $2 million of improved profitability in the U.S. Wallboard & Surfaces segment.\nThe U.S. Performance Materials segment generated $5 million of operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2017. On an adjusted basis, operating profit of $5 million in the U.S. Performance Materials segment declined by $3 million over the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher freight and input costs coupled with additional sales and marketing expenses to support growth drove the decrease in operating profit.\nThe U.S. Ceilings segment generated $25 million of operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2017. On an adjusted basis, operating profit of $26 million increased by $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 due to improved pricing and volumes across tile and grid products.\nThe USG Boral business generated $17 million of equity income in the fourth quarter of 2017. On an adjusted basis, equity income increased $1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nUSG recorded full year 2017 net sales of $3.2 billion, net income of $95 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.65 compared to net sales of $3.0 billion, net income of $510 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.46 in 2016. On an adjusted basis, the corporation generated full year 2017 net income of $264 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.80. For comparative purposes, on an adjusted basis, USG recorded net income of $251 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.70 for the full year of 2016.\nUSG also announced today that its Board of Directors approved a $250 million increase to its share repurchase program, raising the total authorization to $500 million. As of December 31, 2017, $66 million remained under the corporation’s previously authorized $250 million share repurchase program. Although the Board of Directors did not set an expiration date for the share repurchase program, the corporation expects to execute the program within 18 months. Repurchases are expected be made from free cash flow generated from the business. Based on the January 31, 2018 closing share price, approximately 8 million shares, or 6 percent of the corporation’s market capitalization as of January 31, 2018, could be repurchased based on the remaining $316 million authorization under the share repurchase program. The corporation may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in other privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions.\n“Our new organizational structure will enable us to be closer to all of our customers and deliver better value for them. Increasing customer loyalty will be the key to delivering results for our shareholders,” said Scanlon. “I am confident in our strategy and the ability of our team to exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders.”\nA conference call is being held today at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time (8:00 a.m. Central time) during which USG senior management will discuss the corporation’s operating results.

In particular, the corporation presents the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted selling and administrative expenses, adjusted equity income from USG Boral Building Products, adjusted average diluted shares and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which exclude certain items. The non-GAAP financial measures are included as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP because management believes these non- GAAP financial measures help investors’ ability to analyze underlying trends in the corporation’s business, evaluate its performance relative to other companies in its industry and provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the corporation’s core operating results. In addition, adjusted operating profit includes the income from the corporation's equity method investments, including USG Boral Building Products, because management views the joint ventures as a business unit, even though the corporation’s share of the joint ventures are 50%. In addition, the corporation uses adjusted net income as a component in the measurement of incentive compensation. Prior year adjusted results also exclude results from Gypsum Transportation Limited (GTL), a shipping operation that the corporation has exited. Adjustments to net earnings are shown net of the tax effect computed at applicable statutory rates. The non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results and may vary from others in the industry. For further information related to the corporation’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures, see the schedules attached hereto.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 related to management’s expectations about future conditions, including, but not limited to, the execution, funding, and timing of USG's share repurchase program and the impact of our new organizational structure. Actual business, market or other conditions may differ materially from management’s expectations and, accordingly, may affect our sales and profitability or other results and liquidity. Any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially due to various other factors, including: economic conditions, such as employment levels, the availability of skilled labor, household formation, home ownership rate, new and existing home price trends, availability of mortgage financing, interest rates, deductibility of mortgage interest and real estate taxes, consumer confidence, job growth and discretionary business investment; competitive conditions and our ability to maintain or achieve price increases; the loss of one or more major customers, including L&W, and the increasing number of our customers with significant buying power; increased costs, or decreased availability, of key raw materials, transportation or energy; unexpected operational difficulties or catastrophic events at our facilities; our ability to successfully operate the joint venture with Boral Limited, including risks that our joint venture partner, Boral Limited, may not fulfill its obligations as an investor or may take actions that are inconsistent with our objectives; exposure to risks of operating internationally; our ability to innovate and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights; our ability to make capital expenditures and achieve the expected return on investment; a disruption in our information technology systems; compliance with environmental and safety regulations or product safety concerns; the outcome in legal and governmental proceedings; the ability of a small number of stockholders to influence our business and stock price; our ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions to complement or expand our businesses; significant changes in factors and assumptions used to measure our defined benefit plan obligations; our ability to return capital to stockholders; the occurrence of an “ownership change” within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code; our ability pursue strategic opportunities without increasing our debt and leverage ratio; the effects of acts of terrorism or war upon domestic and international economies and financial markets; and acts of God. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking information contained in this press release.
