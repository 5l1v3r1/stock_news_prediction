It expects adjusted free cash flow of $500 million to $700 million, compared to previous estimates of breaking even. \n“We think recent weakness in shares is reflective of lowered investor expectations, while in-line to slightly better financial results could provide some near-term relief,” said Matthew Niknam, analyst at Deutsche Bank, in a research note. \nOn the post-earnings conference call, Sprint Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Claure said Sprint would launch a mobile 5G network in the United States by the first half of 2019.

Sprint cut costs by about $260 million in the quarter, excluding $100 million of hurricane-related charges. \nClaure said “becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of (SoftBank Group Corp) could be a possibility” but that the decision would be up to SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son. Japan’s SoftBank owns a majority of Sprint and has been increasing its stake. \nFor the quarter, Sprint reported net additions of 184,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, compared to additions of 368,000 a year earlier. \nNet operating revenue in the third quarter ended Dec. 31 was $8.24 billion, down from $8.55 billion a year earlier. \nSprint reported quarterly net income of $7.16 billion, or $1.79 per share, due to the impact of federal tax reforms, after a loss of $479 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding the impact of tax cuts signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year, net income was 3 cents a share. \nAccording to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts had expected revenue of $8.15 billion and a net loss of 4 cents a share.
