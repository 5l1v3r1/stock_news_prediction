No thanks!\"\nHis comments followed a march in London on Saturday that drew thousands of people demanding more government funding for Britain's NHS, which has been badly overstretched this winter, in part because of a rise in severe flu cases. Emergency rooms have at times been overwhelmed, causing long waits.\nThe march was organized by the People's Assembly and Health Campaigns Together group, which on Monday condemned Trump's comments.\n\"We don't agree with your divisive and incorrect rhetoric. No thanks,\" the group said in a statement.\nIt said the marchers wanted to show their support for the principle of universal, comprehensive medical care that is free to the user and paid for through general taxation.\nTrump has sought to repeal the health care law of his predecessor, Barack Obama.\nCongress repealed the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance or risk a tax penalty. That takes effect next year. But other major parts of the overhaul remain in place.\nTrump's relationship with Britain has been strained by his retweeting of videos by the far-right group Britain First and disagreements over his policies on climate change, immigration and other matters. Nonetheless, officials in both countries are working on plans for him to visit Britain later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T22:57:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
