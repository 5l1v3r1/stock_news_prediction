The changes mean fewer buyers qualify for loans.\n“The decline in January sales provides clear evidence that the strength in activity late last year reflected a pull-forward of transactions, as rational homebuyers hurried to purchase before mortgage rules changed in 2018,” said Gregory Klump, CREA’s chief economist.\nThe number of newly listed homes plunged 21.6 percent in January to the lowest level since the spring of 2009, the report showed. New supply was down in about 85 percent of all local markets, led by a drop in the Greater Toronto Area, CREA said.\nWith new listings falling more than sales, the national sales-to-new listings ratio tightened to 63.6 percent in January, the report showed.\nThe housing market in Toronto, Canada’s largest city, and nearby cities cooled dramatically last summer after the province imposed new measures to curb speculation, including a foreign buyers tax, but regained some strength by the end of the year.\nAnalysts were divided over whether the nation’s extended housing boom would crash or achieve a soft landing as the cumulative effect of mortgage rule changes and rising interest rates weigh on demand.\nThe national average price for homes sold in January rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier to just over C$481,500 ($385,015), continuing a deceleration in home price appreciation as the softening in Toronto took some steam out of price gains.\n$1 = 1.2506 Canadian dollars Reporting by Andrea Hopkins; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:04:33.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
