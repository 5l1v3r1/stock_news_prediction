It is unenforceable without a penalty, however.\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the mandate was constitutional in its landmark 2012 ruling upholding the ACA, because the penalty fell within Congress’s taxation powers. The removal of that penalty, the GOP state officials argue, renders the mandate unconstitutional and the broader law invalid.\n“Once the heart of the ACA—the individual mandate—is declared unconstitutional, the remainder of the ACA must also fall,” the lawsuit said.\nMore\nHealth Proposal Would Loosen Limits on Short-Term Insurance Republicans Who Opposed Obama’s Health Law Now Work to Keep Premiums Down Senate Scraps Vote on GOP Measure to Repeal Health Law Republicans have failed in the past to have the ACA overturned in the courts. In this case, the plaintiffs face a number of challenges, legal experts said. The states will have to prove they have standing, which means they have to show they have experienced or will experience harm, and that is difficult to demonstrate now that the penalty has been repealed.\nThe litigation reflects a desire by many conservatives to press ahead with efforts to topple the law completely, going beyond recent efforts by the Trump administration to dismantle it piecemeal.\nThat quest is driving the lawsuit, as well as efforts by some House Republicans who are pushing for a repeal of an ACA requirement that many employers provide health coverage or pay a penalty.\nAt least one of the judges where the lawsuit was filed, Judge Reed O’Connor of Fort Worth, has taken action before against the ACA. In 2016, he issued a temporary injunction to block an Obama regulation that prevented discrimination in health care against people based on their gender identity or history of abortion. Judge O’Connor was appointed by former President George W. Bush.\nRelated Video In Trenton, Tenn., and similar rural communities around the country, many residents are underinsured or uninsured and struggle with medical costs, often forgoing care. This burdens local hospitals, which in turn close or scale back care, putting patients at risk.
