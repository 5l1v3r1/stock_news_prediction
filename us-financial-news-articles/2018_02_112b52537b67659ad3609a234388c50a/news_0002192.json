Q4 on Q4 change 2. Fourth quarter 2017 includes a non-cash charge of $2,014 million related to the impact of the US tax reform legislation.\nCCS earnings attributable to shareholders excluding identified items were $4.3 billion for the fourth quarter 2017 and $15.8 billion for the full year 2017, reflecting increased contributions from all businesses, compared with 2016. Full year earnings benefited mainly from higher realised oil, gas and LNG prices, improved refining performance and higher production from new fields, which offset the impact of field declines and divestments.\nCash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter 2017 of $7.3 billion included negative working capital movements of $ 1.1 billion. Excluding working capital effects, cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion. Full year 2017 cash flow from operating activities of $35.7 billion included negative working capital movements of $3.2 billion.\nTotal dividends distributed to shareholders in the quarter were $ 3.9 billion, of which $ 1.6 billion were settled by issuing 52.7 million A shares under the Scrip Dividend Programme. In November, Shell announced the cancellation of the Scrip Dividend Programme from the fourth quarter 2017. Shell expects to announce a dividend of $0.47 per ordinary share and $0.94 per American Depositary Share for the first quarter 2018.\nRoyal Dutch Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden commented:\n\"2017 was a year of strong financial performance for Shell. A year of transformation, in which we showed we have what it takes to deliver a world-class investment case. Our relentless focus on value, performance and competitiveness meant we were able to deliver $39 billion of cash flow from operations excluding working capital movements from our upgraded portfolio. We strengthened our financial framework during the year through an $8 billion reduction in our net debt, while our increased free cash flow generation gave us the confidence to cancel the scrip dividend programme in the fourth quarter, in line with what we said previously.\nWe reported strong earnings for the quarter underpinned by continued delivery momentum. Cash flow reflected higher tax payments and increased cash requirements in relation to our trading business. We enter 2018 with continued discipline and confidence, committed to the delivery of strong returns and cash.\"\nADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES Quarters $ million Full year Q4 Q3 Q4 2017 2017 2016 %1 Definition 2017 2016 % 6,778 5,742 6,913 Capital investment2 [C] 24,006 79,877 6,474 1,365 3,278 Divestments [D] 17,340 4,984 Total production available for sale 3,756 3,657 3,905 -4 (thousand boe/d) 3,664 3,668 - Global liquids realised price 55.28 47.06 44.54 +24 ($/b) 49.00 38.64 +27 Global natural gas realised price 4.40 4.15 4.03 +9 ($/thousand scf) 4.27 3.65 +17 9,776 9,477 9,895 -1 Operating expenses [G] 38,083 41,549 -8 Underlying 9,839 9,197 9,844 - operating expenses [G] 37,556 38,342 -2 ROACE (reported 5.8% 5.0% 3.0% income basis) [E] 5.8% 3.0% ROACE (CCS basis excluding 5.6% 4.6% 2.9% identified items) [E] 5.6% 2.9% 24.8% 25.4% 28.0% Gearing [F] 24.8% 28.0% 1.

Petrobras, the operator, announced that the Libra consortium had submitted the declaration of commerciality and signed a contract to charter the first production FPSO of Mero, which is the north-west block of Libra. The FPSO has a capacity of 180 thousand boe/d and is expected to start production in 2021. Shell has a 20% interest in the consortium developing the Libra area.\nIn December, Maersk Oil, as operator, announced the final investment decision for the redevelopment of the Tyra gas field in Denmark, which is expected to be completed in 2022. Peak production will be approximately 60 thousand boe/d. Shell holds a 36.8% interest in the Tyra field, which is part of the Danish Underground Consortium.\nUpstream divestments completed during the quarter totalled some $3,254 million, which included the disposal of a package of UK North Sea assets and Gabon onshore interests.\nIn January 2018, Shell announced the final investment decision on the redevelopment of the Penguins oil and gas field in the UK North Sea. Shell has a 50% interest in the Penguins field and peak production is expected to be 45 thousand boe/d.

Full year 2016 included $21,773 million related to the acquisition of BG Group plc.\nFourth quarter identified items mainly comprised a loss of $511 million on fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and a charge of $412 million related to the impact of the US tax reform legislation, partly offset by a gain of $164 million, mainly related to the sale of shares in Woodside and the Comgás divestment.\nCompared with the fourth quarter 2016, Integrated Gas earnings excluding identified items benefited from higher realised oil, gas and LNG prices, as well as lower taxation and depreciation, partly offset by lower contributions from trading.\nCompared with the fourth quarter 2016, total production increased, mainly due to higher production from Gorgon with three LNG trains online, compared with two trains in the same quarter in 2016.\nLNG liquefaction volumes were lower due to higher maintenance, partly offset by increased liquefaction volumes from Gorgon. LNG sales volumes increased, compared with the fourth quarter 2016, reflecting increased sales of third-party volumes.\nCash flow from operating activities decreased, mainly due to working capital movements, increased cash margining on commodity derivatives and higher tax payments, partly offset by increased earnings and dividends received. Working capital movements accounted for a negative impact of $894 million, mainly from trading, compared with a positive movement of $40 million in the same quarter a year ago.\nFull year identified items mainly reflected a loss of $445 million on fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and a charge of $412 million related to the impact of the US tax reform legislation, partly offset by a gain of $636 million related to the impact of the strengthening Australian dollar on a deferred tax position.\nCompared with 2016, Integrated Gas earnings excluding identified items benefited from higher realised oil, gas, and LNG prices, as well as higher LNG sales volumes. This more than offset the impact of lower liquids production and lower contributions from trading.\nDespite higher earnings, cash flow from operating activities decreased compared with 2016, reflecting negative working capital movements of $2,149 million. 2016 had benefited from positive working capital movements of $2,842 million.\nCompared with 2016, production volumes mainly reflected higher production from Gorgon, offset by the Pearl GTL controlled shutdown and subsequent ramp-up during the first half of 2017.\nLNG sales reflected increased sales of third-party volumes as well as higher liquefaction volumes, mainly due to increased volumes from Gorgon, compared with 2016.\nUPSTREAM Quarters $ million Full year Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 %1 2017 2016 % 2,050 575 35 +5,757 Segment earnings 1,551 (3,674) +142 Of which: Identified 400 13 (19) items (Definition A) (1,540) (970) Earnings excluding 1,650 562 54 identified items 3,091 (2,704) +214 Cash flow from operating 3,765 4,222 3,904 -4 activities 16,337 7,662 +113 Capital investment 3,485 2,805 3,490 - (Definition [C])2 13,648 47,507 -71 Liquids production available for sale 1,542 1,626 1,732 -11 (thousand b/d) 1,622 1,615 - Natural gas production available for sale 7,154 5,974 7,336 -2 (million scf/d) 6,699 6,781 -1 Total production available for sale 2,775 2,656 2,997 -7 (thousand boe/d) 2,777 2,784 - 1.

These identified items were partly offset by a charge of $1,089 million related to the impact of the US tax reform legislation, and impairments of $259 million.\nCompared with the fourth quarter 2016, Upstream earnings excluding identified items benefited from higher realised oil and gas prices, the movements of various deferred tax positions and lower depreciation, partly offset by decreased oil and gas volumes.\nCash flow from operating activities decreased compared with the same quarter last year, mainly due to comparative higher tax payments, partly offset by increased earnings. Working capital movements accounted for a positive impact of $275 million in the quarter, compared with negative working capital movements of $707 million in the same quarter of 2016.\nFourth quarter production decreased by 7%, compared with the same quarter a year ago, mainly due to the divestments of oil sands in Canada, a package of assets in the UK North Sea and onshore assets in Gabon. Excluding these portfolio impacts, production was 1% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago.\nNew field start-ups and the continuing ramp-up of existing fields in the Santos Basin in Brazil, in the Permian in the USA and in Fox Creek in Canada, as well as Kashagan in Kazakhstan and Schiehallion in the UK, contributed some additional 215 thousand boe/d to production compared with the fourth quarter 2016. This more than offset the impact of field declines of 82 thousand boe/d.\nFull year identified items included impairments totalling $2,557 million, mainly related to the sale of Shell's oil sands interests in Canada and its Upstream interests in Ireland. Other identified items comprised a charge of $1,089 million related to the impact of the US tax reform legislation and a total net gain on sale of assets of $1,463 million, mainly related to the divestment of a package of assets in the UK North Sea.\nCompared with 2016, Upstream earnings excluding identified items benefited from higher realised oil and gas prices, the movements of deferred tax assets and lower depreciation, mainly due to divestments.\nCash flow from operating activities increased by 113%, compared with 2016.\nNew field start-ups and the continuing ramp-up of existing fields, in particular Lula Central, Lula Alto, Lula South and Lapa in the Santos Basin in Brazil, Kashagan in Kazakhstan, and Malikai in Malaysia and Stones in the Gulf of Mexico, contributed some additional 196 thousand boe/d to production compared with 2016, which nearly offset the impact of field declines and divestments.\nDOWNSTREAM Quarters $ million Full year Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 %1 2017 2016 % 1,116 2,405 1,575 -29 Segment earnings2 8,258 6,588 +25 Of which: Identified (280) (263) 236 items (Definition [A]) (824) (655) Earnings excluding 1,396 2,668 1,339 +4 identified items2 9,082 7,243 +25 Of which: 884 2,018 823 +7 Oil Products 6,460 5,560 +16 96 891 77 +25 Refining & Trading 2,462 1,469 +68 788 1,127 746 +6 Marketing 3,998 4,091 -2 512 650 516 -1 Chemicals 2,622 1,683 +56 Cash flow from operating 2,649 949 2,286 +16 activities 12,429 3,556 +250 Capital investment 2,208 1,743 2,251 -2 (Definition [C]) 6,416 6,057 +6 Refinery processing 2,589 2,592 2,698 -4 intake (thousand b/d) 2,572 2,701 -5 Oil products sales 6,861 6,557 6,464 +6 volumes (thousand b/d) 6,599 6,483 +2 Chemicals sales volumes 4,688 4,540 4,414 +6 (thousand tonnes) 18,239 17,292 +5 1.

Earnings are presented on a CCS basis (See Note 2).\nFourth quarter identified items primarily reflected a charge of $121 million related to the impact of the US tax reform legislation and redundancy and restructuring provisions of $89 million, partly offset by a total net gain on sale of assets of $103 million, mainly related to the divestment of Shell's LPG marketing business in Hong Kong and Macau.\nCompared with the fourth quarter 2016, Downstream earnings excluding identified items benefited from improved refining industry conditions as well as increased contributions from marketing. This was partly offset by higher operating expenses, as a result of exchange rate effects.\nCash flow from operating activities included negative working capital movements of $402 million, compared with negative movements of $216 million in the same quarter of 2016.\nOil Products\nRefining & Trading earnings excluding identified items benefited mainly from the impact of the Motiva transaction and exchange rate effects, partly offset by lower contributions from trading, compared with the same quarter a year ago.\nRefinery processing intake volumes decreased by 4%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, mainly due to the divestment of the Port Dickson refinery in Malaysia. Excluding this impact, intake volumes were 1% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago. Refinery availability increased to 89 % compared with 87% in the fourth quarter 2016. Marketing earnings excluding identified items reflected lower taxation and increased underlying unit margins, partly offset by adverse exchange rate effects, compared with the same quarter a year ago.\nOil products sales volumes reflected increased refining and trading volumes, partly offset by lower marketing volumes.\nChemicals\nChemicals earnings excluding identified items reflected higher operating expenses and increased depreciation, partly offset by improved industry conditions.\nChemicals manufacturing plant availability remained 93 %, similar to the fourth quarter 2016.\nFull year identified items primarily reflected the impact of the Motiva transaction resulting in a net charge of $546 million, which included a non-cash charge on a taxable gain (see Note 7), as well as impairment losses of $315 million, and redundancy and restructuring provisions of $200 million and a charge of $121 million related to the impact of the US tax reform legislation. These identified items were partly offset by a total gain of $585 million, mainly related to the divestment of assets in Saudi Arabia, Africa, Australia, and Hong Kong and Macau.\nCompared with 2016, Downstream earnings excluding identified items benefited from improved refining and chemicals industry conditions, partly offset by portfolio impacts.\nCash flow from operating activities increased by 250%, reflecting higher earnings and more favourable working capital movements, which comprised a negative impact of $325 million in 2017, compared with negative working capital movements of $6,272 million in 2016.\nOil Products\nRefining & Trading earnings excluding identified items benefited from higher margins as a result of stronger refining industry conditions and portfolio impacts, compared with 2016.\nRefinery processing intake volumes decreased by 5% compared with 2016, as a result of the divestment of the Port Dickson refinery in Malaysia and the Motiva transaction. Excluding these portfolio impacts, intake volumes were 3% higher compared with the same period a year ago. Refinery availability increased to 91%, compared with 90% in 2016.

As a result, total proved reserves on an SEC basis are expected to be 12.2 billion boe. Acquisitions and divestments of 2017 reserves accounted for a net reduction of 1.4 billion boe.\nThe proved Reserves Replacement Ratio on an SEC basis is expected to be 27% for the year and 78% for the 3-year average. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestments, the reserves replacement ratio was 127% for the year.\nFurther information will be provided in the 2017 Annual Report and Form 20-F, which is expected to be filed in March 2018.\nOUTLOOK FOR THE First QUARTER 2018\nCompared with the first quarter 2017, Integrated Gas production volumes are expected to be positively impacted by some 210 thousand boe/d, mainly associated with Pearl, Gorgon and portfolio impacts.\nCompared with the first quarter 2017, Upstream earnings are expected to be negatively impacted by a reduction of some 270 thousand boe/d associated with completed divestments, and positively impacted by some 40 thousand boe/d associated with lower maintenance activities. Earnings are expected to be positively impacted by 40 thousand boe/d associated with restored production in Nigeria; however, the security situation remains sensitive. The production outlook for NAM in the Netherlands is subject to decisions on production volumes by the Dutch government following the earthquake in Zeerijp in January 2018.\nRefinery availability is expected to decrease in the first quarter 2018 as a result of higher levels of maintenance compared with the same period a year ago.\nChemicals manufacturing plant availability is expected to increase in the first quarter 2018, due to lower levels of maintenance compared with the first quarter 2017.\nAs a result of the separation of the Motiva assets and completed divestments, oil products sales volumes are expected to decrease by some 175 thousand barrels per day compared with the same period a year ago.\nCorporate results, excluding the impact of currency exchange rate effects and interest rate movements, are expected to be a net charge of $300 - 350 million in the first quarter and around $1.4 - 1.6 billion for the full year.\nAs a result of the expected change in the fiscal functional currency of some Shell entities in Australia to US dollars, the impact of exchange rate movements of the Australian dollar on deferred tax balances will be significantly reduced in 2018.\nForthcoming events\nThe LNG Outlook will be held on February 26, 2018 in London.\nThe Downstream Open House for Investors will be held on March 21, 2018.\nThe Annual General Meeting will be held on May 22, 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 results and dividends are scheduled to be announced on April 26, 2018.

Statutory accounts for the year ended December 31, 2016 were published in Shell's Annual Report and a copy was delivered to the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales. The auditor's report on those accounts was unqualified, did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the report and did not contain a statement under sections 498(2) or 498(3) of the Act.\nSegment information\nSegment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings), which is the earnings measure used by the Chief Executive Officer for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. On this basis, the purchase price of volumes sold during the period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same period after making allowance for the tax effect. CCS earnings therefore exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts. Sales between segments are based on prices generally equivalent to commercially available prices.\nINFORMATION BY SEGMENT Quarters $ million Full year Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 Third-party revenue 8,205 8,316 7,031 Integrated Gas 32,674 25,282 2,644 1,654 1,418 Upstream 7,723 6,412 74,561 65,843 56,300 Downstream 264,731 201,823 12 17 18 Corporate 51 74 85,422 75,830 64,767 Total third-party revenue 305,179 233,591 Inter-segment revenue 1,199 1,101 1,087 Integrated Gas 3,978 3,908 8,258 7,991 8,218 Upstream 32,469 26,524 1,281 1,142 796 Downstream 4,248 1,727 - - - Corporate - - CCS earnings 848 1,217 28 Integrated Gas 5,078 2,529 2,050 575 35 Upstream 1,551 (3,674) 1,116 2,405 1,575 Downstream 8,258 6,588 (838) (394) (566) Corporate (2,416) (1,751) 3,176 3,803 1,072 Total 12,471 3,692 RECONCILIATION OF INCOME FOR THE PERIOD TO CCS EARNINGS Quarters Full year Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 Income/(loss) attributable to Royal Dutch Shell plc 3,807 4,087 1,541 shareholders 12,977 4,575 Income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling 130 125 67 interest 458 202 Income/(loss) for the 3,937 4,212 1,608 period 13,435 4,777 Current cost of supplies adjustment: (1,022) (528) (633) Purchases (1,252) (1,284) 287 145 173 Taxation 349 344 Share of profit/(loss) of joint ventures and (26) (26) (76) associates (61) (145) Current cost of supplies (761) (409) (536) adjustment1 (964) (1,085) 3,176 3,803 1,072 CCS earnings 12,471 3,692 of which: CCS earnings attributable to Royal Dutch Shell plc 3,082 3,698 1,032 shareholders 12,081 3,533 CCS earnings attributable to non-controlling 94 105 40 interest 390 159 1.

The merger reserve increased in 2016 following the issuance of shares for the acquisition of BG Group plc. The capital redemption reserve was established in connection with repurchases of shares of Royal Dutch Shell plc. The share plan reserve is in respect of equity-settled share-based compensation plans.\n6. Derivative contracts and debt excluding finance lease liabilities\nThe table below provides the carrying amounts of derivatives contracts held, disclosed in accordance with\nIFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.\nDERIVATIVE CONTRACTS $ million Dec 31, 2017 Dec 31, 2016 Included within: Trade and other receivables - non-current 919 405 Trade and other receivables - current 5,304 5,957 Trade and other payables - non-current 981 3,315 Trade and other payables - current 5,253 6,418\nAs disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, presented in the Annual Report and Form 20-F for that year, Shell is exposed to the risks of changes in fair value of its financial assets and liabilities. The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values at December 31, 2017 are consistent with those used in the year ended December 31, 2016. The carrying amounts of derivative contracts measured using predominantly unobservable inputs have not changed materially since December 31, 2016.\nThe table below provides the comparison of the fair value with the carrying amount of debt excluding finance lease liabilities, disclosed in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.\nDEBT EXCLUDING FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES $ million Dec 31, 2017 Dec 31, 2016 Carrying amount 70,140 77,617 Fair value1 74,650 80,408 1. Mainly determined from the prices Quote: d for these securities.\n7. Motiva joint venture\nOn May 1, 2017, Shell and Saudi Refining Inc. (\"SRI\") completed the separation of assets, liabilities and businesses of Motiva Enterprises LLC (\"Motiva\"), a 50:50 joint venture. Following the transaction, Shell assumed sole ownership of two refineries, eleven distribution terminals and certain Shell-branded fuel retail markets in the United States. The transaction enables Shell to combine the assets retained from the joint venture with other Shell Downstream assets in North America, in line with its strategy to deliver increased cash and returns through simpler and highly integrated businesses. It is accounted for as a disposal of Shell's 50% interest in the Motiva joint venture and a subsequent business acquisition.\nThe fair value of Shell's interest in the joint venture on May 1, 2017 was $3,847 million. This fair value was used, for accounting purposes, as the consideration recognised for the disposal. The disposal gave rise to a taxable gain, leading to a non-cash charge of $574 million on completion of the transaction. Consequently, income for the second quarter 2017 included a net charge of $546 million representing the difference between the net carrying amount of Shell's interest in the joint venture (including associated deferred tax liabilities) of $3,819 million and its fair value, and the tax charge which crystallised upon the disposal. This net charge was reported under \"Interest and other income\".\nThe fair value of $3,847 million also served as the consideration paid for the net assets acquired, in combination with $862 million received in cash from SRI in the second quarter 2017. The fair value of net assets acquired was $2,544 million. As a result, goodwill of $441 million was initially recognised on the business acquisition in the second quarter 2017. In the third quarter 2017, goodwill was reduced to $391 million following updates to the provisionally agreed cash settlement from SRI and to the fair value of the net assets acquired. In the fourth quarter 2017, goodwill was reduced to $355 million as set out in the table below. The fair value of Shell's interest in the joint venture, the fair value of the net assets acquired, and therefore the resultant goodwill, remains provisional although no significant adjustments are expected.\nGOODWILL RECOGNISED As previously $ million published Adjustment As adjusted Fair value of Shell's interest in the Motiva joint venture 1 3,847 - 3,847 Less: Cash settlement 930 27 957 Less: Fair value of net assets acquired 2 Intangible assets 641 15 656 Property, plant and equipment 2,699 (14) 2,685 Other non-current assets 67 - 67 Trade and other receivables (current) - 27 27 Inventories 928 (1) 927 Debt (non-current) (115) - (115) Trade and other payables (non-current) (65) - (65) Deferred tax (non-current liabilities) (312) (6) (318) Retirement benefits (non-current liabilities) (982) 7 (975) Decommissioning and other provisions (non-current) (132) - (132) Trade and other payables (current) (100) (7) (107) Other current liabilities (103) (12) (115) 2,526 9 2,535 Goodwill 391 (36) 355 1. Based on Shell's assessment. 2. Based on an independent valuation using cash flow projections based on the historical performance of the newly acquired assets, forecasted pricing for various related commodities and existing business plan information.\nFor the full year 2017, the total cash impact of this transaction was $887 million reported under \"Proceeds from sale of joint ventures and associates\" in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (third quarter 2017: $842 million). This is the net effect of the $957 million cash received from SRI and a payment by Shell of $70 million to settle the transfer of certain retirement benefit liabilities to SRI.\nDEFINITIONS\nIdentified items\nIdentified items comprise: divestment gains and losses, impairments, fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts, redundancy and restructuring, the impact of exchange rate movements on certain deferred tax balances, and other items. These items, either individually or collectively, can cause volatility to net income, in some cases driven by external factors, which may hinder the comparative understanding of Shell's financial results from period to period. The impact of identified items on Shell's CCS earnings is shown below.\nIDENTIFIED ITEMS AFTER TAX Quarters $ million Full year Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 1,275 324 1,061 Divestment gains/(losses) 1,657 1,631 (321) (405) (293) Impairments (3,042) (2,108) Fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and (541) (398) (239) certain gas contracts (335) (644) (107) (71) (48) Redundancy and restructuring (379) (1,428) Impact of exchange rate (111) 275 (433) movements on tax balances 622 253 (1,416) (130) (811) Other1 (2,234) (1,467) (1,221) (405) (763) Impact on CCS earnings (3,711) (3,763) Of which: (788) (65) (879) Integrated Gas (190) (1,171) 400 13 (19) Upstream (1,540) (970) (280) (263) 236 Downstream (824) (655) (553) (90) (101) Corporate (1,157) (967) Impact on CCS earnings attributable to - - - non-controlling interest (28) (111) Impact on CCS earnings (1,221) (405) (763) attributable to shareholders (3,683) (3,652) 1. Fourth quarter 2017 includes a non-cash charge of $2,014 million primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred tax positions following the US tax reform legislation.\nThe categories above represent the nature of the items identified irrespective of whether the items relate to Shell subsidiaries or joint ventures and associates. The after-tax impact of identified items of joint ventures and associates is fully reported within \"Share of profit of joint ventures and associates\" on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Identified items related to subsidiaries are consolidated and reported across appropriate lines of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Only pre-tax identified items reported by subsidiaries are taken into account in the calculation of \"underlying operating expenses\" (Definition G).\nFair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts : In the ordinary course of business, Shell enters into contracts to supply or purchase oil and gas products as well as power and environmental products. Derivative contracts are entered into for mitigation of resulting economic exposures (generally price exposure) and these derivative contracts are carried at period-end market price (fair value), with movements in fair value recognised in income for the period. Supply and purchase contracts entered into for operational purposes are, by contrast, recognised when the transaction occurs; furthermore, inventory is carried at historical cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. As a consequence, accounting mismatches occur because: (a) the supply or purchase transaction is recognised in a different period; or (b) the inventory is measured on a different basis. In addition, certain contracts are, due to pricing or delivery conditions, deemed to contain embedded derivatives or written options and are also required to be carried at fair value even though they are entered into for operational purposes. The accounting impacts are reported as identified items.\nImpacts of exchange rate movements on tax balances represent the impact on tax balances of exchange rate movements arising on (a) the conversion to dollars of the local currency tax base of non-monetary assets and liabilities, as well as losses (this primarily impacts the Integrated Gas and Upstream segments) and (b) the conversion of dollar-denominated inter-segment loans to local currency, leading to taxable exchange rate gains or losses (this primarily impacts the Corporate segment).\nOther identified items represent other credits or charges Shell's management assesses should be excluded to provide additional insight, such as the impact arising from the US tax reform legislation and certain provisions for onerous contracts or litigation.\nB. Basic CCS earnings per share\nBasic CCS earnings per share is calculated as CCS earnings attributable to Royal Dutch Shell plc shareholders (see Note 2), divided by the weighted average number of shares used as the basis for basic earnings per share (see Note 3).\nC. Capital investment\nCapital investment is a measure used to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. It comprises capital expenditure, exploration expense excluding well write-offs, new investments in joint ventures and associates, new finance leases and investments in Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream securities, all of which on an accruals basis. In 2016, it also included the capital investment related to the acquisition of BG Group plc.\nThe reconciliation of \"Capital expenditure\" to \"Capital investment\" is as follows.\nQuarters $ million Full year Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 5,861 5,018 5,714 Capital expenditure1 20,845 22,116 Capital investment related to the acquisition of BG Group - - - plc - 52,904 Investments in joint ventures 202 42 527 and associates 595 1,330 Exploration expense, excluding exploration wells 380 280 416 written off 1,048 1,274 330 312 215 Finance leases 1,074 2,343 5 90 41 Other1 444 (90) 6,778 5,742 6,913 Capital investment 24,006 79,877 Of which: 1,043 1,148 1,145 Integrated Gas 3,827 26,214 3,485 2,805 3,490 Upstream 13,648 47,507 2,208 1,743 2,251 Downstream 6,416 6,057 42 46 27 Corporate 115 99 1. Full year 2017 includes capital expenditure of $911 million and, under \"Other\", a payable position of $375 million, related to the acquisition of Marathon Oil Canada Corporation in Canada.\nD. Divestments\nDivestments is a measure used to monitor the progress of Shell's divestment programme. This measure comprises proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and businesses, joint ventures and associates, and other Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream investments, reported in \"Cash flow from investing activities\", adjusted onto an accruals basis and for any share consideration received or contingent consideration recognised upon divestment, as well as proceeds from the sale of interests in entities while retaining control (for example, proceeds from sale of interest in Shell Midstream Partners, L.P.), which are included in \"Change in non-controlling interest\" within \"Cash flow from financing activities\".\nWith effect from January 1, 2017, consideration received in the form of shares is valued and included in this measure upon completion of the divestment transactions, instead of when these shares are disposed of. This change in timing of recognition enables Shell to better evaluate its progress against its divestment programme. The share or contingent consideration is not remeasured thereafter, including if and when the shares received are eventually disposed of, or contingent consideration is realised. Comparative information for 2016 has been adjusted to include the share consideration received upon the divestments of Shell's interests in the Deep Basin and Gundy acreages (Canada) and the Brutus TLP and Glider subsea production system (USA), both in the fourth quarter 2016.\nIn future periods, the proceeds from any disposal of shares received as divestment consideration, and proceeds from realisation of contingent consideration, will be included in \"Cash flow from investing activities\".\nThe reconciliation of \"Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and businesses\" to \"Divestments\" is as follows.\nQuarters $ million Full year Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 2,866 236 1,306 and businesses1 8,808 2,072 Proceeds from sale of joint 221 874 1,411 ventures and associates2 2,177 1,565 Share and contingent 217 - 275 consideration3 3,046 275 Proceeds from sale of interests in entities while - 275 289 retaining control 278 1,108 3,170 (20) (3) Other adjustments4 3,031 (36) 6,474 1,365 3,278 Divestments 17,340 4,984 Of which: 3,021 22 47 Integrated Gas 3,077 352 3,254 187 1,480 Upstream 11,542 1,726 199 1,156 1,747 Downstream 2,703 2,889 - - 4 Corporate 18 17 1. Full year 2017 includes $5,188 million related to the Canada oil sands divestment. As reflected in Definition C, capital expenditure of $911 million and a payable position of $375 million, together $1,286 million, were also recorded as part of the oil sands transaction and are integral to the divestment programme. 2. Full year 2017 includes the Motiva transaction, see Note 7. Also integral to the divestment programme is $1,331 million primarily related to net debt assumed by the counterparty in the Motiva transaction, which would have otherwise increased the cash consideration received by Shell. 3. Full year 2017 includes $2,829 million for shares in Canadian Natural Resources Limited received as partial consideration for the Canada oil sands divestment. 4. Fourth quarter 2017 includes proceeds of $2,635 million from the sale of shares in Woodside Petroleum Limited.\nE. Return on average capital employed\nReturn on average capital employed (ROACE) measures the efficiency of Shell's utilisation of the capital that it employs. In this calculation, ROACE is defined as income for the current and previous three quarters, adjusted for after-tax interest expense, as a percentage of the average capital employed for the same period. Capital employed consists of total equity, current debt and non-current debt.\n$ million Quarters Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 Income for current and previous three quarters 13,435 11,106 4,777 Interest expense after tax 2,995 3,088 2,730 Income before interest expense 16,430 14,194 7,507 Capital employed - opening 280,988 286,558 222,500 Capital employed - closing 283,477 286,889 280,988 Capital employed - average 282,233 286,723 251,744 ROACE 5.8% 5.0% 3.0%\nReturn on average capital employed on a CCS basis excluding identified items is defined as the sum of CCS earnings attributable to shareholders excluding identified items for the current and previous three quarters, as a percentage of the average capital employed for the same period.\n$ million Quarters Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 CCS earnings excluding identified items for current and previous three quarters 15,764 13,256 7,185 Capital employed - average 282,233 286,723 251,744 ROACE on a CCS basis excluding identified items 5.6% 4.6% 2.9%\nF.
