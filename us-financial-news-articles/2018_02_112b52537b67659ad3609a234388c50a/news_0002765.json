No problem when you win 3-0. You need to carry on. \n“You have to go through. You have to build on the good things and work on the not-so-good things. Sadio on an average day is still a fantastic player, that’s the good news.” \nKlopp said he was pleased with new signing Virgil van Dijk’s progress in his first month at Merseyside. \n“We will all see Van Dijk at his best after the summer but we don’t have the time to wait until then, why should we? He can bring a lot of things in already and that’s good.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T11:21:33.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
