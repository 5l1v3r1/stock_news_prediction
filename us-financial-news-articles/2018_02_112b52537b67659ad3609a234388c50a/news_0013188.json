Mitsubishi Paper shares closed on Tuesday at 719 yen.\nThey said they plan to cut costs by cooperating on logistics and sharing raw materials purchases.\nDomestic demand for printing paper has fallen 30 percent from a decade ago due to a shift to digital media, while competition from Asian rivals was also threatening Japanese paper manufacturers, they said.\n“In this environment, Oji Holdings and Mitsubishi Paper Mills cannot continue stable operations or growth if they stay on the current management strategy track,” they said.\nReporting by Ritsuko AndoEditing by Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:48:17.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
