We acknowledge the management work to transform the company's business model and to develop a comprehensive offer of software and digital data flow management solutions for healthcare and B2B ecosystems. Cegedim now benefits from strong fundamentals and core shareholders that allow the Group to look towards the future with ambition.\"\nJean-Claude Labrune, Chairman and CEO of Cegedim, adds: \"Cegedim wishes to thank Bpifrance for its support in the transformation of the Group since its initial investment and through its presence at the board of directors. This sale will allow the company to grow and diversify its shareholder base and contribute to increase its stock liquidity.\"\nThis transfer of shares has taken the form of a private placement via an accelerated bookbuilding process to French and international institutional investors at a price of 35 euros per share.\nFollowing the settlement, Bpifrance Participations sells thereby 12% of Cegedim's capital, i.e nearly its entire stake (15% before the transaction), breaching downwards the 5% threshold.\nCegedim's free-float increases to reach now 44% of capital (vs. 32% before the transaction).\nIn the context of the transaction, the shareholders' agreement dated 28 October 2009 between M. Jean-Claude Labrune, FCB (family holding controlled by M. Jean-Claude Labrune) and Bpifrance as well as the concert between the parties have been terminated. In addition, Bpifrance Participations has committed in the context of the shareholders' agreement amendment for a lock-up on 3% of Cegedim's capital until 28 October 2019.\nOddo BHF has acted as Lead Manager and Bookrunner for the placement on behalf of Bpifrance Participations.\nThis press release does not constitute a sale offering of securities and the sale of Cegedim shares by Bpifrance Participations does not constitute a public offering.\nContributors:\nBpifrance : Anne-Sophie Hérelle, Marie Artaud-Dewitte, Grégory Lecomte, Andy Cheremond\nAdvisors : ODDO BHF (Vincent Rietzler, Laurent Danino, Sylvain Tessier) and Solferino Associés (Bernard-Olivier Becker, Camille Chastagner)\nAbout Bpifrance\nFormed by the law of 31 December 2012, Bpifrance (a public sector investment bank) is the outcome of the merger between OSEO, the FSI, CDC Entreprises and FSI Régions.
