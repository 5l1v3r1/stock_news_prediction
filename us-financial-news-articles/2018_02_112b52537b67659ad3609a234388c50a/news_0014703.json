Kalanick confirmed the two of them discussed the possibility of Uber acquiring his company, even though no business existed at that time. Kalanick saying it was either \"late 2015 or early 2016\"\nNotes from John Bares, Uber's engineering manager, during a meeting with Kalanick suggest Kalanick wanted \"IP\" or intellectual property from the acquisition of Levandowski's company.\nNotes from another meeting between Kalanick and Levandowski from January 3, 2016, show the two discussed lasers for self-driving car technology.\nIn its opening arguments on Monday Waymo painted Uber as a competitor that \"needed to win at all costs.\"\nWaymo spent a significant amount of time on Tuesday questioning Kalanick about prior comments he made saying autonomous driving is an \"existential\" crisis for Uber. Kalanick responded by saying \"If you're running a tech company and you're not making new innovation, you become part of the past.\"\nUber however, is arguing that this case is about the fight for top engineering talent. \"Engineers, California and everywhere else in America, are free to go from one job to the other. They don't get a lobotomy in between. They bring all their engineering talent, all the skills they've learned, their education, the publicly known stuff they've worked with, and they can work on the very same technology in the new company,\" Uber's lawyer Bill Carmody said Monday.\nOverall, this case hangs on whether or not Waymo can prove that Uber improperly acquired, used, and benefited from any of eight \"trade secrets\" in question.\nUber argued on Monday that these trade secrets are not trade secrets at all, and that Waymo brought this case over fears of losing talent to competitors.\nWaymo is seeking damages from Uber and an injunction to shut down its plans to use driverless car technology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T01:41:24.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
