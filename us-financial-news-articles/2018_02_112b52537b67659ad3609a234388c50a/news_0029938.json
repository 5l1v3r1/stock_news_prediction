Last year, it toughened the application process for getting safety certificates for imports of GMO soybeans, delaying cargoes and curbing purchases.\nUkraine accounted for about two-thirds of China’s 2.83 million tonnes of corn imports last year, with the United States making up a quarter.\nExport prices from Ukraine have jumped on the higher demand, the senior trader said, rising by $20 since the start of the year to this week hit their highest since July 2016 at $180 per tonne.\n“It is hard for U.S. corn to come in now due to the GMO issue. Getting the GMO processing permit is very difficult,” said a corn trader in eastern China who canceled a U.S. cargo.\n“I had only ordered 7,000 tonnes of U.S. corn, but had to cancel the order and turned to Ukraine,” he said.\nOn Sunday, Beijing launched an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into imports of sorghum from the United States, fuelling concerns in the industry that soybeans might be caught up in trade action.\nReporting by Hallie Gu and Dominique Patton; Editing by Josephine Mason and Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T09:11:10.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
