Washington recently cut aid to Pakistan, India’s nuclear-armed neighbour and arch-rival, over accusations it failed to root out Taliban and Haqqani network militants that have contributed to the long-running war in Afghanistan.\nIndia has increased aid to Afghanistan in recent years and promised in 2016 to ship more arms, aggravating fears in Pakistan it will become wedged between two hostile nations.\nThe two leaders also addressed the plight of more than 680,000 Muslim Rohingya who have fled Myanmar since last year to Bangladesh after the Myanmar military cracked down in northern Rakhine State, amid witness reports of killings, looting and rape, in response to militant attacks on security forces.\nTrump and Modi also addressed North Korea, the White House said. Washington has been leading diplomatic efforts to ramp up international pressure on Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons and missile programs, out of concern they may eventually enable North Korea to attack the United States.\nAlthough India and North Korea maintain diplomatic offices in each other’s capitals, New Delhi has banned trade of most goods with the country, except for food and medicine.\nIndian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj met with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in October in New Delhi and defended India’s ties with Pyongyang, saying some level of diplomatic presence was necessary to keep open channels of communication.\nReporting by Eric Beech; Writing by Eric Walsh; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T03:49:55.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
