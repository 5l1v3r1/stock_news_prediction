He added he expected leu currency loan rates to rise only marginally as a result of Wednesday’s hike.\n“We do not expect a long battle ... the hope is we will manage to return it within the target by year-end.”\nNew inflation forecasts will be released on Feb. 9.\nIsarescu also said policymakers could not rush to move interest rates without looking at the decisions made by neighbouring central and eastern European states such as Hungary and Poland, as well as the European Central Bank.\nRomania is the second among central European peers to start tightening from record low levels, after Czechs.\nOn Wednesday, the Polish central bank kept its main interest rate steady at a record low 1.50 percent. Most analysts expect the next Polish rate hike in early 2019.\n“I expect the central bank will buy as much time as possible this year,” said Ciprian Dascalu, chief economist at ING Romania. He expects two more hikes this year as well as measures to adjust market liquidity, with further tightening due in 2019.\nThe Romanian leu was trading at 4.6515 per euro at 1420 GMT, 0.1 percent softer on the day.\nWednesday’s move would also boost the central bank’s deposit and lending facility rates to 1.25 percent and 3.25 percent, from 1.00 and 3.00 percent respectively.
