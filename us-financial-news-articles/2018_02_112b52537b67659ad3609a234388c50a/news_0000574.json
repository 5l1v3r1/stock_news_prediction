Their insulin business looked challenged in the quarter, with both Tresiba and modern insulins performing worse than expected,” said Sydbank analyst Soren Lontoft.\nThe U.S. market accounts for around half of Novo’s sales and Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen warned conditions were tough there, with drug prices a contentious political issue.\n“There is a continued pressure on pricing in the United States,” Jorgensen told a conference call.\nHe added that higher rebates to customers in the United States towards the end of 2017 “took growth in the fourth quarter a bit down.”\nNovo reiterated its 2018 sales growth forecast of 2-5 percent and operating profit at 1-5 percent growth, both in local currencies.\nHowever, 2018 sales and operating profit measured in Danish crowns will be hit by a weaker dollar, Novo said.\nSales growth is expected to be 7 percentage points lower than in local currencies, compared with a previous guidance of 3 percentage points lower. Operating profit growth is expected to be 10 percentage points lower, compared with its previous guidance of percentage points lower.\nNovo Nordisk said earlier this week it will continue to hunt for promising assets to refill its blood products business, after missing out on Ablynx.\n“We could not see the level of value that the transaction took place at,” said Novo Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard.\nNovo said Brandgaard will step down as CFO later this month to be replaced by Karsten Munk Knudsen, currently senior vice president of corporate finance.\nBrandgaard will continue as executive vice president responsible for Novo’s biopharm business and legal affairs.\nSwiss drugmaker Roche forecast on Thursday that U.S. tax changes would mean its profit growth outstrips sales in 2018.\nNovo said it expects to benefit from the U.S. tax changes by around 1 percentage point.
