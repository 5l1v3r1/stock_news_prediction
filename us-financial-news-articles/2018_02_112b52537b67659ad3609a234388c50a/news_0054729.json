PES is asking a bankruptcy judge to shed roughly $350 million of its current RFS compliance costs, owed to the EPA which administers the program, as part of its restructuring package.\nThe other sources said the meeting will consider whether to cap prices for biofuel credits, let higher-ethanol blends be sold all year, as well as efforts to get speculators out of the market.\nThe meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, will include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas , Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa , along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt , Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and potentially Energy Secretary Rick Perry , according to the sources, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\nOfficials at the EPA, Agriculture Department, and Energy Department declined to comment. A White House official, Kelly Love, said she had no announcement on the matter at this time.\nThe offices of Cruz, Ernst and Grassley did not immediately return requests for comment.\nThe sources said the options moving forward would be constrained by political and legal realities that have derailed previous efforts at reform.\nThe Trump administration has already considered changes to the RFS sought by refiners this year — including reducing the amount of biofuels required to be blended annually under the regulation, or shifting the responsibility for blending to supply terminals — only to retreat in the face of opposition from corn-state lawmakers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T06:41:58.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
