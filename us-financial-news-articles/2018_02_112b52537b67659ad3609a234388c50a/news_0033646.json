Encouraged by the Wall Street’s bounce, Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.45 percent on Wednesday to lend the dollar further support.\nNear-term focus was on whether dollar/yen could hold above 107.320, as a drop below that level would take the greenback to its lowest since November 2016 and clear the path for further losses.\n“Dollar/yen has managed to stay above 107.320 for the time being but a fall beneath that would accelerate its losses towards 106,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior forex strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n“Trend-following macro funds see the yen appreciating further. There are no fresh factors, but for speculators, anything that appears yen-supportive is welcome, even in hindsight.”\nThe dollar’s fall against the yen comes against the currency’s broader weakening against a number of peers.\nThe U.S. currency attracted demand during the global market tumult seen earlier this month, although it had fallen to a three-year low against a basket of currencies in January.\nThe dollar was weighed by factors including the prospect of the United States pursuing a weak dollar strategy and other countries normalising their monetary policy.\nThe dollar index against a group of six major currencies stood little changed at 89.728 after dropping nearly 0.6 percent overnight.\nThe euro was steady at $1.2352 following gains of 0.4 percent the previous day.\nThe Australian dollar was 0.05 percent higher at $0.7865 and the New Zealand dollar gained 0.1 percent to $0.7282.
