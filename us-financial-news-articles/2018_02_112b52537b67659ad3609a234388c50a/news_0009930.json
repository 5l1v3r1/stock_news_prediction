Liquidia’s proprietary PRINT ® technology is designed to optimize the safety, efficacy or route of administration of a wide range of therapies by engineering uniform drug particles in a wide variety of compositions, sizes and shapes. Currently, Liquidia is developing two of its own product candidates using PRINT ® particles: LIQ861 for the treatment of PAH and LIQ865 for the treatment of local post-operative pain. Our lead product candidate, LIQ861, currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial (INSPIRE), is designed to improve the therapeutic profile of treprostinil by enabling deep-lung delivery and higher dose levels than current inhaled therapies by using a convenient, disposable dry powder inhaler. LIQ865, currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial, is designed to deliver sustained release particles of the non-opioid bupivacaine, a local analgesic, to treat post-operative pain. In addition to developing its own product candidates, Liquidia collaborates with leading pharmaceutical companies to apply its PRINT ® technology across existing drugs, new chemical entities (NCEs) and biologics. Liquidia is based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
