REUTERS/Peter Nicholls “We will be conducting an orderly wind-down of the store portfolio over the coming weeks... We will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business,” Simon Thomas, joint administrator and partner at Moorfields, said in a statement.\n“Whilst this process is likely to affect many Toys R Us staff, whether some or all of the stores will close remains to be decided.”\nToys R Us operates more than 100 stores in Britain and also trades as Babies R Us. Moorfields said that the administration did not affect the global operations of Toys R Us outside the UK.\nCreditors of the British arm of the chain had backed a restructuring plan in December in a bid to stave off administration.\nReporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Guy Faulconbridge, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:36:09.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
