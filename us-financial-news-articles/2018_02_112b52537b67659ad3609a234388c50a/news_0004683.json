Wake Forest was 4-for-12 from beyond the arc in the half.\nMoore finished with 12 rebounds for Wake Forest, helping offset Florida State’s front line.\nWake Forest had 12 turnovers, but that was an improvement after averaging more than 20 in two games last week.\nFlorida State had won six meetings in a row with Wake Forest before Wednesday night.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:02:21.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
