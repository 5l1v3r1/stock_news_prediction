Seven and i Holdings Co Ltd, operator of Japan’s largest chain of convenience stores, announced last year it would cooperate on fresh food delivery with Askul Corp.\nAmazon is increasing its range of services in Japan, trialing its “Fresh” food delivery service in parts of Tokyo, and opening a large photography studio in Tokyo this spring as it moves to ramp up its fashion range.\nReporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T07:22:13.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
