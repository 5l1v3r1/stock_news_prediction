REUTERS/Laszlo Balogh/File Photo “It’s not a good benchmark, it’s not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing. We feel that everybody is unique, and some women can go slower than that and still have a normal vaginal birth.”\nA better threshold is 5 cm of dilation during the first 12 hours for a new mother and 10 hours in subsequent labors, WHO said. A woman’s vital signs and baby’s heartbeat should be monitored closely throughout.\nCaesarian rates of more than 10-15 percent do not appear to lead to any significant drop in mortality rates of mother or child, said WHO’s Metin Gülmezoglu.\nAmong middle-income economies, Latin America, Turkey, China and Iran have high caesarean rates, but so do some hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa, “and often not for the right reasons”, he said.\nWomen should be allowed to choose their delivery position,, including squatting or sitting, and be offered pain relief, Oladapo said.\n“We want a situation where women have an informed choice, and they are involved in decision-making,” he said.\nEpisiotomy, a cut made to the woman’s outer genital area to widen the birth canal, is not recommended routinely. “If anything it actually does more harm than good,” he said.\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Alison Williams\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T16:11:54.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
