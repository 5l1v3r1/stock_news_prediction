The Port Authority had no immediate additional comment.\nA September 2016 report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said the incident was probably caused by the pilot’s use of excessive reverse thrust, resulting in an “inability to maintain directional control” of the airplane.\nIt said other factors were the pilot’s focus on other aspects of the landing, and stress resulting from concern about stopping on the relatively short, snow-covered runway.\nNone of the 127 passengers and five crew members was seriously injured, though 29 passengers suffered minor injuries, the NTSB said. here\nThe case is Port Authority of New York and New Jersey v Delta Air Lines Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 450357/2018.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T00:21:23.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
