B. von Wettberg, a plant geneticist at the University of Vermont, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nHe said researchers were working with the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), an India-based agricultural research body, to ensure that the resilient seeds make it to market once they are available.\nAbout one in five people globally depend on legumes such as chickpeas as their primary source of protein, Von Wettberg said.\nHe called for better protection for and conservation of wild varieties of crops, which could have traits that would allow them to survive and thrive under climate pressures.\n“They (wild crops) may be our most potent weapon against climate change,” said Chikelu Mba, plant geneticist at the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n“They are irreplaceable,” he said by phone, adding that chickpeas were vital for nutrition in many developing countries.\nScientists are also assessing wild rice varietals to combat climate change, with one species growing in northern Australia’s crocodile-infested waters raising hope for a more nutritious grain that is drought- and pest-resistant.\nReporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Robert Carmichael and Kieran Guilbert; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, corruption and climate change.
