That has pushed five-year German Bund yields above zero for the first time since 2015. UK gilt prices also cheapened significantly.\nInvestors reacted by bidding the euro broadly higher from a more than two-year top on the yen and a three-year peak on the dollar at $1.2509.\nYet rising U.S. yields have failed to prop up the dollar index, which slipped for a third straight day to loiter around a three-year trough.\n“The trade weighted dollar continued to weaken very broadly in 2018 with the two key pillars being growth strengthening elsewhere in the world, supporting emerging market forex... and central bank divergence narrowing, supporting euro, yen and British pound,” JP Morgan analyst Charles Perrin wrote in a note to clients.\n“The currency was also dragged by U.S. politics.”\nThe United States is witnessing deep partisan political divisions and intraparty squabbles with lawmakers unable to find common ground on most issues. The federal government shut down last month for three days when Republicans and Democrats failed to strike a deal to fund public operations.\nThe dollar is not far off a 4-1/2 month low against the yen .\nBitcoin, the world’s biggest and the best known cryptocurrency, continued to tumble after hitting a record high $19,666 in December on the Bitstamp exchange. It was last down 11 percent at a more than two-month trough of $8,940.\nEQUITIES PAUSE Asian shares were muted following mixed signals from Wall Street. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan paused around record highs.\nJapan’s Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent while South Korea’s benchmark index eased 0.4 percent.\nOn Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.14 percent, the S&P 500 eased 0.06 percent and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.35 percent.\nHigh-profile tech companies reported after the closing bell on Wall Street, with Amazon.com surging 6 percent after reporting the largest profit in its history.\nAlphabet was down nearly 3 percent in extended trade after its earnings missed estimates.\nApple bounced more than 3 percent after posting its results.\nIn commodities, gold hovered near a six-month peak at $1,348.2 an ounce.\nOil rose after a survey showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ commitment to its supply cuts remains in place, even as U.S. production topped 10 million barrels per day for the first time since 1970.\nU.S. crude rose 36 cents to $66.16 per barrel and Brent edged 89 cents higher to $69.78.\nEditing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T07:30:53.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
