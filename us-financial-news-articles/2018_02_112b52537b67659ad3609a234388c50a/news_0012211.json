Their terms were not made public. \nThe families had accused banana distributor Chiquita of providing more than $220,000 in material support to the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) from 1989 to 1999, in payments averaging $32,000 a year. \nThey claimed that made the company liable for the FARC’s killing of six Americans - five Christian missionaries and a geologist - in the 1990s. \n“It has been a very lengthy journey for the families of the victims, and we hope this agreement can bring them some closure,” said Ramon Rasco, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs. \nGary Osen, another plaintiffs’ lawyer, declined to comment on the size of the settlements. \nChiquita said in a statement that it was “pleased to have reached an amicable resolution with the plaintiffs.” \n“With this matter concluded, Chiquita will continue its focus on being a good citizen and partner in the countries where we do business,” it said. \nLast month, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that Chiquita would have to face a jury trial of claims that the company was liable to the families under the federal Anti-Terrorism Act. \nThe claims are part of a long-running consolidated litigation by citizens of the United States and other countries over payments made by Chiquita to Colombian paramilitary groups. The case would have been the first trial in that litigation, and the first Anti-Terrorism Act trial against a U.S. corporation. \nThe U.S. government designated the FARC as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. \nChiquita argued in court papers that it was the victim of extortion by the FARC and other groups. \nThe company pleaded guilty in 2007 to engaging in transactions with a different Colombian designated terror group and agreed to pay a $25 million criminal fine. \nThe FARC, which kept its acronym by changing its name to the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, signed a peace accord with Colombia in late 2016, putting an end to its part in a conflict that killed more than 220,000 people over five decades.
