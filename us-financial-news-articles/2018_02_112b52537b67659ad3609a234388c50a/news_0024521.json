CASH PRIZE \nJohnson Sirleaf was travelling abroad on Monday and could not immediately be reached to comment on the prize. \n“This new award puts the icing on the cake for Ellen,” said Nora King, 27, a student in the capital Monrovia. “She has been a good example for women’s leadership around the world. Some people don’t really realise what she did for Liberia.” \nThe prize is $5 million paid out over 10 years, with another $200,000 annually throughout the winner’s lifetime. \nFounded by freed American slaves, Liberia is Africa’s oldest modern republic. But it has been plagued by years of unrest and bloodshed, including two civil wars notorious for their brutality and use of child soldiers. \nJohnson Sirleaf took on the leadership of Liberia at a time when it was still seeking to heal deep divisions and rebuild infrastructure. Her administration then faced a global commodities crash that crippled its nascent mining industry followed by the deadliest Ebola epidemic in history. \nDespite praise for her role in shoring up peace, she was criticised for failing to tackle corruption or do much to lift ordinary Liberians out of poverty. \nWeah rode a wave of dissatisfaction with her administration to a landslide victory over her vice-president Joseph Boakai in a December run-off election. Johnson Sirleaf was barred from seeking re-election by a constitutional term limit. \n“The country is broke, the economy is poor like many Liberians, and corruption and reconciliation are still issues after 12 years of her leadership,” said Monrovia resident James Ballah, 36. “These institutions always reward the wrong people.” Additional reporting by Alphonso Toweh; Writing by Ed Cropley and Joe Bavier; Editing by Alison Williams", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T11:26:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
