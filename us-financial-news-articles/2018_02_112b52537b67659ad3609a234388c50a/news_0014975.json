Traders are now unable to import scrap copper if they cannot prove they are end-users, while the Ministry of Environmental Protection has tightened thresholds on impurities in foreign waste.\n“Instead of importing scrap, China has turned to unwrought copper for downstream, so that may explain the relatively high number compared to last year,” Lau said.\nDecember unwrought copper imports had fallen by 4.3 percent from November, the country needing less foreign metal in a month when its refined copper output hit a record 865,000 tonnes, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\nThe December production jump defied curbs imposed on the operations of northern Chinese smelters, which - like broad anti-smog measures in place in the north of the country - are due to be lifted on Mar. 15.\nMeanwhile, China’s exports of unwrought aluminium and aluminium products rose for a third straight month in January, making the most of a favourable difference between the Shanghai Futures Exchange price and the London Metal Exchange price.\nExports stood at 445,000 tonnes, up 1.1 percent from December and up 14.1 percent from 390,000 tonnes a year ago, reaching their highest level since June.\nShanghai aluminium prices fell by 4.8 percent over January and closed at a one-year low of 14,175 yuan ($2,239.27) a tonne on Wednesday.\nFor more details, see ($1 = 6.3302 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Tom Hogue and Richard Pullin)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:43:06.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
