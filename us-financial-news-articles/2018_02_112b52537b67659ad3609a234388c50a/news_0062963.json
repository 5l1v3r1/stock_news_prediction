Cambodia ranks among the world’s nations most littered with unexploded ordnance, says the Mines Advisory Group, which helps find and destroy unexploded devices that kill or injure an average of two Cambodians every week. \nThe White House said that Washington had spent more than $1 billion in support for Cambodia and that assistance in health, agriculture and mine-clearing will continue. \nReporting by Prak Chan Thul; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T10:47:27.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
