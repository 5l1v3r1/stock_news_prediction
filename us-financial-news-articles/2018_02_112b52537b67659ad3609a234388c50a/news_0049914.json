Filings show the sale of 10,000 shares last month of ammunition maker Olin Corp, and the sale of debt in gunmaker Remington Outdoor Co.\n“With this bill we are sending a message that New Jersey is making a conscious decision about the type of companies the state should invest in,” Gopal said in the statement.\nTwo members of the state’s assembly also plan to introduce the bill in coming weeks, according to the release.\nDemocrats hold a majority in both houses. A spokesman did not immediately say whether Senate President Stephen Sweeney would support the investment ban.\nReporting by Ross Kerber and Tim McLaughlin in Boston; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T19:16:37.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
