Elsewhere in the sector, MEG Energy jumped 23.1 percent to C$6.18 after it said it had agreed to sell some pipeline and storage assets in Alberta. \n* On the downside, banks slipped 0.2 percent, with Royal Bank of Canada off 0.5 percent to C$100.57 and Toronto Dominion Bank down 0.6 percent at C$71.3. \n* Canada Goose Holdings slumped 15.4 percent to C$40.47 after releasing its quarterly results. \n* Thomson Reuters declined 1.6 percent to C$50.26 after the company beat Wall Street profit expectations in the fourth quarter but missed on revenue. \n* The TSX posted 1 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows. \n* Aurora Cannabis was among the most actively traded stocks up 0.5 percent at $11.20 after the cannabis company reported results. \n* Volume on the TSX index was 32.27 million shares.
