Vu Thu Ha, a senior analyst at Ho Chi Minh City Securities, said the company’s prospective price-to-earnings ratio of 19 times compared with 15 for regional peers.\nThe IPO setback - following another for a rubber firm a week ago - contrasts with the $740 million raised in January from the sale of stakes in another electricity provider, an oil firm and a refinery.\n“EVNGENCO 3’s IPO valuation is actually not that attractive, especially compared to the previous three,” said Nguyen The Minh, deputy research director at Saigon Securities Incorp, who deals with retail investors.\nOther negatives were a shortage of investor funds after the previous IPOs and the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday, said Ho Chi Minh City Securities’ Ha.\nDespite the setbacks, analysts and investors remain optimistic that future IPOs could go well, with the Vietnamese economy growing 6.8 percent last year - the fastest pace since 2010 - and its stock market climbing almost 50 percent in 2017.\nSome 127 more IPOs are planned before 2020 after years of sluggish privatisation activity, which had limited investors’ options in allocating money to Vietnam.\n“That has changed now, with many funds allocating money specifically for IPO deals,” said Saigon Securities’ Minh.\nBut it also means investors can be more choosy.\n“They pick the nice cherries instead of just putting money into every IPO,” said UNICAP’s Baden, who recently moved from Hong Kong because he saw greater opportunity in Vietnam.
