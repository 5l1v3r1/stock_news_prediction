Four in five insurers have diversity strategies and provide training in unconscious bias, the ABI said.\nThe ABI’s findings came from data covering more than 82,000 insurance employees.\nReporting by Carolyn Cohn, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:55:31.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
