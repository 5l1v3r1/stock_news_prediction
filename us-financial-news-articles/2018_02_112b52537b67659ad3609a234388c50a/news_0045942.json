He said it was important to “prevent requirements that are too comprehensive and that cannot be delivered by industry.” \nAirbus this week took a further 1.3 billion euro ($1.6 billion) charge on the A400M program for 2017, bringing total charges on the project to over 8 billion euros. But it said agreement by NATO buyers to stretch out the delivery schedule and accept certain changes would limit future losses. \nHoke lauded an agreement reached this month by NATO buyers, Airbus and the OCCAR pan-European procurement agency to negotiate a new delivery schedule for the aircraft. \nHe said he was confident that agreements with individual countries could be finalised by the end of the year, and said the declaration of intention had helped repair frayed relations with A400M buyer nations. \n“It was a very constructive cooperation, and there was strong support from all participants,” he said. “I believe we have significantly improved relations.” \nHoke said Airbus expected to release details about the next steps on a European program to develop a drone by late April at the Berlin air show. \nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T21:57:16.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
