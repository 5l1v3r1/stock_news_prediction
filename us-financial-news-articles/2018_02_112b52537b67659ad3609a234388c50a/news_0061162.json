GAAP operating loss for fiscal 2017 was $30.5 million, compared to a loss of $86.7 million for fiscal 2016. Non-GAAP operating income was $36.7 million, compared to $29.0 million for fiscal 2016 GAAP net loss for fiscal 2017 was $40.0 million, or ($0.75) per diluted share, compared to a loss of $77.2 million, or ($1.48) per diluted share, for fiscal 2016.

The Company generated $61.9 million in cash from operations in fiscal 2017.\n“Our fourth quarter results reflect the momentum that we built throughout the year, which we attribute to the positive market reaction to several new product introductions, including our F123 Series launched in February, 2017 and the more recently commercialized H2000 and J700 Dental Solutions, as well as investments in specific go-to-market initiatives for our target verticals of aerospace, automotive, and healthcare,” said Ilan Levin, Chief Executive Officer of Stratasys. “Our improved profitability and healthy cash generation in the quarter demonstrates the success of our alignment of resources to support our strategic roadmap.”\nNew Metal Technology\nFor nearly 30 years Stratasys has been pioneering the development and adoption of 3D printing and additive manufacturing technologies, including the precise, repeatable, and reliable FDM and PolyJet 3D printing platforms.\nBuilding on its track record of innovation and leadership, Stratasys is today revealing the development of a new additive manufacturing process, designed from inception to address short-run metal manufacturing.\nThe innovative Stratasys platform was developed internally over the past several years, incorporating the Company’s proprietary jetting technology. The platform was designed from inception to provide the values of additive manufacturing for short-run production, while overcoming material limitations of currently available metal-based additive manufacturing systems. With this new technology, Stratasys believes it will offer customers a new ability to short-run manufacture metal parts made with commonly used powder metallurgy, starting with aluminum, at an economically competitive cost-per-part and throughput, with easy to implement post-processing and high part quality.\nFor more information, please reference the separate press release issued today by the Company .\nThe Company will unveil further details about this new technology at the RAPID + TCT 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Conference, taking place from April 23-26 in Fort Worth, Texas.\nBeginning in 2018, the Company is ramping up investment activity to accelerate long term development programs to expand its addressable markets, including the new metal additive manufacturing platform, as well as further advancements based on FDM and PolyJet technologies.\n“Following a period of incubation over the last several years, we are excited to share details of our technology roadmap, which we believe will deliver the promise of additive manufacturing to short-run metal part production,” continued Levin. “As a pioneer and leader in the additive manufacturing industry, Stratasys is increasing its investments in the development of innovative technologies and application knowledge to drive adoption through deeper customer engagement.”\nFinancial Guidance:\nStratasys today provided the following information regarding the company’s guidance for projected revenue and net income for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018:\nRevenue guidance of $670 to $700 million. Non-GAAP net income of $16 to $27 million, or $0.30 to $0.50 per diluted share. GAAP net loss of $41 to $25 million, or ($0.75) to ($0.46) per diluted share.\nStratasys provided the following additional guidelines regarding the company’s projected performance and strategic plans for 2018:\nNon-GAAP operating margins of 4.5% to 6%. Capital expenditures are projected at $40 to $50 million.\nThe Company’s guidance reflects increased investments in R&D, tools, materials, and additional resources aimed at expanding addressable markets by accelerating development efforts for the new metal additive manufacturing platform, further advancements based on our FDM and PolyJet technologies, and specific go-to-market initiatives in order to deepen customer engagement.\nGiven the expected ongoing negative impact of not recording a tax benefit on U.S. tax losses on the Company’s non-GAAP net income, the Company believes that the rate of growth in its non-GAAP operating income will be the best measure of performance.\nNon-GAAP earnings guidance excludes $32 to $34 million of projected amortization of intangible assets; $17 to $19 million of share-based compensation expense; and $7 to $9 million in reorganization and other related costs; and includes $4 to $5 million in tax expenses related to non-GAAP adjustments.\nStratasys Ltd.

We also exclude, when applicable, non-recurring changes of non-cash valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, as well as, non-recurring significant tax charges or benefits that relate to prior periods which we do not believe are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. These non-GAAP adjustments either do not reflect actual cash outlays that impact our liquidity and our financial condition or have a non-recurring impact on the statement of operations, as assessed by management. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses our performance for internal planning and forecasting purposes. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of our results of operations without including all items indicated above during a period, which may not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in our industry.
