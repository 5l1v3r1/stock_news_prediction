In my whole career of winning skateboarding events I would always stop, do a whole winter, and then come back to skating. So I won’t have to re-learn everything.”\nIf White wins a skateboarding medal in Tokyo, he would become only the sixth person to win medals at both winter and summer Olympic Games. The most recent athlete to do so was American Lauryn Williams, who won medals in sprinting and the bobsleigh.\nIf White takes the challenge of entering skateboarding at Tokyo 2020, he could rely on his long-time friend and mentor Tony Hawk for encouragement.\nHawk, widely seen as the greatest skateboarder in history and a pioneer behind many of the tricks that skateboarding and snowboarding share, first met White when he was just nine-years-old and the pair have remained in contact ever since.\nWhite talked effusively about the role Hawk has played in his development as an extreme sports athlete.\n“Tony, thank you for being such a great inspiration for me and such a good role model for me to look up to. He told me to come win this thing and then sail off into the sunset and never touch a snowboard again,” White said.\n“I hope he wishes me luck because I think I am going to go on to skateboarding.” (Reporting by Jack Tarrant; editing by Sudipto Ganguly)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:58:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
