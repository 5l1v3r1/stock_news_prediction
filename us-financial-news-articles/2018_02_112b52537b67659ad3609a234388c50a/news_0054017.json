It’s a very complicated country. We understand elements of it but we have a very black and white viewpoint, so I think this is one of these elements to start to understand it.”\nThe exhibits date from the 1970s to the early 2000s, a time when designers in North Korea, largely cut off from outside influence, blended Soviet-inspired iconography with their own national aesthetic.\nDespite the array of imagery portraying North Korean workers as muscular, heroic figures, Bonner said it us unlikely that the exhibition’s propaganda component would win the regime any new supporters. The exhibition runs until May 13.\nWriting by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T00:11:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
