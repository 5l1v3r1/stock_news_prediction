U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, a lynchpin of the Mexican economy.\nThe EU and Mexico intend to update the trade deal agreed 21 years ago, which largely covers industrial goods. They want to add farm products, more services, investment and government procurement, and include provisions on labor standards and environmental protection.\nNegotiators meeting in Mexico City agreed chapters on technical barriers to trade, state-owned enterprises, subsidies, anti-corruption, and trade in services, Mexico’s economy secretary said in a statement.\nMexican officials had hoped for a deal by the end of February, but that is looking unlikely, as the next round of talks to update NAFTA will take precedence when they begin on Sunday.\n“Consensus still needs to be reached on specific issues in the chapters on trade in goods, rules of origin and intellectual property,” the ministry said.\nThe key challenges are how far to open each other’s markets to food and drink - such as tequila, chicken and asparagus from Mexico and dairy products from Europe - and the EU’s demand to recognize geographical indications.\n“The modernization of the free trade agreement is a priority in the Mexican trade agenda,” the ministry said.\nReporting by Anthony Esposito, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T06:09:40.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
