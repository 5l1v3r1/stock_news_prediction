However, some of those early phones shipped with a number of glitches including purple lines across the camera’s viewfinder, spotty Wi-Fi connectivity, and battery charging and overheating problems. However, the biggest complaint was that the device had a faulty microphone that made it impossible for many owners to use the device for its original purpose: a phone. \nThis week two Pixel owners, Patricia Weeks and Waleed Anba, filed a proposed class action suit in federal court in San Jose, Calif. against Google for the allegedly defective microphones. The suit requests a jury trial and accuses Google of shipping the phones with defective parts in addition to how it handled customer complaints about the defects. \nWeeks claims that Google acknowledged that her phone was defective, but that it refused to refund her money or replace it despite the fact it was still under warranty, tech news site Ars Technica report s. The suit does not specify how much the plaintiffs are seeking in damages. \nFortune has reached out to Google and will update this story with its response if it provides one. A Google spokesperson told Ars: “We don’t comment on ongoing litigation but it might be worth including a link to our help center page in your story which explains the solutions we have for out-of-warranty customers.” \nBoth plaintiffs are represented by Girard Gibbs .
