Farrell, man of the match in the weekend 37-27 victory over Wales, twisted his knee in the turf, according to a statement from Ireland Rugby. “Chris Farrell received treatment on the field after twisting his knee on the turf,” the statement said. ”He subsequently jogged on to join the rest of the playing group and felt well. “He was sent for a precautionary scan this afternoon which indicated some ligament damage had occurred and he will now see a specialist. Chris is unlikely to be available for the rest of the Six Nations.” Leaders Ireland host Scotland on March 10 before a potential championship-deciding clash with England at Twickenham.
