It is BlackRock strategists’ first outright positive reading on U.S. stocks since May 2016.\n“We believe the coming positive effects of new U.S. tax and spending plans are still underappreciated by markets,” BlackRock’s Turnill said in the note.\n“We find earnings growth matters more than valuations over shorter time horizons at this stage of the bull market,” Turnill said, adding:\n“Economic strength was already changing the tone of earnings momentum, but U.S. tax cuts and government spending plans lit a fire under the trend.”\nTurnill noted that while earnings momentum in Europe was robust, it lagged other regions and said the euro’s strength is a “source of pain.”\nThe S&P 500 .SPX index is up more than 2 percent this year, while Europe's STOXX 600 is down nearly 3 percent, in terms of price.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt, Kit Rees and Thyagaraju Adinarayan; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T19:06:55.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
