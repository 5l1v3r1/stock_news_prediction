(the \"Company\" or \"Atkore\") (NYSE: ATKR) announced earnings for its fiscal 2018 first quarter ended December 29, 2017 (\"first quarter\").\n\"Atkore delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2018,\" commented John Williamson, Atkore President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We drove organic volume growth, generated productivity savings and realized accretive earnings from integrating recent acquisitions that contributed toward double-digit year over year improvements in EBITDA and EPS,\" Williamson added.\n2018 First Quarter Results\nThree months ended December 29, December 30, ($ in thousands)\n2017 2016 Change % Change Net sales\nElectrical Raceway $ 316,523 $ 242,385 $ 74,138 30.6 % Mechanical Products & Solutions 98,574 95,681 2,893 3.0 % Eliminations (539 ) (475 ) (64 ) 13.5 % Consolidated operations $ 414,558 $ 337,591 $ 76,967 22.8 % Adjusted EBITDA Electrical Raceway $ 56,160 $ 42,117 $ 14,043 33.3 % Mechanical Products & Solutions 10,809 15,781 (4,972 ) (31.5 )% Unallocated (8,482 ) (8,007 ) (475 ) 5.9 % Consolidated operations $ 58,487 $ 49,891 $ 8,596 17.2 % * Not meaningful Net sales increased $77.0 million, or 22.8%, to $414.6 million for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to $337.6 million for the prior-year period. Net sales increased $30.7 million due to higher volume of products sold for the metal electrical conduit and fittings, armored cable and fittings, mechanical pipe and metal framing and fittings product categories. Additionally, net sales increased $25.2 million resulting from the acquisitions of Marco Cable Management (\"Marco\"), Flexicon Limited (\"Flexicon\") and Calpipe Industries, LLC (\"Calpipe\") during the second half of fiscal 2017. Lastly, Net sales increased $19.0 million due to higher net average selling prices resulting from the pass-through of higher input costs.\nGross profit increased $5.2 million, or 5.7%, to $96.9 million for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to $91.7 million for the prior-year period. Gross profit increased primarily due to the acquisitions of Marco, Flexicon and Calpipe during the second half of fiscal 2017 and higher volume of products sold, partially offset by higher input costs.\nNet income increased $9.8 million, or 56.4%, to $27.2 million for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to $17.4 million for the prior-year period, primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.8 million during fiscal 2017, lower interest expense of $3.2 million and lower income tax expense of $3.0 million due to the one-time tax benefit of the revaluation of the company's deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of new tax legislation H.R.1. on December 22, 2017. The increase in net income was partially offset by higher selling, general, and administrative costs and intangible amortization expense resulting from the acquisitions of Marco, Flexicon and Calpipe in the second half of fiscal 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $8.6 million, or 17.2%, to $58.5 million for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to $49.9 million for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to higher volume of products sold, incremental Adjusted EBITDA from acquisitions during the second half of fiscal 2017 and improved manufacturing productivity within the Mechanical Products and Solutions (\"MP&S\") segment. Adjusted EBITDA margins decreased slightly to approximately 14.1% during the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to 14.8% for the prior-year period.\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.41 for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to $0.26 in the prior-year period. Adjusted net income per diluted share increased to $0.46 for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to $0.28 for the prior-year period.\nSegment Results\nElectrical Raceway\nElectrical Raceway Net sales increased $74.1 million, or 30.6%, to $316.5 million for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to $242.4 million for the prior-year period. The increase was due primarily to $25.3 million of higher volume of products sold within the metal electrical conduit and fittings and armored cable and fittings product categories and $25.2 million of additional sales from the acquisitions of Marco, Flexicon and Calpipe during the second half of fiscal 2017. Additionally, Net sales increased $21.8 million resulting from the pass-through impact of higher input costs of copper and increased market prices within the PVC electrical conduit and fittings market.\nElectrical Raceway adjusted EBITDA increased $14.0 million, or 33.3%, to $56.2 million for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to $42.1 million for the prior-year period. The increase was largely due to higher volume of products sold and increased market prices within the PVC electrical conduit and fittings market. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.9 million due to acquisitions during the second half of fiscal 2017.\nMechanical Products & Solutions (\"MP&S\")\nMP&S Net sales increased $2.9 million, or 3.0%, to $98.6 million for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to $95.7 million for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to $5.4 million of higher volume of products sold within the mechanical pipe and metal framing and fittings product categories partially offset by lower net average selling prices due to product mix.\nMP&S Adjusted EBITDA decreased $5.0 million, or 31.5%, to $10.8 million for the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to $15.8 million for the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margins decreased to 11.0% or the three months ended December 29, 2017, as compared to 16.5% for the three months ended December 30, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to higher steel and freight costs partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity and a higher volume of lower margin products sold.\nRecent Events\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company completed a stock repurchase transaction whereby the Company repurchased from CD&R Allied Holdings, L.P. (the \"CD&R Investor\"), a related party, approximately 17.2 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a per share price equal to $21.77, which approximated fair value on the date of pricing for a total purchase price of approximately $375 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement. As a result of the stock repurchase transaction, the CD&R Investor ownership decreased to approximately 29%.\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company borrowed an incremental $425 million under the First Lien Term Loan Facility at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%. Under this financing transaction, the interest rate on the pre-existing First Lien Term Loan Facility was also reduced to LIBOR plus 2.75%. The Company used proceeds from the incremental borrowing to i) repurchase common shares from the CD&R Investor, ii) repay all outstanding loans under the ABL Credit Facility and iii) pay related fees and expenses.\nSecond Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Guidance\nThe Company's second quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA guidance will be in the range of $0.42 - $0.48.\nThe Company reaffirms its expectation that fiscal year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA will be in the range of $245.0 - $260.0 million and is updating its Adjusted EPS guidance to be in the range to $1.95 - $2.15 due to the expected impact of the federal tax reform and after giving effect to the stock repurchase transaction described above.\nReconciliations of the forward-looking 2018 outlook for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are not being provided as the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliations.\nConference Call Information\nAtkore management will host a conference call today, February 6, 2018, at 8 a.m. Eastern time, to discuss the Company's financial results.

The Company assumes no obligation to update the information contained herein, which speaks only as of the date hereof.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release includes certain financial information, not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Because not all companies calculate non-GAAP financial information identically (or at all), the presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, these measures should not be considered substitutes for the performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. See non-GAAP reconciliations below in this press release for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in evaluating the performance of our business, and we use each in the preparation of our annual operating budgets and as indicators of business performance and profitability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin allow us to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before: depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, income tax expense (benefit), restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, consulting fees, multi-employer pension withdrawal, certain legal matters, transaction costs, gain on sale of joint venture and other items, such as inventory reserves and adjustments and realized or unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when presented in conjunction with comparable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") measures, is useful for investors because management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a profitability measure in evaluating the performance of our business.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales.\nNet Income Margin\nWe define Net Income Margin as Net income as a percentage of Net sales.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share\nWe use Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share in evaluating the performance of our business and profitability. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing the Company's results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure provide an indication of performance and profitability excluding the impact of unusual and or non-cash items. We define Adjusted net income as net income before consulting fees, loss on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense, gain on sale of joint venture, certain legal matters and other items. We define Adjusted net income per share as basic or diluted earnings per share excluding the per share impact of consulting fees, loss on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation, gain on sale of joint venture, certain legal matters and other items.\nLeverage Ratio - Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define leverage ratio as the ratio of net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing twelve month (\"TTM\") basis. We believe the leverage ratio is useful to investors as an alternative liquidity measure.\nATKORE INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC.
