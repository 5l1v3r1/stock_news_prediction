Full-year growth for 2017 was confirmed at 2.2 percent, the strongest rate since 2011.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Madeline Chambers\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:11:39.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
