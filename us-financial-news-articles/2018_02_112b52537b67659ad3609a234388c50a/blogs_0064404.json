They were spot on with their predictions for the end of 2017 for Mexico's main index. \nIn the latest poll, bullishness was tempered on rising global bond yields and expectations for increased volatility. \nAbout 80 percent of over 50 strategists who answered an extra question said the period of low inflation, bond yields and volatility is over. \n\"We do see inflation, bond yields and volatility all higher in 2018 than levels we were at in 2017. Better economic growth and more fiscal stimulus will put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates this year,\" noted Darrell Cronk, president at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \n\"We would find it difficult to imagine that we will return to the lows in volatility during the second half of 2017.\" \nVolatility spiked during the deep sell-off in equities and all but one of 82 specialists who answered a separate question said the CBOE Volatility index this year will stay above its average of 11 percent over the past year. \nTwenty-seven of 81 respondents said it will roughly average 10-15 percent, 44 said 15-20, eight said 20-25 and two said 25-30 percent. \nA robust U.S. economic expansion that is expected to be supported by additional fiscal stimulus and higher profit growth will boost Wall Street, the poll found. The recent sell-off makes valuations look less stretched than in January. \nThe benchmark S&P 500 is forecast to end this year about 8.5 percent above 2017's finish and up 4.3 percent from Monday's close. \n\"Things are actually less expensive because of the powerful earnings (growth) and to a certain extent the market pulling back,\" said Jonathan Golub, Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist. \n\"We're in this nice place where things are moving forward but the risk that something goes wrong has been contained.\" \nCanada shares are forecast to rise to a record high by the end of the year as the prospect of higher global inflation boosts appeal for its resource shares. \nEuropean shares were also expected to bounce back, according to strategists who also said the things that supported European markets in 2017 will continue to do so even if the market is now more volatile. \nBut concerns over the terms of Britain's exit from the European Union and rising volatility will hold back the FTSE share index from rising above its record high in the next two years. \nEmerging economies' stock markets are expected to underperform developed ones as risks from huge fiscal deficits remain and on higher global interest rates. \nWhen asked what will be substantially affected by any sharp moves in U.S. stocks, the top pick was emerging market shares. \n\"If the U.S. experiences sharp moves this year, everything will be affected,\" noted David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. \nIndian stocks are expected to recover most of their recent losses, helped by strong corporate earnings, but will close out 2018 a little short of the record high hit at the end of January. \nBrazil's market rally is expected to head into a third year on strong growth expectations but the government's inability to plug a fiscal deficit could put a lid on those gains. \n(For other stories from the Reuters global stock markets poll:) (Additional reporting and polling by correspondents in Bengaluru, London, Mexico City, Milan, Moscow, New York, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo and Toronto; Editing by Ross Finley and Janet Lawrence)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T20:40:59.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
