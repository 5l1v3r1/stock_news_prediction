The other four countries are Belgium, Greece, Italy and Poland. \n“Capacity mechanisms can help to safeguard security of electricity supply, but they must be designed so as to avoid distortions of competition in energy markets,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. \nThe Commission said the schemes in Germany and Belgium are temporary strategic reserves which are available only in emergencies. Italy and Poland were cleared to set up market-wide schemes to offset structural security of supply problems. \nThe schemes in France and Greece pay users to reduce their power consumption in hours when electricity is scarce.
