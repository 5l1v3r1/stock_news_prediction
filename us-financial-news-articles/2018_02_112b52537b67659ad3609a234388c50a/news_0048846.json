Moreover, Angela Merkel's approval ratings have also declined significantly since the election.\"\nSPD leadership uncertainty In addition to the membership ballot, there are SPD leadership changes afoot that are likely to bring about a change of approach and uncertainty over whether Merkel will see out a fourth term as chancellor (more on that below).\nSPD leader Martin Schulz resigned last week following criticism of his agreement to serve as foreign minister in a future coalition government after previously saying the party would stay in opposition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:26:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
