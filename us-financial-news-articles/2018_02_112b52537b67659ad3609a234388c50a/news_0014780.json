The four-time All-Star scuffled with Bradley just 6:15 into the contest, a run-in that drew each a technical foul.\nDetroit led 80-77 entering the final period, but had only one field goal in the first 6:38 of the quarter, during which the Clippers used a 15-5 run to go up 92-85. Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams combined for 11 of Los Angeles’ 15 points in the burst.\nAfter Andre Drummond cut the gap to five with a layup, the Clippers immediately countered with a layup by Austin Rivers and a 3-pointer by Williams, opening a 96-87 advantage they were able to massage to the finish.\nRivers was playing for the first time since Dec. 29 as he recovered from a strained right Achilles. He had 16 points in 32 minutes in his return to action.\nWilliams led all scorers with 26 points and Harrell added 18 to lead the Clippers, who were playing the opener of a seven-game trip.\nDanilo Gallinari was a sixth Clipper in double figures with 16 points, while DeAndre Jordan complemented four points with 17 rebounds.\nGriffin had eight rebounds and six assists to go with his 19 points. He had averaged 21.5 points and 7.8 rebounds in his first four games for Detroit.\nReggie Bullock also had 19 points for the Pistons, while Ish Smith had 15.\nDrummond matched Jordan’s 17 rebounds to go with 12 points for Detroit, which had averaged 113.2 points in its five-game winning streak.\nNeither team led by more than eight points in a tightly contested first three quarters.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:21:18.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
