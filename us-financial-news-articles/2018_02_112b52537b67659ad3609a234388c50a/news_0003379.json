It has previously called for the tax to be abolished.\n$1 = 0.8006 euros Reporting by Markus Wacket; Additional reporting by Victoria Bryan; Writing by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Paul Carrel and Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:35:38.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
