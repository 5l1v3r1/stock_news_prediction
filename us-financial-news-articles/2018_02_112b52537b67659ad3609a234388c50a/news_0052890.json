The line would transport crude from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana, connecting to an existing line that originates in Nederland, Texas. The project is 60 percent owned by Energy Transfer with the remainder owned by refiner Phillips 66 N>.\nOnce complete, the Bayou Bridge system will have capacity to transport up to 480,000 barrels of oil per day to refineries along the Mississippi River. It is projected to start service by the second half of 2018.\nThe line also would move oil from Texas and as far as North Dakota, through connections with Energy Transfer’s Dakota Access, to Gulf Coast refiners. Louisiana is home to around 3.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nEnergy Transfer’s 1,172-mile (1,885-km) Dakota Access crude pipeline was thrust into the spotlight following massive protests near its construction site in North Dakota. Although protesters were able to temporarily halt construction, it began service in mid-2017.\nThe case is Atchafalaya Basinkeeper et al vs U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. District Court, Baton Rouge, No 3:18-cv-00023-SDD-EWD (Reporting by Liz Hampton; Editing by Gary McWilliams and Leslie Adler)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T22:11:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
