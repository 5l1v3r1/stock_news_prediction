The number of Venezuelans living in Colombia increased 62 percent to more than 550,000 in the second half of 2017, according to the migration authority.\nReporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Helen Murphy, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T01:02:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
