His endorsement may also help contain the pro-Trump, anti-establishment forces in the Republican Party that influenced decisions by GOP Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona to retire after this year, although a Corker spokesman has said he might reconsider.\nShortly after Trump’s endorsement, Romney posted a note of gratitude on his own Twitter feed. “Thank you Mr. President for the support. I hope that over the course of the campaign I also earn the support and endorsement of the people of Utah,” he wrote.\nRomney is entering the race as the early favorite thanks to his popularity in Utah, fundraising skills, name recognition, and months of campaigning and fundraising for other GOP candidates. Republicans currently hold a 51-49 edge over Democrats in the Senate.\nFor more about Mitt Romney’s Senate candidacy, watch Fortune’s video:\nOne question is whether Romney will continue to be a strong anti-Trump voice or follow the path of former vocal Trump critics like South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham who have now become allies.\nTrump has weathered tough criticism from Romney, who referred to the then-presidential candidate as “a phony, a fraud” in a March 2016 speech. Romney assailed Trump for suggesting that both sides were to blame for violence following a violent white supremacists’ march in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying that the president’s remarks “caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn.”\nDespite their differences, Trump interviewed him as a candidate for secretary of state. Romney said in June 2017 that he would have accepted the job if it had been offered, and that he and the president weren’t as far apart on issues as he’d feared.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T08:26:12.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
