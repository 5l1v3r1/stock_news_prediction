They were a shot clear of six players tied for fifth, including Thai Phachara Khongwatmai who held a share of the overnight lead at the Saujana Golf and Country Club.\nFrittelli, who beat Arjun Atwal in a playoff to win the Mauritius Open in December, began slowly but six birdies helped him get back in contention.\n“It was a good round,” said Frittelli. “I think a lot of the guys are getting frustrated with the greens and I‘m just trying to stay as positive as I can, and just try and speak to them nice and get the ball to go in the hole.”\nCampillo, seeking an elusive first European Tour win in his 196th event, eagled the first hole and produced four birdies to give himself a good chance to seal the title.\n”It was good,“ Campillo said. ”I played solid for most of the round. I had a few tough holes but I managed to make the putts so overall I played solid. It is a good day.\n“I‘m really looking forward to tomorrow. It is a nice position to be and I‘m excited.”\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T11:52:08.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
