Germany has long insisted that Greece needs to focus on reforms instead.\nTo accommodate the IMF and convince it to participate in the third bailout, euro zone governments said last year that in 2018 they would consider extending the maturities and grace periods of their loans to Greece by a range from zero to 15 years. The average maturity now is 30 years.\nReporting by Stanley White; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T08:15:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
