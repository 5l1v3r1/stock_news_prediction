The army seized money, arms, ammunition and other military hardware from the house, it said. \nLebanese authorities say they have disrupted a number of Islamic State attacks and networks since the last major attack - a 2015 twin suicide bombing in Beirut. \nLebanon has mostly escaped the rash of militant assaults around the Middle East spurred by the war in its neighbour Syria, and last year forced Islamic State fighters out of an enclave on the mountainous border between the two countries.
