Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Bob Iger, chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Co. \nDisney CEO and Chairman Bob Iger said it will cost $4.99 to stream ESPN Plus, in Disney's first ever direct-to-consumer offering. \nThe over-the-top service will roll out sometime in the spring, in tandem with a redesign of Disney's ESPN app. The app will enable customers to watch sports reels and highlights, live stream games and access ESPN Plus. \n\"The third feature is a plus service, we're calling it ESPN Plus, that will include an array of live programming that is not available -- live sports, live sports events -- not available on current channels,\" Iger said in an exclusive interview on CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" \nThe platform will feature about 10,000 sporting events each year, will have content from the MLB, NHL, MLS, collegiate sports and tennis' Grand Slam events. The company had teased in August it would launch its own ESPN video streaming service in early 2018.
