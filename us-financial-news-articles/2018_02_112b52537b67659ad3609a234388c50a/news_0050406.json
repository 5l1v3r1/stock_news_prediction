However the Scottish and Welsh governments are seeking legal protection for their current powers.\n“Progress is being made and we will continue to talk. I will continue to fight for the best deal for Scotland,” said Scotland’s Brexit minister Michael Russell after the meeting.\nThe British parliament must seek consent from the Scottish and Welsh assemblies when legislating on policy areas that overlap with their devolved powers. But both have declined to give their consent to the withdrawal bill because they say it fails to respect the devolution agreement made 20 years ago.\nWhile they do not have a veto on Brexit legislation, ignoring them would stretch already tense relations with London, and could feed public appetite for Scottish independence.\nRussell said the British government needed to take more steps to safeguard devolution and that Scotland would continue to argue for Britain to remain part of the EU’s single market and customs union. That possibility is something Prime Minister Theresa May’s government in London has ruled out.\n“We are not opposed to UK-wide frameworks, when they are in Scotland’s interest, but devolved powers can only be changed with the agreement of the Scottish parliament,” said Russell.\n“Failing that commitment from the UK government, we will be unable to recommend consent to this legislation.”\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:10:06.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
