RBS shares fell 4.6 percent to 269 pence at 0835 GMT as it gave no update on a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice for mis-selling toxic mortgage backed securities, which some analysts estimate could mean a charge of up to $12 billion. The bank’s 752 million pound profit beat a company-provided average of analyst forecasts for a 592 million pound loss. It had hoped to settle the U.S. mis-selling charges, the bank’s last large remaining misconduct issue, in 2017. Chief Executive Ross McEwan said the settlement was out of the bank’s control but it could begin to think about resuming dividends or buying back shares nearly a decade on from its 45.5 billion pound state bailout during the financial crisis “With many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer,” he said. The DOJ issue weighs on RBS’s share price and complicates the government’s plan to sell down its 71 percent stake.

REUTERS/Peter Nicholls DIFFICULT READING RBS has in recent months been at the centre of renewed political furore over the mistreatment of thousands of business customers during and after the financial crisis. This has hamstrung McEwan’s efforts to rebuild the bank’s image and he admitted on Friday that a confidential report into the bank’s conduct, recently made public and detailing behaviour by RBS staff, made for “difficult reading”. The CEO’s pay fell in 2017 as a result of the bad publicity around the bank’s brand image.
