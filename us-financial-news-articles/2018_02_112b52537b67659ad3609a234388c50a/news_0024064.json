REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach \nThe Norwegian was the strong pre-competition favorite after dominating World Cup jumping this season. \nThe athletes were forced to contend with night-time temperatures of -11 Celsius (12.2 Fahrenheit) and frequent gusts of wind that delayed some jumps and left them huddling in blankets or beating their knees for warmth as they waited.

REUTERS/Dominic Ebenbichler \nThe waits got longer towards the end of the first round, with defending champion Carina Vogt of Germany forced to take off her skis and flex her leg muscles as she waited around five minutes to take off down the ramp. She ended the competition in fifth place. \nThe competition was watched by a sparse but enthusiastic crowd of spectators, including a vocal contingent from Japan, some wrapped up like polar explorers against the chill. \nIt was the second time that women have competed in Olympic ski jumping, having joined the program in Sochi in 2014 after years of struggling to prove they were as capable as men at launching themselves off a snowy ramp at speeds of up to 90 km/h and flying over 100 meters through the air. \nThey still only take part in the smaller normal hill contest, not the large hill nor the team event.
