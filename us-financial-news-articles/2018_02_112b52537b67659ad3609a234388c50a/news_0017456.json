Local media have estimated the proceeds at $18 billion.\nSwiss Re’s shares last traded at 90.18 Swiss francs, giving it a market capitalisation of 31.51 billion francs ($34 billion). Its largest shareholder is BlackRock Institutional Trust Co with a 5.02 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nSoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has said he wants to build a group of industry-leading companies that, powered by technological advancements in artificial intelligence and interconnected devices, will endure for 300 years.\nThrough its investment arm centred on the Vision Fund, the world’s largest private equity fund, SoftBank has already funnelled $27.5 billion into tech firms around the world. That could bring a huge number of potential insurance customers - from ride-share drivers to dog walking app users - into what Son calls his “synergy group” of companies.\nThe purchase of a stake in Swiss Re would be the latest in a constant stream of investments that have made valuing SoftBank difficult and left a “conglomerate discount” weighing on its share price.\nSoftBank Group’s market capitalisation currently stands at around $90 billion. By contrast, its near 30 percent stake in Alibaba is worth around $130 billion.\nIt would also come at a time when the reinsurance industry has been hit by rock bottom interest rates that have dampened investment returns with falling industry prices putting pressure on margins.\nSwiss Re’s nine-month earnings implied a loss of around $1.7 billion from July through September, hit by claims from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the United States and from two earthquakes in Mexico. But it said expected a rise in insurance premiums, especially in disaster-hit areas, would help it recover.\nSoftBank has made other investments the insurance industry, and has stakes in Chinese online insurer ZhongAn, health insurance claim processing service Ping An HealthKonnect set up by Ping An Insurance Group, and U.S. insurance startup Lemonade.\nThe Japanese firm’s interest-bearing debt at the end of December was 15.8 trillion yen ($144.5 billion), with Son saying on Wednesday he wants to keep debt levels below 3.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, debt and amortization. That ratio stands at 2.8 times currently.\nSoftBank shares climbed 1 percent on Thursday, in line with the broader market.\n($1 = 0.9443 Swiss francs)\n($1 = 109.3500 yen)\nReporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi in Zurich, Sam Nussey in Tokyo; Additional reporting by Pallavi Dewan; Editing by Richard Pullin and Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T05:39:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
