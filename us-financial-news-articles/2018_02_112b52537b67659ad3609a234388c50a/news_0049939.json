(NYSE:WR) today announced earnings of $324 million, or $2.27 per share, for 2017 compared with earnings of $347 million, or $2.43 per share, for 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 earnings were $34 million, or $0.24 per share, compared with earnings of $54 million, or $0.38 per share, for the fourth quarter 2016.\nLower earnings per share for 2017, compared with the prior year, were the result of lower retail sales attributable to mild weather and having received no corporate-owned life insurance income. The lower revenue was partially offset by lower income tax expense.\nEarnings per share for the fourth quarter 2017, compared with 2016, decreased primarily from writing off deferred income tax assets due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Lower corporate-owned life insurance income, offset in part by reduced operating and maintenance costs, also contributed to lower earnings per share.\nDividend Declaration\nThe Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share on the company's common stock payable April 2, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 9, 2018. This results in an indicated annual dividend of $1.60 per share.\nAs part of the merger of equals with Great Plains Energy Incorporated, the combined company is expected, upon closing, to pay an initial dividend that would result in a 15% increase for Westar Energy shareholders.\nConference Call and Additional Company Information\nWestar Energy management will host a conference call Thursday, Feb. 22 with the investment community at 10:00 a.m. ET (9:00 a.m. CT).
