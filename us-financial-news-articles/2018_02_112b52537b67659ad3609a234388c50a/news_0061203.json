They are not the domain of mobile companies,” said the 60-year-old Mittal, whose family fortune Forbes Magazine puts at $8.8 billion.\nHis move to shed non-core assets follows the blockbuster entry into the Indian market by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio that has forced rivals to merge, creating a three big players in the country of 1.3 billion people.\nIndian operators, despite their strapped finances, will need to prepare for the launch of fifth-generation services, and Mittal said he expected Bharti Airtel to continue to commit $3-$4 billion a year to capex.\nIndia will roll out 5G “in step” with other parts of the world, he said, with first use cases likely to be industry applications, and in fixed-line and machine-to-machine communication.\nIF YOU WANT TO SELL\nSunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman of Bharti Enterprises, delivers his keynote speech at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 27, 2017. REUTERS/Paul Hanna Bharti Airtel controls Bharti Infratel Ltd, and also owns 42 percent stake in Indus Towers Ltd, India’s largest mobile infrastructure company with nearly 123,000 towers.\nBharti Infratel said last October it was considering buying the rest of Indus that is owned by competitors Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, which are in the process of merging.\nMittal said he had a flexible approach to exiting the towers business, and had also received board approval to pursue the alternative of reducing Bharti’s stake in Infratel to below majority control.\n“We have gone down from 100 percent to 53 percent. And our board has decided: if you want to go and sell, then sell,” said Mittal, who also chairs the GSMA industry group that hosts the annual Barcelona gathering.\nCOMMITTED TO AFRICA Bharti Airtel, present in 20 countries, said in mid-February that it was exploring an initial public offering for Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V. (BAIN), the holding company that owns its African interests.\nA listing, if it does happen, would only be of a minority stake, said Mittal: “It will remain a Bharti subsidiary. That means we are staying (in Africa).”\nVice-Chairman Akhil Gupta said London was a potentially good venue but that Bharti would rely on the advice of investment bankers, yet to be appointed for the deal, before making up its mind.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch has said BAIN could be valued at an enterprise value of $6.6 billion, or six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Gupta said he was looking for a higher price.\n“I think we should be much more, because we should be at $1.2 billion of EBITDA by the time (of the float),” he said. “But the markets will decide all this.”\nReporting by Douglas Busvine.
