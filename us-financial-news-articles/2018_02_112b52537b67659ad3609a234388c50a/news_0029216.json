Many would have let their heads drop as chance after chance went begging, but Kane kept coming, ensuring United were constantly on the back foot. \nThe England international passed the mental strength test at Liverpool last week. \nAfter missing one penalty, Kane stepped up to take another deep into stoppage-time to earn his side a 2-2 draw with the coollest of spot-kicks. \nComing into the north London derby at Wembley, it was imperative for Tottenham to maintain their recent good form, but they laboured in the first half. \nKane, however, lifted his side with an expertly-taken header out of nothing, shifting the tide firmly in Tottenham’s favour when they needed it most and they went on to win the game 1-0. \n”I have been repeating for three years he is one of the best strikers in the world,” Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said. \nHis Arsenal counterpart Arsene Wenger agreed. \n“A super striker,” Wenger said. “One of the best in the world who scores against everybody.” \nThe best forwards are often judged by their record against other top sides. \nManchester United’s Romelu Lukaku receives criticism for his poor goal return against major rivals and although Kane’s record is much better, his ineffectiveness against Chelsea, City and Arsenal revived criticism that he can disappear on the big occasion. \nAfter leading Spurs to seven points from three games against their nearest rivals, however, there can be no doubt that Kane is among the very best all-round strikers.
