The first is to challenge the U.S. law at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Another is to develop a new way to undermine the European Union’s low-tax states. Then there’s the chestnut of making another tax grab at American internet companies.\nThe WTO challenge is gaining some steam. Europe would claim that the “base erosion and anti-abuse” (BEAT) provision punishes imports while the “foreign-derived intangible income” (FDII) section of the U.S. law is a de facto export subsidy. Both would be illegal under global trade rules if Europe’s claims were true.\nBut these interpretations are a stretch. The FDII applies what amounts to a 13.125% tax rate to profits above a certain threshold from the sale or licensing of intellectual property abroad. Critics complain that since profits on such sales within the U.S. are taxed at the 21% corporate rate, the FDII is an export subsidy. But the relevant global trade rules don’t apply to taxes on services such as intellectual property.\nEurope might have more of a point on the BEAT, which under some circumstances could create more favorable tax treatment for American companies than for foreign firms operating in the U.S. But the EU would still be wise to exercise restraint here for the sake of good tax diplomacy since the U.S. provisions resemble measures Europe has advocated for years. \nThese and other provisions are intended to deter U.S. firms from moving their headquarters and intellectual property to low-tax countries. This behavior has been in the crosshairs of the campaign Europe is waging with the help of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Now that Washington will tax this income instead of allowing it to accumulate by the tens of billions offshore, Europe refuses to take yes for an answer.\nEuropean leaders also are dusting off the “common consolidated corporate tax base.” This would impose one set of exemptions, deductions and accounting principles on companies across the EU for determining taxable income, and then apportion shares of company profits to EU governments to tax. \nAt least countries could choose their own tax rates. But this would still strip governments—especially low taxers such as Ireland and Luxembourg—of significant sovereignty over tax laws. And it would pave the way for new EU limits on low national rates, a longtime goal of France and Germany. If Europe wants to be uncompetitive, this is the way to do it.\nEurope’s third bad idea is to slap new levies on Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. Here Europe wants to invent new standards for calculating the tax base solely to punish foreign companies in a specific industry. President Trump would love to duke that one out, especially if WTO litigation also created a new opening to challenge European laws that exempt exporters from value-added taxes. Some Americans think that’s an export subsidy.\nAbsent from this EU debate is any admission that corporate rates are still too high in the likes of Germany (up to 37%) and Italy (28% including national and regional taxes). French President Emmanuel Macron is cutting his corporate rate to 25% from 33.3% over five years, although he still wants to punish U.S. tech companies because, well, they’re American. Europe would do better to accept the U.S. reform and make its own code competitive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T17:26:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
