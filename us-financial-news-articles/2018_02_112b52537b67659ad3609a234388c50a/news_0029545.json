But when asked, he did not rule out making a donation to the government in return for his freedom.\nA senior Saudi official later told Reuters he was freed after reaching a financial settlement with the attorney general, but neither party provided details.\nMost detainees have been released, after settlements that the attorney general said secured more than $100 billion from members of the elite.\nPrince Alwaleed tweeted a photo of himself on Tuesday watching a soccer game with his family and said: “Answering my brother Turki al-Sheikh’s invitation to support Saudi clubs ... I present 2 million Saudi riyals ($533,333) to support Al Hilal FC.”\nAl-Sheikh heads the government’s General Sports Authority and is seen as close to the crown prince. Prince Alwaleed’s fortune was previously estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion.\n($1 = 3.7500 riyals)\nReporting by Sarah Dadouch; Editing by Stephen Kalin and Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T00:08:50.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
