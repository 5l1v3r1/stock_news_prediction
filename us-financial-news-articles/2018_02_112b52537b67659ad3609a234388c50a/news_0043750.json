It takes belief,\" Tebow tells CNBC contributor Suzy Welch in an exclusive interview. \nSince playing football in college, Tebow says he always tried to play his best in the fourth quarter. Tebow tells Welch his best moments as an NFL player came whenever he saw his opponents were tired or fatigued. Tebow would take his rivals' uncertainty and turn it into his own opportunity. show chapters 5 Mins Ago | 01:03 \n\"I love the concept of finishing strong because whatever it is that we're going for in life, people are going to get fatigued and tired and discouraged,\" Tebow tells Welch. \"But if we have our mindset on that goal and we continue to fight ... then we can finish strong,\" he says. \nTebow adds that meeting your goal doesn't take talent or ability: \"It takes a mindset. It takes character.
