(NYSE:OIS) reported a net loss for the fourth quarter 2017 of $37.9 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, which included a pre-tax charge of $1.4 million ($0.9 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) of transaction-related costs and a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $28.2 million (or $0.56 per diluted share), resulting from the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the corresponding tax reform legislation in the United States. These results compare to a reported net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $10.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, which included pre-tax charges of $0.6 million ($0.4 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) of severance and other downsizing charges.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company generated revenues of $183.7 million and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA (Note B) of $12.9 million (excluding $1.4 million of transaction-related costs). These results compare to revenues of $169.9 million and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA of $13.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016 (excluding $0.6 million of severance and downsizing charges).\nOil States’ President and Chief Executive Officer, Cindy B. Taylor, stated, \"Our results for the fourth quarter continued to benefit from improved completions activity across the U.S. shale plays as our customers focus on unconventional completions to grow their production. Low levels of deepwater spending continued to affect our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment with limited industry award activity during the fourth quarter. However, we were able to maintain a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 0.79x, yielding 0.95x for the full year.\n\"Subsequent to year end, we closed the acquisition of GEODynamics, Inc. We believe that GEODynamics is a unique and transformational acquisition for Oil States, offering meaningful growth potential that combines advanced technology with downhole consumable completion solutions. Their offerings, which help our customers enhance their well productivity, are ideal for the current operating environment which is characterized by longer lateral lengths, increased frac stages and a growing number of perforation clusters. GEODynamics' products are complementary to our Completion Services offerings, creating additional revenue opportunities and the ability to service an expanded customer base.”\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenues of $670.6 million and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA of $38.0 million (excluding $3.4 million of severance, downsizing, and transaction-related costs). The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $84.9 million and included $2.0 million ($1.5 million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) of severance and downsizing charges, $1.4 million ($0.9 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) of transaction-related costs, $28.2 million of additional tax expense ($0.56 per diluted share) due to a one-time, non-cash income tax charge resulting from the recently enacted tax reform legislation in the United States and $1.0 million ($0.02 per diluted share) from the decision to carryback 2016 net operating losses against taxable income reported in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported revenues of $694.4 million and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA of $55.5 million (excluding $5.2 million of severance and downsizing charges). The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $46.4 million and included $5.2 million ($3.3 million after-tax, or $0.06 per diluted share) of severance and downsizing charges.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n(See Segment Data Tables)\nWell Site Services\nWell Site Services generated revenues of $82.0 million and Segment EBITDA of $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to revenues and Segment EBITDA of $54.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Well Site Services revenues and Segment EBITDA increased 49% and 895%, respectively, due to a 36% year-over-year increase in the number of Completion Services job tickets coupled with a 6% year-over-year increase in revenue per Completion Services job. These increases were driven by significantly increased completion-related activity levels in the U.S. and a more favorable job mix. Adjusted Segment EBITDA margins (Note A) averaged 13% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2% in the fourth quarter of 2016 after excluding severance and downsizing charges. Improved utilization in the land drilling business, which averaged 31% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to only 18% in the fourth quarter of 2016, also positively impacted the segment’s results.\nOffshore/Manufactured Products\nOffshore/Manufactured Products generated revenues and Segment EBITDA of $101.7 million and $16.3 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to revenues of $115.0 million and Segment EBITDA of $25.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues and Segment EBITDA decreased 12% and 36% year-over-year, respectively, due to lower contributions across most of the segment’s product and service lines, particularly those tied to major deepwater project sanctions. Lower project-driven revenues were partially offset by a 45% improvement in sales of our shorter-cycle products (elastomer and valve products), which continued to benefit from expanded U.S. land-based activity. Segment EBITDA margin was 16% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a margin of 22% realized in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2016 margins benefited from the larger number of major projects in process or nearing completion during the period. Backlog totaled $168 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $198 million at September 30, 2017 and $199 million reported at December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognized an effective tax rate provision of 156.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an overall effective tax rate provision of 9.6% for 2017. This compares to an effective tax rate benefit of 37.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an overall effective tax rate benefit of 36.7% for 2016. The higher effective tax rate provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily attributable to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation which resulted in a non-cash income tax charge of $28.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This charge related primarily to the U.S. transition tax recorded on its unremitted foreign earnings coupled with reserves booked against its foreign tax credits which were recorded as assets prior to U.S. tax reform. Additionally, the Company was required to revalue its other U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate which has been reduced from 35% to 21%.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s revolving credit facility was undrawn and cash on hand totaled $53.5 million. Total availability under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017 was $159.3 million (net of standby letters of credit totaling $21.2 million).\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 12, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of GEODynamics, Inc. The acquisition was funded with a combination of $295 million of cash (net of estimated cash acquired and funded by borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility), the issuance of 8.66 million shares of the Company's common stock (valued at approximately $295 million based on the Company's share price at closing) and the issuance of a $25 million unsecured promissory note payable to the sellers, bearing interest at 2.5% per annum maturing in July 2019, for total consideration of approximately $615 million at closing.\nOn January 30, 2018, the Company completed an offering of $200 million principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2023. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility, which were drawn in January 2018 to fund the cash portion of the GEODynamics acquisition. In conjunction with the issuance of the convertible senior notes, the Company's revolving credit facility was further amended and the maturity date extended. Lender commitments under the amended revolving credit facility total $350 million. The amended revolving credit facility can be increased up to an incremental $150 million, subject to additional lender commitments, and the maturity date of the amended credit agreement was extended to January 30, 2022. The amended credit agreement contains customary financial covenants and restrictions, such as a senior leverage ratio, a total net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.\nConference Call Information\nThe call is scheduled for Thursday, February 15, 2018 at 10:00 am CT, and is being webcast and can be accessed from the Company’s website at www.ir.oilstatesintl.com .

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for operating income (loss) or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Additionally, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company has included EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because its management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA provide useful information regarding its ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures and provides investors a helpful measure for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. The Company uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA to compare and to monitor the performance of its business segments to other comparable public companies and as a benchmark for the award of incentive compensation under its annual incentive compensation plan. The tables above set forth reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA to operating income (loss), which is the most directly comparable measure of financial performance calculated under generally accepted accounting principles.\n(B) The terms Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA consist of net loss from continuing operations plus net interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and certain other items.

The Company has included Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because its management believes that Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA provide useful information regarding its ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures and provides investors a helpful measure for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. The Company uses Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA to compare and to monitor the performance of the Company and its business segments to other comparable public companies and as a benchmark for the award of incentive compensation under its annual incentive compensation plan. The table above sets forth a reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA to net loss from continuing operations, which is the most directly comparable measure of financial performance calculated under generally accepted accounting principles.\nOIL STATES INTERNATIONAL, INC.
