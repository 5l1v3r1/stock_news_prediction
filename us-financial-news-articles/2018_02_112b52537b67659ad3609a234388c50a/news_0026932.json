Moon’s chief of staff held a farewell dinner for the delegation before the delegation attended a performance by a North Korean orchestra, the last item on their itinerary before heading home. \n“I never thought I would visit (the South) so suddenly and believed much would be strange and different but I saw many things that were similar or the same,” said Kim Yo Jong in a toast during Sunday’s dinner, adding she hoped to meet the “friendly faces” before her later in Pyongyang. \nEarlier South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon had hosted a lunch for the Pyongyang delegation at a five-star hotel. \nOn Saturday Kim Yo Jong “courteously” handed over a personal letter from the North Korean leader to Moon and told him of her brother’s “intention”, North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said, without elaborating what that was. \nSouth Korean officials said Moon had been invited to Pyongyang to speak with Kim Jong Un during the talks and lunch that Moon hosted at the presidential Blue House in Seoul on Saturday. \nSuch a meeting, if it came about, would mark the first inter-Korea summit since 2007. \nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, back in Washington after attending the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, said the United States, South Korea and Japan were in complete agreement on isolating North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. \n“There is no daylight between the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan on the need to continue to isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically until they abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile program,” Pence told reporters during the return flight to the United States. \nA White House official said although Moon did not discuss the invitation with Pence, the South Korean president made it very clear that only when North Korea actually starts to take steps to denuclearise would anyone even consider beginning to take the pressure off.

Yonhap via REUTERS \n‘COME VISIT PYONGYANG’ \nLoud applause greeted the appearance of Moon, Kim Yo Jong and her delegation at the concert, attended by more than a thousand people. The North Korean orchestra will return home on Monday after their second and last performance on Sunday. \nNorth Korea’s nominal head of state, Kim Yong Nam, a member of the delegation, was seen wiping away tears with his handkerchief and at times clapping enthusiastically during the show. \n“Always stay healthy and please come and visit Pyongyang with President Moon,” Kim Yo Jong told South Korea’s First Lady Kim Jung-sook after the show ended.
