Macron’s government also plans to invest 15 billion euros in job training over the next five years, significantly expanding apprenticeship schemes under broader changes to be presented in April.\nThe logo of the National Agency for Employment (Pole Emploi) is seen on the facade of a building in Nice, France, March 3, 2016. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard/File Photo That reform will take time to kick in, leaving companies to grapple in the meantime with a widespread mismatch between those seeking work and the jobs on offer.\nEven though French unemployment remains higher than the euro zone average, a lack of skilled workers is creating production bottlenecks and snarling up supply chains, company executives told Reuters last week.\nThat means the country may already be reaching the limits of what economists call its structural unemployment rate, which could be around 9 percent according to European Commission data from November.\n“The available workforce doesn’t match the needs of the country’s production base, which will at some point limit the drop in the unemployment rate,” Alexandre Vincent of the COE-Rexecode think-tank told Reuters on Thursday.\nMacron this week identified the deterioration in the skill set of the French workforce as the most worrying issue for the economy.\n“When you’re told structural unemployment is at 9 percent, that’s the real scandal,” he told reporters.\nBecause of this mismatch, French firms are starting to see wage pressure, as elsewhere in the West.\nBut they are also trying to avoid raising salaries by attracting skilled workers by other means, such as dangling long-term contracts, training and other perks.\nMany employers have until now avoided moving to permanent contracts over fears that under France’s previous stricter labour rules they would struggle to sack workers if business turned sour.\nMacron’s overhaul of the labour code has helped ease those concerns, and hiring on permanent contracts rose 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter to 48 percent, a level not seen since before the global financial crisis.\nThursday’s data also showed the number of jobless people in mainland France fell by 205,000 in the fourth quarter, bringing the total number of unemployed to 2.5 million.\nThe employment rate, the percentage of people in jobs, rose to 65.7 percent, the highest level since the early 1980s, with all age groups marking an improvement.\nReporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T10:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T10:50:10.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
