IMG announced in December 2016 a plan to build another indoor theme park called IMG Worlds of Legends, which will feature eight property partnerships with global names such as Nickelodeon, Mattel and Pokemon.\nThe company said they are working on the design of IMG Worlds of Legends and an update will be soon provided.\nReuters reported in December 2016 that the company was working with JP Morgan Chase & Co, EFG Hermes and Goldman Sachs on a possible initial public offering (IPO) as the park operator expands. reut.rs/2E2d58V\nIMG will continue to keep all possible future financing options open, the company spokesperson said when questioned about IPO plans.\n$1 = 3.6730 UAE dirham Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://reut.rs/2E2d58V", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:11:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
