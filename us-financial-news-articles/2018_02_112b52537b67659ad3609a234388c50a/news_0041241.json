During 2017 Walmex opened 125 new stores while online sales climbed 34 percent.\nWalmex posted the healthy sales growth even as annual inflation in Latin America’s second-biggest economy climbed to a 16-1/2 year high in December.\nEarlier this month, Mexico’s central bank hiked interest rates, citing increased risks of inflation.\nBanorte analyst Valentin Mendoza said Walmex has been able to use its scale to keep prices low despite inflation, getting an edge over competitors.\nWalmex shares rose 0.22 percent to 44.95 pesos on Thursday before the results were released.\nReporting by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Christine Murray and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T00:11:43.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
