Apple captured a record 51 percent global smartphone revenue share , accounting for more than the rest of the entire industry combined.\nLinda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “We estimate total global smartphone wholesale revenues grew 8 percent annually to reach an all-time high of US$120 billion during Q4 2017. The smartphone industry’s wholesale average selling price surged 18 percent annually from US$255 in Q4 2016 to US$300 in Q4 2017. The smartphone industry has managed to increase massively its pricing and revenues, despite a recent decrease in shipment volumes.”\nNeil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “We estimate Apple iPhone captured a record 51 percent share of all smartphone wholesale revenues worldwide in Q4 2017. Apple iPhone generated a huge US$61 billion in the quarter, helped by solid demand for its premium X model, and Apple now accounts for more revenue than the rest of the entire global smartphone industry combined. Apple generated three times more smartphone revenue than nearest rival Samsung and 7 times more than Huawei. Apple iPhone’s average selling price is approaching US$800 and almost three times higher than the overall industry average. Apple iPhone is an incredible money-making machine.”\nLinda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Samsung grew its global smartphone wholesale revenues by 16 percent annually to US$19 billion in Q4 2017. Like Apple, Samsung’s smartphone wholesale average selling price (ASP) grew strongly, rising 21 percent annually to US$254 in the quarter. The popularity of premium Note 8 and Galaxy S8 models, as well as fewer low-end sales in its core Asia markets such as China, drove the growth.”\nWoody Oh, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Huawei generated US$8 billion of global smartphone wholesale revenues to maintain its position as the world’s third largest vendor by turnover in Q4 2017. Huawei’s smartphone wholesale average selling price sits at US$205 today and it has by far the lowest pricing among the top-three smartphone players. If Huawei wants to grow its worldwide pricing and revenues even higher in the future, the company will need to grab additional marketshare in the high-value United States market.”\nGlobal Smartphone Wholesale Revenues by Vendor in Q4 2017 1\nGlobal Smartphone Wholesale Revenues (US$, Billions) Q4 '16 Q4 '17 Apple $54.2 $61.4 Samsung $16.2 $18.9 Huawei $7.2 $8.4 Others $34.2 $31.5 Total $111.8 $120.2 Global Smartphone Wholesale Revenue Share (%) Q4 '16 Q4 '17 Apple 48.5% 51.0% Samsung 14.5% 15.7% Huawei 6.5% 7.0% Others 30.5% 26.2% Total 100.0% 100.0% Source: Strategy Analytics The full report, Global Smartphone Revenue, ASP and Profit by Vendor by Price Tier: Q4 2017, is published by the Strategy Analytics Wireless Smartphone Strategies (WSS) service, details of which can be found here: https://tinyurl.com/yamnzgs2 .\nAbout Strategy Analytics:\nStrategy Analytics is a global, independent research and consulting firm.
