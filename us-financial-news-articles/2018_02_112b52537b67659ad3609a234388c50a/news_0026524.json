We had nothing to do with what happened. Port Said is innocent from what happened. But thank God,” said 32-year-old home fan Mahran Al Sayed. \nAl Masry supporters had been accused of inciting the violence with many of the dead crushed when panicked fans tried to escape from the stadium after a post-match pitch invasion by home supporters. Others fell or were thrown from terraces.
