Dollar General and Dollar Tree’s Family Dollar division have signaled that food stamps account for roughly 5 percent of sales, according to Gordon Haskett Research Advisors analyst Chuck Grom. \nBut the changes — if implemented — would extend to a broad swath of the grocery industry, including Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co. The food-stamp program served 42.2 million people during the 2017 fiscal year, with many spending the benefits at supermarkets. \n“Whenever the low-income consumer feels pressured, there’s going to be an effect,” said Poonam Goyal, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \nDollar Tree fell as much as 3.7 percent to $103.68, while Dollar General was down 4.9 percent to $93.48. The declines largely wiped out gains by the two companies this year. \nThe plan to overhaul SNAP would save a projected $214 billion over a decade, according to the administration. It would give all households receiving more than $90 a month in cash a food-aid package that would include items such as shelf-stable milk, peanut butter, cereal and meat.
