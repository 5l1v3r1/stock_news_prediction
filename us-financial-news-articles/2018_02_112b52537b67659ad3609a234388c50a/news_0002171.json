The Philippine Stock Exchange PSEI Index rose as much as 0.6 percent after shedding 3.3 percent in the previous two sessions. \"The index dropped quite a bit. Technically we're at support level, so I think that's one of the reasons why we are rebounding,\" said April Lee-Tan from COL Financial INC. Real estate giant Ayala Land climbed as much as 2.8 percent, while SM Prime Holdings rose as much as 1.6 percent. Among other gainers, SM Investments Corp jumped up to 2 percent, while Bank of the Philippine Islands rose 2.4 percent. The central bank said on Wednesday that annual inflation in January may hit the upper end of the government's target range of 2.0 percent to 4.0 percent for this year, boosted by higher prices of oil and food. Singapore shares were little changed. Industrial stocks were among the top gainers. Jardine Matheson Holdings rose as much as 2 percent, while United Overseas Bank Ltd climbed 0.9 percent. Thai shares climbed as much as 0.6 percent and extended gains into a second session, ahead of January inflation data. Energy stocks were among the top gainers with PTT Pcl rising as much as 1.2 percent. PTT Exploration and Production Pcl surged to a near three-year high after Royal Dutch Shell said on Wednesday it would sell its stake in the Bongkot gas field to the Thai petroleum producer. Indonesian shares extended gains into a second day, rising as much as 0.8 percent, ahead of January inflation data. Index heavyweight Bank Central Asia jumped up to 3 percent. An index of the country's 45 most liquid stocks climbed 0.8 percent. Vietnam shares dropped over 1 percent, dragged down by industrials. FLC Faros Construction slumped up to 6.7 percent, while Petrovietnam Gas Joint Stock Corp fell 3.7 percent. Malaysia remained closed for a public holiday. Asian shares eked out modest gains, clawing back sharp losses from earlier this week, however, rising U.S. bond yields and interest rates could dampen investors' optimism toward the global economic outlook. The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold as expected at its first policy meeting in 2018 on Wednesday but flagged interest policy tightening later this year.
