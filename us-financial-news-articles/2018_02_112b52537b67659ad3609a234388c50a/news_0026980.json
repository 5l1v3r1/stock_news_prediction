The lawyer, David Silver, provided the document to Reuters. A spokesman for the Tezos project’s founders did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.\nReporting by Anna Irrera; Writing by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T13:29:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
