With Joe Marler suspended and Ellis Genge, Matt Mullan and Beno Obano all injured, uncapped prop Alec Hepburn is named among the replacements. \nJones has always admired the hole-punching ability of rugby league convert Te‘o but the New Zealand-born, part-Samoan 31-year-old has had to work overtime to get back into test-match shape after such a long lay-off. \nAs evidence of his commitment he spent a lot of his own money to fund a six-week rehabilitation course in Brisbane, which included the extensive use of a cryotherapy ice machine. \n“He’s a very experienced player, he knows his body,” Jones said on Thursday. \n”He went to Australia with trusted physios and has come back in super nick and is definitely ready to play a significant part of the game. \n“He’s got a big match demeanour, he doesn’t get too excited or too disappointed and gets on with the next play.” \nTe‘o’s only previous England start was also against Italy last year when they had something of a scare at Twickenham when they struggled to deal with the Italians’ surprise “no ruck” tactics before coming from behind at halftime to emerge 36-15 winners. \nThat took their tally to 23 wins from 23 games against Italy, averaging 40 points a game. \nEngland will expect to make it 24 on Sunday in the first step in their bid to become the first team to win the Five/Six Nations championship outright three years in a row. \nTeam:15 Mike Brown (Harlequins 64 caps)14 Anthony Watson (Bath Rugby 28 caps)13 Ben Te‘o (Worcester Warriors 8 caps)12 Owen Farrell (Saracens 53 caps)11 Jonny May (Leicester Tigers 29 caps)10 George Ford (Leicester Tigers 40 caps) 9 Ben Youngs (Leicester Tigers 73 caps) 1 Mako Vunipola (Saracens 44 caps) 2 Dylan Hartley (Northampton Saints 89 caps) 3 Dan Cole (Leicester Tigers 77 caps) 4 Joe Launchbury (Wasps 47 caps) 5 Maro Itoje (Saracens 14 caps) 6 Courtney Lawes (Northampton Saints 61 caps) 7 Chris Robshaw (Harlequins 59 caps) 8 Sam Simmonds (Exeter Chiefs 3 caps) \nReplacements16 Jamie George (Saracens 20 caps)17 Alec Hepburn (Exeter Chiefs uncapped)18 Harry Williams (Exeter Chiefs 5 caps)19 George Kruis (Saracens 21 caps)20 Sam Underhill (Bath Rugby 3 caps)21 Danny Care (Harlequins 76 caps)22 Jonathan Joseph (Bath Rugby 35 caps)23 Jack Nowell (Exeter Chiefs 23 caps) Reporting by Mitch Phillips; editing by Sudipto Ganguly/Amlan Chakraborty/Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:33:33.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
