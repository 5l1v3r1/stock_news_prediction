The increase in third party fee revenues was primarily driven by an increase in management fees as a result of an increase in assets under management over the last twelve months. Total expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $2.6 million compared to $2.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 10.1%.

The decrease was driven by the fourth quarter 2017 notable loss events. Asset Management segment (loss) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $(1.1) million compared to income of $6.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $7.4 million.\nManaged investments\nHighlights for the fourth quarter 2017 were as follows:\nManaged net investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $41.6 million compared to $35.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $5.7 million, or 16.0%. The increase was primarily driven by increased returns on the Company’s portfolio of managed fixed maturities and other investments. Annualized effective yield on managed investments for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 2.44%, compared to 2.25% for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 19 basis points.

Changes in unrealized (losses) on managed investments during the three months ended December 31, 2017 were primarily driven by the impact of interest rate increases on the Company’s managed fixed maturity portfolio. Income from investment affiliates for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $6.3 million compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $4.2 million, or 192.9%.

The decrease was primarily driven by a lower bonus accrual and a higher allocation of costs to reporting segments during the three months Share compensation expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $4.1 million compared to $3.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.3 million, or 7.5%.

Tax (benefit) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $(0.4) million compared to $(21.2) million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The tax benefit during the three months ended December 31, 2017 mainly related to operating losses in the Insurance segment and was partially offset by the re-measurement of net deferred taxes following U.S. Tax Reform. The tax benefit during the three months ended December 31, 2016 related to a partial release of a valuation allowance which had been applied against a deferred tax asset related to net operating losses acquired as part of the Company’s acquisition of Flagstone. The release was due to the Company believing it is more-likely-than-not that it will have sufficient future taxable income to realize a portion of that deferred tax asset over three years beginning in 2017 and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company was required to record a tax benefit of $18.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn presenting the Company’s results, management has included and discussed certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures, which may be defined and calculated differently by other companies, better explain and enhance the understanding of the Company’s results of operations. However, these measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nIn addition to presenting book value per common share determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company believes that the following non-GAAP book value financial measures are key financial indicators for evaluating performance and measuring overall growth: book value per diluted common share, book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends and tangible book value per diluted common share. A reconciliation of book value per common share, a GAAP financial measure, to the non-GAAP book value financial measures has been included below.\nIn addition to presenting net (loss) income (attributable) available to Validus common shareholders determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company believes that showing net operating income (loss) available (attributable) to Validus common shareholders, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability and enables investors, analysts, rating agencies and other users of its financial information to more easily analyze the Company’s results in a manner similar to how management analyzes the Company’s underlying business performance.\nNet operating income (loss) available (attributable) to Validus common shareholders, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by the addition or subtraction of certain Consolidated Statement of (Loss) Income line items from net (loss) income (attributable) available to Validus common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and measures the performance of the Company’s operations without the influence of gains or losses on investments and foreign currencies and other items as noted in the reconciliation below. The Company excludes these items from its calculation of net operating income (loss) available (attributable) to Validus common shareholders because the amount of these gains and losses is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part, according to availability of investment market opportunities and other factors. The Company believes these amounts are largely independent of its core underwriting activities and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations. The Company believes the reporting of net operating income (loss) available (attributable) to Validus common shareholders enhances the understanding of results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the Company’s core (re)insurance operations. This profitability is influenced significantly by earned premium growth, adequacy of the Company’s pricing, as well as loss frequency and severity. Over time it is also influenced by the Company’s underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio, which it accomplishes through its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.\nReturn on average equity, a GAAP financial measure, and net operating return on average equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the returns generated on common shareholders’ equity during the year and are presented below.\nValidus Holdings, Ltd.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements herein may include projections, goals, assumptions and statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and Validus may make related oral, forward-looking statements on or following the date hereof. These projections, goals, assumptions and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only Validus’ belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside Validus’ control.
