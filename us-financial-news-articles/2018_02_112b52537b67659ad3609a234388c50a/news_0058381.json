Mao’s body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch, and Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer, will be released from prison.\nThese won’t happen immediately—Xi won’t even be named president until March—and I may be wrong entirely. But my hunch on this return to China, my old home, is that change is coming.\nHere’s my case for Xi as a reformer.\nFirst, it’s in his genes. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a pioneer of economic restructuring and publicly denounced the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in 1989. Xi’s mother chooses to live in Shenzhen, the most capitalist enclave in the country.\nXi is also one of the first Chinese leaders to send a child to the United States as an undergraduate. His daughter is a junior at Harvard, reflecting her parents’ emphasis on learning English and their admiration for American education.\nIt helps that the bar is low for Xi: he follows President Hu Jintao, who is widely regarded in China as a failure. Even government ministers complain that he squandered his 10 years as leader. Today there is pent-up demand for change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T17:26:07.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
