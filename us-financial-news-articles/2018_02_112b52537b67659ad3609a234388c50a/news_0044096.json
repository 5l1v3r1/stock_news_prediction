Patients with hyperglycemia demonstrated improved glucose tolerance (n=13); Fig 2. Osteocalcin levels improved (n=17)\nFinancial Highlights\n2017 revenue of $159.2 million, an increase of 96 percent from 2016 Fourth quarter revenue of $53.3 million, an increase of 124 percent from fourth quarter 2016 2017 GAAP net income of $1.04 per share, compared to $0.07 per share in 2016 Fourth quarter GAAP net income of $0.77 per share, compared to $0.04 per share in fourth quarter 2016 Cash and investments at December 31, 2017 of $104.0 million 2018 revenue guidance of $275 – 300 million\nCorcept’s 2017 revenue was $159.2 million, compared to $81.3 million in 2016. Fourth quarter revenue was $53.3 million, compared to $23.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGAAP net income was $129.1 million for the year and $98.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $8.1 million for the year and $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 net income included a one-time, non-cash gain of $76.7 million from recognition of the company’s deferred tax assets. Excluding this non-cash gain and non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation and implied interest on the company's capped royalty obligation (which it retired in July 2017), Corcept generated $24.7 million of non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter, compared to $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full-year, non-GAAP net income was $63.3 million, compared to $17.1 million in 2016. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income is set forth below.\nOperating expenses increased to $31.6 million in the fourth quarter 2017, from $18.8 million in the fourth quarter 2016, primarily due to increased spending to develop the company’s proprietary, selective cortisol modulators, including relacorilant, CORT125281 and CORT118335. Costs resulting from revenue growth also increased, primarily compensation expense for the company’s expanded sales force and the cost of dispensing Korlym ® to more patients.\nCash and investments increased $27.4 million in the fourth quarter, to $104.0 million. This balance does not include $12.9 million delivered to Corcept in January 2018 pursuant to the settlement of litigation with the company’s former specialty pharmacy.\n“We produced outstanding results in 2017 and expect strong performance in 2018. Physicians are increasingly aware of the risks of not treating hypercortisolism and are more frequently screening patients for the disease. For many of the patients they identify, physicians are choosing cortisol modulation as the optimum medical treatment,” said Joseph K. Belanoff, MD, Corcept’s Chief Executive Officer.\nRelacorilant Phase 2 Trial Interim Results\nTop-line findings from first 17 patients enrolled in this trial (“Low Dose Cohort”) Dosing: each patient received 100 mg/day of relacorilant for four weeks, then 150 mg/day for four weeks, then 200 mg/day for four weeks Statistically significant, dose-dependent improvements in glucose tolerance and serum osteocalcin (a marker of bone growth suppressed by excess cortisol activity) Five millimeters or greater reduction in blood pressure in 45 percent of patients with uncontrolled hypertension No evidence of progesterone receptor affinity; no serious adverse events Testing of higher doses continues; results expected in second quarter Phase 3 trial expected to start in second half of 2018\n“The data emerging from relacorilant’s Phase 2 trial point to a major clinical advance – a medication offering the benefits of potent cortisol modulation, but without Korlym’s serious off-target effects,” said Dr. Belanoff.\n“Relacorilant’s activity in these patients is extremely encouraging,” said Robert S. Fishman, MD, Corcept’s Chief Medical Officer. “The medication’s safety profile was excellent: no serious adverse events and, as expected, no signs of progesterone receptor affinity.\n“We were pleasantly surprised that even at relatively modest doses administered for only 12 weeks, many patients in the low dose cohort responded: Patients with hyperglycemia demonstrated improved glucose tolerance as measured by the oral glucose tolerance test. Levels of osteocalcin – a marker of bone formation – also improved, which is important because hypercortisolism frequently causes osteoporosis. For both measures, these results grew more pronounced as the dose of relacorilant increased, with the highest dose reaching statistical significance compared to baseline ( see Figures 1 and 2). Forty-five percent of patients (five of eleven) with uncontrolled hypertension showed a five millimeter or greater reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure as measured by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring – a result at 12 weeks that was similar to the one we saw in Korlym’s pivotal trial after six months of treatment.\nAn infographic accompanying this announcement are available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/169da0f1-9927-4e2b-bed4-0b7a6568c65a\nWe expect that these measures will show an even greater effect size in the trial’s final cohort of patients, who are receiving higher doses of the medication, and look forward to sharing the full results at scientific conferences later in the year.”\nOther Clinical Developments\n“Relacorilant’s promising initial Phase 2 results should not overshadow the progress in our other development programs,” added Dr. Fishman. “CORT118335’s Phase 1 trial continues. We plan to initiate Phase 2 trials of this compound as a treatment for patients with antipsychotic-induced weight gain and non-alcoholic steatotic hepatitis (“NASH”) by year-end. CORT125281 is now being tested in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Finally, our Phase 1/2 trial of relacorilant plus Abraxane ® to treat patients with solid tumors is generating encouraging early results, which will be released in detail later this year.”\nConference Call\nCorcept will hold a conference call February 22, 2017, at 5:00 pm Eastern Time (2:00 pm Pacific Time).

The passcode will be 1581123.\nAbout Hypercortisolism\nHypercortisolism, often referred to as Cushing’s syndrome, is caused by excessive activity of the stress hormone cortisol. Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is an orphan disease that most often affects adults aged 20 – 50. In the United States, an estimated 20,000 patients have Cushing’s syndrome, with about 3,000 new patients being diagnosed each year. Symptoms include high blood sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure, upper-body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, thinning arms and legs, severe fatigue and weak muscles. Irritability, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and depression are also common. Cushing’s syndrome can affect every organ system in the body and can be lethal if not treated effectively.\nAbout Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated\nCorcept is a pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs that treat severe metabolic, oncologic and psychiatric disorders by modulating the effects of cortisol. Korlym is the company’s first FDA-approved medication. Corcept has a large portfolio of proprietary compounds that modulate the effects of cortisol but not progesterone. Corcept owns extensive United States and foreign intellectual property covering the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of a wide variety of serious disorders, including Cushing’s syndrome. It also holds composition of matter patents covering its selective cortisol modulators.\nNon-GAAP Measures of Net Income\nTo supplement Corcept’s financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of net income, non-GAAP basic net income per share and non-GAAP diluted net income per share that exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and the interest expense of the company’s capped royalty obligation. We believe that these non-GAAP measures help investors better evaluate the company’s past financial performance and potential future results. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP accounting and investors should read them in conjunction with the company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures of net income we use may be different from, and not directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nForward -Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements.
