Had iHeart made that payment, it may have upset debt investors who are more senior in the company’s capital structure and have a greater claim on the company’s assets.\nThe latest public proposal by creditors for a debt restructuring, released late last year, called for the senior creditors to take the bulk of the equity in a recapitalized iHeart. The existing owners, buyout firms Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, would keep small stakes in the company.\nThe radio station owner tried to trim its debt load by up to $4.3 billion a year ago, according to an estimate by credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings, by convincing its lenders and bond investors to exchange some of their debt holdings. But the company has not received enough support to finalize these arrangements.
