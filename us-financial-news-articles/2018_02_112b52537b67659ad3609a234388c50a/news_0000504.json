He’s fractured his ankle and damaged ligaments around it,” the former England manager told reporters. \n“He certainly won’t play again this season and may be a doubt to be fit for the start of next.” \nHodgson described the type of injuries to hit his squad this season as “unusual” as he has just 19 players to choose from for Sunday’s league fixture against Newcastle United. \n“Our injury situation is unusual. A lot of clubs can get a number of muscle injuries, but we’re in a situation where we’ve lost five for the season,” he said. \n“(Christian) Benteke, (Wilfried) Zaha, and (Mamadou) Sakho all spent at least 6 weeks out earlier in the season.” \nHodgson added that Norwegian new signing Alexander Sorloth will replace Sako in the squad at Selhurst Park this weekend.
