REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files The 4.3 percent wage increase now agreed for a 27-month period mirrors a deal that IG Metall won for around 3.9 million industrial employees in Germany this month after rolling 24-hour strikes across the country.\n“This (similarity) was an important objective for us in order to safeguard the competitiveness of Volkswagen,” board member Karlheinz Blessing said in a statement.\n“At the same time, we have made Volkswagen significantly more attractive as an employer,” he said.\nVW workers will also receive an additional payment equivalent to 27.5 percent of their monthly wage once a year from next year.\nSome employees with small children at home or who work a demanding shift schedule can choose to take six additional days off instead, the parties said.\nOn the other hand, Volkswagen will be able to ask five percent and in special cases even 10 percent of the workers covered by the wage agreement to temporarily increase their working hours to up to 40 per week.\n“This provision gives us the additional flexibility which we definitely needed,” VW chief negotiator Martin Rosik said.\nFrom July 2019, the amount that Volkswagen pays into the company pension scheme each month will rise to 90 euros per member from 27 euros now, and increase to 98 euros from January 2020.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; editing by Keith Weir and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T14:25:44.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
