( BBVA.MC ), will open for business this week, marking the latest effort by the Spanish lender to attract a new generation of digital-savvy customers.\nThe startup, which will offer online banking services to small businesses and freelancers, was built within a BBVA division that funds stand-alone fintech startups, the companies said on Tuesday.\nAzlo will rely on BBVA’s banking license and payment infrastructure to operate across the United States, but will be run as an independent company, its founder and CEO Brian Hamilton said in an interview.\nFounded in early 2017, Azlo has been in testing mode with a small group of clients over the past few months, Hamilton said.\nBig banks across the world are seeking to court millennials as their next generation of customers, with products such as app-based accounts.\nBBVA has already acquired or invested in several young online-only banks.\nIn 2014, it bought U.S-based digital bank Simple for $117 million, and the following year it acquired a majority stake in British mobile-only bank Atom Bank. Months later, it acquired Scandinavian digital bank Holvi.\nThe move could help BBVA expand its retail presence in the United States, where it operates through its subsidiary BBVA Compass.\nAzlo will target “gig-economy” freelancers and self-employed workers, a segment which has been overlooked by traditional banks but is expected to grow, Hamilton said.\n“We are targeting an underserved segment,” Hamilton said. “If you walk into a bank and try to open a business account it is still pretty wonky and not easy.”\nCustomers will be able to open the account online and will have access to digital tools for businesses, such as a service to send invoices to clients and request payments, he said.\nThe financial terms of BBVA’s investment in Azlo were not disclosed.\nReporting by Anna Irrera, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T16:03:13.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
