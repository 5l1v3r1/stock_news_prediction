By doing so, we were able to take out $94 million of full-year operating expenses,\" Chief Financial Officer Frank Verdecanna told Reuters.\nThe Milpitas, California-based company said it expected to report between breakeven and earnings of 4 cents per share for the full-year, compared with analysts' estimate of a net loss of 2 cents.\nFireEye also said it expected revenue in the range of $815 million to $825 million, above estimates of $799.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nFireEye said net loss attributable to shareholders widened to $77 million, or 42 cents per share, in the fourth quarter from $61.5 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier.\nThe quarter included payment of $12.5 million in net legal settlement costs, the company said.\nTotal revenue rose 9.5 percent to $202.3 million, beating analysts' estimate of $193.6 million.
