But in 2016, Xiaomi faced intense competition from other low-cost rivals such as Oppo and Vivo.\nVCG | Getty Images Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun introduces Surge S1 chipset, Mi 5C smartphone and Redmi 4X smartphone during a press conference on February 28, 2017 in Beijing, China Chief Executive Lei even admitted the company grew \"too fast\" in a letter to staff at the start of 2017. But he also said the company made \"essential adjustments\" to its business to grow in the future.

It opened its third physical store in Spain on Saturday, to help boost its presence in western Europe, and has been launching shops in other key markets, including India and China. It has also focused on new products from smart artificial intelligence speakers similar to the Amazon Echo, to a new range of TVs, which has helped diversify the business.\nXiaomi could be gearing up to go public this year and has hired Citic Securities, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as joint sponsors for its initial public offering (IPO), Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported in January . The news company said that the IPO could value Xiaomi at $100 billion.\nWang declined to comment on the report.\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T08:05:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
