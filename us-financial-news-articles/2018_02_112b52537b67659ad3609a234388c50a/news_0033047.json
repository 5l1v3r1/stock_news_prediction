It will take effect on March 2.\n“In deciding to reduce the reserve requirement ratios, the Monetary Board reaffirms the (Philippine central bank‘s) commitment to gradually lessen its reliance on reserve requirements for managing liquidity in the financial system,” it said in a statement.\nThe central bank had previously flagged a plan to eventually reduce the reserve requirement ratio, one of the highest in the region, as it reduces its reliance on this tool to manage liquidity. It said the move should not be mistaken as a change in monetary policy.
