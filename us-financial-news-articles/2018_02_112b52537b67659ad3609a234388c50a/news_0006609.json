It’s a return to a repressive period we had forgotten about,” NTV journalist Larry Madowo told Reuters. “We are becoming another African country.”\nBLOODY CLASHES NTV journalist Ken Mijungu told Reuters that he and colleagues Madowo and Linus Kaikai had all been warned by security sources on Wednesday that their arrest was imminent.\nA supporter of Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga of the National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition jumps from a bus after riot police fired teargas canisters to disperse them after his swearing-in ceremony in Nairobi, Kenya January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Isaac Biosse In African states with entrenched rulers such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon, governments have asked telecommunications companies to block social media, mainly during elections and protests.\nOn Wednesday, the Kenyan government had said the TV stations would stay off air indefinitely.\nInterior Minister Fred Matiang‘i accused media organizations of facilitating Odinga’s “illegal act”, which he said put the lives of thousands of Kenyans at risk. [L8N1PQ3JZ]\nClashes between Odinga supporters and security forces claimed around 100 lives during the election season. Almost all were killed by the police.\nAlso on Wednesday, police arrested opposition lawmaker Tom Kajwang for illegally administering Odinga’s “oath”. He was expected to be charged on Thursday oath but was taken out of court by police before the charges were read.\nKenyatta won an Aug. 8 election that was later nullified by the Supreme Court over irregularities. A repeat election was held on Oct. 26, but Odinga boycotted it because he said the electoral commission had made insufficient reforms.\nKenyatta won with more than 98 percent of the vote.\nOdinga, whom the government accuses of trying to force a bloody confrontation with the authorities, gave no hint in his five-minute speech at Tuesday’s rally about future actions and deflected questions on Thursday about his next move.\n“We want (ruling party) Jubilee to accept that they lost the election,” he told a news conference, promising to release details of his plan the next day.\nThe opposition leader accused the government of suspending the constitution by attacking the media, and batted away suggestions his staged inauguration was a bid to seize power.\n“I am not a megalomaniac. I am a very reasonable Kenyan,” Odinga said.\nAdditional reporting by Humphrey Malalo and John Ndiso; Writing by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T13:24:21.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
