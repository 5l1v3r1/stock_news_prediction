Highlights of the full year and quarter include:\nGenerated earnings per diluted share of $3.97 for the year compared to $3.50 in 2016. For the fourth quarter, generated earnings per diluted share of $0.67 compared to $0.80 for the fourth quarter 2016. Generated FFO per diluted share of $5.74 for the year ($5.91 excluding prepayment premium) compared to $5.65 in 2016. For the fourth quarter, generated FFO per diluted share of $1.30 ($1.47 excluding prepayment premium) compared to $1.45 for the fourth quarter 2016. Generated same-center property operating income growth of 3.4% for the year ended 2017. For the fourth quarter, same-center growth was 2.6%. Signed leases for 300,511 sf of comparable space in the fourth quarter at an average rent of $34.75 psf and achieved cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 15%. Opportunistically issued $175 million of 3.25% senior unsecured notes due 2027 offered at 99.404% of the principal amount with a re-offer yield of 3.323%. Introduced 2018 FFO per diluted share guidance range of $6.08 to $6.24.\n\"We remain focused on the future as we navigate through this transitional time in the retail real estate space,\" said Donald C. Wood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Federal Realty. \"Through thoughtful positioning of our portfolio over the last decade, there are more arrows in our quiver than ever before. Federal Realty is the only shopping center company to grow NAREIT-defined FFO year-over-year for the entirety of the current real estate cycle, and we remain confident that retail-based real estate in the best locations, with flexible formats and carefully created environments will be the future of retail and will thrive in the years to come.\"\nFinancial Results\nFor the full year 2017, Federal Realty reported net income available for common shareholders of $287.5 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.97. This compares to net income available for common shareholders of $249.4 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.50 for the full year 2016. Net income available for common shareholders was $48.6 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.67 for the fourth quarter 2017 versus $57.9 million and $0.80, respectively, for the fourth quarter 2016.\nFor the full year 2017, Federal Realty generated funds from operations available for common shareholders (FFO) of $420.0 million, or $5.74 per diluted share. Excluding the $12.3 million early extinguishment of debt charge in the fourth quarter 2017, FFO per diluted share for the full year 2017 would have been $5.91. This compares to FFO of $406.4 million, or $5.65 per diluted share, for the full year 2016. For the fourth quarter 2017, FFO was $95.5 million, or $1.30 per diluted share ($1.47 if the early extinguishment of debt charge was excluded), compared to $104.9 million, or $1.45 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2016.\nFFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the Trust considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.\nPortfolio Results\nFor the year 2017, same-center property operating income increased 3.4% when including properties that are being redeveloped and 0.7% when excluding those properties. In fourth quarter 2017, same-center property operating income increased 2.6% when including properties that are being redeveloped and 1.0% when excluding those properties. As anticipated, the Trust's proactive releasing initiatives throughout the portfolio negatively impacted the year end and quarterly results.\nThe overall portfolio was 95.3% leased as of December 31, 2017, compared to 94.4% on December 31, 2016. Federal Realty's same center portfolio was 96.3% leased on December 31, 2017, compared to 95.9% on December 31, 2016.\nFor the year 2017, Federal Realty signed 406 leases for 1.8 million square feet of retail space. On a comparable basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), Federal Realty leased 1.6 million square feet at an average cash-basis contractual rent increase (i.e., excluding the impact of straight-line rents) of 13%. The average contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new leases is $38.31 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $33.79 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases. The previous average contractual rent was calculated by including both the minimum rent and any percentage rent actually paid during the last year of the lease term for the re-leased space. On a GAAP basis (i.e., including the impact of straight-line rents), rent increases for comparable retail space averaged 26% for the year ended 2017.\nDuring fourth quarter 2017, Federal Realty signed 91 leases for 344,768 square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis, Federal Realty leased 300,511 square feet at an average cash basis contractual rent increase of 15% and 27% on a GAAP basis. The average contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new leases is $34.75 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $30.19 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases.\nRegular Quarterly Dividends\nFederal Realty also announced today that its Board of Trustees declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $1.00 per common share, resulting in an indicated annual rate of $4.00 per common share. The regular common dividend will be payable on April 16, 2018 to common shareholders of record as of March 14, 2018.\nFederal Realty's Board of Trustees also declared a quarterly cash dividend with respect to the Trust's Series C Preferred Shares. All dividends on the preferred shares will be payable on April 16, 2018 to preferred shareholders of record as of April 2, 2018.\nSummary of Other Quarterly Activities and Recent Developments\nFebruary 12, 2018 – Federal Realty announced promotions within its finance, operating and development Ranks. Melissa Solis was promoted to Senior Vice President – Chief Accounting Officer. Christian Fleming was promoted to Vice President – Asset Management. Patrick McMahon was promoted to Vice President – Development.\nDecember 21, 2017 – Federal Realty issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured notes due 2027.
