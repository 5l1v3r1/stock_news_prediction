In second place is NASDAQ-listed NetEase Inc. \nShanda owns popular titles “Dragon Nest” and “The World of Legend”, and had been the main force in Chinese gaming before slipping behind local rivals including Tencent over the past decade. \nThe investment comes as Tencent gears up to formally launch global hit game “PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds” in China, after saying last year it would give the game a socialist make-over to meet Chinese rules governing digital content. \nTencent also owns significant stakes in U.S. game developers Riot Games Inc, Epic Games Inc and Activision Blizzard Inc. In 2016, Tencent bought the majority of Finland-based “Clash of Clans” mobile game maker Supercell for $8.6 billion. \nShanda said Tencent’s investment would help “bolster” Shanda’s core business. It also said the two firms would collaborate on current businesses, including several of Shanda’s popular games. \nTencent confirmed the investment in a statement, adding that Shanda was “one of the most widely recognized online game companies in China” and that its strategic investment would boost the smaller firm’s growth prospects. \nTencent is valued at over $510 billion and has seen its share price boom on the back of strong demand for its mobile games.
