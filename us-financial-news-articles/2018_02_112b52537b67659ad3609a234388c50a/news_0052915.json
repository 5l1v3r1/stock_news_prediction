It was placed in receivership in October 2015 for alleged links to Gulen.\nThe Slieve Gallion joint venture licence, currently wholly owned by Koza Ltd, has great potential as a source of base metals and gold, Walkabout said in a statement.\nIt is located around 20 kilometres from Dalradian Resources’ Curraghinalt project, where the Canadian miner is seeking to build Northern Ireland’s first major underground mine.\nWalkabout will get a 50 percent share of the Slieve Gallion joint venture if it spends a minimum of $500,000 in exploration and an additional 25 percent after a feasibility study.
