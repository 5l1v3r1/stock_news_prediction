REUTERS/Christinne Muschi There was no plan for Trump himself to meet Liu but officials did not rule it out if progress was being made.\nWhite House officials say China has shown little inclination to take steps to reduce the trade deficit in a way that would satisfy Trump and that he is now demanding action.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department on Feb. 16 recommended that Trump impose stiff curbs on steel imports from China and other countries and offered the president several options ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas.\nA blanket tariff on steel would cover every steel and aluminum product entering the American market from China.\nA source close to the White House said Trump had expressed interest in imposing a tariff on steel imports of at least 24 percent. The White House said no final decision had been made.\n”I don’t think we’ve ever had a better relationship with China than we do right now,“ Trump told reporters last Friday. ”The only thing that can get in its way is trade, because it so one-sided, it’s so lopsided.”\nReporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T22:27:35.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
