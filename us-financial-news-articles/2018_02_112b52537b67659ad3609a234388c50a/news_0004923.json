Rahimi became known as the “Chelsea Bomber.”\nIn a letter to U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who will impose punishment, Rahimi’s lawyer Xavier Donaldson said his client deserves no more than life plus 45 years in prison, all but 15 years of which are required by law.\nDonaldson said Rahimi, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Afghanistan, has completed classes in business, entrepreneurship and drama since his arrest.\nFILE PHOTO: Ahmad Khan Rahimi, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen accused of planting bombs in New York and New Jersey, appears in Union County Superior Court for a hearing in Elizabeth, New Jersey, U.S., May 15, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo He said Rahimi should be allowed to “avail himself of any educational opportunities” he qualifies for while in prison, and said the father of three should be housed as close to Virginia as possible so family can visit.\nDonaldson urged Berman not to “unnecessarily stack” extra life sentences on Rahimi for three of the eight counts.\n“The obvious severity of a life sentence plus 30 years is crystal clear: said sentence is intended to ensure that Mr. Rahimi is never released,” he wrote.\nOn Jan. 16, federal prosecutors also urged a life sentence for Rahimi.\nThey said Rahimi has “failed to show remorse” and has tried to radicalize fellow inmates with Islamic State and al Qaeda propaganda.
