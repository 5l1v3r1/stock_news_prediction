Authorities have yet to identify the remains of the other five bodies recovered.\nThe search for evidence at the home has been hampered by frozen ground, Idsinga said.\nReporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; Editing by Jim Finkle and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:38:56.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
