The work stoppage also slowed the unloading of beans at soyoil and meal manufacturing sites, Wade said. \n“Time passes and no merchandise enters, there are fewer stocks and the situation is getting worse,” Wade said in a telephone interview, speaking from his headquarters in Argentina’s main grains hub of Rosario. \nStrikes are common in the country as businesses struggle to provide wages that keep up with inflation, expected at more than 19 percent this year. \nArturo Rojas, president of the Management Consortium of the southern port of Quequen, said export activities were going to be affected there as well. \nHe said a cargo ship was loading and would embark on Thursday. “But there is no merchandise for the next one. After that the whole port would be stopped,” Rojas added.
