People want to see if it would confirm the recent trend of strong inflation and strong growth,” Goldberg said.\nA faster pace of inflation is likely to fan fears that the Fed would increase the number of rate hikes this year - the same worries that sparked the market rout that began Feb. 2 after a jobs report showed the strongest annual wage growth since 2009.\n“I expect a continued stream of volatility, driven by uncertainty among investors with fears of accelerating rates. I don’t think that’s going away any time soon,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.\nMSCI’s gauge of stock markets in 47 countries .MIWD PUS was down just 0.03 percent and its emerging markets index .MSCIEF rose 1.00 percent.\nA man walks past an electronic stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, February 9, 2018.

The S&P 500 .SPX lost 8.9 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,647.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 13.40 points, or 0.19 percent, to 6,968.56.\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a voting member in the central bank’s rate-setting committee this year, said inflation should pick up this year but not at a rate that requires a faster Fed reaction.\nThe market sell-off this month that led to stocks to decline 10 percent from a record peak last month and a jump in volatility will not damage the U.S. economy’s overall strong prospects, Mester told the chamber of commerce in Dayton, Ohio.\nU.S. long-dated Treasury yields slipped in generally quiet trading.\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.8494 percent.\nGerman government bonds were in demand as recent multi-year highs on yields on either side of the Atlantic proved attractive for some investors.\nGermany’s 10-year bund, the benchmark for the euro bloc, was down 1.5 basis points at 0.74 percent, off 2-1/2 year highs of 0.81 percent hit last week.

The Japanese yen JPY= strengthened 0.97 percent versus the greenback at 107.62 per dollar.\nOil fell to its lowest in two months, giving up early gains after a forecasting agency estimated world crude supply could overtake demand this year, potentially undermining producer efforts to curb supply.\nThe Paris-based International Energy Agency raised its forecast for oil demand growth in 2018 to 1.4 million barrels per day, from a previous projection of 1.3 million bpd.\nU.S. crude CLcv1 fell 23 cents to $59.06 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was down 11 cents at $62.48.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T03:07:14.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
