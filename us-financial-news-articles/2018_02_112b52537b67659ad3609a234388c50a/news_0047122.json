I just have somebody else doing the posts for me - which I don’t know if I‘m supposed to be saying that,” said Shiffrin, who is tipped to win a potential handful of medals.\n“I haven’t been watching (TV) really much - I watch in Korean, so that’s easy because I can’t understand anything.”\nReporting by Mark Trevelyan; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:08:44.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
