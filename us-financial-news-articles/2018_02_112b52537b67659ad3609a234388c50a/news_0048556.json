Adding to these concerns was a two-year budget deal reached this month which would increase spending on military and entitlement programs by $300 billion.\nTuesday’s short-dated government supply had a mixed reception among investors and dealers.\nAnalysts and traders said they were more concerned about demand for the $35 billion five-year note sale on Wednesday US5YTWI=TWEB and $29 billion seven-year auction on Thursday US7YTWI=TWEB.\nThese medium-term Treasuries were hard hit last week by stronger-than-forecast inflation data that stoked bets the Federal Reserve may speed up its interest rate hikes.\n“Demand could be spotty here because the two-year (auction) didn’t do particularly well,” said Mary Anne Hurley, vice president of fixed income at D.A. Davidson in Seattle.\nThe Treasury will also auction $15 billion in two-year floating-rate notes on Wednesday.\nOn Tuesday, the Treasury sold $51 billion of three-month bills at an interest rate of 1.63 percent and $45 billion of six-month bills at an interest rate of 1.82 percent. These were record-high amounts offered in an auction for both maturities, and they sold at the highest yields since September 2008.\nIt also sold $55 billion in one-month bills at an interest rate of 1.380 percent, and $28 billion in two-year fixed-rate debt at a yield of 2.255 percent, the highest since August 2008.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by James Dalgleish and Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T23:18:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
