The High Court reduced that sentence last April to three-and-a-half years. \nThe prosecution appealed against that decision, asking for the original sentence to be reinstated, but the Court of Appeal ruled on Thursday that the High Court’s decision would remain. \nThe Court of Appeal also rejected appeals by prosecutors against the sentencing of four other church leaders, who will continue to serve reduced sentences. \nKong was found guilty of misusing S$50 million ($36 million) of church money to fund his wife’s musical career. Domestic media have reported it was the largest amount of charity funds ever misappropriated in Singapore. \nThe once-glamorous founding pastor of City Harvest, known for his electrifying Sunday services, wore purple prison garb for the court appearance, his hair noticeably greyed. \nKong smiled and acknowledged with a wave more than 50 of his supporters, some of whom had waited outside the court from 6 a.m. (2200 GMT Wednesday). \nCity Harvest Church preaches a “prosperity gospel” that blends spiritual and material aspirations. \nKong’s wife, Ho Yeow Sun - known as Sun Ho - is famous for a video of her English-language hit “China Wine”, which shows her dancing intimately with rapper Wyclef Jean. \nDefence lawyers had said Sun Ho’s music career was used to evangelize. She was not charged in the case. \nWhile megachurches originated in the United States, some of the largest are in Asia, where packaging the traditional biblical message into a more dynamic format of pop music, lively services and social media has lured a new generation of followers and turned the churches into major enterprises. \nCity Harvest had a congregation of 15,923 and more than 50 affiliations in China, the United States, and seven other countries in 2016, according to its latest annual report.
