JB Hi-Fi and larger player Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd are among those expected to take an immediate hit from the entry of the online juggernaut. \nJB Hi-Fi cautioned its annual profits would grow at a slower pace than its sales, indicating tighter margins, after earlier reporting a 21 percent jump in underlying net profit to A$151.7 million ($119 million) for the six months ended December. \nShares of the company fell as much as 8.5 percent after the news and were down 7.8 percent by 0122 GMT, on track for their biggest daily drop since 2014. The stock had climbed 17 percent since Amazon started in Australia on Dec. 5, amid criticism of a lacklustre opening from the U.S. giant. \n“JB Hi-Fi has rallied strongly into this result on high expectations for Christmas trading (and) while this proved correct, concern is likely to build around gross margin pressure,” Citi analysts wrote in a client note. \nThe company expects its full-year profit to grow 13-16 percent despite sales rising 22 percent. \nMargins narrowed in the first half of the year too, with group sales up 41 percent, helped by demand for audio devices and drones, double the rate of its underlying net profit. \nJB Hi-Fi added that sales from its appliances chain, The Good Guys, which it bought in 2016, grew just 1.8 percent on a comparable store basis in the six-month period. \nFor the month of January, The Good Guys sales fell 4.7 percent from the same month a year earlier, due to unusually strong air conditioner sales the previous January, it said. \nOnline sales for JB Hi-Fi rose 41 percent to A$119.3 million in the six-month period, a fraction of total sales which came in at A$2.48 billion. \nJB Hi-Fi declared an interim dividend of 86 Australian cents per share, up from 72 Australian cents last year.
