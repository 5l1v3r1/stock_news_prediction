It is a promise between the two countries and the foundation of our bilateral ties,” Abe told reporters after meeting Moon in Pyeongchang, where he will attend the opening of the Winter Olympic Games.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nAbe, whose decision to attend the Games angered some of his conservative backers, has said the agreement will not be altered “by even one millimeter”. \nHe also demanded South Korea remove statues of comfort women that have been installed in several countries in addition to South Korea, including the United States, Australia and Germany, Kyodo news agency reported. Slideshow (4 Images) \nMoon said the emotional damage sustained by the victims cannot be resolved through simple exchanges between governments and that both South Korea and Japan should continue efforts to heal their wounds, Blue House spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom told a briefing. \nIn 2014, the U.N. Human Rights Committee asked Tokyo to clarify the “comfort women” euphemism, with an independent expert on the panel calling for it to be replaced with “enforced sex slaves”. \nDespite their differences, Moon and Abe decided to resume “shuttle diplomacy” as agreed last year and hold a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea and China as soon as possible. \nAbe said he had confirmed with Moon the need to maintain strong pressure on North Korea to get it to abandon its nuclear and missile programs, reiterating Tokyo’s stance that “talk for the sake of talk is pointless”. \nA North-South Olympics detente has raised concerns in Washington and Tokyo that Seoul may ease up on the “maximum pressure” campaign by the United States and its allies to rein in North Korea.
