TDC shares closed up 2.35 pct at 37.47 crowns before the report, valuing it at 30.43 billion Danish crowns ($5 billion).\nTDC did not give any financial details of the offer.\nThe consortium sent a letter on Jan. 26 to TDC chairman Pierre Danon offering to buy all of the shares in TDC, the newspaper said.\nA Macquarie spokeswoman in Sydney declined to comment. Spokesmen at ATP and PKA were also not able to comment, while PFA could not be reached. A spokesman at TDC did not give further information.\nBorsen said the bidding consortium is working with Nordea Bank ( NDA.ST ) and another unnamed bank on a deal.\nReporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen in Copenhagen.
