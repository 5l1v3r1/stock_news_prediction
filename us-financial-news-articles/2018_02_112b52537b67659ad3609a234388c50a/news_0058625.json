No treasury shares will be in issue after the Specific Repurchase. Application will be made to the JSE for the delisting of the shares with effect from Monday, 5 March 2018.\nThe acquisition will have no financial effect on Sasol or its shareholders, other than in respect of Specific Repurchase costs that are normally incurred in transactions of this nature. As the Specific Repurchase is intra-group, between Sasol and its wholly-owned subsidiary, SIC, the net cash position of the Sasol group will not change as a result of the acquisition (except for the payment of the transaction costs).\nConsequently, the financial effect of the Specific Repurchase on Sasol's earnings per share, headline earnings per share, net asset value per share and net tangible asset value per share will be confined to the cost of the sponsor fee, the legal fees, the taxes levied by the South African Revenue Services and the JSE documentation fee which are considered negligible. The Specific Repurchase will be funded out of Sasol's existing reserves resulting in a reduction of contributed tax capital.\nJohannesburg\nSponsor: Deutsche Securities (SA) Proprietary Limited\nDisclaimer - Forward-looking statements: Sasol may, in this document, make certain statements that are not historical facts and relate to analyses and other information which are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.
