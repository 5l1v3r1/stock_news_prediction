The company, which writes policies for heavy-duty assets such as oil rigs, ships and aircraft, reported a pretax loss of $72.9 million for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2017. It had reported a pretax profit of $150.4 million a year ago. The insurer’s gross written premiums fell about 6.7 percent to $591.6 million in the period, and its combined ratio deteriorated to 124.9 percent from 76.5 percent last year. “I expect 2018 to be another challenging year for our industry, but I am confident... that the Lancashire Group has the appropriate business model, talent and access to capital to maximise underwriting opportunities to benefit our shareholders,” CEO Alex Maloney said.
