Rather than seriously considering several exceptionally qualified directors – with relevant public market and REIT experience – that Land & Buildings recommended for appointment to the Board, they chose the former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Marriott International, Robert McCarthy.\nWhile we agree that the RLJ management team, CEO Ross Bierkan and CFO/COO Leslie Hale, are in desperate need of both capital allocation and operating experience – given the horrible performance of RLJ shares following numerous capital allocation missteps – the most glaring need in the boardroom is relevant capital markets and REIT experience. Specifically, the rejection of an all cash offer from Blackstone for well north of $24 per share over the Summer of 2017, issuing equity at a substantial discount to net asset value to help the FelCor acquisition, delays in selling assets to reduce high debt levels, and the lack of transparency on synergies related to the merger with FelCor, all highlight the desperate need for additional oversight at the Company and in particular, directors with relevant capital markets and REIT experience.\nThe interests of Executive Chairman Robert Johnson, CEO Ross Bierkan and CFO/COO Leslie Hale are clearly misaligned with the interests of RLJ shareholders given the outsized compensation they earned in 2016 of $3.6 million, $4.4 million and $4 million, respectively.\nIt continues to be our strong desire to work collaboratively with the Board to bring the necessary experience and skill sets that are currently lacking in the boardroom in order to right the ship and maximize value for all shareholders. Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly evident what game the Board is playing: namely, disenfranchising shareholders and working to preserve the troubling status quo. As such, Land & Buildings has preserved its rights to seek the election of director candidates at the upcoming 2018 Annual Meeting through its prior submission of a nomination of a slate of director candidates to the Company.\nSincerely,\nJonathan Litt\nFounder & Chief Investment Officer\nLand & Buildings\nAbout Land and Buildings:\nLand & Buildings is a registered investment manager specializing in publicly traded real estate and real estate related securities.
