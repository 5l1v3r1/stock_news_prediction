The company had been keen to reach a deal before it reports earnings on Feb. 15.\nThe company said the buyers had agreed on Wednesday ”to work\non a number of contractual elements including a revamped delivery plan as well as a roadmap for the development and completion of military capabilities for the A400M.”\nAirbus last year cited “huge losses” on the project and warned of “significant risks” ahead. The program was initially valued at 20 billion euros but its cost has ballooned to well over 30 billion, sources told Reuters last year.\n“Since its inception in 2003, this program has suffered not only from a number of operational issues but, more importantly, under a flawed contractual set-up and insufficient budget which resulted in significant losses for Airbus,” Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in the statement.\n“We have a good chance to stop or at least reduce the bleeding now and deliver the capabilities our customers need,” he added.\nReporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T20:24:45.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
