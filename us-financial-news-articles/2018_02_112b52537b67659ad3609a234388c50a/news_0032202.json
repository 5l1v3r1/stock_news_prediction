The parcel was found to contain a smooth-bore rifle.\nOfficers decided to search the manâ€™s vehicle and discovered a pistol and bullets. They went to his home, where they found rooms packed with loaded shotguns, more ammunition and arms parts, none of which he was licensed to keep.\nGrowing more suspicious, they searched another vehicle where they found ammunition, grenades, a hunting rifle and more parts. Finally, they went to a warehouse rented by the same man, where they discovered racks of assault rifles, machine guns, automatic pistols, cartridges and a workshop for retooling weaponry.\nThe customs department said in a statement the judicial authorities were now pursuing the matter with the man and that no terrorist activity was suspected at this stage.\nWriting by Luke Baker, reporting by Simon Carraud, editing by Brian Love, Larry Kihng\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:52:40.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
