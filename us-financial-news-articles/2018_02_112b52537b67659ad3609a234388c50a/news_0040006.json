The common currency surged to a three-year high of $1.2556 on Friday before slipping and posting a loss of 0.7 percent.\nThe euro’s strength has played a large role in weakening the dollar this year. Focus was on economic indicators due this week, such as Wednesday’s euro zone purchasing managers’ index and Friday’s German gross domestic product numbers, and whether they could propel the euro higher again.\nThe pound was steady at $1.4035 after shedding 0.5 percent on Friday.\nThe Australian dollar was a shade firmer at $0.7914 after losing 0.5 percent the previous day.
