The French company said discussions about opening up the capital of its property unit AccorInvest to a group of French and international investors were in their final stages. AccorHotels, which runs high-end chains such as Raffles and Sofitel as well as budget brands such as Ibis, said earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) reached 492 million euros ($606 million) in 2017. This was above a revised company’s guidance for a 2017 EBIT at the upper end of a 460-480 million euros range, while analysts polled by Inquiry Financial for Reuters had forecast 481 million euros. $1 = 0.8118 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T08:32:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
