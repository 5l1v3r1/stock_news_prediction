Updated 32 Mins Ago CNBC.com \nOne of Citadel's top equity investors was let go from the firm, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. \nRichard Schimel, who had headed the Aptigon Capital unit, left this week after a year and a half at the hedge fund, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing personnel moves. The reason was due to performance, one of the people said. There was also a difference of opinion on the future of the unit, another person said. \nCitadel confirmed that Schimel had departed the firm as did the chief operating officer of the group, David Bonfili, and a \"number of investment professionals.\" \n\"We are committed to the success of Aptigon Capital, and we will continue to recruit leading talent to the team,\" a spokesman at Citadel said. \nEric Felder has been named the head of Aptigon Capital and Reza Shahi will become the COO. Felder joined the firm last May to launch Fundamental Strategies and later assumed responsibility for Citadel's Global Credit business, Citadel said. He will continue to lead those businesses in conjunction with Aptigon. Lucy Nicholson | Reuters Richard Schimel, Head of Aptigon Capital, a Citadel Company, speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, May 3, 2017. \nSchimel had joined with much fanfare in July 2016 to start Citadel's fourth equity trading unit, based in Greenwich, Conn. Prior to Citadel, Schimel had co-founded Diamondback Capital in 2005 and grew it to a $6 billion firm at its peak. The firm shut down in 2012 after an insider-trading raid that caused investors to be nervous. \nSchimel and Bonfili did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.
