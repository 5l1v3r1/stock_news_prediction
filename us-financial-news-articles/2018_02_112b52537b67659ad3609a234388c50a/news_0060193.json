In a statement, it said it was suspending or curtailing several Treasury, USAID and American military assistance programs that support Cambodia’s military, taxation department or local authorities - all of which the White House said shared blame for recent instability. Washington has spent more than $1 billion to support Cambodia but the recent “setbacks compelled the United States to review its assistance to Cambodia to ensure that American taxpayer funds are not being used to support anti-democratic behavior,” the White House said. U.S. assistance directed at Cambodians that address health, agriculture and mine clearing would continue, it added. The move comes as other Western nations and rights groups have decried a crackdown against the political opposition and independent media ahead of Cambodia’s July 29 general election.
