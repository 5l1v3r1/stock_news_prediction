The appointment comes in response to the increased demand for Emotive Brand's strategic offerings and year-on-year growth over its nine years of business.\nNew Creative Director, Jane Brown, joins Emotive Brand with over 20 years of experience developing corporate and brand identity programs for a broad range of clients, from global corporations to startups. Working for noted firms such as Landor, Luxon Carra, and MetaDesign, she has reimagined and reenergized brand development for airline, finance, publishing, technology, and biotech clients.\n\"Jane is a true master of her craft,\" said Bella Banbury, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Emotive Brand. \"One of those designers who consistently breaks boundaries, finds fresh and unique ways to express ideas that others will follow. Jane's ability to bridge creative and strategy with ground breaking work is what attracted us to each other.\"\n\"We've known and admired Jane for 20 years, and knew it was the right time to bring her on,\" said Tracy Lloyd, Emotive Brand Co-Founder. \"Jane is coming because she believes in the power of Emotive Branding and we can't wait to see the impact of her work on our clients' business and brands.\"\nJane Brown's internal roles have included Design Director at Gensler and Creative Director of Brand at the University of Phoenix, where she led the team to complete an award-winning brand identity system.

Some of her clients over the years include Adobe, McAfee, Oxford University, Johnson & Johnson, San Francisco International Airport, and Wells Fargo.\n\"As a Creative Director, I am enamored with the entire process of design,\" said Jane Brown. \"Admittedly, my favorite step in the process lies between the strategic framework and brand expression. When teams pivot from logic to feeling, and begin to reimagine and visualize what is possible â€” that's when the magic happens.\"\nAbout Emotive Brand\nEmotive Brand is a brand strategy and design firm that transforms businesses by transforming brands.
