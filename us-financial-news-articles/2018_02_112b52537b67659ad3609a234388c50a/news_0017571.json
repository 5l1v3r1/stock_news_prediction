The index logged its biggest one-day percentage gain since Jan. 24. \n* The capesize index gained 128 points, or 7.7 percent, to 1,790 points. With a 22 percent jump, the index saw its best week since the week of Sept. 8. \n* Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as iron ore and coal, rose $928 to $14,136. \n* “Demand for major bulks into the Far East has continued to drive firmer sentiment and as such rates higher for capesize vessels,” said analysts at shipbroker Clarksons Platou Securities. \n* “After some fresh activity out of South America, capesize rates are closing the week on a stronger note.” \n* The panamax index was down 13 points, or 1.03 percent, at 1,250 points, the lowest since early October. \n* Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which usually carry coal or grain cargoes of about 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes, fell $104 to $10,030. \n* Among smaller vessels, the supramax index fell eight points to 825 points, while the handysize index fell three points to 526 points.
