That was modestly higher than the initially reported increase of 422,500 jobs.\nThe 2.3 percent gain over the course of last year was the fastest job growth since 2002, the agency said.\nThe acceleration in employment, as well as unexpectedly strong economic growth in the first half of 2017, has prompted the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates three times since last July, and many economists expect two more hikes this year.\nDecember’s unemployment rate was revised slightly higher to 5.8 percent from 5.7 percent, while December’s monthly employment change was downwardly revised to 64,800 from 78,600.\nNonetheless, the revisions still indicate a very strong labor market that continued to improve in the second half of last year despite slower economic growth, said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.\nWhile Ferley expects job growth to start to cool with the January report released next Friday, he said the low unemployment rate should still be enough to keep the Bank of Canada on a tightening path, even with the ongoing uncertainty over the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n“With the kind of momentum that we’re seeing, you become more confident that the economy might be able withstand some negative hits and, as a result, you really don’t need rates as accommodative as they are right now,” Ferley said.
