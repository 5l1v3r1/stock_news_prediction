Hilco Redevelopment Partners, based in suburban Northbrook, will undertake comprehensive remediation of the industrial site before proceeding with redevelopment. NRG Energy selected Hilco after an extensive process to sell the property.\n\"When we closed down Chicago's last two coal plants, we committed to creating a cleaner, brighter and more sustainable future for Chicago's neighborhoods,\" Mayor Emanuel said. \"I look forward to working with Hilco Redevelopment Partners to turn this site from a vestige of Chicago's past to a vibrant part of our shared future.\"\nRemediation work will begin soon at the Crawford site, may take anywhere from 14-24 months depending on site conditions, and will be completed in accordance with the highest safety and comprehensive industrial regulatory standards. The plan is to begin demolition after the site has been safely abated of any potentially hazardous materials that may present environmental concerns to the community, city or regulators. During this time, Hilco Redevelopment Partners will be in regular communication with community leaders and residents on the project's progress while also creating a redevelopment plan for the highest and best use of the property. The company has launched a website to share updates and information at www.crawfordstation.com .\n\"A true hallmark of Hilco's mission is to return economic opportunity to industrial sites that have run their useful life,\" said Roberto Perez, Managing Partner, President, Hilco Redevelopment Partners. \"We see the Crawford site as a transformational opportunity to take 70-acres of urban infill industrial land from an obsolete facility and eyesore to a modern and robust economic engine in the neighborhood. This location and current zoning classification offers great potential to serve as a last-mile distribution and logistics facility given its proximity to such a significant population center.\"\nAdded Alderman Ricardo Munoz, 22 nd Ward: \"This is an exciting development for the Little Village community. The Hilco Redevelopment team understands that we have a terrific labor pool that can support the type of 'new economy' businesses that they expect to attract to the site. This will be a terrific boost to the economy in Little Village and throughout Chicago.\"\nHilco Redevelopment Partners is a unit of holding company Hilco Global, with offices in Northbrook and Chicago. Hilco brings a wealth of relevant experience to the 70-acre Crawford site having managed numerous remediation, recycling and redevelopment projects with similar highly complex brownfield sites.

Beginning in 2012, Hilco Redevelopment Partners decommissioned and remediated the site before redeveloping it into the largest tri-modal logistics hub on the eastern seaboard of the USA. Following the remediation and demolition, Hilco Redevelopment Partners has signed long-term leases and has built or will be building logistics facilities for FedEx Ground, Amazon and Under Armour, with more to be announced this year. Summer Street, Boston, MA – Hilco purchased the former Boston Power Generating Station owned by Exelon Corporation.
