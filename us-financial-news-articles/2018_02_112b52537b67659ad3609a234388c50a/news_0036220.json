It’s keeping us humble and happy.”\nThe two helped the U.S. figure skating team win bronze in the team competition earlier this week but struggled on Wednesday after she touched the ice with her hand in a throw triple flip.\nAsked how they planned to celebrate making it into the top-16 pairs advancing to Thursday’s free skate, they both said they would rest.\n“We have another program tomorrow and that will be the last of our Olympic journey,” Chris said. “So we’re just going to rest, recover and get ready for tomorrow morning.”\nReporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:26:59.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
