But it remained just above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.\nThat would mark the 19th straight month of expansion for China’s manufacturers, but the drop may raise some concerns for the country’s leaders as they prepare for the start of the National People’s Congress next week where Beijing will unveil its economic targets for this year.\nAnalysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would ease marginally to 51.2.\nBoosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient property market and unexpected strength in exports, China’s manufacturing and industrial firms helped the economy produce better-than-expected growth of 6.9 percent in 2017, its first annual acceleration in seven years.
