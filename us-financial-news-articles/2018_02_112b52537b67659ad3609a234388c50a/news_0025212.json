Buildings in Beijing shook very slightly.\nChina is frequently hit by earthquakes, many centered in the southwest of the country.\nNorthern China is much more rarely affected although in 1976, the Tangshan earthquake, just to the east of Beijing, killed up to 300,000 people.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T12:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T13:10:42.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
