Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that a Canadian parliamentarian on the trip had taken responsibility for the mistake.\nA largely unrecognized figure in India, Atwal was a trending topic on Twitter across the subcontinent on Thursday after images of him in the company of Trudeau’s wife and other Canadian ministers surfaced online.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during women business leaders' roundtable in Mumbai, India February 20, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui The trip, partly aimed at shoring up support for Trudeau’s Liberals among the politically important ethnic vote in key regions, has also been criticized for being light on official government business.\nSupport from Canada’s large and concentrated South Asian community helped Trudeau’s Liberals gain power in 2015, and all three of Canada’s main parties -- including the New Democratic Party, lead by Jagmeet Singh -- are courting the Indo-Canadian vote ahead of the 2019 election.\nSlideshow (5 Images) “I don’t know if Justin Trudeau thinks that international trade missions are reality TV shows, but they are not,” Conservative party leader Andrew Scheer, Trudeau’s main opponent, told Reuters.\nTrudeau on Tuesday cited C$1 billion in deals between Canadian and Indian companies announced in Mumbai, and said the trip was “not just about political ties” but improving business and cultural ties.\nThe Atwal controversy came as the Trudeau family’s ornate traditional Indian attire raised eyebrows, with the prime minister at one point donning formal wear typically worn by bridegrooms.\n“FYI we Indians don’t dress like this every day sir, not even in Bollywood,” tweeted Indian politician Omar Abdullah.\nEarlier this week, Trudeau rejected suggestions that he had been snubbed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nModi tweeted a welcome to Trudeau late on Thursday, on the eve of a bilateral meeting between the two, six days after the Canadian leader arrived in the country, adding: “I hope PM @JustinTrudeau and his family had a very enjoyable stay so far.”\nAdditional reporting by Euan Rocha in Mumbai and David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T23:29:41.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
