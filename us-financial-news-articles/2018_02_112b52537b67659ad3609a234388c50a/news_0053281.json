Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Cash Offer Documents, Cash Offer Eligible Holders (as defined below) who (i) validly tendered and who did not validly withdraw Old Notes at or prior to the Cash Offer Expiration Date or (ii) delivered a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery and all other required documents at or prior to the Cash Offer Expiration Date and who tender their Old Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 26, 2018 pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures, and whose Old Notes are accepted for purchase by AT&T, will receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined in the Offer to Purchase). Cash Offer Eligible Holders are required to electronically transmit the certification of eligibility to participate in the Cash Offers and are required to tender in the applicable minimum denominations in order to receive the applicable Total Consideration.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, on the Cash Offer Settlement Date, AT&T expects to pay an aggregate total consideration of (i) €11,766,500 for the Floating Rate Global Notes due 2023, plus accrued and unpaid interest of €14,331.11; (ii) €5,252,000 for the 1.050% Global Notes due 2023, plus accrued and unpaid interest of €26,327.66; (iii) €505,000 for the 1.800% Global Notes due 2026, plus accrued and unpaid interest of €4,339.73 and (iv) €404,000 for the 2.350% Global Notes due 2029, plus accrued and unpaid interest of €4,532.60, in each case for the respective series of Old Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Cash Offers.
