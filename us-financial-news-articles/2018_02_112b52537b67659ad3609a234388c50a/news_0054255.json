With this appointment, Acuña will serve as Sizmek’s lead evangelist, educating the market on emerging trends at the intersection of data, technology and customer experiences, while helping agencies and their clients develop innovative strategies to impact their business.\n“Nikos is one of the digital industry’s most provocative luminaries informing the future of marketing. He possesses keen foresight into how technology can empower agencies and brands through creative augmentation as opposed to automation alone,” said Mark Grether, CEO of Sizmek. “Nikos will be a key resource in guiding clients through an era of accelerating change and opportunity. He will not only help crystallize Sizmek’s vision, but I am confident that he will also help shape the story of our industry.”\nAcuña brings over 20 years of experience in marketing technology and media. He is the author of The Predictive Business and Mindshare (Motion Publishing, 2012), which received Foreword Magazine’s Book of the Year Award, the USA Best Book Award in 2012, and a Publisher recommendation for the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award. He published over a dozen foundational research studies on AI and cross-industry digital transformation over the past two years, and speaks frequently at conferences around the world about creativity and innovation, AI’s implications in a connected future, and how to deepen engagement by tapping into intrinsic human desires.\n“Sizmek is dedicated to redefining the way brands connect with audiences. It's more evident than ever by the way they bring data, creative, and media together for optimal campaign performance across the entire customer journey,” said Nikos Acuña, Chief Visionary at Sizmek. “I look forward to supporting Sizmek’s tradition of innovation, by identifying the forces that propel our industry forward. My focus will be on catalyzing growth and inspiring the next generation of industry leaders.”\nAmong his upcoming speaking engagements, Acuña is slated to speak at SXSW, leading the “What AI Reveals about Our Place in the Universe” panel with world-renowned scientists and AI practitioners. The discussion will explore how artificial intelligence reveals patterns in our brains, bodies, cities, advertising ecosystems, and the universe at large. The panel takes place at Fairmont Hotel on March 9, from 11:00 am – 12:00 pm CT.\nAdditionally, Acuña is launching a bi-weekly video series called Symbiosis. In the spirit of Jason Silva’s Shots of Awe, Symbiosis explores innovation at the intersection of data, technology, and experiences through a portrait of a postmodern futurist. The first episode launched today and can be found on YouTube, Facebook, and nikosacuna.com .\nAbout Sizmek\nSizmek is the world’s largest independent buy-side advertising platform that creates impressions that inspire.
