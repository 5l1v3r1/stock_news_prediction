Casino, whose credit rating was cut to junk by Standard & Poor’s in March 2016, is under pressure to revive profits in France, its biggest market, where it now makes more than 50 percent of its sales, at a time of slower growth in Brazil. The planned takeover of Sarenza, which had sales of more than 250 million euros ($310 million) in its last fiscal year, follows an e-commerce deal between Casino and Ocado. Shares in Casino rose 1.3 percent, outperforming a weaker overall Paris market on Monday as investors welcomed the news of the planned Sarenza deal, although the stock remains down by around 9 percent since the start of 2018. The company’s shares had fallen sharply in January after it reported weak fourth-quarter sales. “Casino’s plans to strengthen its digital presence are a sound strategy, although we will have to see how the company integrates it all,” said Meriem Mokdad, fund manager at Paris-based Roche Brune Asset Management. Mokdad said her firm did not own Casino shares as it wants more evidence of a turnaround at Casino before investing. Earlier this month, Amazon announced plans to create 2,000 new jobs in France, a further sign of the U.S. online giant’s ambitions to grow there. France’s traditional supermarket operators such as Casino, sector leader Carrefour and privately-held firm Leclerc have all taken steps to respond to the Amazon threat. Leclerc announced the launch of a food delivery service in Paris last month, while Carrefour struck a partnership in China with Tencent and said it would boost its investments in the sector.
