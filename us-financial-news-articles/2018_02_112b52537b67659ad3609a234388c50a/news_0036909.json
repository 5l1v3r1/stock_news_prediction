( on.wsj.com/2Ch5Gg9 )\nAmerisourceBergen said it did not discuss potential mergers or acquisitions. Walgreens was not available for comment.\nThe two companies are already closely allied, having struck a 10-year deal in 2013 for AmerisourceBergen to buy drugs for Walgreens, which subsequently acquired 26 percent of the distributor.\nWalgreens would buy the remaining shares under the deal being considered, the Journal reported. An offer has not been made, and there may be no deal, it added.\nThe drugstore operator last year represented 30 percent of AmerisourceBergen’s revenue and is its largest customer.\nWalgreens reported in January its sixth straight quarterly fall in retail same-store sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 along with a drop in gross margins in its U.S. business.\nAmerisourceBergen reported last week a threefold jump in quarterly profit to $861.9 million, helped by a $587.6 million tax benefit.\nLeerink analyst Ana Gupte said the Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen deal would be “poised to improve the profitability of the drug store giant through purchasing power with generics and branded drug manufacturers.”\nThe CVS-Aetna deal was seen pressuring rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers and retail pharmacies to consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.\nEvercore analysts said Walgreens could fund all or a majority of the transaction via debt, likely making the financial returns notably attractive.\nWalgreens shares have fallen 17.8 percent in the past 12 months, while AmerisourceBergen shares are down 1.9 percent in the same period.\nCEO Pessina drove the Walgreens-Boots Alliance deal and more recently agreed to acquire 1,932 stores from smaller U.S. rival Rite Aid, partly in a bid to improve its ability to negotiate for lower drug costs.\nReporting by Ismail Shakil and Rishika Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Peter Henderson in San Franciso, Caroline Humer in New York and Bhanu Pratap in Bangalore; Editing by Peter Cooney and Lisa Shumaker and Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T03:59:31.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
