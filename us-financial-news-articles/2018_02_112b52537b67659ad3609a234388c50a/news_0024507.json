Conde has declined to comment on his intentions. \nThe electoral commission has yet to announce the results of the election for mayors and neighbourhood chiefs held on Feb. 4. \nTensions remain high, and a Reuters witness saw clashes on Monday in the Ratoma neighbourhood of the capital Conakry. \n“We are going to create a commission to identify anyone inciting ethnic hatred and violence,” the Minister of National Unity and Citizenship told Reuters on Monday. \nSince his election in 2010, Conde has struggled to fulfil his promise of reducing tensions between the two largest ethnic groups, the Malinke and Peul. \nConde’s ruling party is largely backed by Malinke, who account for 35 percent of the population. Opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo is mainly supported by Peul herders, who make up 40 percent of the population. \nYoung people took to the streets in various cities after Diallo denounced “massive fraud” in the vote. Conde’s party has denied the accusations of fraud. \nOver 70 arrests had been made across the country, a police source said on Monday. \n“The ethnic character behind some of these clashes is forcing us to call for calm and restraint,” government spokesman Damantang Albert Camara said. \nThe unrest coincides with other long-running disputes. Many Guineans are frustrated that the country’s rich bauxite reserves have not trickled down to address constant power cuts, unemployment and low public sector salaries. \nFrustrations led to riots near some of the country’s largest bauxite mines last year, interrupting production and resulting in several deaths.
