The policy (statement) seems to have assuaged some of these concerns which has led to short covering,” he said adding that traders might turn cautious on bond supply concerns.\nThe 10-year benchmark bond yield fell as much as 11 basis points at one point to 7.49 percent, the biggest intraday fall since Jan. 17.\nIt was trading at 7.51 percent at 1049 GMT, after ending at 7.57 percent on Tuesday.\nThe rupee also rose briefly but trimmed gains on weak foreign inflows.\nIt traded at 64.24 rupees to the dollar from 64.13 before the policy announcement. It had ended at 64.25 on Tuesday.\nThe broader NSE stock index was down 0.21 percent.\nThe RBI kept the repo rate steady at 6.00 percent, as widely expected, but maintained a careful balancing act in its comments.\nThe central bank highlighted higher oil prices and fiscal deficit slippages as potential risks to inflation on one hand, but also echoed concerns of government and businesses over weak economic growth.
