France does not accept that the convention prohibiting chemical weapons be challenged,” von der Muhll told reporters in a daily online briefing. \nPresident Bashar al-Assad’s government denies using chemical weapons, which it agreed to destroy in 2013 under an agreement brokered by Russia and the United States. \n“We are actively working with our partners on this issue and on all reports of new chemical attacks in Syria,” von der Muhll said. \nA deadly sarin attack on a rebel-held area in April 2017 prompted Trump to order a missile strike on the Shayrat air base, from which the Syrian operation is said to have been launched. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said that Paris could launch unilateral air strikes against targets in Syria if a new chemical attack took place, although he has since said he would coordinate any action with Trump. \nReporting by John Irish; Editing by Leigh Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T18:08:25.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
