We need The Wall!”\nMore than 800 Central American migrants have been found in truck trailers or safe houses in Mexico so far this year, according to a government document seen by Reuters.\nIn July, 10 people died after a truck stuffed with more than 100 Guatemalan and Mexican migrants was abandoned in a Texas parking lot.\nReporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Writing by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T23:36:45.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
