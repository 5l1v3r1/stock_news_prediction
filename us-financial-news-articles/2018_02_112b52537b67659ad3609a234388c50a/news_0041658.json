Its pullback from last week’s sell-off has been accompanied by low volatility, encouraging economic data and corporate reports.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is set for its best week since November 2016, with a 4.2 percent gains, while the Nasdaq Composite’s 5.6 percent gain since Monday has set it on course for its strongest week since December 2011.\n“A long-term uptrend in the market is viable given how strong economic fundamentals and earnings are. What’s a caused a rebound from the correction is just that we’re simply back on that trend,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\nShares of Coca-Cola rose 2.3 percent in premarket trading after the soda maker’s cost-saving initiatives helped its beat fourth-quarter profit estimates.\nDeere & Co rose 0.94 percent after the tractor maker reported a 23 percent jump in quarterly revenue as its key markets improved.\nEconomic data also painted a healthy picture. Homebuilding increased to more than a one-year high in January, boosted by a rebound in the construction of single-family housing units.\nHousing starts jumped 9.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.326 million units, the highest level since October 2016, the Commerce Department said.\nBeside strong quarterly earnings, investor sentiment has also got a boost from expectations that more growth is still to come due to newly-implemented corporate tax cuts and plans to increase infrastructure spending.\nNearly 77 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter results so far have topped earnings estimate, above the 72 percent average beat-rate of the past four quarters.\nMany companies have boosted their forecasts and analysts now expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share in 2018 by 18.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAfter falling by more than 10 percent from their record highs on Jan. 26 on concerns about rising borrowing costs due to a pick up in inflation, the S&P has gained 5.8 percent since last Friday.\nSome traders have said the market was also reassured by a decline in the CBOE Volatility index - a measure of implied near-term volatility on the S&P 500, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”.\nOn Thursday, the VIX dropped below 20 points for the first time since hitting a two-and-a-half-year high of 50.3 last week, while yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds hit a more than four-year high of 2.9440 percent.\nBut, the rising yields this week has not pressured stocks like they did last week. The 10-year yields slipped to 2.8822 percent on Friday.
