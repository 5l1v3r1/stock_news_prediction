That bid had been opposed by the tenants and a group of media companies.\n\"Under common law, there is a presumption that the public has access to all judicial records,\" wrote federal Judge James Bredar.\nBredar in his opinion noted: \"The Defendants believe that because the Kushners, including the President of the United States' son-in-law Jared Kushner, are members of Defendant LLCs, 'the media has taken an unprecedented interest in this case' and made 'outrageous allegations, and assign[ed] guilt.' Publicly releasing the citizenship of Defendant LLCs will, so the Defendants claim, only add fuel to this fire.\"\nOn Friday, two new lawyers for Kushner's company notified Bredar that they are now representing the firm.\nAnd the new lawyers said in court filings that they now want the case sent back to Baltimore Circuit Court, where it was first filed.\nOne of those lawyers, Michael Blumenfeld, declined to comment when contacted by CNBC.\nChris Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Kushner Cos., said only, \"Our counsel on this matter has determined that the case should be remanded to state court.\"\nCNBC has asked the White House for comment on the case.\nIf the case had gone to trial in federal court, Kushner's company might have had a better chance at winning.\nThe jury pool for Maryland federal court has proportionately fewer tenants — as opposed to homeowners — than does the pool that provides jurors for cases tried in Baltimore Circuit Court.\nThere are \"more tenants in a Baltimore City jury,\" noted Freeman, the plaintiffs' lawyer.\nIn his own filing Friday, Freeman wrote, \"After expending over three months – and requiring substantial time and resources from both Plaintiffs' counsel and the Court – Defendants have now belatedly agreed that they should never have attempted to remove this case to federal court. Plaintiffs do not oppose Defendants'notice of withdrawal.\"\nFreeman indicated in the filing that he wants to seek attorneys' fees that occurred because of the delay from Kushner's firm.\nWATCH: Kushner warned about ties to Wendi Deng Murdoch show chapters Jared Kushner reportedly was warned about his ties to Wendi Deng Murdoch, ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch      2:29 PM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 | 01:00", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T00:38:40.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
