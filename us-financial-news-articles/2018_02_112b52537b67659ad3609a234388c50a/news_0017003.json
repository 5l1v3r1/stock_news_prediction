So it will take three to four years,” he said.\nAdani’s plans are in line with a broad push in India to more than double the share natural gas has in the country’s energy mix to 15 percent by 2022.\nIndia has four LNG terminals now and imports around 20 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel a year, but the government plans to build another 11 terminals over the next seven years.
