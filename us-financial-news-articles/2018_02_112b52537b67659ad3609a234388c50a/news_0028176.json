About a third of upper-school students are enrolled in such programs in Germany compared to only 5 percent in France, according to OECD data.\nThe head of the Medef employers’ union, Pierre Gattaz, said the government’s plan “corresponds to the changes that we want”.\nReporting by Caroline Paillez; writing by Leigh Thomas; editing by Michel Rose and Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:12:23.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
