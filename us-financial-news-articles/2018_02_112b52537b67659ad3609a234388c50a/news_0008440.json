This represents an increase of 5.4 percent from the prior-year period, or 3.7 percent on a currency-neutral basis, and includes an estimated 110 basis point adverse impact from the previously disclosed change in the U.S. dispensing business model.\n\"We are proud of our performance in our final stand-alone quarter, as we continued to deliver solid, consistent results,\" said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chairman and CEO. \"We look forward to the future with confidence as we welcome C.R. Bard to BD. Together, through our combined capabilities and the impact we can have on our customers and their patients, we have a tremendous opportunity to advance the world of health.\"\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Operating Results\nAs reported, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $(0.76), compared with $2.58 in the prior-year period. This represents a decrease of 129.5 percent and is primarily due to restructuring, transaction and financing costs associated with acquisitions and additional tax expense relating to new U.S. tax legislation, as well as a litigation reserve reversal in the prior-year period following a favorable appellate antitrust ruling. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.48, compared with $2.33 in the prior-year period. This represents an increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 6.4 percent, or 3.9 percent on a currency-neutral basis.\nSegment Results\nIn the BD Medical segment, as reported, worldwide revenues for the quarter of $2.035 billion increased 3.6 percent from the prior-year period, or 1.9 percent on a currency-neutral basis, which includes an estimated 170 basis point impact from the change in the U.S. dispensing business model. The segment's results reflect strong performance in the Medication and Procedural Solutions unit and solid results in the Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems units. Performance in the Medication Management Solutions unit reflects the adverse impact of the change in the U.S. dispensing business model as well as a tough comparison due to the timing of capital placements in the prior-year period.\nIn the BD Life Sciences segment, as reported, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.045 billion, an increase of 9.1 percent over the prior-year period, or 7.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Revenue growth reflects strong performance across the segment. BD Life Sciences' growth was aided by flu-related revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit as a result of an earlier start to the flu season in comparison to the prior year.\nGeographic Results\nAs reported, first quarter revenues in the U.S. of $1.657 billion increased 1.6 percent from the prior-year period, which includes an estimated 200 basis point adverse impact from the change in the U.S. dispensing business model. Within the BD Medical segment in the U.S., growth in the Medication and Procedural Solutions and Diabetes Care units was offset by declines in the Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units. Performance in the Medication Management Solutions unit reflects the adverse impact of the change in the U.S. dispensing business model as well as the aforementioned tough comparison to the prior-year period. U.S. revenues in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit declined due to the geography of customer ordering patterns. BD Life Sciences segment results in the U.S. reflect strength in the Diagnostic Systems and Preanalytical Systems units. BD Life Sciences' growth in the U.S. was aided by the aforementioned flu-related revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit as a result of an earlier start to the flu season in comparison to the prior year.\nAs reported, revenues outside of the U.S. of $1.423 billion increased 10.1 percent from the prior-year period, or 6.3 percent on a currency-neutral basis. International revenue growth reflects solid growth in the BD Medical segment and strong performance in the BD Life Sciences segment. Within the BD Medical segment, growth was driven by strength in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit, which was aided by the geography of customer ordering patterns, and solid results in the Medication and Procedural Solutions and Diabetes Care units. Growth in the BD Life Sciences segment reflects strength in the Diagnostic Systems and Biosciences units.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook for Full Year\nRevenues for the full fiscal year 2018, including the accretion from the acquisition of C.R. Bard, are expected to increase approximately 30.0 to 31.0 percent on a reported basis. On a comparable, currency-neutral basis that includes the revenues of C.R. Bard in the current and prior year, revenues are expected to grow 4.5 to 5.5 percent. This includes an estimated 50 basis point adverse impact from the change in the U.S. dispensing business model and the estimated sales impact from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico on Bard's business during BD's first fiscal quarter.\nThe Company expects full fiscal year 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share, including the accretion from the C.R. Bard acquisition, to be between $10.85 and $11.00, which represents growth of approximately 15.0 to 16.0 percent, or approximately 12.0 percent on a currency-neutral basis.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call regarding BD's first quarter results will be broadcast live on BD's website, www.bd.com/investors , along with related slides, at 8:00 a.m. (ET) Tuesday, February 6, 2018 . The conference call will be available for replay on BD's website, www.bd.com/investors , or at 1-800-585-8367 (domestic) and 1-404-537-3406 (international) through the close of business on Tuesday, February 13, 2018, confirmation number 4282726.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures/Financial Tables\nThis news release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these and other non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial tables. Estimated adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 excludes potential charges or gains that may be recorded during the fiscal year, such as, among other things, the non-cash amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related charges, and certain tax and litigation matters. BD does not attempt to provide reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP earnings guidance to the comparable GAAP measure because the impact and timing of these potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts. In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of BD's financial performance. Within the attached financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts.\nAll \"comparable\" basis revenue growth rates relating to fiscal year 2018 presented in this release are adjusted for certain items as detailed in the attached tables. Current and prior-year adjusted diluted earnings per share results exclude, among other things, the impact of purchase accounting adjustments (including the non-cash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets); integration, restructuring and transaction costs; the reversal of a litigation reserve; and the loss on debt extinguishment. We also provide these measures on a currency-neutral basis after eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation, where applicable. Reconciliations of these amounts to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the tables at the end of this release. As previously announced, comparable historical revenue schedules inclusive of C. R. Bard are available on the Investor page of BD's website, www.bd.com/investors , for BD's 2016 and 2017 fiscal years. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of BD's fiscal year 2018.\nAbout BD\nBD is one of the largest global medical technology companies in the world and is advancing the world of health by improving medical discovery, diagnostics and the delivery of care.
