So any time we see another African country we embrace them.” - Nigerian bobsledder Akuoma Omeoga on the other African nations competing at the Winter Games\n“Maybe if I got a nice tailwind in the second run and the other guys got a nice headwind, and something funky happens, maybe I have a hope and a prayer.” - U.S. skier Ted Ligety on whether he could challenge for a medal after a disappointing first run in the giant slalom\n“For me it’s tough to grab when I have poles, so I never have them. I am not scared at all. I fly higher without them.” - Japan’s Taisei Yamamoto on being one of the few competitors to ski without poles\n“Whenever I get more than one interview, that means I must have done pretty good. We know whenever we play Canada a win is a bonus. It’s going to be a joker in the pack that maybe the other teams don’t have.” - Swiss curler Peter de Cruz after the team’s round-robin win against Canada\n”I‘m obviously pretty disappointed, but at the end of the day skiing put on the most amazing show today. I think we really showed how cool we all are and that’s the main thing... I can’t keep my eyes off the screen. It’s incredible. - British skier James Woods after finishing fourth in the slopestyle final\n“Maybe I will fall, maybe I will land it. Right now my mindset is, ‘I am going to nail it’. I believe in myself and continue to visualize that jump. People would have probably told me, ‘You cannot do a triple axel, you are too old’ but here I am doing it.” - American figure skater Mirai Nagasu on doing the triple axel jump more often\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T14:50:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
