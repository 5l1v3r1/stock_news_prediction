But we do not comment on our future financing plans.”\nMorgan Stanley declined to comment.\nAdaptive Insights was founded in 2003 by Robert Hull, previously a chief financial officer at several companies, who wanted to create better software for CFOs to use. It is one of the many enterprise software firms looking to replace spreadsheets and disrupt how corporations keep track of budgeting, forecasting reporting and analytics.\nAdaptive Insights was valued at roughly $500 million in its last fundraising round in 2015, according to incorporation documents. The company is hoping the IPO will value it at more than $600 million, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is private.\nThe company said in December it had reached $100 million in annual revenue for the trailing 12 months.\nWhile enterprise software IPOs are less flashy than Internet IPOs, the sector accounts for a big chunk of venture capital funding and of the technology IPO market.\nSalesforce.com ( CRM.N ) is an investor in the company, along with Bessemer Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners. The company also raised $75 million in 2015, putting its total fundraising amount at about $176 million.\nReporting by Liana B.
