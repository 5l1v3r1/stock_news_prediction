Weather conditions made sure every race was wide open, and wayward shooting was quickly punished.\nWorld Cup action will now resume with many familiar names at the top of the leaderboards, but some superb performances, not least by the Swedes, will give the young pretenders even more confidence as the season reaches its climax.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T12:20:43.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
