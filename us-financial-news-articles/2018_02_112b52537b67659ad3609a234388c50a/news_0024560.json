REUTERS/Jorge Silva “So that final was just for me and to show myself that I could do it and put down the best run that I could.”\nLAYING DOWN A MARKER Kim, who leads the world rankings and was the overwhelming favorite coming into the Olympics, admitted there had been pressure on her to succeed.\nSlideshow (14 Images) “There has definitely been a lot of hype around this, on just a two-hour time period (for the final). It is pretty nerve-wracking as this has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl,” she added.\n“I put a lot of pressure on myself and wanted to put down the best run I have ever done.”\nGold left it late but delivered when it mattered, saving her best for the final round, which she started with a risky 1080 at the top of the run on her way to scoring 85.75.\nRelated Coverage Snowboarding: \"Hangry\" Kim rides expectations to gold Snowboarding: Father's sacrifice pays off as Kim claims gold The 21-year-old, who suffered a separated shoulder shortly before the 2014 Sochi Olympics, said coming third was tinged with sadness as it bumped team mate Kelly Clark off the podium.\n“It was a bittersweet position to be in when it came down to Kelly and I for third position,” Gold lamented.\n“She is someone I have looked up to ever since I started snowboarding, even more so after I got to know her. All the work she does behind the scenes is something I have tried to incorporate.”\nClark, competing at her fifth Games, showed she still has plenty to teach the younger generation with a score of 83.50 on her third run. However, the day was all about Kim.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T07:27:29.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
