Telefonica posted stable revenue in Spain in the fourth quarter, with service revenue rising 0.7 percent.\nDeutsche Bank said Telefonica’s domestic result was encouraging despite a slide in core profit, and kept its “buy” rating on the stock.\n“We believe the improved revenue trend and decent KPIs (key performance indicators) are more important as an indicator that Telefonica is managing the low-end risks in the Spanish market,” wrote analyst Keval Khiroya.\nOrange on Wednesday reported a return to annual sales growth in its home country for the first time since 2009.\nOrange has been fighting a price war waged by younger rival Iliad ( ILD.PA ) in its home market, while Telefonica has contended with low-cost rivals including Mas Movil.\nIn Germany, challenger E-Plus was bought by Telefonica Deutschland ( O2Dn.DE ) in 2014, reducing the number of mobile operators to three from four and easing pressure to cut prices, although cable firms are still competitive on broadband.\nThat merger was hailed at the time as sending a signal for other European markets, but attempts at similar consolidation in France have failed, while Spain also still has four mobile carriers even after a wave of takeovers.\nFIBER DIET An ability to offer superfast fiber connections is proving key to winning and retaining customers, and will be essential to building the next generation of faster mobile services, 5G.\nHere, the carriers’ approaches diverge, with Deutsche Telekom, like BT ( BT.L ) in Britain, favoring a method called vectoring that cranks up the old copper network to higher speeds without the costly extension of fiber all the way to buildings.\nSpain and France offer far more fiber-to-the-building or home connections, with penetration of 34 and 15 percent respectively as of last September, while in Germany the figure was under 3 percent.\nFiber connections are offered by a host of smaller players as well as the incumbents.\nWith the advent of 5G, the balance of power may change again, as fiber to the building could become less important.\nCommercial 5G services are expected to start to become available around 2020.\nWriting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:02:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
