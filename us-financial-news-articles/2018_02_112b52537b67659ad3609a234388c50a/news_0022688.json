(nS8N1IX00F)\n“Any virtual currency business of credit institutions needs to be rigorously supervised to ensure that risks emerging from such activities are contained,” ECB Executive Board member Yves Mersch said at an event in London.\nMersch said that proper protocols were needed to meet anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing regulations.\n“Furthermore, given the risks posed by leverage, credit institutions should not accept virtual currencies as collateral (by banks),” he added.\nMersch is the latest of a slew of global policymakers to speak out against digital currencies after their meteoric rise last year. Bitcoin, the best-known crypto asset, rose more than 1,000 percent in 2017\nThis year, however, the threat of regulatory clampdowns and bans from credit card firms to social media sites, has already caused it to tumble about 50 percent. (nL8N1PR50V)\nIn the same vein, relevant market authorities should also monitor, analyse and regulate Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) - where companies or projects issue their own digital coins or ‘tokens’ as a way of raising real world money from the public.\nIn 2016, the total amount of funds raised through ICOs was less than 82 million euros. This number dramatically increased to over three billion euros in 2017.\nMersch added somewhat reticently that he had had “heated” discussions with his own son who was “seriously considering” an ICO for a new firm he was looking to start up.\nDespite the concerns he raised, Mersch said that the ECB was looking at its own virtual currency, although he stressed it would be more of a digital version of cash rather than a bitcoin-styled revolution.\nCentral banks already create money digitally via the reserves that banks either park or borrow, but that is not technically the same as the money that comes out of cash machines and used for everyday payments.\nAny new digital currency would be like that though. At the same time however its use would depend on its popularity.\n“One could imagine a digital representation of cash that replicates the features of cash in the reasonably distant future, if citizens demanded it.”\nMersch acknowledged that negative interest rates, like those currently at the ECB, were part of the virtual currency debate.\nEconomists argue having these currencies would allow central banks to slash rates even further as people and firms would then not be able to withdraw and stash away physical cash to avoid the hit of sub-zero rates to their savings.\nHowever “deeply negative” rates would not become a standard instrument in the central bank’s toolbox, Mersch said.\nReporting by Marc Jones, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:41:43.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
