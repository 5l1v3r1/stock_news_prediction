(“ Aurora ”) (TSX: ACB) (OTCQB: ACBFF) (Frankfurt: 21P; WKN: A1C4WM) and CanniMed Therapeutics Inc. (“ CanniMed ”) (TSX: CMED) today announced the filing of Aurora’s Notice of Variation and CanniMed’s Notice of Change to Directors’ Circular (collectively the “ Offer Documents ”) in connection with Aurora’s improved offer to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of CanniMed (“ CanniMed Shares ”) not already owned by Aurora or its affiliates, described under “Aurora’s Notice of Variation” below (the “ Improved Offer ”). As previously announced by the parties on January 24, 2018, CanniMed’s board of directors (the “ CanniMed Board ”) is unanimously recommending that CanniMed’s shareholders accept the Improved Offer.\nAurora’s Notice of Variation\nPursuant to the terms of the Notice of Variation, Aurora has increased the consideration offered per CanniMed Share, at the election of each CanniMed shareholder, to: (a) 3.40 common shares (“ Aurora Shares ”) of Aurora (the “ Share Alternative ”); (b) $43.00 in cash (subject to proration); (the “ Cash Alternative ”); or (c) any combination thereof (subject to proration of the cash portion), (the “ Share and Cash Alternative ”).\nThe maximum amount of cash available under the Improved Offer is $140 million (the “ Maximum Cash Consideration ”), and the number of Aurora Shares to be issued will be between approximately 72 million (assuming full cash elections) and 84 million (assuming full share elections and no cash elections). CanniMed Shareholders should note that any cash elected to be received is valued (for purposes of determining the number of Aurora Shares to be received in addition to such cash) based on an implied Aurora Share price of $12.65, which may be more or less than the value of the share consideration at the time that the CanniMed Shares are taken-up under the Offer. CanniMed Shareholders are advised to consider recent market price quotations for Aurora Shares and to carefully review the Offer Documents before deciding whether to tender to the Improved Offer and before making their consideration elections.\nThe cash consideration of the Cash Alternative and the Share and Cash Alternative will be prorated, to ensure that the Maximum Cash Consideration payable is not exceeded. Assuming that all CanniMed Shareholders elect the Cash Alternative, each CanniMed Shareholder would receive $5.70 in cash and 2.9493 Aurora Shares for each CanniMed Share. The full details of the proration mechanisms are provided in Aurora’s Notice of Variation.\nThe Improved Offer is open until 11:59 PM (Pacific Time) on March 9, 2018, subject to acceleration, extension or withdrawal by Aurora.\nCanniMed Notice of Change to Directors’ Circular\nThe CanniMed Board has filed a Notice of Change to Directors’ Circular in connection with the Improved Offer. The CanniMed Board is unanimously recommending that CanniMed Shareholders accept the Improved Offer and tender their CanniMed Shares to the Improved Offer.\nThis decision follows a unanimous determination, made by the CanniMed Board and the special committee to the CanniMed Board (the “ Special Committee ”) that, after consultation with their financial and legal advisors, the consideration under the Improved Offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to CanniMed Shareholders (other than Aurora and its affiliates) and that it would be in the best interests of CanniMed to support and facilitate the Improved Offer. The CanniMed Board’s financial advisor, AltaCorp Capital Inc., and the financial advisor to the Special Committee, Cormark Securities Inc., have each provided opinions that, as of January 26, 2018, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications on which the opinions are based, the consideration to be received under the Improved Offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to CanniMed Shareholders other than Aurora and its affiliates.\nInitial Deposit Period\nIn connection with the filing of the Offer Documents, the CanniMed Board has reduced the initial deposit period (being the minimum amount of time the Improved Offer must be open for acceptance before Aurora can begin taking up shares under the Improved Offer) to 84 days from the commencement of the offer on November 24, 2017. This means that commencing on the later of February 16, 2018 and the date all of the conditions to the Improved Offer have been satisfied or waived, Aurora will be able to take up CanniMed Shares under the Improved Offer.

(the “ Original Locked-Up Shareholders ”) to support the Original Offer (and the Improved Offer). The CanniMed Shares to be tendered pursuant to the Original Lock-Up Agreements represent approximately 36% of the issued and outstanding CanniMed Shares on a fully diluted basis.\nIn addition to the Original Locked-Up Shareholders, certain CanniMed directors and officers holding approximately 12% of the issued and outstanding CanniMed Shares, including Brent Zettl, Chief Executive Officer, have agreed to support the Improved Offer and have entered to into lock-up agreements in respect of the same (the “ New Lock-Up Agreements ”).\nAltogether, under the Original Lock-Up Agreements and the New Lock-Up Agreements, shareholders holding approximately 48%of the issued and outstanding CanniMed Shares have agreed to tender to the Improved Offer. In addition, Aurora owns 700,600 CanniMed Shares, representing approximately 2.87% of the issued and outstanding CanniMed Shares, which are not the subject of the Improved Offer.\nAbout the Improved Offer\nThe full details of the Improved Offer are set out in the Offer Documents, which have been filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and are being mailed to CanniMed Shareholders.

Forward-looking statements are frequently characterized by words such as “plan”, “continue”, “expect”, “project”, “intend”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “may”, “will”, “potential”, “proposed” and other similar words, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” occur. These statements are only predictions. Forward looking statements in release include statements regarding the Improved Offer, the anticipated value of the Improved Offer, the number of shares to be issued and timing to complete the Improved Offer. Various assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions or making the projections contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this news release, including assumptions based upon CanniMed’s publicly disclosed information, and that there will be no change in the business, prospects or capitalization of CanniMed or Aurora. Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the statements are made, and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Neither Aurora nor CanniMed is under any obligation, and expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable law. A more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing either Aurora or CanniMed is in their Annual Information Forms and continuous disclosure filings, which are available at www.sedar.com .\nNeither TSX nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of Toronto Stock Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nNotice to U.S. Holders\nThe Offer is made for the securities of a company formed outside of the United States. The Offer will be subject to disclosure requirements of Canada that are different from those of the United States. Financial statements included in the documents, if any, will be prepared in accordance with Canadian accounting standards and may not be comparable to the financial statements of United States companies.\nIt may be difficult for a securityholder in the United States to enforce his/her/its rights and any claim a securityholder may have arising under the U.S. federal securities laws, since the issuer is located in Canada, and some or all of its officers or directors may be residents of Canada or another country outside of the United States. A securityholder may not be able to sue a Canadian company or its officers or directors in a court in Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States for violations of U.S. securities laws.
