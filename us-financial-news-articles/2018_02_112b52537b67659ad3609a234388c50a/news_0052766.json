Well-trained, gun-adept teachers and coaches\" should be the ones carrying guns.\n\"I mean, I don't want to have 100 guards with rifles standing all over the school. You do a concealed carry permit,\" he added. \"This would be a major deterrent, because these people are inherently cowards.\"\nA teacher with a concealed weapon \"would have shot the hell out of\" the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter last week in South Florida, Trump said during the speech.\nAfter the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in which 20 young children and six adults was gunned down in Connecticut, the National Rifle Association called for putting police officers and armed guards in schools.\nDuring last week's massacre, the armed Broward County officer on duty at the school \"never went in\" to confront the shooter, Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters Thursday. The officer, Scot Peterson, has resigned, Israel said.\nBut even as Trump advocated arming teachers with concealed weapons, he criticized the media for wrongly characterizing his proposals.\n\"I'm not talking about teachers,\" he said, describing media reports about his position on giving teachers guns as \"fake news.\" He then talked about what kinds of teachers should be armed.\n\"I don't want a person that's never handled a gun, that doesn't know what a gun looks like, to be armed,\" he said. Only those who are \"gun-adept\" — which Trump says could be 10 or 20 percent of teachers — should have guns, he said.\nThe nation is gripped in a debate over gun control and school security after a gunman wielding an AR-15 semi-automatic last week killed 17 students and adults at a southeast Florida high school.\nOn Wednesday, Trump hosted a listening session at the White House with the families and survivors of school shootings .\nAt that event, Trump said teachers with firearms could end an attack \"very quickly.\"\nThe next day, in seven tweets on the issue of gun policy, Trump strongly advocated arming \"only the best\" trained teachers with guns in schools.\n\"20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to ... immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions,\" Trump tweeted.\nDuring the CPAC speech, Trump also said if Democrats win majority control of congressional House races in 2018, \"they will take away your Second Amendment.\"\nAnd he called for strengthening background checks and preventing \"people who are mentally ill from having any form of weapon.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T17:50:01.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
