I will go on explaining carefully to those concerned.” Reporting by Kiyoshi TakenakaEditing by Clarence Fernandez", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:16:49.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
