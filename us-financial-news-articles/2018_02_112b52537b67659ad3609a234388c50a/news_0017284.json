Four assault rifles, a grenade launcher and stolen police firearms and ammunition were recovered. \nThe security forces were trying to arrest Omar Daiser, who was among the inmates freed on May 23 last year when Maute group gunmen stormed the Marawi City Jail, looted a police armory and seized control of other parts of the city.
