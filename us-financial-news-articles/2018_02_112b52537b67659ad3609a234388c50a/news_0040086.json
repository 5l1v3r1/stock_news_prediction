Industry experts say more than 100 financial institutions in India are connected with SWIFT including the central bank.\nCity Union said it was working with the Ministry of External Affairs and officials in Turkey and China to repatriate the funds.\nSeparately, India’s Punjab National Bank said earlier this week it had been hit by a $1.77 billion fraud.\n($1 = 0.8061 euros)\nReporting by Rafael Nam and Manoj Kumar; Editing by Alison Williams and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T01:58:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
