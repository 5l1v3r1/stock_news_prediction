Net income (2) was $76 million (diluted EPS of $0.67), including a $55 million nonrecurring tax benefit from U.S. tax reform and compared with $2 million (diluted EPS of $0.02) in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS (1) was $0.37, compared with $0.25 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA (1) was $95 million (19.3% of net sales), compared with $79 million (17.6% of net sales) in last year's third quarter. Completed the World Dryer acquisition in our Water Management platform.\nTodd A. Adams, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our third-quarter operational results were at the higher end of our expectations, as we leveraged the acceleration in sales growth with our improved cost structure to deliver 20% year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA growth. The margin and cash flow benefits from completing our Supply Chain Optimization and Footprint Rationalization (“SCOFR”) initiatives were fully reflected in the quarter, and we continue to evaluate incremental opportunities to further improve our overall cost structure, long-term profitability, and free cash flow. The roll-out of our DiRXN (pronounced “Direction\") digital enterprise strategy continues to gather momentum with our OEM and end user customers, and we remain on track to meet our first-year launch objectives.\n“Our Process & Motion Control (“PMC”) platform delivered an 8% year-over-year net sales increase in our third quarter that includes 6% core growth and more fully reflects the improved OEM and end-user order environment we have experienced in recent quarters. Leveraging the Rexnord Business System (“RBS”) enables us to capture the benefits of our leaner cost structure in our margins and cash flow, while sustaining our investments in the transition to a digital enterprise and supporting our strategic growth initiatives. We are also excited to have signed an agreement to acquire Centa Power Transmission which we expect will add approximately $100 million of annual sales, extend our couplings capabilities in engine-driven applications, and create new growth opportunities for PMC.\n“Our Water Management platform benefited from good balance between our nonresidential building and water infrastructure end markets and delivered 10% growth in the quarter, with 7% core growth and ongoing margin expansion. New product introductions are continuing to gather momentum and are expected to combine with strengthening activity in institutional building categories, such as health care and education, to sustain favorable core growth in our nonresidential construction end-markets well into our fiscal 2019. We have completed the integration of World Dryer and believe it further strengthens the value proposition we can offer building owners.\"\n(1) Refer to \"Non-GAAP Measures\" for a definition of this non-GAAP metric, as well as the accompanying reconciliations to GAAP.\n(2) Net Income reflects net income attributable to Rexnord common stockholders.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nAdams continued, “As we head into our fourth quarter, we are increasing our fiscal 2018 outlook to reflect the positive demand trends we’re experiencing across our primary end markets and the impact of recent U.S. tax law changes. We now project fiscal 2018 net income to be in a range of $155 million to $159 million, Adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $381 million to $387 million, and our free cash flow to exceed net income.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Segment Highlights\nProcess & Motion Control\nPMC net sales increased 8% year over year to $293 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as core sales increased 6% year over year and foreign currency translation added 2%. The increase in core sales is the result of favorable demand trends across the majority of our served end markets.\nPMC income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $49 million, or 16.6% of net sales. Income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased by 600 basis points year over year, primarily due to the core sales increase, RBS-led productivity gains and benefits from footprint repositioning actions and lower restructuring-related expenses, partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals and incremental investments in our innovation and market expansion initiatives.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $66 million. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales increased by 190 basis points year over year to 22.5%.\nWater Management\nWater Management net sales were $200 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 10% year over year. Core sales increased 7% year over year, excluding a 2% increase from the World Dryer acquisition, a 1% adverse impact associated with last year's exit of the RHF product line, and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The year-over-year increase in core sales reflects favorable demand trends in our nonresidential construction and water and wastewater infrastructure markets.\nWater Management income from operations was $26 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, or 12.9% of net sales. Income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased by 500 basis points year over year, as benefits from core sales volume growth, ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, and lower restructuring expense more than offset incremental investments in our innovation and market expansion initiatives.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $37 million, or 18.6% of sales. The comparable margin increased by 100 basis points year over year.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by management in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis. We believe that these financial measures are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our underlying operating performance trends compared to historical and prospective periods and our peers. Management also believes that these measures are useful to investors in their analysis of our results of operations and provide improved comparability between fiscal periods as well as insight into the compliance with our debt covenants. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented above to our GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.\nCore Sales\nCore sales excludes the impact of acquisitions (such as the Cambridge and World Dryer acquisitions), divestitures (such as the RHF product line exit) and foreign currency translation. Management believes that core sales facilitates easier and more meaningful comparison of our net sales performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. We exclude the effect of foreign currency translation from this measure because the volatility of currency translation is not under management's control.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\nAdjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share (calculated on a diluted basis) exclude actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement benefit obligations, restructuring and other similar charges, gains or losses on divestitures, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, the impact of acquisition-related fair value adjustments in connection with purchase accounting, amortization of intangible assets, and other non-operational, non-cash or non-recurring losses, net of their income tax impact, as well as the expected non-recurring effects of recent U.S. tax reform legislation. The tax rates used to calculate adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are based on a transaction specific basis. We believe that adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are useful in assessing our financial performance by excluding items that are not indicative of our core operating performance or that may obscure trends useful in evaluating our continuing results of operations. All references to Net Income and EPS within this earnings release refer to net income attributable to Rexnord common stockholders and net income per diluted share attributable to Rexnord common stockholders, respectively.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented because it is an important supplemental measure of performance and it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. EBITDA is also presented and compared by analysts and investors in evaluating our ability to meet debt service obligations. Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently. EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net income as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA is calculated before recurring cash charges, including interest expense and taxes, and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of the business, it should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of the business.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is the term we use to describe EBITDA as defined and adjusted in our credit agreement, which is net income, adjusted for the items summarized in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors, excluding non-operational, non-cash or non-recurring losses or gains. In view of our debt level, it is also provided to aid investors in understanding our compliance with our debt covenants. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA varies from others in our industry. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations (as it relates to our two reportable segments, we adjust from income from operations because “non-operating” expenses such as interest and income taxes are not allocated to our segments and therefore net income is not presented at the segment level) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (a) our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (b) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) the significant interest expenses, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; (d) tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; (e) any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; or (f) the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we and the lenders under our credit agreement may not consider indicative of our ongoing operations. In particular, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA allows us to add back certain non-cash, non-operating or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income, even though these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict and can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results.\nIn addition, certain of these expenses can represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other corporate purposes. Further, although not included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA below, the measure may at times allow us to add estimated cost savings and operating synergies related to operational changes ranging from acquisitions to dispositions to restructurings and/or exclude one-time transition expenditures that we anticipate we will need to incur to realize cost savings before such savings have occurred. Further, management and various investors use the ratio of total debt less cash to Adjusted EBITDA (which includes a full pro-forma last-twelve-month impact of acquisitions), or \"net debt leverage\", as a measure of our financial strength and ability to incur incremental indebtedness when making key investment decisions and evaluating us against peers.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, and we use this metric in analyzing our ability to service and repay our debt and to forecast future periods. However, this measure does not represent funds available for investment or other discretionary uses since it does not deduct cash used to service our debt.\nAbout Rexnord\nHeadquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Rexnord is comprised of two strategic platforms, Process & Motion Control and Water Management, with approximately 8,000 employees worldwide.
