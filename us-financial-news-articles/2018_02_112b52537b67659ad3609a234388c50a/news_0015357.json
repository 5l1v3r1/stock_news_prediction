That pushed the index some 0.2 percent lower while European bourses were weighed down by commodity and technology stocks.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 share index fell 0.5 percent, and is still down almost 3 percent year-to-date.\nWall Street too looks set for a weaker session, with U.S. stock futures , down around a quarter percent, as investors eye the potential for higher inflation and borrowing costs.\nThat has “toned down the straight line move on equity markets, led to a more volatile environment and limited the potential for equities,” Francois Savary, chief investment officer at wealth manager Prime Partners said, referring to investors’ bullishness prior to the recent correction.\n“I don’t think markets can recover immediately (from the shock), there needs to be a stabilisation phase”.\nThe previous two sessions saw the heaviest volumes traded on the STOXX 600 index in more than seven months.\nVolumes on U.S. exchanges meanwhile exceeded 9 billion shares for a fourth straight day on Wednesday, a figure surpassed just once before in the past seven months, according to Deutsche Bank.\nIn Asia, MSCI’s index of emerging Asian equities remained near six-week lows.\nFocus was on China, where Shanghai’s benchmark index hit a six-month low after Beijing resumed an outbound investment scheme after a two-year hiatus, granting licenses to about a dozen global money managers, sources said.\nSPENDING SOARS The recent selloff, sparked by last Friday’s jump in Treasury yields, sent the VIX index, considered Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, spiralling. The index is down just below 30 on Thursday, but that is more than twice the levels seen in the past few months.\nBond yields got a fresh impetus on Wednesday from U.S., lawmakers’ deal on the budget, with 10-year U.S. yields back up to 2.84 percent, near Monday’s four-year peak of 2.885 percent.\nThe fear now is that alongside the economic boost President Donald Trump’s tax cut plans may deliver, higher deficit spending could overheat the already strong U.S. economy and accelerate inflation to levels not seen in over a decade.\nThe Senate and the House were both expected to vote on the deal on Thursday.\n“The news yesterday has set up a test for 3 percent on 10-year Treasury yields,” Savary said.\nEuropean bond yields also rose, lifted by the prospect of increased fiscal spending after Wednesday’s coalition government deal in Germany.\nUK government bond yields rose too after the Bank of England said interest rates probably needed to rise sooner and by a bit more than it thought three months ago and raised economic growth forecasts for Britain.\nBritish two-year government bond yields rose to the highest since December 2015 after the statement, rising around 6 basis points to 0.706 percent. Sterling rose around one percent against the dollar and euro .\nAdditional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo and Sujata Rao in London; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:53:13.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
