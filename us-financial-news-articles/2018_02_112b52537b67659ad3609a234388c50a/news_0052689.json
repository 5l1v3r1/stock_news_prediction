It had received approval from Britain, while Singapore’s review was ongoing, she said.\nThe FTC has filed an administrative complaint with an agency judge asking for the deal to be scrapped.\nIt also authorized staff to request a preliminary injunction in federal court temporarily stopping the deal while the administrative process goes forward.\nIn most cases, if the agency wins in federal court, the companies cancel their proposed transaction.\nThe deal has a $200 million termination fee, according to a statement from Wilhelmsen when the transaction was announced in April 2017.\nReporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:33:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
