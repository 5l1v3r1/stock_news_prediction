Federal prosecutors allege that the PayPal accounts were opened with fake identities to get past the online payment company’s security requirements. \nA spokesperson for PayPal told Bloomberg that the company is “intensely focused on combatting and preventing the illicit use of our services” and working with law enforcement to stop illegal activity. \nAccording to the indictment, the operatives illegally took social security numbers and birth dates of Americans without their knowledge and created fake means of identification, including false driver’s licenses, which allowed them to open and maintain PayPal accounts. Behind the stolen identities, the operatives posted on various social media accounts and used their PayPal accounts to pay for political advertisements. \n“Defendants and their co-conspirators also obtained, and attempted to obtain, false identification documents to use as proof of identity in connection with maintaining accounts and purchasing advertisements on social media sites,” the indictment says. \n“PayPal is intensely focused on combatting and preventing the illicit use of our services,” the company said in a statement to Fortune. “We work closely with law enforcement, and did so in this matter, to identify, investigate and stop improper or potentially illegal activity.” \nThis story has been updated to include a statement from Paypal.
