He denied any connection to Gulen’s movement; Gulen, who lives in the United States, denies being involved in the abortive coup. \nWashington expressed worry over the sentencing and the fate of other U.S. citizens who are facing prosecution under the state of emergency in Turkey. \n“The United States is deeply concerned by the Feb. 8 conviction without credible evidence of U.S. citizen Serkan Golge for being a member of a terror organization,” U.S. state Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Thursday. \nNauert also called on Ankara to end to the state of emergency in Turkey, which was imposed shortly after the coup attempt, and to release people detained arbitrarily. \nTurkey and the United States suspended issuing visas last year after Washington complained about the detention of two locally hired consular employees on suspicion of a role in the failed coup. Both countries resumed issuing visas in late December 2017.
