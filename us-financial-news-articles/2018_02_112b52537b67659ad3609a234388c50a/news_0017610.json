Security Council sanctions.\nKim Yo Jong is vice director of the party’s Propaganda and Agitation Department, which handles ideological messaging through the media, arts and culture. Choe had previously worked for the same body.\nIn 2016, South Korea’s former spy chief said Kim Yo Jong was seen “abusing power”, punishing propaganda department executives for “minor mistakes”.\n“One of the positives of her visit is that she is someone able to deliver a direct message on behalf of Kim Jong Un,” said Shin Beom-chul, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul.\n“What is problematic is that she’s coming with Choe Hwi. ... This raises worries that North Korea likely intends to use this Olympics as a propaganda tool, rather than a possible opening to meaningful dialogue with South Korea.”\nThe opening ceremony will also be attended by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other world leaders.\nPence said after talks with Abe in Tokyo on Wednesday that Washington would soon unveil its toughest ever economic sanctions on North Korea, calling the country the “most tyrannical and oppressive regime on the planet”.\nChoi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said, ”The United States would be unhappy to see South Korea trying to undermine all the rigid sanctions that it had worked so hard to put in place by granting exemptions for the sake of the Olympics.\n“Personally, Pence would feel uncomfortable just being in the same place with the North Koreans.”\nFROM PRINCESS TO TOP POLICYMAKER Having previously only occasionally appeared in the background, the young heiress has moved to the front and center of media photos more recently, assisting her brother at numerous state events.\nIn October, Kim Yo Jong was promoted to the party’s politburo, an opaque, all-powerful decision-making body that decides top state affairs.\nMembers of North Korean cheering squad walk at an expressway service area in Gapyeong, South Korea, February 7, 2018. Yonhap via REUTERS The promotion is a sign Kim Jong Un is consolidating his position by drawing his most important people closer to the center of power, experts and officials say.\nOn Tuesday, Kim Yo Jong was seen in state media greeting a North Korean art troupe that has since departed for the South to stage performances during the Olympics.\n“She could deliver a message from Kim Jong Un in a way that conveys personal seriousness and commitment that even Kim Yong Nam couldn‘t,” Andray Abrahamian, a research fellow at Pacific Forum CSIS in Hawaii, told Reuters.\n“It may be a sign that Pyongyang is going to pull out all the stops in the next couple weeks, in terms of making plans with Seoul.”\nJUBILANT CHEERLEADERS A group of 280 North Koreans arrived on Wednesday in South Korea, one of the largest peacetime crossings of the inter-Korean border, to spur on athletes from the two sides at the Winter Olympics.\nSlideshow (14 Images) Besides the 229-member cheer squad that formed the bulk of the group, there were 26 taekwondo performers, 21 journalists and four North Korean Olympics committee members, including Sports Minister Kim Il-guk.\nThe delegation celebrated its first night in South Korea with a banquet at its hotel, dining on roasted scallops, steak, beef marrow soup and shrimp wrapped in thinly sliced radish, according to a pool report.\nThey arrived a day after a North Korean ferry crossed the border with a 137-strong orchestra to perform during the Games.\n(For graphic on North Korea’s Olympic delegations, click tmsnrt.rs/2E1Qa9Q )\nOIL REQUEST After the troupe’s Tuesday arrival on the ferry, which is also being used as accommodation, North Korea asked the South to provide oil for refueling, the Unification Ministry said.\nOil is a sensitive item and has taken center stage in global efforts to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, with Washington urging a drastic cut in energy supplies to the isolated country.\nNorth Korea has virtually no domestic oil production, and has traditionally imported its fuel from China and Russia.\nIn December, the U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on the North, seeking to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to the country by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year.\n“There was a request for oil support during our discussions with the North after the ship arrived, and we’re reviewing it now,” ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told a news briefing in Seoul.\nIn Tokyo, asked about concerns that South Korea was making exceptions to the sanctions, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said it was important not to let up pressure.\n“We must not be fooled by North Korea’s ‘smile diplomacy,'” he told a news conference.\nReporting by Hyonhee Shin and Christine Kim in SEOUL; Additional reporting by Heekyong Yang in SEOUL, Soyoung Kim and James Pearson in PYEONGCHANG and Linda Sieg in TOKYO; Editing by Michael Perry and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T04:22:57.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
