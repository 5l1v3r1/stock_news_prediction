There was some exporter (dollar) selling at the latter part of the day,” said a currency dealer. \nThe rupee held steady compared to last week, but has fallen 0.6 percent so far this year, Thomson Reuters data showed. \nDealers said they expected the currency to be pressured by continued importer dollar demand. \nThey expect a 2-3 percent depreciation in the rupee and higher volatility this year on account of debt repayment by the government. The rupee fell 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016. \nPresident Maithripala Sirisena’s administration must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.85 billion) in 2018 - a record high - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans and a total of $5.36 billion in interest. \nForeign investors bought 5.9 billion rupees worth of government securities this year up to Jan. 30, central bank data showed.
