Skoda Auto’s board will discuss the situation on Feb. 19.\nSkoda, which has become Volkswagen’s second-most profitable brand in terms of operating margin, reported another record year in 2017 with global sales up 6.6 percent to 1.2 million vehicles.\nStrikes rarely take place in the European Union member country which boasts the bloc’s lowest unemployment thanks to robust economic growth.\nSkoda’s Czech plants accounted for 60.7 percent of the country’s car production in 2017, followed by Hyundai Motor and a joint plant of Toyota and Peugeot Citroen (TPCA). It also operates plants in China, India and Russia.
