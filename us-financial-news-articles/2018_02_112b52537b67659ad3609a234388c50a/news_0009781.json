These are completely untrue, such as the fact that three new micro cracks were found in Tricastin 1 during the third decennial overhaul. This is a lie,” Miniere said.\nHe added that the issue of trapped hydrogen defects in some forged nuclear components was already known within the industry and that EDF had taken measures during the construction of its reactor vessels to make sure these defects did not occur.\nMiniere added that after the problems with the couple of Belgian reactors were revealed, the ASN regulator had asked EDF to re-read all the manufacturing documents linked to its reactor vessels and carried out checks on six additional vessels.\n“None of the vessels showed any defects due to hydrogen,” Miniere said, added that the Belgian reactors that were found to have the micro cracks, were not manufactured in France.\nThe newspaper article said French reactors that had similar defects to the Belgian reactors included Bugey 2, Gravelines 5, St Alban 1, Golfech 5, Cruas 1 and Penly 1.\n“I don’t know where this list came from. This is a complete lie,” Miniere said, adding that EDF had carried out tests in liaison with the ASN on Bugey 3, Dampierre 3, Blayais 2, Penly 2 and Graveline 4 and Cruas 3 reactors.\nEDF shares were down 1.8 percent in mid-session trading, amid a drop in broader European stock markets.
