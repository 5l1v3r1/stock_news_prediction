Analysts had expected earnings per share of 24 cents. \nChesapeake also surpassed expectations on the top line, drumming up about $2.5 billion in revenues, compared with the Street's forecast for nearly $2.3 billion. \nThe revenues were boosted by higher commodity prices, as U.S. crude prices rallied 17 percent in the fourth quarter. Chesapeake also increased its oil, natural gas and liquids output by 3 percent over the three months. \nThe average selling price for the three categories of hydrocarbons was up about 20 percent at $24.41 per oil equivalent barrel. \nChesapeake expects its total output to rise by 3 percent in 2018, with oil production growing at 5 percent for the year. The company says it can pump more while spending about 12 percent less on capital expenditures. \nThe driller also continued to cut expenses in the fourth quarter, with cost dropping 18 percent last year. \nChesapeake also reduced its debt by 32 percent, or $1.3 billion, in 2017, bringing its long-term load to $9.9 billion. The company completed $1.3 billion in asset sales for the year and announced $575 million more in divestitures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T16:49:39.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
