The Coyotes also ended a five-game losing streak to Edmonton.\nThe shutout was the first of the season for Raanta and the ninth of his five-year NHL career.\nEkman-Larsson fired a shot from the point that bounced in off of Dvorak, who was stationed in front in front of the net, and past Edmonton goaltender Cam Talbot. Christian Fischer also got an assist on the goal.\nThe Oilers thought they had tied the match with 8:52 to play when Oscar Klefbom’s shot caromed off Patrick Maroon and past Raanta. Arizona challenged the goal and it was negated because of interference on Raanta.\nThe defeat extended Edmonton’s season-long losing streak to six games. The Oilers are now 6-13-2 in their past 21 games. Talbot stopped 31 shots in the hard-luck loss.\nThere’s no rest for the Oilers as they fly to Denver tonight for a match on Sunday afternoon against the Avalanche. Arizona will enjoy a four-day break before hosting Calgary on Thursday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:08:36.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
