Slideshow (16 Images) \nChelsea pushed players forward and Eden Hazard and Pedro as well as defender Marcos Alonso had attempts on goal but the team, playing their ninth game this month, looked jaded as coach Antonio Conte cut a forlorn figure on the touchline. \nThe Italian has suggested his squad is too small to be playing Premier League, Cup and Champions League competitions and that he has little control over signing new players. \nThe humiliation was complete when former Chelsea midfielder Nathan Ake made it three in the 68th minute, prodding the ball in from a Stanislas shot. \nChelsea’s first home defeat since Sept. 30 exposed the London side’s lack of firepower, with Alvaro Morata injured, Michy Batshuayi on his way to Dortmund on loan and Olivier Giroud signed from Arsenal only a few hours before kickoff.
