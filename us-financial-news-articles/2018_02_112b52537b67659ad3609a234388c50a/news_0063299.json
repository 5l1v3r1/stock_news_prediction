The currency has eased back from its recent highs against the dollar and volatility is also down.\nECB policymakers will next meet on March 8 and sources close to the process said no big change is likely, but a discussion may be reopened about dropping the bank’s easing bias - part of its guidance stipulating its readiness to increase bond buys if needed.\nSpeaking to European lawmakers earlier this week, ECB President Mario Draghi said the factors holding back inflation were temporary and merely slowed down the rise in prices, a message that appeared to support expectation for a decision later this year on reducing stimulus.\nStill, even when bond buys are concluded, the ECB is likely to provide years of support through exceptionally low interest rates and its massive holding of government debt, which should keep yields low.\nAnother core inflation measure that many market economists look at, which excludes also the prices of alcohol and tobacco, also held stable in February at 1.0 percent year-on-year.\nEnergy prices grew by 2.1 percent year-on-year, just short of January’s 2.2 percent rate, but unprocessed food prices fell 0.9 percent, compared with a 1.1 percent rise in January.\nEurostat’s first estimate of inflation does not include a month-on-month figure.\nReporting by Jan Strupczewski and Balazs Koranyi; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:37:51.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
