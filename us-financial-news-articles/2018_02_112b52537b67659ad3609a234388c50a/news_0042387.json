He has his own ski lift, a small one, so I learned it there and I fell in love - not at the beginning, but afterwards.”\nShe remembered her first reaction: “Oh no, it’s too cold and I never saw snow and it was like, ‘Oh my gosh, no.'”\nSixteen years on, she is still living in Austria, training with the Austrian team and hoping she can get more funding to pursue her ambitions in the sport.\n“I‘m 19 years old, so I‘m at the beginning and I want to get faster and better ... but we need also the financial support to get a good professional team,” she said.\nBacked by her mother Sarah, who watched her in Pyeongchang, and her coach Christian Reif, she believes she can reach the top by herself, even in the absence of fellow skiers from Kenya.\n“I can do it alone, with a professional team I can do it.”\nReporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T01:59:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
