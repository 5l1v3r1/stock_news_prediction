He hasn’t played too much for PSG this season so we have to assess him. We’re sure he’s going to help us,” Pochettino told the BBC. \nMoura will have seen that there is no guarantee that he is going to slot straight into a team that seemed to have rediscovered their mojo after draws with Southampton in the league and fourth-tier Newport County in the FA Cup. \nParticularly impressive were the returning Eriksen and Dele Alli, both back to their best as Spurs earned a rare success over fellow top-six opponents this season that bodes well for their next two league matches against Liverpool and Arsenal. \n“For us, it was a fantastic result and a fantastic performance,” said Pochettino, delighted that his side are now two points behind both third-placed Liverpool and Chelsea. \n“We have a lot of important matches to play and that’s why we have to stay focussed in everything - the League, FA Cup and Champions League.” Reporting by Ian Chadband,; Editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T03:30:03.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
