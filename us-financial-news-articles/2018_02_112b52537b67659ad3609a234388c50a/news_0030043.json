He said Ivory Coast would need to raise a total of 1.31 trillion CFA francs ($2.49 billion) from both the international and regional markets.\nPrime Minister Coulibaly said Wednesday the government intended to raise 300 billion CFA francs on the regional market.\nSince ending a decade-long crisis capped by a 2011 civil war, Ivory Coast has emerged as one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, attracting a wave of foreign investment in everything from large infrastructure projects to retail chains.\nIt last tapped the debt market last June, raising $1.25 billion in 16-year debt and 625 million euros ($777 million) in eight-year debt, just months after a wave of army mutinies raised fears of a return of political instability.\nThe unrest, coupled with a major crisis in its cocoa sector last year, have taken some of the shine off Ivory Coast’s post-war success story. But Coulibaly said he did not expect any difficulties attracting investors to the new bond.\n“Ivory Coast’s credibility permits it to go to the international market,” he said.\nThe Ivorian economy expanded by about 7.6 percent in 2017, he said, while the deficit remained at 4.3 percent of gross domestic product. The debt load meanwhile stood at 42.8 percent of GDP.
