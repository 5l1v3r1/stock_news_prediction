The fierce drought on the Iberian peninsula has left rivers dry and devastated crops.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation fell to 7.32 billion euros at the Basque Country-based company, missing a Reuters polled forecast of 7.7 billion euros.\nNet profit rose 3.7 percent to 2.8 billion euros, compared with a Reuters forecast of 2.59 billion euros, buoyed by capital gains from a U.S. tax reform.\nThe company booked a one-off capital gain of 1.28 billion euros in 2017 from the U.S. tax reform. However, nearly all of this was used as provisions to adjust values of some assets, the company said.\nRevenue in Iberdrolaâ€™s networks business in Britain, where it owns Scottish Power, fell 7.4 percent on lower demands and margins.\nIberdrola said it recommended a 2017 dividend of 0.32 euros per share. It said its 2022 profit forecast implied a 0.4 euros per share dividend for that year.
