The Brazil international joined Chelsea in 2013 under Mourinho, who was sacked two years later before taking over at United in 2016. The 29-year-old Willian has scored four goals and provided seven assists in 26 league appearances for Chelsea this campaign and Antonio Conte’s team sit three points behind second-placed Manchester United in fourth position. “He (Mourinho) is my friend. I had a great time with him, but I am at Chelsea and he is now at Manchester United,” Willian told British media. “They are difficult games. It is totally different to play in the Premier League to the Champions League. I think we can stay at this level and we can go to Old Trafford on Sunday and play another great game.” Chelsea drew 1-1 with Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday and Willian believes his team mates must emulate their performance if they are to beat United and leaders Manchester City. “We have to play in a similar way. Against Manchester United, I think we can do a great job,” Willian added. “Against Manchester City, it will be like the game against Barcelona - they like to have the ball. We have to stay compact and use the same plan as we used against Barcelona.” With City holding a seemingly insurmountable 16-point lead atop the standings, United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal are battling to secure a top-four finish with 11 games remaining. Following the trip to Old Trafford, Chelsea face City and Crystal Palace before the return leg against Barcelona on March 14.
