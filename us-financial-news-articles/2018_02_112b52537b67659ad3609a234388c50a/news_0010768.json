One civilian member of the Turkish contingent was also wounded, it said. \nThe army began setting up the outpost on Monday southwest of the Syrian city of Aleppo, the deepest position they have established so far inside northwestern Syria under a deal with Russia and Iran aimed at reducing violence there. \nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the observation post was near the village of al-Eis, which would place it less than five km (three miles) from territory held by Syrian government forces and their allies. \nA week ago, a large Turkish military convoy heading for the same area came under attack and had to pull back. The region is one of the last main strongholds of rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. \nThe “de-escalation” in violence that the Turkish forces were supposed to monitor has collapsed. In December, the Syrian army alongside Iranian-backed militias and heavy Russian air power launched a major offensive to take territory in Idlib province. \nSeparately, Turkey launched an offensive two weeks ago into another neighbouring part of Syria, the Afrin region, against Kurdish fighters who control it.
