Pence arrives in South Korea on Thursday as head of the U.S. delegation to the Games.\nRippon declined to confirm if Pence had in fact reached out to him, referring queries to the U.S. Olympic Committee.\n“I don’t want to distract from the competition or make this too much for my competitors and my teammates,” he told reporters after a practice session.\n“After the competition I‘m open to meeting him and having an open conversation, but opening ceremonies are tomorrow and I’ve been really focused,” Rippon, who is taking part in his first Olympics, added.\nThe oldest of six children, Rippon was born with a severe hearing loss that was corrected through surgery when he was nearly a year old. He came out as gay in 2015 and is said to be the first openly gay U.S. athlete to qualify for the winter Olympics.\nRippon said he didn’t mind talking about the situation with Pence but that he didn’t want to create a fuss - and said that he was not having trouble maintaining his concentration.\n“If anybody can do it, I can. Because I think I have a lot of experience that my competitors don’t - I‘m 28, I’ve dealt with a lot of things in my life and I think at the very core I’ve always spoken my mind.”\nRippon, who has said he could hardly believe he had made it to the Olympics and that seeing the Olympic rings from his room in the athletes’ village was incredibly inspiring, also said he thought it was important for athletes to speak up - but that he also needed to get through the Games.\n“I’ve been waiting 28 years to be here and I want to do everything I can to stay focused and ready for this opportunity,” he said. “It’s my opportunity to show the world what I’ve got and represent my country the very best that I can.” (Reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T15:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:32:45.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
