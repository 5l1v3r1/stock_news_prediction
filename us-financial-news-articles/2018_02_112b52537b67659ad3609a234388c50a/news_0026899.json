But to be disciplined you have to be confident.” \nFrance have not won in their last eight outings. \n“We must respect the rules otherwise we won’t make it,” added Guirado. \n“We’re always under tremendous pressure and after two defeats in a row the game against Italy will be more than welcome to bounce back.” \nFrance are fifth in the standings with two points with their next opponents Italy on zero after they also lost their first two games. \n“The championship is not over yet but we must stop losing games like this,” said Guirado. \n“We gave away too many points,” added flyhalf Lionel Beauxis.
