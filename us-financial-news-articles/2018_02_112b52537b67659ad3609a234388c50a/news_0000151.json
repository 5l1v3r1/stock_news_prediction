Greece has its own territory called Macedonia, and argues that its small northern neighbor’s use of the name, along with contentious articles in its constitution, imply territorial claims over Greek land.\nBecause of Greek objections, Macedonia was admitted to the United Nations with the provisional name “The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, which remains its official title in international organizations.\nThe issue arouses strong passions among Greeks who consider Macedonia, the ancient kingdom ruled by Alexander the Great, to be an integral part of their homeland.\nHundreds of thousands of Greeks turned out at a demonstration on Jan. 21 in Thessaloniki, capital of Greece’s Macedonia region, to protest against any use of the name by the neighboring state.\nA rally in central Athens is scheduled for Sunday.\nToskas said that sending threatening letters to those who have been trying to settle a problem in a honest manner was “dangerous”. Police were trying to identify who had sent the letter to the minister, he added.\nIn an interview to Reuters on Thursday, Kotzias said that Athens would submit draft proposals to resolve the dispute, expecting that a settlement could be reached by June.
