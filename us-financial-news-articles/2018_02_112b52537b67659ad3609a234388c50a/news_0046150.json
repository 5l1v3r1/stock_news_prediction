Most IS members withdrew from the town during the battle.\nThe arrested man, whom the source identified only as Saud, entered Lebanon through a legal border crossing using his brother’s identity. It was not clear when he entered the country and whether he was planning any militant activities, the source said.\nIn a separate incident, Lebanon’s General Security announced on Wednesday the arrest of another Syrian Islamic State operative who had planned a suicide attack on an army bus.\nLebanese authorities say they have disrupted a number of IS plots in recent months. The last very big jihadist attack in Lebanon was a suicide bombing in Beirut in November 2015 which killed dozens.\nReporting by Younis Aoude, writing by Dahlia Nehme; Editing by Robin Pomeroy, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T14:01:12.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
