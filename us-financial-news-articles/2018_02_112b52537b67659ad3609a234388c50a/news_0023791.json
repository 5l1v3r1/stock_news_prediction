We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will, and must, build the Wall!” \nAn autopsy report released last week showed Martinez died of blunt-force trauma. The FBI said it found no evidence that any “scuffle, altercation, or attack” had occurred. \nAccording to the El Paso Times, the memo sent by CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the other agent, Stephen Garland, fell about 22 feet from where Martinez fell, “landing on his back and sustaining significant injuries to his back and skull. His resultant injuries have impaired the agent’s ability to recall the events of the incident.” \nIn late November, the U.S. Department of Justice offered a $25,000 reward for information related to a “potential assault on a federal officer” in the case. \nSome 33 border agents have died on duty since the CBP was created in 2003, the libertarian think tank Cato Institute said in a report after Martinez’ death. Of those, about half were from auto accidents and four were murdered, the institute said. \nReporting by Bernie Woodall in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Editing by Paul Simao and Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T20:50:05.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
