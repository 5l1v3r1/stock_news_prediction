Car exports rose 2.46 percent to 82,067 vehicles in January compared with a year earlier, the FTI said. The FTI has forecast domestic car sales of 900,000 vehicles this year after a 13.4 percent jump in 2017, which was the first annual increase in five years. It forecasts car exports at 1.1 million for this year after about 1.14 million vehicles exported last year. Annual domestic car sales declined during 2013-2016, following the end of a government car subsidy scheme in 2012, when sales surged 81 percent. Thailand is a regional vehicle production and export base for the world's top carmakers. The auto industry accounts for about 12 percent of Thailand's economy, Southeast Asia's second largest.
