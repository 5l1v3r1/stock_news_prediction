On a new episode of \" Kneading Dough ,\" host Maverick Carter asked James about the best financial decision he's ever made. He couldn't pick just one. \n\"There's two,\" the NBA star said. \" Signing with Nike and getting down with Beats.\" Liam Kyle | NBAE | Getty Images LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers speaks to the crowd during the Victory Parade And Rally on June 22, 2016 in Cleveland. \nChoosing Nike wasn't as easy of a decision as it could seem. When James was 18 years old, he took a meeting with Paul Fireman, the former chairman and CEO of Reebok. Fireman offered the high school senior $10 million on the spot, under one condition: that James wouldn't talk to Nike or Adidas. \n\"I was lost for words at the beginning,\" James recalls on a separate episode of \"Kneading Dough.\" \"I flew in from Akron, Ohio, from Spring Hill, from the projects. Our rent is like $17 a month and now I'm looking at a $10 million check.\" \nThe teen, who had been raised on welfare, didn't take the money: \"I started thinking, 'If this guy is willing to give me a $10 million check right now, what's to say that Nike or Adidas is not willing to give me $20 or $30 [million] upfront — or to say that maybe the upfront money is not even the biggest thing.'\" show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T21:11:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
