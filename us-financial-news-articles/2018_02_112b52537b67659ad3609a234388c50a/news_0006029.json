Nobody’s going to force anyone to go back if they don’t want to go back,” Hariri said. \nIn a speech at a donor conference in Beirut calling for $2.68 billion in humanitarian aid for the crisis this year, Hariri warned that refugees would try to move to other countries if there was not enough support for them in Lebanon. \n“We need more from the international community because we are doing a public service for the international community. Otherwise these people, if we do not do more, if you do not do more, they will seek refuge somewhere else,” he said. \nReporting By Angus McDowall, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:18:40.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
