Neil Robson, a lawyer at Katten Muchin Rosenman, said Monday’s statement suggested regulatory forbearance may be short lived.\nIn a related move on Monday, the Bank of England published a consultation paper on what it expects from firms it authorizes regarding the management of risks from algorithmic trading.\n“It applies to all algorithmic trading activities of a firm, including in respect of unregulated financial instruments such as spot foreign exchange,” the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority said in a statement.\nFIA EPTA Secretary General Piebe Teeboom said it was important that all players in algorithmic trading are subject to the same requirements and high levels of market conduct.\nAll firms should name a senior person who is responsible for algorithmic trading, and branches of foreign banks in Britain will have to show they are properly managing risks.\nThe PRA guidance will come into effect in June and the regulator will publish a discussion paper on operational resilience in algorithmic trading later this year.\nAdditional reporting by Maiya Keidan; Editing by Alexander Smith and David Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T14:42:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
