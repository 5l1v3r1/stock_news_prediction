The European index however remains down 3.8 percent so far this year.\nData out of Germany earlier in the day showed Europeâ€™s biggest economy was set to power ahead in 2018, while a Thomson Reuters study said fourth-quarter European earnings growth expectations were revised upwards after 15 weeks of downgrades.\nOne Milan-based trader said barring a major stock market correction, he was confident European equities could outperform Wall Street given monetary policy in the euro zone was still expansionary.\nOther investors however appear to be betting on a heavy pullback in equities after years of strong gains. Bridgewater Associates was reported to have taken short bets against major German companies Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Allianz ( ALVG.DE ), and BASF ( BASFn.DE ).\nThose three stocks all ended higher.\nTop gainer on the STOXX was silicon wafer group Siltronic ( WAFGn.DE ), up 7.9 after a positive note from Credit Suisse.\nSecond was French electrical parts distributor Rexel ( RXL.PA ), which rose after a trading update.\nFood packaging group Huhtamaki ( HUH1V.HE ) rose 3.5 percent after it released fourth-quarter results, and Dutch food supplement maker DSM ( DSMN.AS ) jumped 2.9 percent after giving an upbeat outlook for 2018.\nIn the banking sector, Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ) was a clear leader, up 3.7 percent after posting a third straight annual loss which was smaller than expected.\nInvestment bank Natixis ( CNAT.PA ) added 0.1 percent after reporting an unexpected rise in quarterly net profit..\nIts French peer Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) was down 2.8 percent after results.\nOther French stocks were among the top performers, with retirement home operator Orpea ( ORP.PA ) up 5.1 percent after reporting a solid outlook.\nReporting by Danilo Masoni and Julien Ponthus; Editing by David Holmes\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:10:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
