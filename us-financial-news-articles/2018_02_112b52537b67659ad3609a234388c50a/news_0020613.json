I can argue with a defender and I’ll have a better chance of getting him sent off if I know he has been booked, and I know he will do the same to me,” he said. \n“It’s not that I‘m old school, I‘m just of the theory that if an opponent insults me, tells me I‘m bad, says anything he likes or insults my sister, I will never go and cry to the media about it. I put up with everything, it doesn’t bother me or hurt me, it’s part of the game.” \nSuarez had a turbulent start to the season as he battled back to fitness ahead of schedule from a knee injury. \nHe has experienced a dramatic transformation, however, since taking a two-week break in November, scoring 16 goals in his last 17 games to help Barca go nine points clear at the top of La Liga. \n“I was very worried, and not just about the goals because I’ve been through spells like that before. I knew my knee was bad and I was worried it would affect me psychologically too,” Suarez said. \n“My attitude was not the same as before and nor was my intensity. But since November I’ve felt spectacular.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T16:33:45.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
