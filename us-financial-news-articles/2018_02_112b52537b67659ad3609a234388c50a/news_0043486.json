Of these, 2,371,724 Common Shares were issued to insiders of Burcon and 2,304,903 Common Shares were issued to all other persons. A total of 1,437,734 Common Shares were issued pursuant to the additional subscription privilege of the Rights Offering.

As 64.7% of the Rights Offering was subscribed to, Allan Yap was not required to fulfill his obligations under the Standby Commitment .\nAs compensation for providing the Standby Commitment, Allan Yap received non-transferable Common Share purchase warrants (the \" Standby Warrants \") entitling Mr. Yap to acquire up to 1,182,099 Common Shares. The exercise price under the Standby Warrants is $0.69 per Common Share, and the Standby Warrants will expire two years after issuance. In accordance with the policies of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the issuance of the Standby Warrants to Allan Yap is subject to shareholder approval, which will be sought at Burcon's next annual meeting, which is expected to be held in September 2018.\nThe estimated net proceeds of the Rights Offering will be used to fund the Company's ongoing and expanded research and development program, further strengthen and expand its intellectual property portfolio and for general working capital.
