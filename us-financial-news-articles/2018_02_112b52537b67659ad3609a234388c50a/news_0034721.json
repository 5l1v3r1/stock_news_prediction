The plan will be presented to a U.S. judge on Friday for approval.\nVictims of the faulty inflators will also be able to collect from a separate $125 million compensation fund created as part of a plea deal Takata entered with the U.S. Department of Justice early last year. As part of that plea, automakers will receive their share of an $850 million restitution fund.\nRice said funds from the Justice Department settlement and the bankruptcy are likely to fall short of full compensation for injured drivers, but they will still be able to sue the car manufacturers.\nThe one exception is Honda Motor Co, which agreed to create a trust to ensure injuries linked to its vehicles will be compensated in full, according to Rice. He said Honda also will not contest fault for the injuries.\nAt least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries worldwide are linked to the Takata inflators.\nHonda has faced the greatest number of air bag-related claims of the automakers, and 20 of the deaths have occurred in Honda vehicles, most of which were in the United States. In return for funding the trust, Honda will be shielded from further lawsuits. That also means it will not face the risk of punitive damages.\nLast year, a consumer lawsuit unearthed an internal email that plaintiffs said showed Honda was long aware of the risks of Takata air bags, the type of allegation that could have opened the way to punitive damages.\nHonda has said it was a victim of deception by Takata.\nHonda did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\nThe 12 other carmakers that were involved in the settlement, including Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Co, General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG, have 18 months to opt into the trust, if they agree to compensate drivers in full.\nUntil then, they will continue to defend personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits. They will be able to offset any judgments with payments made to claimants from the Justice Department fund and the bankruptcy.\nThe automakers trust being funded by Honda is similar to arrangements used by manufacturers driven into bankruptcy over asbestos-tainted products. While the asbestos trusts have often been underfunded, the automakers trust will be a pay-as-you-go system, helping to ensure it remains solvent.
