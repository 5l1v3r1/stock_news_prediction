Gross non-performing loans totalled 13.8 billion euros, the equivalent of 14.03 percent of its total gross loans. \nThe European Central Bank has stepped up pressure on Italian banks to offload debts that turned sour during the country’s recession which ended in 2014. \nEarlier this week, Italy’s biggest retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo said it would halve its impaired loan burden under a new four-year plan, while the country’s third largest lender Banco BPM stepped up its target for shedding bad debts by 5 billion euros. \nUBI Banca, Italy’s fourth biggest bank by market value, reported a 2017 net profit of 690.6 million euros, including results from the three small rivals it bought last year. \nThis compares with a loss of 830.2 million euros on a standalone basis a year earlier. \nThe bank said its fully-loaded CET1 ratio - an indicator of financial strength - stood at 11.43 percent, including a planned dividend payout of 0.11 euros per share.
