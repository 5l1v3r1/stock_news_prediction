Research has shown that the time change disrupts sleep schedules and can impact productivity at work. \nSupporters say the extra morning daylight in winter and evening light in summer can help reduce traffic accidents and save energy. \nThe European Parliament voted by 384 to 153 for a motion calling on the European Commission to study the effects of switching clocks and, if necessary, to come up with a plan for a revision. \nBefore the vote, members of the European Parliament debated the issue, with voices both for and against a change in the law. \nFrench lawmaker Karima Delli said the shift to summer time left people tired, causing traffic accidents. \nBut Belgian lawmaker Hilde Vautmans argued that eliminating the clock change would mean either losing an hour of light at the end of the day for seven months in summer, or sending children to school in the dark for five months in winter. \nOutside the EU, a handful of European countries have stopped switching between summer and winter time, including Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland.
