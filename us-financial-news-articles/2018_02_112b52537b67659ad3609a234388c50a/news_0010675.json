That cap could evolve over time.”\nThe EU should consider the impact of additional global bank capital standards approved in December on financing sustainable projects before putting them into law, the expert group said.\n“This report is just the beginning,” European Commission Vice Presidents Valdis Dombrovskis and Jyrki Katainen said in the report’s introduction.\n“As part of our work to build a true Capital Markets Union, we will come forward in March of this year with a broad Action Plan on sustainable finance, building on the recommendations in this report,” they wrote.\nThe expert group also said Brussels should encourage markets to focus on long-term goals not short-term gain.\nThe bloc should also introduce an official EU Green Bond standard to help the market develop more fully, the group said.\nGreen funds had around 145 billion euros of assets under management in 2016, against 3.1 trillion invested in European bonds and 3.4 trillion in equity funds, the group said in an earlier report.\nThe EU aims to cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030, for which it estimates about 180 billion euros ($212 billion) in additional low-carbon investments are needed per year.\nBrussels plans to introduce a legal obligation for asset managers to consider environmental risks when investing client funds.\nReporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:06:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
