But it has also stressed the need to ramp up sanctions to force North Korea to give up development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, said North Korea presented “a potentially existential” threat to the United States and said time was running out to act on the threat.\n“Decision time is becoming ever closer in terms of how we respond to this,” Coats told a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. “Our goal is a peaceful settlement. We are using maximum pressure on North Korea in various ways.”\nCIA Director Mike Pompeo told the same hearing there was “no indication there’s any strategic change” in Kim’s desire to retain a nuclear threat to the United States.\nCoats said in an annual threat assessment report that North Korea was likely to continue weapons testing in 2018 and noted that it had said it was considering an atmospheric nuclear test. The report said Pyongyang’s repeated statements that nuclear weapons were the basis for its survival “suggest the regime does not intend to negotiate them away”.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said earlier on Tuesday that the United States was open to talking with North Korea.\n“The United States sees inter-Korean dialogue in a positive light and has expressed its openness for talks with the North,” his spokesman Quote: d Moon as telling Latvian President Raimonds Vējonis.\nThat sentiment was repeated by Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said Moon had agreed it was necessary to keep up maximum pressure on North Korea.\nLast year, North Korea conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. resolutions as it pursues its goal of developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States.\nJapanese officials were at pains to stress there was no daylight between Japan, the United States and South Korea on their approach to dealing with North Korea.\nFILE PHOTO: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects a newly established Pyongyang trackless trolley factory in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on February 1, 2018. KCNA/via REUTERS “The goal is denuclearization and the process is dialogue for dialogue, action for action, so if North Korea does not show actions, the United States and Japan will not change their policies,” a senior Japanese diplomat told lawmakers.\nPompeo said last month that North Korea could be only “a handful of months” away from being able make a nuclear attack on the United States.\nWhile stressing its preference for a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis, the United States has warned that all options on are on the table, including military ones, to prevent this, although talk of preventative military strikes has eased since the Koreas resumed dialogue last month.\nA senior South Korean military official stationed at the border between North and South Korea told Reuters North Korea has lowered the volume of its border propaganda broadcasts since the Olympics’ opening ceremony on Feb. 9.\nFeb 10, 2018; Gangneung, South Korea; Kim Yo-jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during women's ice hockey Group B play between Switzerland and Korea in the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Kwandong Hockey Centre.
