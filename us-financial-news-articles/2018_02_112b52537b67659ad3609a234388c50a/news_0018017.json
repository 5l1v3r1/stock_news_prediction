We will keep the finances stable. There will be no new debts, but also no tax increases.”\nWriting by Paul Carrel; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:54:30.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
