But relations between the junta and the United States have improved under President Donald Trump.\nThe presence of the 6,800 U.S. personnel - nearly double last year’s number - was a demonstration of America’s continuing muscle in a region where China is growing ever more powerful.\nThe Cobra Gold military exercise has been held for more than three decades. This year’s Cobra Gold will be attended by some 11,075 personnel from 29 countries.\nSoldiers attend opening ceremony of Cobra Gold, Asia's largest annual multilateral military exercise, outside Bangkok, Thailand February 13, 2018.

It speaks to the commitment of the U.S. in the region,” Steve Castonguay, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, told Reuters.\nThis year’s exercise has been marked by Thailand’s controversial invitation to Myanmar, where 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled military action that the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing in response to insurgent attacks.\nSlideshow (13 Images) Castonguay confirmed an army major from Myanmar was attending the opening ceremony but that Myanmar would not participate in any military drills.\nThe United States has pushed for the restoration of democracy in Thailand, its oldest regional ally.\nPrime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had promised an election would take place in November this year, but the junta last month said it could be delayed until February 2019 - which would be the latest of several postponements.\nWriting by Patpicha Tanakasempipat; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Matthew Tostevin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T07:02:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
