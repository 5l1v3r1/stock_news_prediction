I cannot be satisfied with that. I was never 1.2 seconds behind in the entire season,” Mayer told Austrian TV station ORF.\n“Especially in the middle part of the course I lost too much time, but it seems that that was the case for a lot of us,” he added.\nReporting by Mitch Phillips, Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:53:07.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
