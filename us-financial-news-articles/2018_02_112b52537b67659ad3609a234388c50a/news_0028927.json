Henkin’s lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe case is Forman v Henkin, New York State Court of Appeals, No. 1.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T21:05:14.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
