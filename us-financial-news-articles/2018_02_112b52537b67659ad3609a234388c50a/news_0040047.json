The freshman guard also collected seven rebounds and a game-high five assists.\nReid Travis recorded a double-double for the Cardinal with 13 points and a game-high 10 rebounds, while Pickens finished with 17 points and Michael Humphrey finished with 11.\nStanford won despite committing 16 turnovers.\nColeman led Cal with 17 points, while Marcus Lee grabbed a team-high nine rebounds to complement 15 points for the Bears, who had won their most recent home game 74-70 over Oregon State.\nSueing had 15 points and Juhwan Harris-Dyson 13 for Cal, which shot just 37.1 percent from the field and connected on just three of its 18 3-point attempts.\nThe Bears entered the game as the Pac-12’s worst team in field goal percentage, 3-point percentage and scoring.\nStanford built its one-point halftime lead on the strength of Davis’ 3-pointer and two free throws in the final minute of the first period.\nThe Cardinal led by as many as eight in the half, coming initially when Humphrey and Pickens hit 3-pointers in an 8-0, game-opening run.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:53:40.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
