The school will also rescind Cosby's honorary degree.\nThe school says it has been a century since it took away an honorary degree but that \"credible\" allegations against the men warranted the action.\nThe Wall Street Journal last week reported that a number of women said they were harassed or assaulted by Wynn, with one case leading to a $7.5 million settlement.
