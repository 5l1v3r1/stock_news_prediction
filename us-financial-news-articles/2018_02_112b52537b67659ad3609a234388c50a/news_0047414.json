(OTCPINK:TMED) today reported its financial results for its quarter ending on December 31, 2017.\nFor the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017, Trimedyne had revenues of $1,534,000, an increase of 40% from revenues of $1,094,000 for the prior year quarter. We had a net income for the current quarter of $86,000 or $0.70 per share, as compared to a net loss of $225,000 or $1.83 per share for the prior year quarter. This 138% increase in net income as compared to the prior year quarter is a considerable improvement, which was primarily the result of an increase in our sales revenue and the continuation of our cost controls.\nAt the end of the quarter on December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,047,000, which included $576,000 in customer deposits for future orders, as compared to $200,000 of deposits at the end of the prior fiscal year.\nCommenting on the financial results for the quarter, Marvin P. Loeb, Sc.D., Chairman of Trimedyne, said: “Since we are no longer required to file periodic reports with the SEC, our Financial Statements are un-audited. However, we believe our Financial Statements have been prepared and contain all adjustments of a recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of our operations and financial condition for the period and dates shown in the financial statements attached herein.\nWe appreciate the patience of our shareholders, and we are working hard to improve our financial condition.”\nTRIMEDYNE, INC.
