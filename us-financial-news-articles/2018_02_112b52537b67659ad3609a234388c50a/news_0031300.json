After annual management reviews and training, potential incomes can range from $60,000- $100,000 per year. \nThe budget proposal recommendations are based on a 2016 report that said “there is a mismatch in some areas [of the Weather Service] between workforce and workload” and “that the current distribution of staff across the country can evolve.” \nAll totaled, the Weather Service faces cuts of $75 million in the initial proposal. Some or all of those cuts could be jettisoned before the bill is voted upon.
