Treasuries have been very quiet today so the auction came in on the screws,” said Justin Lederer, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.\nThe auction showed direct bidders, or large institutions that buy Treasuries directly from the government, taking 12.7 percent, the highest since August 2017.\nIndirect bidders, meaning institutions that buy through an intermediary, took 58 percent of the offer, the smallest since April 2017. Dealers took 29.3 percent.\nThe percentage taken by dealers, which are required to buy unbid supply, was just below the average of the past four auctions.\nFOREIGN DEMAND IN FOCUS The smaller share of indirect bidders may signal weaker foreign demand, as that share has historically been seen as a proxy for overseas buying.\n“There is still some relationship there,” said Aaron Kohli, interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.\nForeign banks are a significant buyer of U.S. Treasuries, so any decrease in that demand would impact the United States’ fundraising capacity.\n“Indirect demand was kind of weak,” said Kohli of Wednesday’s five-year auction. “We’ve been noticing some Japanese outflows, which were probably based on the inability to hedge that exposure … The real strength came from direct buyers, which in a vacuum, I’d peg as large domestic money managers.”\nInvestors will now focus on the sale of $28 billion of seven-year notes on Thursday.\n“The seven-year is a good level for a lot of these foreign accounts to participate in, so we’ll be watching very closely,” said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.\nThe yield on the seven-year note was last at 2.869 percent, near its highest level since April 2011.\nThe five-year notes sold at a yield of 2.658 percent versus 2.660 percent at the bid’s close, with a 2.44 bid-to-cover ratio.\nThat ratio, which indicates the demand for an offering relative to the number of investor bids, hit the average of the past four auctions despite the increased issuance size.\nThe five-year Treasury yield was initially little changed following the auction. It later climbed to 2.689 percent, its highest level since April 2010, after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting showed confidence in the need to keep raising interest rates.\nThe five-year auction followed an issuance of two-year floating rate notes earlier on Wednesday to weak demand. The 2.75 bid-to-cover ratio was the lowest on record since the issue was introduced in January 2014, according to Tom Simons, senior money market economist at Jefferies LLC in New York.\nExpectations the Fed could raise interest rates as many as four times in 2018 had helped propel the two-year Treasury yield to a nine-year high of 2.282 percent in overnight trading.
