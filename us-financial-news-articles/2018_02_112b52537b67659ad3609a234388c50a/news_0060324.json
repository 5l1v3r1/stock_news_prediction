Melrose shareholders are due to vote at a March 8 meeting on the potential acquisition and the turnaround specialist’s plan to issue shares to help to finance a deal for GKN. But PIRC, which advises institutional investors, has warned Melrose shareholders in a Feb. 27 report that “various issues surrounding” its bid mean they should oppose the proposed takeover at the forthcoming vote. The board of GKN, a mainstay of the British engineering sector and manufacturer of parts for the Eurofighter Typhoon and Black Hawk helicopters among others, spurned Melrose’s cash-and-paper bid last month, prompting the suitor to turn hostile and take its offer directly to GKN investors. The battle between GKN and Melrose has quickly escalated into a war of words and has also prompted some lawmakers to raise national security concerns. Melrose typically breaks up companies once it has improved their performance and some British lawmakers are worried that parts of GKN involved in defense programs could be sold on to a foreign buyer. PIRC has highlighted to investors that Melrose’s decision to go hostile means that it “has not benefited from the co-operation of the GKN board”. The adviser also said that “significant political and other considerations, including security concerns” have been raised and that Melrose has reported annual losses two years running. However, PIRC’s opposition conflicts with a recommendation made by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), another influential investor adviser. “Given the sensible strategic rationale, (Melrose‘s) turnaround track record and reasonable valuation, approval of the acquisition is warranted,” ISS said in a note circulated to clients last week. A Melrose spokeswoman said: “Melrose has always been highly focused on engaging with its shareholders to secure their ongoing support, including in relation to its offer for GKN.” Reporting by Ben Martin, Carolyn Cohn and Simon Jessop; Editing by David Goodman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T17:26:31.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
