Broadcom shares were up 1 percent at $238. \n“Qualcomm and its board now have a tough decision as this is a compelling offer in our opinion,” said analyst Daniel Ives of GBH Insights. \nIn what would be the largest tech deal in history, Broadcom said it was willing to increase the cash part of the deal if the transaction is not completed within a year after any definitive agreement, and would pay Qualcomm a significant “reverse termination fee” if regulators scuttle the deal. \nBroadcom could pay a break-up fee of up to $10 billion to Qualcomm, CNBC reported citing sources. \nQualcomm said it would review the revised proposal and will have no further comment on the proposal until its board has completed its review. \nBroadcom said it remained confident that the deal would be completed within 12 months following a definitive agreement. \nQualcomm had said that the regulatory review processes required around the world would take much longer. \nAny deal between the two companies would attract significant scrutiny across several countries where they operate. A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen, as chip maker Broadcom Ltd announced an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake \nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission last month made a second request for information on Broadcom’s bid. \nThe new offer also puts pressure on Qualcomm to either buy NXP Semiconductors NV at $110 per share or terminate the $38 billion deal. \nNXP shareholders had held up a deal, saying it undervalued the company and had sought a price as high as $135. \nIf Qualcomm accepts Broadcom’s offer, it would have to drop the NXP bid as it is unlikely that NXP shareholders would accept the original price after clamoring for a higher price. \nNXP shares were slightly down at $119.83. \nIn November, Qualcomm rejected Broadcom’s $70 per share cash-and-stock bid that valued it at $103 billion. \nQualcomm had said Broadcom’s offer significantly undervalued the company. \nReuters reported exclusively on Sunday that Broadcom had planned to raise its offer. \nAfter Qualcomm rejected its earlier offer, Broadcom and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners took the offer hostile by nominating 11 directors to its board in December. Qualcomm later rejected the nominees. \nShareholders will vote for or against the nominees at an annual meeting on March 6. \nSingapore-based Broadcom is known for its connectivity chips used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers and Qualcomm provides chips to mobile carrier networks to deliver broadband and data - a business that will benefit significantly due to the roll out of 5G wireless technology. \nAccenture has estimated that wireless operators will invest as much as $275 billion in the United States alone over seven years as they build out 5G.
