It’s more about skiing it better than it is about taking risks. The risk isn’t going to be a reward here.” \nHe was followed by Norwegian medal contender Kjetil Jansrud (1:40.76) with Swiss Mauro Caviezel third fastest (1:40.90) and defending champion Matthias Mayer just off podium pace in fourth (1:41.20). \n“It was a little bit slower than I expected but it’s a really nice downhill,” said Austrian Mayer, who skied the race of his life to win gold in Sochi four years ago. \n“I think everyone wants to be fast here but I‘m feeling good in my mood.” \nBeat Feuz, the reigning downhill world champion after his triumph in St. Moritz last year, was 15th quickest in 1:41.86 and thought the conditions could make for some fast times on Sunday. \n“It’s a very fine slope. It’s cold, which is good for the piste. It’s a slope where a lot of people can ski very fast,” said the Swiss. \nThe course, the ninth designed by 1972 Olympic champion Bernhard Russi, was first used for a men’s World Cup race in 2016 and is less dramatic than some of the classic European runs like Kitzbuehel’s Hahnenkamm. \nIt features four large jumps that will test the skiers’ technique and aerodynamics, and its relative shortness will punish any mistakes because any time lost will be next to impossible to make up. \nAfter a World Cup race on the course in 2016, it was suggested by some of the skiers that it would favour the more technical skills of the Super G specialists. \nAdjustments have been made since, however, and Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal said that might no longer be the case. \n”Snow’s good, the course looks good,“ the 35-year-old said. ”It’s easy in the sense that we haven’t seen many crashes today but it’s not easy to go fast. \n“I think it’s going to favour the downhillers because you need to have those ‘be gentle with the snow skills’ but this is the Olympics, we always get some surprises.” Additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan and Rory Carroll, editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T07:29:34.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
