The video was filmed in Aokigahara, a Japanese forest known for an enormous amount of suicides that have taken place there.\nThe clip, which was taken down following an immediate backlash, ignited controversy for both the YouTube star and the website itself. Paul subsequently apologized for his actions in a post on Twitter, and YouTube removed him from its Google Preferred platform .\nPG | Bauer-Griffin | GC Images Logan Paul is seen on August 08, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. Wojcicki did not refer to the Logan Paul incident directly, but said that the misbehavior of some creators could put the broader YouTube community in a negative light.\n\"While these instances are rare, they can damage the reputation and revenue of your fellow creators, so we want to make sure we have policies in place that allow us to respond appropriately,\" she said.\nProminent channels, such as popular commentator Philip DeFranco and comedian Ethan Klein of H3H3 , have complained of unfair \"demonetization\" of videos by the media service. As YouTube has clamped down on channels that publish offensive and inappropriate content, some creators appear to have suffered due to its new restrictive policies on what content qualifies for monetization.\nEarlier this month, YouTube moved to introduce even more restrictive requirements for content creators that meant channels with less than 4,000 hours of \"watchtime\" over a 12-month period and fewer than 1,000 subscribers would not qualify for advertising revenue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:30:15.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
