Kuroda made the remark when asked by a lawmaker whether the BOJ would conduct an assessment of why its policy had failed to accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target. He reiterated the BOJ’s resolve to maintain its massive monetary stimulus with inflation distant from its target. The BOJ revamped its policy framework to one targeting interest rates from the pace of money printing in 2016, after three years of heavy asset buying failed to fire up inflation.
