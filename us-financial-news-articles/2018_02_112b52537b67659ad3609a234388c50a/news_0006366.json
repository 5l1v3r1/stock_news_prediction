Whether this disputed issue can be resolved is an important indicator of how Taiwan people will view the future direction of relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,” Taiwan’s China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement late Wednesday.\n“We again call on the Chinese side to treasure the hard won peace and stability of relations between the two sides. China needs to carry out measures to make up for this deficiency, in order to avoid this issue continuing to grow and ferment.”\nTaiwan says the new routes, which run near two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands which sit close to China, are a threat to aviation safety and were opened by China without Taiwan’s approval, contravening previous agreements.\nChina considers Taiwan a wayward province, and relations have cooled dramatically since Tsai Ing-wen of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office as Taiwan’s president in 2016.\nReporting by Jess Macy Yu; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:29:58.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
