Afriflora produces over 1.1bn roses a year, cultivated from its farmland in Ethiopia.\nMoody’s assigned Flamingo a B2 corporate rating earlier this month, citing positive free cash flow at the business due to reduced capex requirements following years of notable investment.\nThe ratings agency forecast Flamingo’s adjusted net leverage at 4.5 times for 2017 year-end, also noting some €10m of cash on balance sheet.\nSun previously bought Finlays Fresh produce in 2015, subsequently rebranding it Flamingo.\nFlamingo is the second largest supplier of flowers and vegetables in the UK, according to banking sources.\nIt is issuing the debt through Zara UK Midco Limited.\nEditing by Christopher Mangham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:16:15.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
