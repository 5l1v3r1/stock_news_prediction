The 10 were detained on Jan. 25, along with 77 other foreigners, in a raid on an event called the “Pub Crawl or Let’s Get Wet” in Siem Reap province, home to the ancient Angkor Wat ruins. The Siem Reap Provincial Court, which has deported the nine, had dropped all charges, Yin Srang, the court’s spokesman, said. “The charges against the nine people have been dropped,” Yin Srang told Reuters. Yin Srang said the remaining suspect is a British national.
