The Department of Justice has also been informed,” it said.\nProsecutors in Germany have also been investigating whether Airbus issued bribes to win the $2 billion contract. Airbus denies the charges.\nOn Friday, German prosecutors ordered Airbus to pay 81 million euros ($99 million) to settle the German investigation.\nAustria is seeking up to 1.1 billion euros in compensation.\nReporting by Kirsti Knolle; Writing by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Victoria Bryan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T18:41:16.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
