At SouthCrest, they will find we are there to help them meet their financial goals and needs.”\nGrimes, a Fayette County resident for more than 15 years, began her banking career as a teller 20 years ago and has steadily advanced. Happily married for 22 years to husband Robert, they have two children, Raven and Robert Jr.\nABOUT SOUTHCREST BANK\nSouthCrest Financial Group, Inc. is a bank holding company with over half a billion dollars in assets, headquartered in Atlanta, GA.
