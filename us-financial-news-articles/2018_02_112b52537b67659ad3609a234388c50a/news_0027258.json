The bottle of craft beer dropped back down to Earth via parachute landing intact only 55 miles away from launch point.\nIn 1996, BridgePort launched the first IPA in the Pacific Northwest igniting Oregonian's taste buds with an intensity of hops never experienced before.\n\"The richness of the region's hop fields inspired BridgePort and set the benchmark for the IPA style,\" said Gregor Mina, Director of Marketing. \"Hop boundaries were pushed way out and we felt it would be fun to send the brew that helped shape the category 'way out there' into space and mark another first for BridgePort IPA.\"\nThe BridgePort Brewery and BrewPub are located at 1313 NW Marshall Street in Portland, Oregon. It is open from Sunday to Wednesday 11:30 – 10 pm and Thursday through Saturday 11:30 – 11 pm. The renovated BrewPub's work was directed by Portland-based design firm Moore Arch Designs using supplies and recycled materials from local artisans. It prides itself on excellent food and great service.\nTo view the BridgePort IPA space exploration see below:\n60 second\nFull version\nAbout BridgePort Brewing\nFounded in 1984, BridgePort is Oregon's original craft brewery.
