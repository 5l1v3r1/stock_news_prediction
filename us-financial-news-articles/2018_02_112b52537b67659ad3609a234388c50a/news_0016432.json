GAAP operating income was $26.0 million , or 12.7% of total revenues and non-GAAP operating income was $36.3 million , or 17.7% of total revenues. GAAP earnings per diluted share (EPS) was $0.45 . Non-GAAP EPS was $0.62 . Cash flows from operations were $24.4 million . Full year 2017 financial results: Total revenues grew four percent year-over-year to a record high of $789.6 million, exceeding expectations. GAAP operating income was $105.7 million , or 13.4% of total revenues and non-GAAP operating income was $142.1 million , or 18.0% of total revenues. GAAP EPS was $1.87 Non-GAAP EPS was $2.51, in line with expectations. Cash flows from operations were $127.2 million, exceeding expectations. CSG declared its quarterly cash dividend of $0.1975 per share of common stock, or a total of approximately $7 million , to shareholders, bringing the total 2017 dividends to approximately $27 million . In February 2018, CSG’s Board of Directors approved an approximately 6% increase in CSG’s cash dividend, effective with the first quarterly payment of $0.21 per share of common stock. During the fourth quarter, CSG converted over 700,000 customer accounts onto its cloud solutions for a total of approximately 4.2 million conversions for the year.\n“We executed well against our plan in 2017 and have put ourselves in a strong position for 2018 and beyond,” said Bret Griess, president and chief executive officer for CSG. “We grew four times faster than the market, extended and expanded our relationships with two of our largest clients, consolidated the remaining Comcast residential customers that were on a competitor’s solution onto our hybrid cloud platform, doubled the revenues that we generate from our managed services offering and still returned 50 percent of our free cash flows to shareholders. Our investments in our solutions and our people uniquely position us to help service providers successfully undertake their digital transformation so that they can thrive with new business models going forward.”\nFinancial Overview (unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\nQuarter Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Percent Percent 2017 2016 Changed 2017 2016 Changed Revenues $ 205,204 $ 195,169 5 % $ 789,582 $ 760,958 4 % GAAP Results: Operating Income $ 26,048 $ 25,366 3 % $ 105,685 $ 132,629 (20 %) Operating Margin 12.7 % 13.0 % — 13.4 % 17.4 % — EPS $ 0.45 $ 0.38 18 % $ 1.87 $ 1.90 (2 %) Non-GAAP Results: Operating Income $ 36,343 $ 33,789 8 % $ 142,127 $ 164,329 (14 %) Operating Margin 17.7 % 17.3 % — 18.0 % 21.6 % — EPS $ 0.62 $ 0.57 9 % $ 2.51 $ 2.79 (10 %) For additional information and reconciliations regarding CSG’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the attached Exhibit 2 and the Investor Relations section of CSG’s website at www.csgi.com .\nResults of Operations\nRevenues: Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $205.2 million, a 5% increase when compared to revenues of $195.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and a 3% increase when compared to revenues of $199.2 million for the third quarter of 2017. Total revenues for the full year 2017 were $789.6 million, a 4% increase when compared to revenues of $761.0 million for the full year 2016.\nThe increases in revenues can be mainly attributed to the growth in CSG’s cloud and related solutions revenues, resulting primarily from the conversion of customer accounts onto our cloud solutions over the past year and increases in revenues from recurring managed services arrangements, with these year-over-year increases reduced by lower software and services revenues generated during those periods.\nGAAP Results: GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $26.0 million, or 12.7% of total revenues, compared to $25.4 million, or 13.0% of total revenues, for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $28.4 million, or 14.2% of total revenues, for the third quarter of 2017. The sequential quarterly decrease in GAAP operating income is mainly due to higher restructuring and reorganization charges incurred during the current quarter.\nGAAP EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.45, as compared to $0.38 for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $0.44 for the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS is primarily due to decreased non-operating expense, due mainly to foreign currency, and a lower effective income tax rate. The sequential quarterly increase in GAAP EPS is primarily attributed to a lower effective income tax rate, resulting from the enactment of the US Tax Cut and Jobs Act (US Tax Reform) executed in the fourth quarter of 2017 (see additional discussion below).\nGAAP operating income for the full year 2017 was $105.7 million, or 13.4% of total revenues, compared to $132.6 million, or 17.4% of total revenues for the full year 2016. GAAP EPS for the full year 2017 was $1.87 compared to $1.90 for the full year 2016. The year-over-year decreases in GAAP operating income margin and GAAP EPS are primarily due to lower operating results, driven mainly by the increase in planned investments that began late in 2016 and continued through 2017, aimed at generating future long-term growth in our business.\nNon-GAAP Results: Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $36.3 million, or 17.7% of total revenues, compared to $33.8 million, or 17.3% of total revenues, for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $36.5 million, or 18.3% of total revenues for the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in operating income is driven primarily by the higher revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.62, compared to $0.57 for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $0.64 for the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP EPS was driven primarily by higher revenues and decreased non-operating expense, due mainly to foreign currency.\nNon-GAAP operating income for the full year 2017 was $142.3 million, or 18.0% of total revenues, compared to $164.3 million, or 21.6% of total revenues for the full year 2016. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year 2017 was $2.51 compared to $2.79 for the full year 2016. The decreases in the full year 2017 non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS are primarily due to lower operating results, driven mainly by the increase in planned investments that began late in 2016 and continued through 2017, aimed at generating future long-term growth in our business.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2017 were $261.4 million, compared to $258.5 million as of September 30, 2017 and $276.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nCSG generated net cash flows from operations for the fourth quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $24.4 million and $24.7 million, respectively, and had non-GAAP free cash flow of $18.8 million and $22.0 million, respectively. CSG generated net cash flows from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $127.2 million and $84.2 million, respectively, and had non-GAAP free cash flow of $98.3 million and $69.9 million, respectively.\nUS Tax Reform\nCSG recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter from the remeasurement of US-based net deferred tax liabilities as required under the US Tax Reform enacted in December 2017, which provided approximately $0.06 of GAAP EPS benefit for both the current quarter and full year results. This tax benefit did not impact our non-GAAP EPS for either the quarter or the full year as this benefit was excluded from our non-GAAP results as an unusual, one-time income tax benefit.\nIn addition, we currently expect both our GAAP and non-GAAP effective income tax rates for 2018 to be in the range of 26%-28% as a result of the US Tax Reform, an improvement of 10 to 11 percentage points for 2018 had the new legislation not been enacted.\nSummary of 2018 Financial Guidance\nCSG’s financial guidance for the full year 2018 is as follows:\nGAAP Measures: Revenues $795 - $815 million Operating Margin Percentage 14.5% EPS $2.15 - $2.28 Cash Flows from Operating Activities $120 - $140 million Non-GAAP Measures: Operating Margin Percentage 17.5% EPS $2.76 - $2.89 For additional information and reconciliations regarding CSG’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the attached Exhibit 2 and the Investor Relations section of CSG’s website at www.csgi.com .\nConference Call\nCSG will host a conference call on Wednesday, February 7, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, to discuss CSG’s fourth quarter and full year results for 2017.

CSG believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with its GAAP financial measures, provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by CSG’s management in its financial and operational decision making. CSG uses these non-GAAP financial measures for the following purposes:\nCertain internal financial planning, reporting, and analysis; Forecasting and budgeting; Certain management compensation incentives; and Communications with CSG’s Board of Directors, stockholders, financial analysts, and investors.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided with the intent of providing investors with the following information:\nA more complete understanding of CSG’s underlying operational results, trends, and cash generating capabilities; Consistency and comparability with CSG’s historical financial results; and Comparability to similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not measures of performance under GAAP, and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. Limitations with the use of non-GAAP financial measures include the following items:\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles; The way in which CSG calculates non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the way in which other companies calculate similar non-GAAP financial measures; Non-GAAP financial measures do not include all items of income and expense that affect CSG’s operations and that are required by GAAP to be included in financial statements; Certain adjustments to CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures result in the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in CSG’s financial statements in future periods; and Certain charges excluded from CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures are cash expenses, and therefore do impact CSG’s cash position.\nCSG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement only. Additionally, CSG provides specific information regarding the treatment of GAAP amounts considered in preparing the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciles each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: Basis of Presentation\nThe table below outlines the exclusions from CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures:\nNon-GAAP Exclusions Operating\nIncome EPS\nRestructuring and reorganization charges X X Acquisition-related charges X X Stock-based compensation X X Amortization of acquired intangible assets X X Amortization of original issue discount (“OID”) — X Gain (loss) on repurchase of convertible notes — X Unusual income tax matters — X CSG believes that excluding certain items in calculating its non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding CSG’s performance and these items are excluded for the following reasons:\nRestructuring and reorganization charges are expenses that result from cost reduction initiatives and/or significant changes to CSG’s business, to include such things as involuntary employee terminations, changes in management structure, divestitures of businesses, facility consolidations and abandonments, and fundamental reorganizations impacting operational focus and direction. These charges are not considered reflective of CSG’s recurring core business operating results. The exclusion of these items in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s current financial results with historical and future periods. Acquisition-related charges relate to direct and incremental expenses related to business acquisitions, and thus, are not considered reflective of CSG’s recurring core business operating results. These charges typically include expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services. The exclusion of these charges in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s current financial results with historical and future periods. Stock-based compensation results from CSG’s issuance of equity awards to its employees under incentive compensation programs. The amount of this incentive compensation in any period is not generally linked to the level of performance by employees or CSG. The exclusion of these expenses in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to evaluate the non-cash expense related to compensation included in CSG’s results of operations, and therefore, the exclusion of this item allows investors to further evaluate the cash generating capabilities of CSG’s business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is the result of business acquisitions. A portion of the purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to acquired intangible assets (e.g., software, client relationships, etc.), which are then amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives. This annual amortization expense is generally unchanged from the initial estimates, regardless of performance of the acquired business in any one period. Also, the value assigned to acquired intangible assets in a business combination is based on various estimates and valuation techniques, and does not necessarily represent the costs CSG would incur to develop such capabilities internally. Additionally, amortization of acquired intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency, and can be significantly affected by the timing and size of an acquisition. The exclusion of these expenses in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to evaluate the non-cash expense related to acquisitions included in CSG’s results of operations, and therefore, the exclusion of this item allows investors to further evaluate the cash generating capabilities of CSG’s business. The convertible notes OID is the result of allocating a portion of the principal balance of the debt at issuance to the equity component of the instrument, as required under current accounting rules. This OID is then amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective convertible debt instrument. The interest expense related to the amortization of the OID is a non-cash expense, and therefore, the exclusion of this item allows investors to further evaluate the cash interest costs of CSG’s convertible notes for cash flow, liquidity, and debt service purposes. Gains and losses related to the repurchase of CSG’s convertible notes are not considered reflective of CSG’s recurring core business operating results. Any resulting gain or loss on the repurchase of CSG’s convertible notes is non-cash income or expense, and therefore, the exclusion of this item allows investors to further evaluate the cash impact of these repurchases for cash flow and liquidity purposes. In addition, the exclusion of these gains and losses in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP EPS allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s current operating results with historical and future periods. Unusual items within CSG’s quarterly and/or annual income tax expense can occur from such things as income tax accounting timing matters, income taxes related to unusual events, or as a result of different treatment of certain items for book accounting and income tax purposes. Consideration of such items in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s current financial results with historical and future periods.\nCSG also reports non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP free cash flow. Management believes non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to investors in evaluating CSG’s operating performance, debt servicing capabilities, and enterprise valuation. CSG defines non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, foreign currency transaction adjustments, and unusual items, such as restructuring and reorganization charges, and gains and losses related to the repurchase of CSG’s convertible notes, as discussed above. Additionally, management uses non-GAAP free cash flow, among other measures, to assess its financial performance and cash generating capabilities, and believes that it is useful to investors because it shows CSG’s cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase its common stock, pay cash dividends, and fund ongoing operations. CSG defines non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less the purchases of property and equipment.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP Operating Income:\nThe reconciliations of GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income for the indicated periods are as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 % of % of Amounts Revenues Amounts Revenues GAAP operating income $ 26,048 12.7 % $ 25,366 13.0 % Restructuring and reorganization charges (1) 4,199 2.0 % 1,017 0.5 % Stock-based compensation (1) 4,438 2.2 % 5,443 2.8 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 1,658 0.8 % 1,963 1.0 % Non-GAAP operating income $ 36,343 17.7 % $ 33,789 17.3 % Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 % of % of Amounts Revenues Amounts Revenues GAAP operating income $ 105,685 13.4 % $ 132,629 17.4 % Restructuring and reorganization charges (1) 8,796 1.1 % 416 0.1 % Stock-based compensation (1) 20,782 2.6 % 22,795 3.0 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 6,864 0.9 % 8,489 1.1 % Non-GAAP operating income $ 142,127 18.0 % $ 164,329 21.6 % (1) Stock-based compensation included in the tables above and following excludes amounts that have been recorded in restructuring and reorganization charges.

Non-GAAP EPS:\nThe reconciliations of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP EPS for the indicated periods are as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amounts EPS (3) Amounts EPS (3) GAAP net income $ 14,966 $ 0.45 $ 12,647 $ 0.38 GAAP income tax provision (2) 6,705 6,814 GAAP income before income taxes 21,671 19,461 Restructuring and reorganization charges (1) 4,199 1,017 Stock-based compensation (1) 4,438 5,443 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 1,658 1,963 Amortization of OID 643 1,010 Non-GAAP income before income taxes 32,609 28,894 Non-GAAP income tax provision (2) (12,036 ) (10,037 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 20,573 $ 0.62 $ 18,857 $ 0.57 Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amounts EPS (3) Amounts EPS (3) GAAP net income $ 61,364 $ 1.87 $ 62,882 $ 1.90 GAAP income tax provision (2) 26,346 37,117 GAAP income before income taxes 87,710 99,999 Restructuring and reorganization charges (1) 8,796 416 Stock-based compensation (1) 20,782 22,795 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 6,864 8,489 Loss on repurchase of convertible notes - 8,651 Amortization of OID 2,790 4,866 Non-GAAP income before income taxes 126,942 145,216 Non-GAAP income tax provision (2) (44,430 ) (53,076 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 82,512 $ 2.51 $ 92,140 $ 2.79 (2) For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 the GAAP effective income tax rates were approximately 31% and 30%, respectively, and the non-GAAP effective income tax rates were approximately 37% and 35%, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP effective income tax rates relates primarily to: (i) an income tax benefit of approximately $2 million recorded in the fourth quarter from the remeasurement of US-based net deferred tax liabilities as required under the US Tax Reform legislation enacted in December 2017, which was not included in the non-GAAP effective income tax rate; and (ii) the timing treatment of the net income tax benefit from Comcast’s exercise of their vested stock warrants in January 2017. The net income tax benefit from the exercise of the warrants was spread ratably across 2017 in the non-GAAP effective income tax rate; however, the entire amount of the benefit was recorded as a discrete item, as required by GAAP, in the first quarter. For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 the GAAP and non-GAAP effective income tax rates were approximately 35% and 37%, respectively. (3) The outstanding diluted shares for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were 33.0 million and 32.9 million, respectively, and for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 were 32.9 million 33.0 million, respectively.
