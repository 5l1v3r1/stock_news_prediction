Analysts on average had expected $4.51 billion. \nDisney’s cable division has been under pressure from viewers switching to streaming services such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s Prime, or what the industry calls “cord-cutting”. \nAs a counter, Disney said in August it would develop its own streaming services to grab digital viewers who are dumping traditional television. The company is also pulling new movies from Netflix, starting in 2019. \nDisney to boost its digital offerings said in December it would buy the film, television and international businesses of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc for $52.4 billion in stock. \nA deal would also give Disney majority control of Netflix rival Hulu, which is also partially owned by Comcast Corp and Time Warner Inc. \nDisney has been adding ESPN to smaller, cheaper bundles of channels delivered online in order to reach more consumers. \nNet income attributable to the company rose to $4.42 billion, or $2.91 per share, in the first quarter ended Dec. 30 from $2.48 billion, or $1.55 per share. \nThe media conglomerate recorded a $1.6 billion gain due to recent changes to the U.S. tax law. \nExcluding items, it earned $1.89 per share, beating analysts average estimate of $1.61. \nDisney’s revenue rose 3.8 percent to $15.35 billion. \nAnalysts on average had expected a revenue of $15.46 billion.
