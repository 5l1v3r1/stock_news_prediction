Although he says he is pleased with the company's progress so far, Khosrowshahi cautioned that the San Francisco company still has a long way to go to win back the trust of its consumers and drivers.\nHe made his remarks during a late Wednesday appearance at a technology conference hosted by Goldman Sachs.\nKhosrowshahi also predicted that Uber will be well on the way to turning a profit by time make an initial public offering of its stock next year, despite a $4.5 billion loss last year.\n10 a.m.\nRide-hailing giant Uber's full-year net loss widened to $4.5 billion in 2017 as the company endured a tumultuous year that included multiple scandals and the replacement of its CEO.\nThe results also showed that Uber cut its fourth-quarter net loss by 25 percent from the third quarter as its new CEO moves to make the company profitable before a planned public stock sale sometime next year.\nThe full-year loss grew from $2.8 billion in 2016, but that year was skewed by a gain from the sale of Uber's business in China. Uber also said its U.S. ride-hailing market share fell from 82 percent at the start of last year to 70 percent in the fourth quarter.
