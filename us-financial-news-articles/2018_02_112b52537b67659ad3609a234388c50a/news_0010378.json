Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net MORNING CALL: SELL-OFF TO SPREAD TO EUROPE (0618 GMT) Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. European stocks are in for a turbulent start to the week after a sharp sell-off in Asian shares overnight, with fears of resurgent inflation taking their toll on markets near record high levels. Asian shares fell the most in more than a year, tracking a much weaker Wall Street session after Friday's U.S. payrolls report showed wages growing at their fastest pace in more than 8 years. Spreadbetters call the DAX 153 points lower at 12,632.4, the CAC 40 down 64 points at 5,300.7, and the FTSE down 79 points at 7,364.
