But a recent Reuters poll showed more than half of Japanese firms do not plan to raise base pay in annual wages talks this year.\nTokyo area’s core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, likely rose 0.8 percent in February from a year ago, led by energy costs and up only marginally from 0.7 percent in January.\nThe internal affairs ministry will announce the core CPI for Tokyo and jobs data at 8:30 a.m. on March 2, Friday (2330 GMT on Thursday).\nThe government started publishing the nationwide and Tokyo CPI data on different dates starting this month.\nData showed on Friday the nationwide core CPI index rose 0.9 percent in January from a year earlier.\nReporting by Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Kim Coghill\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T08:16:21.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
