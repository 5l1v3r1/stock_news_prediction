Source: Tesla A Tesla solar roof \nTesla is expanding its solar division across Home Depot 's stores, a source familiar with those plans told CNBC. \nThe expansion would help Tesla test the appeal of its renewable-energy products to a wider audience. It would help Home Depot use some of its excess floor space to sell new products and gain a competitive edge over its peers. \nBloomberg first reported on the news on Thursday. \nTesla is adding its own selling spaces at 800 of Home Depot's stores across the U.S., the person told CNBC, to sell residential solar panels and Powerwall (batteries) to begin with. Those areas are scheduled to be built in the first half of 2018, and Tesla employees will man them. \nMeanwhile, Lowe's has also held talks with Tesla about selling solar products, Bloomberg reported, based on conversations with familiar sources. \nA representative from Lowe's told CNBC: \"We don't have any plans to carry the products at this time.\" \nNumerous companies, including SolarCity, have taken a similar approach to make solar products — roofs and panels — available in mass retailers (including Home Depot) before. The issues have been that these products are costly, often hard to display and aren't as popular among U.S. consumers.
