He is also serving a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions. \nIn January, USA Gymnastics suspended Geddert, who worked with Nassar, was criticized for creating a hostile environment by several victims during Nassar’s sentencing hearings. \nGeddert ran a Lansing-area gymnastics centre called Twistars, where athletes said Nassar molested them in a back room.
