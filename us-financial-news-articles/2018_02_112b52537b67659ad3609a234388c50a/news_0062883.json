The state, however, limited the amount of fuel the company could store and withdraw to protect public safety.\nSeveral community groups want the state to shut Aliso Canyon but SoCalGas says it is needed to keep the gas system reliable, especially on the coldest days.\nLimitations at Aliso Canyon, coupled with outages at three gas pipelines, caused state regulators in November to express concern about the utility’s ability to meet customer demand this winter.\nOne pipeline (Line 235-2) ruptured in October, damaging a second pipe (Line 4000) nearby. Another pipe, Line 3000, was out of service last winter and SoCalGas said it is expected to remain out until May 1.\nSoCalGas returned Line 4000 to service in December but it remains operational at reduced pressure, the company said.\nState regulators said SoCalGas should be able to support about 4.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of system capacity without pulling gas from Aliso Canyon after Line 4000 returned to service.\nOne bcfd is enough gas to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes.\nWhen SoCalGas started pulling gas out of Aliso Canyon last week, it forecast usage would top 4.0 bcfd on Feb. 20 and 21. Actual usage last week, however, peaked at 3.9 bcfd on Feb. 19.
