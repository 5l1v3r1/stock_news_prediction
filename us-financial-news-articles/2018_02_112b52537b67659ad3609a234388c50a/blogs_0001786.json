The Dow and S&P 500 are down 3.4 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively, for the week, while the Nasdaq has lost 2.9 percent. Pointswise, the Dow has lost 952 points this week.\nIn 2016, the Dow lost 6.2 percent in the week of Jan. 8, while the S&P 500 dropped 5.9 percent that week. The Nasdaq pulled back 5.4 percent the week of Feb. 5.\nThe major indexes were also on track to snap four-week winning streaks. Stocks kicked off the year trading sharply higher, as investors cheered strong global economic growth and better-than-expected corporate earnings.\nBut Wall Street grew jittery this week as concerns about rising inflation sent interest rates higher. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level in four years Friday.\nChevron is the worst-performing Dow stock this week, falling 8.4 percent. The energy giant reported earnings Friday that appeared to miss analyst expectations. But the company included a $2 billion tax benefit, which made the profit number difficult to compare with analyst estimates.\nDowDuPont , meanwhile, is the second-biggest decliner in the 30-stock index this week, dropping 7.4 percent. The company reported better-than-expected earnings earlier this week, but analysts at Nomura Instinet noted that guidance for first-quarter 2018 appeared to be light.\nIn the S&P 500, Chesapeake Energy is by far the biggest laggard for the week, sliding 16.5 percent. On Tuesday, the company said in a memo it will lay off about 400 employees, or 13 percent of its workforce.\nMetLife is also one of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks this week. On Monday, the company postponed its fourth-quarter earnings release. MetLife's stock is down more than 13 percent for the week.\nUPS, Tractor Supply and Harley-Davidson are also down sharply for the week, rounding out the five worst S&P 500 performers for the week.\nâ€” CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this report.\nCorrection: MetLife on Monday postponed its fourth-quarter earnings release. An earlier version misstated the day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:15:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
