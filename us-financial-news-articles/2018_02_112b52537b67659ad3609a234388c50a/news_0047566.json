We live for those moments, we train every day for those moments, so for sure it’s disappointing to end it like that,” Gut said.\nAlpine Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Downhill - Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 21, 2018 - Lara Gut of Switzerland competes.

So tomorrow is another day.”\nGut, who in 2016 became the first Swiss woman to win the overall World Cup since Vreni Schneider in 1995, has struggled to deliver her best skiing at the Olympics and missed the 2010 Games through injury.\nBut she indicated on Wednesday that she intends to be back.\n“I hope to have another four years... You pick yourself up, that’s how it is - we’re athletes,” she said. “One day you crumple, the next you have a new start.”\nReporting by Mark Trevelyan, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T09:32:08.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
