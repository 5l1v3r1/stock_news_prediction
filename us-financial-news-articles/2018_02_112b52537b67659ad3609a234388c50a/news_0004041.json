The size of the reduction is not yet known, the company said.\nTakeda forecast an operating profit of 218.7 billion yen for the current financial year ending in March, versus its prior forecast of 200 billion yen.\nThe new forecast, which would put its operating profit at the highest since the year ending March 2012, compares with a consensus estimate of 225 billion yen from 13 analysts.\nThe revision was driven by higher expected sales of Velcade, which is used to treat multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. A U.S. court last year upheld Takeda’s patent, giving the drugmaker rights to exclusively sell the drug until 2022.\nVelcade sales grew 4.1 percent to 107.9 billion yen in the nine months to December.\nFor the third quarter ended December, Takeda’s operating profit jumped almost 60 percent to 87.9 billion yen. Two analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast an average estimate of around 51 billion yen.\nLast month, Takeda said it would pay about $646 million for Belgian biotech group TiGenix NV ( G9U.BR ) whose drug Cx601, a stem cell therapy for Crohn’s disease - an inflammatory bowel disease - is moving towards approval in Europe.\nReporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:51:35.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
