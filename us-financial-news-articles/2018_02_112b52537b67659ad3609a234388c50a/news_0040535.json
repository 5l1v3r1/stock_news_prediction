Now, the New York Times is giving those tools to marketers to help drum up new business.\nThe newspaper announced on Thursday the launch of a new team focused on adapting tools from groups specializing in data science, product and design, technology, and advertising.\nThe team, called “nytDEMO,” has already adapted two tools originally developed by the company’s data science team for editorial and business purposes.\nOne was based on an initiative called “Project Feels” that aimed to help the Times determine how its readers would react to stories based on associations between content, keywords and emotion, said Chris Wiggins, chief data scientist at the Times. The newspaper can use that tool in what is called “perspective targeting,” attaching ads to articles predicted to have a certain resonance with readers.\nThe other tool, Readerscope, emerged from the New York Times’ push to expand its readership in countries outside the U.S. The data team built a tool to assess which stories that readers in different countries were interested in, and which topics were popular with different kinds of readers. The Times will offer the tool to advertisers to help them develop targeted branded campaigns.\nCMO Today newsletter Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ’s CMO Today newsletter.

The new team will be able to work with T Brand Studio to help bring in more advertising clients and build more tailored branded content offerings.\nOther publishers have turned their capacities for data crunching into a business opportunity. In June, Bloomberg hired Havas Creative Group Chief Executive Andrew Benett, who has been using the company’s audience data in consultation with brands. The Washington Post adapted “ Post Pulse ,” a tool for tracking the company’s trending stories, for clients including Sprint, BMW and Chevy.\nThe creation of the team at the Times is part of a broader trend among news organizations, which have been building up stand-alone divisions to cash in on the growing market for branded content. The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Mic and Hearst are among the many publishers that have studios to help clients market their brands.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nThe New York Times’ “Project Feels” initiative can now be used in what is called “perspective targeting,” attaching ads to articles predicted to have a certain resonance with readers. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the tool would be used to assess how readers will respond to a piece of advertising.", "external_links": ["https://digiday.com/media/building-end-end-solution-bloomberg-wants-agency-business/", "http://adage.com/article/digital/red-alert-washington-post/310895/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/ask-the-post/wp/2013/01/15/announcing-post-pulse-whats-trending-on-social-from-the-washington-post/?utm_term=.424daff0d0d9"], "published": "2018-02-15T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T01:57:58.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
