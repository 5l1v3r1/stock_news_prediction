Doha, which has been hit by an embargo from four other Arab nations, managed to keep transfer traffic flat, according to Forward Keys, which analyses more than 17 million flight booking transactions a day.\nPassengers in transit can bring extra revenue for airports because they often spend their time shopping or eating.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:06:04.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
