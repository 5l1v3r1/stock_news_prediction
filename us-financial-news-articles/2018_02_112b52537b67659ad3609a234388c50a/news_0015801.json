In the role, Eskew will align the needs of the country’s leading regional and national health systems with the company’s capabilities in motor vehicle accident (MVA) and complex claim denials solution offerings.\nEskew joins the 10-year-old company as it enters into the next phase of its lifecycle after having received a growth equity investment from Philadelphia-based private equity firm LLR Partners in mid-2017. With his breadth of experience and deep healthcare network, Shay will be a key contributor charged with helping to execute on the strategy to expand Kemberton’s footprint beyond the 25 states and 150 provider organizations currently served.\nAn Ironman triathlete, Eskew previously served as senior vice president of client services at Franklin, Tenn.-based EnableComp. Severely burned by a neighbor’s child at the age of eight and told by doctors that he’d never compete in physical sports again, Eskew learned early that success requires overcoming obstacles. Featured by NBC’s “Ironman World Championship” broadcast, USA Triathlon Magazine, www.Ironman.com , hfm Magazine, and other media outlets, he serves as a national keynote speaker for Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) and American Association of Healthcare Administrative Management (AAHAM) conferences. Eskew also shares his motivational story as an annual keynote speaker for Rotary Youth Leadership Awards and in elementary school classrooms.\n“Shay, with more than six years of experience in specialized revenue cycle management, is well versed in the challenges healthcare executives face in maximizing revenue from non-traditional health payers,” says George Abatjoglou, CEO at Kemberton. “He brings to Kemberton and our clients a deep understanding of providers’ revenue cycle challenges. Shay will help the company deepen our relationships with healthcare executives who are grappling with maximizing cash from their specialized revenue cycle claims that are difficult to realize without the right people, processes, and technology in place.\n“Further, Shay possesses a tenacious spirit, a desire to overcome all challenges, and winning energy—and that means he’s precisely the right person to add to our valued team. Professionally, through the years, Shay has demonstrated a commitment to turn the uncollectible into the collectible. I’m grateful to welcome him to the Kemberton team.”\nSays Eskew, “I’m excited to join the Kemberton team. In today’s competitive environment, providers are increasingly charged with doing more with less and on collecting every dollar owed them. I look forward to continuing to forge strong, meaningful partnerships with revenue cycle executives at the most respected and forward-thinking healthcare systems in the country. I relish the opportunity to help Kemberton’s clients solve their most challenging specialized revenue cycle management problems.”\nAbout Kemberton\nKemberton is a proven leader in tackling motor vehicle accident (MVA) and other complex claims challenges.
