The vote will be watched closely across Europe as a possible barometer of both the continent’s antiestablishment sentiment and the appetite for change in the eurozone’s third-largest economy . Here are five things to know ahead of the elections.\nWhich way are Italians likely to vote? The 40-million strong electorate is roughly divided into three rumps, according to opinion polls: the antiestablishment 5 Star Movement with about 27%; a center-right coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister and media mogul, at 35%; and a loose grouping of center-left parties, including the ruling Democratic Party, at 28%.\nSome of the final polls published in mid-February had as much as 30% of the electorate undecided. Calling the election results is particularly difficult for pundits because of a new electoral law passed late last year that allocates a little more than a third of seats in a first-past-the-post system, with the rest doled out proportionally.\nSo there may be no clear winner? Polls suggest it may be difficult for any party or coalition to win a majority. Italy’s political landscape has been fragmented since the end of World War II, with individual parties rarely getting more than a third of the national vote and never an outright majority. But parties, sometimes from disparate ends of the political spectrum, have always managed to come together to form coalitions. That paradigm has been shaken up in recent years with the rise of 5 Star , which has refused to aggregate with other political groups.\nWhat are the possible outcomes? Analysts are predicting, in varying orders of likelihood: an outright win by the center-right coalition; a hung parliament followed by a grand coalition that aggregates some center-right and center-left parties; or another election, perhaps in about six months’ time, with a caretaker government holding down the fort in the meantime. Considered unlikely, but still a possibility, is 5 Star not joining a coalition, but managing to piece together support from nonaffiliated parties to form a majority. A 5 Star government without its own majority would be on precarious footing with the risk of collapsing at every parliamentary vote of confidence.\nRelated\nWhy Italian Elections Matter: A New Type of Populism Is Rising Italy: The Country That Forgot How to Grow What will happen after the vote? Italy’s president will likely ask the leader of the party or coalition that gets the most seats in parliament to try to form a government that could garner a majority of support in both houses of parliament. Consultations between the parties will follow, likely start in late March, and could drag on for weeks or even months.\nWhen is a result expected? Exit polls will be published immediately after the polls close at 11 p.m. local time, or 5 p.m. ET. The first actual results will be released by Italy’s Interior Ministry during the early hours of Monday, with definitive results expected late morning.\nPredictions of populist, eurosceptic victories ahead of major European elections last year didn’t fully materialize—but Italy is different. WSJ’s Niki Blasina explains why the March 4 election in the eurozone’s third-largest economy could have serious repercussions for the European Union.
