Copenhagen’s benchmark index was down 1.6 percent.\nPandora on Tuesday launched a 4 billion Danish crown ($665.50 million) share buyback programme for 2018, up from 1.7 billion last year, but said it would halve the dividend payout compared to last year to 2 billion crowns.\n“Whilst we didn’t come across any investors who were pro higher buybacks, we spoke to many that were pro dividends. Therefore we expect the announcement this morning to be taken negatively,” said Berenberg analysts.
