Seoul has asked Washington for compensation in that case, a demand that could potentially be undermined if it became the subject of a dispute.\nThe European Union, China, Taiwan and Japan have also demanded compensation for those U.S. safeguard duties.\nReporting by Tom Miles; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T06:16:49.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
