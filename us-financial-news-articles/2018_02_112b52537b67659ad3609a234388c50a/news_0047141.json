Even though its first-half core profit fell 7.4 percent, weighed down by slowing demand in its video division, one trader said net profit beat expectations and cost-cutting surprised positively.\nFood giant Danone’s shares rose 1.2 percent after it published 2017 results.\nSwedish defense firm Saab plummeted 10 percent, leading losers in Europe after it posted fourth-quarter operating earnings below analysts’ forecasts and proposed a smaller dividend hike than expected.\nAir France was another top faller, down 5.8 percent. Its shares reversed course after a positive open that traders linked to the airline’s positive comments on pricing.\nRoche gained 0.9 percent after the Swiss drugmaker said it would buy the rest of Flatiron Health for $1.9 billion to speed development of cancer medicines.\nReporting by Danilo Masoni; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T12:02:16.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
