[nL1N1KG1JZ]\nThe NFL, which has been accused of tolerating head injuries as part of the sport, has changed rules ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday in Minneapolis, requiring players who show signs of a seizure to be pulled from the game. [nL1N1PE06S]\nAt future games, athletes who stumble to the ground when trying to stand will be examined in their team locker room, the league said last month. More neurotrauma consultants not affiliated with specific teams will be on the field and at the NFL’s command center to monitor players.\nThe NFL was not immediately available to comment on the latest study.\nChris Nowinski, chief executive officer of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, said that the AMA study was hampered because the career NFL players involved were too young to have died from the effects of CTE.\n“But even if they were older the presence of the disease and what gets written on death certificate are two separate things,” Nowinski said. “That’s a well-established problem in looking at death records and trying to establish dementia.”\nNowinski also said that even the replacement players likely had spent eight to 12 years playing competitive football - including high school, college and some time in professional leagues - meaning that they could have sustained nearly as much head trauma as the NFL veterans.\nSo far, CTE can be diagnosed only by taking brain tissue from a dead subject. A January study in the scientific journal Brain found more evidence that all hits to the head, not just those that cause concussions, can contribute to CTE.\nThe AMA study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that the leading cause of death among the NFL career players was cardiometric disease, followed by transportation injuries and unintentional injuries.\nAmong the replacement players the leading cause of death was cardiometric disease followed by self-harm and interpersonal violence and then neoplasms.\nReporting by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T18:18:32.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
