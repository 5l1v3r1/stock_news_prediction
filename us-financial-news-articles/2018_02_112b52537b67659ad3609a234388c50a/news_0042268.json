South Korea is considering filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization if the U.S. levies heavy duties on steel. Max Baucus, former U.S. ambassador to China, told CNBC that it's more effective to target the issue of over-capacity together with other countries than focusing on punitive actions like tariffs that will lead to trade disputes. 17 Hours Ago | 03:12 \nHeavy tariffs and quotas on steel will hurt China, but other countries may well bear the brunt of such measures. \n\"The fact is that China does export a lot of steel and aluminum to the United States, but frankly, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, other countries import more steel than does China,\" said Max Baucus, former U.S. ambassador to China, which is the world's top overall steel exporter. \nOn Friday, the Commerce Department recommended imposing heavy tariffs or quotas on foreign producers of steel and aluminum in the interest of national security, following a trade investigation of imports. The metals are used in a wide range of industrial applications including infrastructure and cars. \nPresident Donald Trump and his administration announced the investigation into steel and aluminum importation in April. It sought to determine whether the imports posed a threat to the country's national security. \nThe recommendations call for tariffs on multiple countries, although Trump could determine that specific nations should be exempt, based on the economic or security interests of the United States. \nThe president could also consider a country's willingness to work with the United States to address global excess capacity and other challenges facing the U.S. aluminum and steel industries. \nThe U.S. is the world's largest steel importing country. The top shipper of steel into the U.S. is Canada. Large Asian exporters — and American allies — that may be implicated include South Korea and Japan. \nAccording to Commerce Department data, China was not among the top 10 sources of U.S. steel imports in the period between January to September 2017.

China is the culprit, China is the country that causes the most overcapacity. I think the answer to this is basically: Go after the problem, go after over capacity,\" Baucus said. \nU.S. steel stocks jumped immediately after the Commerce Department report. \nNomura said in a note on Tuesday that if Trump accepts all the recommended measures, U.S. steelmakers will become more profitable. The move will also hasten consolidation and streamlining in non-U.S. countries. \nTrump must respond to the reports by April 11 and 19 for steel and aluminum, respectively. \n—Reuters and CNBC's Kayla Tausche, Lori Ann LaRocco and Tom DiChristopher contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T09:51:00.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
