Backcourt mate C.J. McCollum went for 50 last Wednesday against the Chicago Bulls.\nLillard’s career high is 59, established last April against Utah.\nThe All-Star connected on eight 3-pointers, including two during the game-breaking run that began with Portland leading just 75-74 after a Zach Randolph layup with 4:25 remaining in the third period.\nLillard also had three 2-point hoops and three free throws, the result of being fouled on a 3-point attempt, in his 15-point flurry.\nMcCollum had the only other basket in the run, which gave Portland a 92-74 advantage headed into the final period.\nThe Trail Blazers coasted home for a second consecutive win that also allowed them to snap a three-game road losing streak.\nLillard connected on 16 of his 26 shots overall and all 10 of his free throws. The Trail Blazers went 17-for-18 from the line in the game.\nMaurice Harkless (15), McCollum (11) and Shabazz Napier (13) also scored in double figures for Portland. Ed Davis collected a game-high 14 rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who had split a pair of earlier decisions against Sacramento.\nWillie Cauley-Stein had 19 points and Randolph had 17 points for the Kings, who were coming off a 104-98 home win over the Bulls on Monday.\nBuddy Hield had 16 points, De‘Aaron Fox 13, and Justin Jackson, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Kosta Koufos 10 apiece for Sacramento, which completed a 1-3 homestand.\nRandolph also recorded a team-high nine rebounds. Fox flirted with a triple-double, complementing his 13 points with seven rebounds and a game-high nine assists.\nNeither Joe Johnson nor Iman Shumpert, both acquired in a three-team trade Thursday, played for the Kings.\nPortland used an 11-3 spurt at the end of the second quarter to build a 62-52 halftime lead. Lillard accounted for nine of the 11 points.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T14:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:10:28.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
