Analysts have warned, however, that PNB may be left on the hook.\nRajiv Kumar, India’s financial services secretary, said the bank “will have to own responsibility of bonafide transactions.”\nMorgan Stanley estimated on Thursday if PNB had to assume all the liability from the fraud it would need 80 billion rupees ($1.25 billion) in additional capital, which at the stock’s current valuation would mean a 14 percent dilution.\nKumar also said the ministry had written to all banks to take effective steps to avoid a repeat of a PNB-like fraud. The Reserve Bank of India will also take all the required steps in the fraud case, Kumar said.\n“Our responsibility is to ensure that fire alarms are installed and are in working condition. We can’t stop every fire,” Kumar told Reuters.
