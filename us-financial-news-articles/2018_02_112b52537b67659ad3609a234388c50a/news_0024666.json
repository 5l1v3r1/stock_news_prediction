This business is expected to have about 60 percent fixed-price type contracts, which is a key to higher margins.\n“CSRA has been trading at a slight discount to the other services companies in the government services sector. This combined with the fact that General Dynamics’ own services business has a similar profit margin and business lines made it a more attractive purchase for General Dynamics,” a person familiar with the deal told Reuters.\nGeneral Dynamics said it expects the deal to add to its earnings per share and free cash flow per share in 2019 and generate annual pre-tax cost savings of about 2 percent of the combined company’s revenue by 2020.\nReporting by Arunima Banerjee, Sanjana Shivdas and Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru, and Mike Stone in Washington; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Sayantani Ghosh\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T13:52:44.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
