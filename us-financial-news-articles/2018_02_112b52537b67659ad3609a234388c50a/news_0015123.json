REGULATOR REBUKED \nThe Senate’s measure comes after a report from the country’s chief economic advisory body accused APRA of creating an environment that promoted record profits over the interests of customers and failing to stimulate competition. \nThe Productivity Commission also said a three-decade-old law stopping takeovers between the so-called “Big Four” banks was outdated and should be removed. \nIt will hand in its final report by July 1. \nA spokesman for Treasurer Morrison said the government would then consider its response. \nAustralia’s big banks - CBA, National Australia Bank Ltd, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Westpac Banking Corp - reported a combined net profit of about $25 billion in the 2017 fiscal year, up 6.4 percent on a year ago, according to KPMG. \nCBA, the biggest of the “Big Four”, is defending allegations by Australia’s anti-money laundering agency that it allowed thousands of suspicious transactions to pass through its systems, including failing to report attempts to wire money by an individual convicted of terror-related offences. \nAPRA said it welcomed the Commission’s draft report. \n“We have actively engaged with the Commission in the preparation of the draft report and we will continue to do so as it prepares its final report,” an APRA spokesman said.
