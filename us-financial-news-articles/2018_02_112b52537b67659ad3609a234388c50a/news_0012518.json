Tampa Bay has won five of its past six contests and leads the Eastern Conference with 75 points through 52 games.\nThomas Vanek and Brock Boeser both scored in the third period as part of a late flurry for the Canucks, who nearly erased a three-goal deficit. Vancouver lost for the first time in three games.\nCanucks goaltender Jacob Markstrom allowed four goals on 28 shots.\nTampa Bay seized a 1-0 lead only 86 seconds after the opening faceoff. Defenseman Anton Stralman fired a shot from near the blue line, and Kunitz deflected the puck into the net for his eighth goal of the season. The 38-year-old veteran has scored a goal in three of his past six games.\nHedman increased Tampa Bay’s lead to 2-0 at the 5:52 mark of the first period. The 6-foot-6, 233-pound defenseman pinched into the offensive zone and flicked a wrist shot past Markstrom for his seventh goal.\nGourde scored with 4:13 to go in the second period to make it 3-0. His one-timer from the right circle marked his 18th goal, 16 of which have come on even strength. Gourde’s rising shot delivered a direct hit on Markstrom’s water bottle, which rested on top of the net.\nVanek cut the deficit to 3-1 with 10 minutes remaining in the third period. He potted his 15th goal on a wraparound from behind the net.\nBoeser pulled the Canucks within 3-2 with 5:30 remaining. He carried the puck into the offensive zone and ripped a pinpoint wrist shot for the 25th goal of his rookie campaign.\nTampa Bay regained a two-goal lead when Conacher scored on a penalty shot with 3:24 to play. Canucks defenseman Christopher Tanev was called for tripping Conacher on a breakaway to set up the penalty shot.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T15:17:34.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
