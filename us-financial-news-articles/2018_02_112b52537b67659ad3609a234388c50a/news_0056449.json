The fund earned a return of 13.7 percent in 2017, up from 6.9 percent in 2016. “The fund’s cumulative return since inception has passed 4,000 billion Norwegian crowns ($511 billion). One out of four crowns of return was generated in 2017, after a very strong year for the fund,” CEO Yngve Slyngstad said in a statement. “Again, our equity investments returned strongest with a return close to 20 percent.” The fund invests the proceeds from Norway’s oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad.
