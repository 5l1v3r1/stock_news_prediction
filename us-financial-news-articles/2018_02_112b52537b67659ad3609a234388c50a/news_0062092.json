The services sector accounts for over half of China’s economy.\nHowever, analysts cautioned the timing of the long holiday may have skewed the activity readings, and a clearer picture of conditions in China may not emerge for another month.\nSentiment was already sour after Fed’s Jerome Powell gave an upbeat view of the U.S. economy on Tuesday and said recent data had strengthened his confidence on inflation.\nWhen asked about likely catalysts for more than three rate hikes in 2018, he said each member would write a new “dot plot” rate path ahead of the March meeting and that he wouldn’t want to prejudge that outcome.\nRate futures fell following Powell’s remarks as traders began pricing in about a one-in-three chance of a fourth hike this year.\nFears of faster U.S. rate hikes have caused anxiety that other central banks will start to tighten policy and raise borrowing costs. That would in turn hurt corporate earnings, clouding the outlook for what had been expected to be another solid year of global economic growth.\n“Today’s comments appear to open the door for others on the (Fed) Committee to revise their forecast as they see fit, and that Powell himself may be inclined to look for four hikes this year,” JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli said in a note.\n“We are naturally more confident in our standing call for four hikes this year and another four next year.”\nThe Fed moved three times in 2017 and is seen as certain to do the same or more this year, with the first move expected as early as March.\nResponding to Powell, equity markets in Europe and Wall Street turned south with the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq falling more than 1 percent each.\nBONDS AND CURRENCIES Treasury prices slipped with yields on the 10-year U.S. note rising past 2.9 percent.\nThe dollar held on to gains after rallying against most major currencies overnight.\nIt hovered near a recent 1-1/2 month top against the Australian dollar and held near a three-week high on the euro at $1.2227.\nHowever, it did not fare well against the Japanese yen, a perceived safe haven.\nDollar bulls were wrongfooted after the Bank of Japan announced it would trim the amount of super long Japanese government bonds it offered to purchase at its regular debt-buying operation.\nIn commodities, oil prices extended declines into a second day fell as industry data showed an increase in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles.\nBrent crude futures fell 31 cents to $66.32 a barrel, while U.S. crude was last down 37 cents at $62.64.\nSpot gold eased to $1,317.31 an ounce, not far from Tuesday’s $1,313.26 which was the lowest in three weeks.\nReporting by Swati Pandey Editing by Eri Meijer and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:10:01.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
