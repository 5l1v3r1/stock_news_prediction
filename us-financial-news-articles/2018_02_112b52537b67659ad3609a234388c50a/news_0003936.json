The Hokies cut the deficit to 66-63 with 3:51 remaining, but Miami freshman Lonnie Walker IV answered with a 3-pointer and then a jumper to keep Virginia Tech from getting closer.\nWalker finished with 14 points, including eight in the second half. In the final two minutes, he took two full-court passes from Lawrence and converted both into points.\nDejan Vasiljevic scored nine of his 14 points in the first half for Miami (17-5, 6-4).\nIt was an important win for the Hurricanes, who have the nation’s No. 24 RPI and NCAA Tournament aspirations.\nVirginia Tech (16-7, 5-5) had its three-game win streak snapped. The Hokies were led by Justin Robinson’s 22 points and Justin Bibbs’ 16 points. Freshman guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker scored 12 of his 15 points in the first half for the Hokies, who entered the game with the nation’s No. 29 RPI.\nThe Hurricanes were without combo guard Bruce Brown, who leads the team in assists and rebounds and is second in scoring. It was announced on Tuesday that he will miss six weeks due to an injury to his left foot.\nWith Brown out, the Hurricanes got unexpected contributions. Three-point specialist Vasiljevic, for example, drove for three first-half layups, something he hadn’t done all season.\nAnother major surprise for Miami was the use of 7-foot sophomore center Rodney Miller, who entered the game having scored only 10 points all season in just 32 overall minutes. On Saturday, he finished with two points in four first-half minutes.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:40:45.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
