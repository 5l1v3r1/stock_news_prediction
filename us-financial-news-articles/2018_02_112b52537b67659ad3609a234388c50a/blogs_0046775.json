Over five billion people will have access to TV coverage of the Pyeongchang Games,” Lumme told reporters.\nEarly estimates showed some three billion people will have watched some coverage of the Olympics that started on Feb. 9 and end on Sunday, he said.\nThe Pyeongchang Games are the first of three consecutive Olympics in Asia, with Tokyo hosting the 2020 summer edition and Beijing staging the 2022 winter Olympics.\nBroadcasters in these three major Asian markets were “consistently outperforming their average share of viewing”.\nIn the United State, Lumme said NBC’s coverage during prime time was bigger than all other competitor networks combined.\n“Often it is even doubling the combined audience of other network,” he said.\nU.S. rights holder NBC is the IOC’s largest single source of revenue, having paid more than $7.75 billion for the rights to broadcast the Olympic Games to U.S. audiences, up until 2032.\nU.S. national advertising sales for the Olympics in Pyeongchang have surpassed $900 million, a record for the Winter Games, NBC Sports Group, a unit of Comcast Corp. had said prior to the start of the Games.\nNBC is producing more than 2,400 hours of coverage over 18 days from Pyeongchang.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T10:51:20.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
