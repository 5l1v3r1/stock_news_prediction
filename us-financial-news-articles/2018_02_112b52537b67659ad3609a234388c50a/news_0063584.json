Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said it was up to May and the DUP to come up with their own solutions if they did not like it.\nBarnier rammed home that “time is short” before Britain will be out of the EU in exactly 13 months. He called on May to “pick up the pace” of negotiations so that a withdrawal treaty, including terms for keeping the status quo during a two-year transition, could be agreed this autumn and ratified by March.\nAs the rhetoric on both sides has taken a more irritable turn, and negotiations have stalled since the interim accords in December, Barnier said he was “preparing for every situation” in case Britain, the continent’s second-biggest economy, lurches out of the Union without a deal after 46 years.\nEuropean Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier arrives to address a news conference at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir One EU diplomat said Barnier and his team had “switched gear into attack mode” and had agreed with Dublin on a tactic to push Britain on from December’s fudge on the Irish border. Britain wants the border issue settled as part of an overall EU-UK trade deal which Brussels will only start discussing with it in April.\nMay, who will lay out her vision for the future trading relationship with the EU on Friday, said she would work to protect UK unity in the negotiations. She again ruled out an EU-UK customs union - something that her Labour opponents advocate as a way to avoid disruptive controls at the Irish land border.\n“Overall the work has been progressing well in recent weeks,” her spokesman said. “This is just a draft document ... and we will be having discussions where we don’t agree in the coming months.”\nUnionists fear new barriers with the British mainland could increase the chances of Ireland, which broke from British rule a century ago, absorbing Northern Ireland, most of whose 1.8 million people are entitled to Irish, and hence EU, citizenship.\nBarnier conceded there might be new checks on trade between Northern Ireland and the mainland - but definitely no “border”.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “NO ARROGANCE HERE”\nThe Democratic Unionist Party’s Nigel Dodds, however, said Barnier’s “ludicrous” plan “will not go anywhere”.\nBarnier dismissed suggestions that the draft was an attempt to “shock” Britons into concluding a deal, insisting that his sole goal was to avoid a disorderly divorce. “There is no arrogance here,” he said.\nThe draft treaty sees a joint EU-British committee overseeing the arrangements but the European Court of Justice remaining the ultimate authority to resolve disputes.\nAsked why the draft made no mention of a section in December’s EU-UK joint report that there should be no regulatory divergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Barnier said it was because that was an internal British matter.\nHe restated his view that the proposals for future trade that May is expected to make on Friday - to maintain a mixture of common and different regulations with the EU - were not acceptable. “There will be no cherry-picking,” he said.\nBarnier said he would engage in a new round of negotiations next week and would also meet leaders of Northern Ireland.\nHe also said “significant divergences” remained in talks on a transition period, and so a deal, which both sides hope to clinch in March to calm business nerves, was “not a given”.\nSupporters of Brexit argue that Britain will benefit from no longer being bound by EU rules and can do more trade with the rest of the world, while opponents say the prospect of new barriers to trade in Europe is already damaging its economy.\nMay’s government got a boost on Wednesday when Japanese carmaker Toyota confirmed plans to build a new model in England.\nAdditional reporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Jan Strupczewski, Robert-Jan Bartunek, Robin Emmott and Samantha Koester in Brussels, William James and Elizabeth Piper in London and Padraic Halpin in Dublin; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:06:22.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
