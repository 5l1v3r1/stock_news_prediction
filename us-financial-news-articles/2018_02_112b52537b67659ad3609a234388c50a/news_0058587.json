The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons in the war that will soon enter its eighth year.\nThe Russian defense ministry, which backs the Syrian government in the war, on Sunday accused rebels of preparing to use toxic agents in eastern Ghouta so they could later accuse Damascus of employing chemical weapons.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organization that reports on the war, confirmed a child had died from suffocation in eastern Ghouta but said it could not confirm if poison gas had been used, its director told Reuters by phone.\nVideo circulated on social media networks purporting to show the aftermath of the attack depicted a child’s corpse wrapped in a blue shroud, and several bare chested men and young boys appearing to struggle for breath, with some holding nebulizers to their mouths and noses.\nEastern Ghouta, the last major rebel stronghold near Damascus, has been targeted in a fierce government offensive that got underway last week.\nThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday demanded a 30-day truce across Syria. The Observatory said Sunday’s bombardment of eastern Ghouta was less intense than last week, but 14 people were still killed.\nIn recent weeks, the United States has accused Syria of repeatedly using chlorine gas as a weapon. Rebel-held areas of the Ghouta region were hit in a major chemical attack in 2013.\nLast year, a joint inquiry by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) found the Syrian government was responsible for an April 4, 2017 attack using the banned nerve agent sarin in the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, killing dozens of people.\nThe inquiry had previously found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas.\nThe Russian defense ministry said rebel leaders were “preparing a provocation with employment of toxic material, aiming at accusing the governmental forces of using chemical weapons against civilian population”.\nThe statement was released by a Russian ceasefire monitoring center, which is run by the Russian military, and published on the defense ministry’s website.\nReporting by Amman/Beirut bureaus and Andrey Ostroukh in Moscow, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T00:48:06.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
