But there are sensitive talks going on and they need more time,” one EU diplomat said.\n“They are on a charm offensive. It won’t be enough if it’s just words, there will have to be real moves from Poland. But for now we are waiting to see where it takes us.”\nThe Commission said in December that the EU should take legal action against Poland under Article 7 of the EU treaty - which could theoretically lead to the country losing its voting rights - if it fails to reverse or modify its judicial reforms.\nMOOD MUSIC Poland faces a March 20 deadline to respond to the Commission’s recommendations and Warsaw has now signaled it might make some conciliatory adjustments to its legislation.\nIn a further effort to improve the mood music, Morawiecki’s government has said it will respect the final ruling of the EU’s top court in a case against Poland over excessive logging in Europe’s last remaining primeval forest, Bialowieza.\nThe deputy head of the Commission, Frans Timmermans, will brief other EU member states on the state of play in relations with Poland on Feb. 27, but they will delay taking any action until after the March 20 deadline.\nThough embarrassed by the threat of ‘Article 7’ being invoked against it, Poland does not seriously have to worry about losing its voting rights as this would require unanimity among other member states and it can rely on support from its ally Hungary, which is waging its own battles with Brussels.\nBut Poland and Hungary are both increasingly worried by calls from wealthier western European countries to make respect for the bloc’s rules and standards on democracy and rule of law a precondition for receiving EU funds.\nThe Danish and Dutch prime ministers reiterated the importance of conditionality on Friday as they arrived in Brussels for talks on the EU’s next multi-year budget, especially as the bloc braces for a loss of funds with the exit of Britain, a net donor, from the Union in 2019. [nL8N1QD2RS]\nPoland is currently the biggest beneficiary of EU funds, which are earmarked for infrastructure and other projects.\nAsked about conditionality on Friday in Brussels, Morawiecki said the next EU budget should be based on a “healthy compromise”, adding: “We want (policies) that have so far worked well for Poland... to be continued.”\nReporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:11:32.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
