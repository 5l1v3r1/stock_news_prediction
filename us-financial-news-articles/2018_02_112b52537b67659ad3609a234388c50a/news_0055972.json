If the venture is approved, the two could offer more flights, including to cities not currently served by either.\nRegulators in Australia and New Zealand had approved the first application for the joint venture before it was rejected by the United States.\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye Editing by Edwina Gibbs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T06:35:46.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
