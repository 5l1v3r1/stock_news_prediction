DE10YT-RR\nThe yield on this bond has more than doubled since early December as the ECB cut bond purchases by half at the start of the year and is expected to end the programme in its entirety soon after it runs out in September.\nOther euro zone bond yields were flat to a touch higher on the day, though bonds from lower-rated Italy, Spain and Portugal edged lower on the day.\nAnd yet, Tuesday’s stock market crash was a reminder that there is still demand for Europe’s best-rated and most liquid asset, and for other well-rated government bonds in the continent.\nThis will tested later as Germany is set to sell bonds maturing in August 2028 in an auction.\n“We are sticking to our forecasts for now, there are still some risk events up ahead: the U.S. government shutdown and the Italian election,” said Schroeder of ING. ING expects German 10-year bond yields to be at 0.85 percent by the end of 2018.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday approved another stopgap bill to keep the federal government from shutting down, hours after President Donald Trump said he would “love” to see a shutdown if immigration legislation were not included.
