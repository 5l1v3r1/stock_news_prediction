( goo.gl/TRuF2Z )\nVenezuela is undergoing a major crisis, with quadruple-digit inflation and shortages of food and medicine. Economists consistently describe the 15-year-old currency control system as the principal obstacle to functioning commerce and industry.\nThe new rate is still dwarfed by the black market rate for greenbacks, currently at 228,000 bolivars per dollar according to website DolarToday, which is used as a reference.\nThe existence of such disparate exchange rates has for years encouraged Venezuelans to buy dollars on the cheap and flip them on the black market for a profit. That has created shortages of hard currency, which in turn fuels shortages of imported products such as food and medicine.\nThe government has repeatedly created foreign exchange mechanisms similar to DICOM, but business leaders say they never provided a steady supply of hard currency.\nThe government would repeatedly end up shuttering the foreign exchange platforms in part because maintaining an exchange rate so divergent from the black market rate proved to be unsustainable.\n“If the exchange rate is imposed arbitrarily, it will perpetuate the crisis,” wrote Alejandro Grisanti of local consultancy Ecoanalitica on Twitter.\nReporting by Caracas newsroom; Writing by Brian Ellsworth and Girish Gupta; Editing by Leslie Adler and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T01:55:53.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
