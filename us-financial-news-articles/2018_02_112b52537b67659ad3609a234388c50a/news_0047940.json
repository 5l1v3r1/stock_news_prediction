Someone who can teach me new things and inspire me,” El-Hassan wrote on her dating profile.\nShe sent messages to him on the WhatsApp service with links to websites on how to make ricin. He sent her back graphic videos of IS beheadings, shootings and killings of prisoners using explosives.\nWhen police arrested him in December 2016, Mohammed, who worked in a food factory making meals for supermarkets, possessed instruction manuals on mobile phone detonators, ricin and how to make explosives, prosecutors said.\nHe had also contacted an IS commander via Facebook and offered to carry out a “lone actor” mission.\n“We’ll never know what Munir Mohammed’s target might have been,” said Chief Superintendent Jim Allen from Derbyshire Police. “What we do know is that he had the intention to cause serious harm to a large number of people.”\nMohammed, who the BBC reported was Eritrean-born and had come to Britain from Sudan as an asylum-seeker, and El-Hassan were both found guilty of preparing acts of terrorism at London’s Old Bailey court last month.\nReporting by Michael Holden; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:05:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
