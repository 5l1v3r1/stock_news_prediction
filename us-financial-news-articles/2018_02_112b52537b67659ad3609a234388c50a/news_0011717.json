It is hopefully not also misjudging central convictions held across the Channel.”\n“Otherwise, a disorderly Brexit could become increasingly likely. Such a turn of events would bring renewed downward pressure to Britain’s sovereign rating,” Kraemer added.\nReporting by Marc Jones; editing by Sujata Rao\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T12:29:51.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
