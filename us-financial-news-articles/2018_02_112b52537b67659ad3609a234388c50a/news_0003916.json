I think so,” Aubameyang, who struck 37 minutes into his first game for the club after signing from Borussia Dortmund last week, said after the match. \n“We won the game in the first half and the second was a bit different. We are all happy today.” \nArsenal remain sixth in the league, three points adrift of north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who visit Liverpool on Sunday.   editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T08:11:43.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
