No passwords, conversations or payment data were affected, it said. \nIt came to light during a routine check of operations that showed unknown parties had misappropriated access rights of the unidentified sales partner to see the data. \nIn response, Swisscom blocked the partner’s access and adopted new policies that ban high-volume queries for all customer information and require two-factor authentication for all data access by sales partners.
