We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the Committee,” he said. \nAllegations about the Global Restructuring Group (GRG) have overshadowed efforts by RBS to reform its image a decade on from the financial crisis and as the government prepares to start selling down its 70 percent stake in the bank. \nRBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan had previously said the “vast majority” of firms it dealt with were turned around, although he accepted last week this was not the case. \nRBS and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates British banks, have stopped short of saying GRG systematically and deliberately pushed firms into administration, although both have acknowledged failures.

REUTERS/Darren Staples \nAndrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, is due to make a routine appearance before the committee on Wednesday. \n“LOSE THEIR SHIRTS” \nRBS has set aside 400 million pounds ($555 million) to cover claims relating to the restructuring unit, which handled more than 12,000 troubled businesses between 2007 and 2012. \nLewis said the full version of the report, which was commissioned by the FCA but is yet not public, was more damning. \n“The bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a chunky equity deal,” he said. \nThe full version of the report has been at the centre of a year-long dispute, with the committee frustrated at the regulator’s refusal to publish it. \nHowever the FCA said last week it would publish the report in full at a later date, after McEwan and RBS chairman Howard Davies said they would not object to this. \nThe FCA has already published a summary following pressure from the TSC and a committee-appointed lawyer had confirmed this was an accurate reflection of the report’s full contents. \nBut Lewis, who also co-chairs a parliamentary group on how British businesses are treated by big banks, said it represented a “sanitised version”. \nA spokesman for a group of 500 businesses affected by GRG said in response to the intervention by Lewis on Tuesday: \n“Thousands of people whose jobs, livelihoods and businesses were destroyed by RBS’s rogue bankers already knew this.” Reporting by Emma Rumney and Lawrence White; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Alexander Smith", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T17:03:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
