Enes Kanter had 10 points and 12 rebounds for New York, but Hardaway was stifled for the third straight game.\nAtlanta came into the game with its defense awry, having allowed 119 or more points in four of its previous five contests, after opposing teams hit that number just six times in their first 47 games.\nThe Knicks, meanwhile, came in on a two-game losing streak in which they scored just a combined 163 points.\nSomething had to give.\nOn Sunday, the Hawks held New York to just 38 first-half points, making up for their own poor shooting by limiting the Knicks to 36 percent shooting on 45 attempts. Atlanta shot just 37 percent in the first half, with Dennis Schroder going 1-for-11 from the field.\nBut Porzingis was just 2-for-10 for six points, while Kanter was held scoreless.\nBoth came alive in the third quarter as New York surged back to take the lead. The Knicks led for much of the fourth quarter but Atlanta battled back as five Hawks scored in double-figures and Dewayne Dedmon had a clutch free throw with three seconds left to increase Atlanta’s lead to three.\nSchroder finished with 10 points on just 2-of-16 shooting.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T15:23:20.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
