Unlike many cloud companies that rely on enterprise sales teams, over 90 percent of Dropbox's revenue comes from users purchasing their own subscription, the company said. \nStill, the loss-making company has about $1.7 billion in contractual obligations, like leases, outstanding. Dropbox also has a multi-million dollar relationship with Hewlett Packard Enterprise. It has some stiff competition, as well: Aspects of Dropbox's business compete with giants like Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft.\nProceeds from the IPO will be used to fund an expansion plan of upgrading more users to subscriptions and expanding integration with third-party software. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and Allen and Company are among the top underwriters for the IPO.\nShares of Box, a rival company, rose 2.8 percent after the release of Dropbox's prospectus.
