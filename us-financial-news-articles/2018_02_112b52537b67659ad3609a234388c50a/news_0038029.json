REUTERS/Ha Kwiyeon After dimethylpolysiloxane was reported as being used in oil to fry potatoes, researchers received a number of inquiries asking how many french fries people should eat to cure baldness.\n“No matter how many fried potatoes you eat, you’ll never grow more hair. That’s a total misunderstanding that’s gone viral,” lead researcher Junji Fukuda told Reuters.\nFukuda said the research, published in the journal Biomaterials this month, was a breakthrough as scientists had previously struggled to produce the large quantities of HFGs needed to generate significant hair growth.\n“Up until now we’ve only been able to produce a few dozen hair follicle germs at a time, but with this new technology we’ve developed a simple method to produce hundreds and thousands,” Fukuda said.\nThe team have also received many serious inquiries from researchers and people seeking hair-regenerative medicine to offer their cells to test and develop the research, he said.\nReporting by Kwiyeon Ha; Writing by Kwiyeon Ha in Tokyo and Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:32:03.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
