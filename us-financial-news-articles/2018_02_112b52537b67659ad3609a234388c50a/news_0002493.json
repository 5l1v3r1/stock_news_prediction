Some analysts have warned that CBS could be better off alone and that the companies’ content is too different to easily add much negotiating power. \nCBS and Viacom have previously explored recombining at the urging of ailing Redstone, 94, and his daughter Shari Redstone, who control both through privately held National Amusements. \nBut CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves and the CBS board had concerns about corporate governance and the deal’s financial rationale, and the Redstones called off the effort in December 2016. \nCBS shares were up 2.7 percent on Thursday, while Viacom shares were flat.
