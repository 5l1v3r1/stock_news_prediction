But much of the violence was going on in areas that were impossible for aid workers to reach.\nThe “lion’s share” of abuses concerned extortion and illegal taxation, mostly carried out by Congolese armed forces at road blocks.\nThe conflict is part of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Congo. Militia violence has risen since President Joseph Kabila’s refused to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in 2016.\nCongo’s military has largely stamped out an insurrection that displaced 1.5 million people in central Congo in 2016-17 but militias are increasingly active along the eastern borders with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.\nTanganyika province is three times the size of Switzerland with a population of about 3 million, of whom 630,000 have been displaced by the fighting, a number that has almost doubled in a year.\n“Given the circumstances we are only observing an upward trend in displacement right now,” Mahecic said.\n“How high it could go is anyone’s guess, but clearly it is a major concern for us.”\nLast year UNHCR received less than $1 per person to support the 4.4 million people displaced in Congo, he said.\nReporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T15:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:17:38.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
