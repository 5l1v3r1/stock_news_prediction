We see the banking system and the financial system generally being fairly resilient. I think the financial stability picture shows at most modest risks.\"\nAddressing the economic situation, Powell earlier in his prepared remarks said economic growth is \"solid.\" Asked about the flattening of the yield curve, he said he was largely unconcerned about compression between government bond yields.\n\"It's very typical for the yield curve to flatten as short-term rates come up as the economy strengthens,\" he said. \"There's always the risk of a recession at any given point in time. I don't see it as at all high at the moment.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T18:15:04.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
