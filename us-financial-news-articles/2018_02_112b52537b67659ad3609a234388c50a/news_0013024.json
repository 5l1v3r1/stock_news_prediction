Consumer associations and politicians had called for class-action lawsuits to be made possible during the Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) diesel emissions scandal.

Germany’s booming economy has allowed them to agree an extra 11 billion euros for education and compromise deals have been reached on migration and healthcare policy. \nSome of the accords are noticeably less ambitious than those reached in the previous talks with the two smaller parties. Then, negotiators agreed to spend 20 billion euros over a longer period on building a better national broadband network. Privatisations are also now off the agenda. \nDespite the differences between the parties, Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s Bavarian ally, whose party has in the past been most sceptical about a renewed coalition with the SPD, was optimistic. \n“I think we’ll get this done in the coming days,” Seehofer said. “So far, there is no reason to expect we will need longer than Sunday.” Related Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:23:25.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
