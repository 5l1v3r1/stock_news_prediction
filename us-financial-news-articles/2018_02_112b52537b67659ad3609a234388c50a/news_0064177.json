That marked the first rise for the measure in 12 quarters and beat the average analyst estimate of a 0.31 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nStill, previously reported comparable sales growth in November and December lagged rivals', suggesting Macys lost market share during the key shopping months. Macy's is the first major retailer to report full holiday-quarter results.\nChief Executive Jeff Gennette said on a call to discuss the earnings that Macy's plans to add 100 Backstage stores in 2018, including in some premium mall locations.\nThe company has said putting Backstage stores in existing locations can lure foot traffic, and the \"treasure hunting\" of off-price shopping is hard to replicate online.\nComparable sales fell 2.2 percent in fiscal 2017 on an owned basis and 1.9 percent on an owned-plus-licensed basis.\nGross margin, which measures how much the company makes on each dollar of sales, slipped slightly in the quarter.\nBut it was a smaller fall than the company had guided for, with Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet on Tuesday crediting a stronger merchandise margin thanks to inventory controls.\nShares in Macy's jumped as much as 13 percent and were last up 4.8 percent at $28.77. Rival JC Penney Co Inc also surged early but pared gains to trade up 1.8 percent.\nMacy's also operates the Bloomingdales and Bloomingdale's outlet brands and the Bluemercury beauty and spa stores it bought in 2015.\nSELLING REAL ESTATE\nMacy's has worked to generate cash by renting or selling its real estate, even considering unloading floors at its storied Herald Square flagship in New York.\nMacy's partnered with Brookfield Asset Management in 2016 to let the real estate developer come up with plans to redevelop 50 properties.\nOn Tuesday, Macy's said agreements have been reached for nine assets which, if sold, would be worth about $50 million.\nIt also said it inked a deal to sell the top floors of its State Street store in Chicago for $30 million and is exploring selling a chunk of its Union Square building in San Francisco.\nMacy's adjusted earnings per share were $2.82 for the quarter, excluding restructuring and U.S. tax overhaul impacts, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.71.\nRevenue rose 1.8 percent to $8.67 billion, in line with estimates.\nBefore Tuesday, Macy's shares were up more than 50 percent since November, but are well below a mid-2015 peak of more than $73.\n(Reporting by Meredith Mazzilli Editing by Franklin Paul and Nick Zieminski)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:28:05.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
