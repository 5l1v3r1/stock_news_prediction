An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nFourth Quarter and Recent Business Highlights\nEnded the fourth quarter of 2017 with 3,392 customers, a 46% increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. Added 338 net new customers in the fourth quarter of 2017. Achieved a dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 131% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Outlook\nAs of February 21, 2018, guidance for the first quarter 2018 and full year 2018 is as follows:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance : Revenue is expected to be in the range of $39.0 million to $40.0 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $(3.5) million to $(4.5) million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $(0.06) to $(0.07) based on approximately 60.0 million non-GAAP weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding. Full Year 2018 Guidance : Revenue is expected to be in the range of $176.0 million to $179.0 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $(15.0) million to $(18.0) million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $(0.24) to $(0.29) based on approximately 60.9 million non-GAAP weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding.\nThe financial outlook above for non-GAAP loss from operations and non-GAAP net loss per share exclude estimates for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related adjustments, and other non-recurring items. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis primarily as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related adjustments, and other non-recurring items. In particular, stock-based compensation expense is impacted by our future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of our Class A common stock, all of which is not within our control, is difficult to predict, and is subject to constant change. The actual amount of these expenses during 2018 will have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nAlteryx will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s financial results. To access this call, dial 877-407-9716 (domestic) or 201-493-6779 (international). A live webcast of this conference call will be available on the “Investors” page of the Company’s website at www.alteryx.com .\nFollowing the conference call, a telephone replay will be available through February 28, 2018, at 844-512-2921 (domestic) or 412-317-6671 (international). The replay passcode is 13675199. An archived webcast of this conference call will also be available in the “Investors” section of the Company’s website.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, and non-GAAP weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use non-GAAP measures to internally evaluate and analyze financial results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP financial measures:\nStock-based compensation expense. We exclude stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense, from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, companies calculate stock-based compensation expense using a variety of valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions.\nAcquisition related adjustments. We exclude amortization of intangible assets, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, and related income tax adjustments, which are non-cash, related to business combinations from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude such expenses as they are related to a business combination and have no direct correlation to the operation of our business.\nAccretion of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock. We exclude accretion relating to our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock from non-GAAP net loss per share because this is a non-cash item that will not recur in the periods following our initial public offering.\nFollow-on public offering costs. We exclude the costs relating to our follow-on public offering in September 2017 from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because the costs do not have a direct correlation to the operation of our business.\nImpairment of long-lived assets. We exclude the impairment of long-lived assets from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures, because the expenses are non-cash and do not have a direct correlation to the operation of our business.\nIn addition, we adjust non-GAAP weighted-average diluted shares outstanding to include the conversion of the redeemable convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock as though the conversion had occurred at the beginning of each of the respective periods. In periods of non-GAAP net income, we adjust non-GAAP weighted-average diluted shares outstanding to include the effect of dilutive shares.\nInvestors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, we exclude stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets which are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. The non-GAAP measures we use may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our outlook for the first quarter 2018 and full year 2018, our market opportunity, our ability to execute the Company’s long-term growth strategy, and other future events.
