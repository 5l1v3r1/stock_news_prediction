It was one of six firms that presented the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency with a prototype for Trump’s proposed border wall on the Mexican border.\nTrump’s rhetoric and policies have strained relations between the two countries. Trump has used the contentious issue of whether to shield from deportation young immigrants known as “Dreamers,” including hundreds of thousands of Mexicans, as a bargaining chip to get funding for the wall project.\nPart of the site where the new U.S. embassy will be built is seen during a ceremony to place the first stone of the embassy in Mexico City, Mexico February 13, 2018.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido The influential Mexican newspaper Reforma incorrectly reported last year that the new embassy project had been put on hold indefinitely. Though the March story turned out be wrong, it was indicative of the tense atmosphere surrounding Trump’s early months in office.\nTrump has threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a lynchpin of Mexico’s economy, if he cannot rework it to better benefit American workers and interests.\nSlideshow (8 Images) The uncertainty around the future of the $1.2 trillion trade deal has rattled markets and spooked investors.\nAt the ground-breaking ceremony, Slim said he had not seen investment affected. “Investment is continuing. Look at all this. There is no better sign,” he told Reuters, pointing at the construction site.\nThe work on the new diplomatic headquarters in Mexico City comes in the wake of Trump cancelling a trip to London to open a new embassy there.\nTrump said he did not want to endorse a deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old London embassy for “peanuts,” even though the decision to move from Grosvenor Square in up-market Mayfair to the south bank of the Thames was agreed in 2008 under Republican President George W. Bush.\nReporting by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T04:12:58.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
