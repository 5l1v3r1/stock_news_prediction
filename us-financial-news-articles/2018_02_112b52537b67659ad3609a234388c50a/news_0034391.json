Normally, the Peru LNG consortium exports five or six shipments of about 150,000 cubic metres each a month.\nA spokesman for Transportadora de Gas de Peru said repair work on the pipeline was “very advanced” and estimated that shipments to the Peru LNG’s plant on the coast could resume by the end of the week.\nThe Camisea fields, which form Peru’s largest natural gas reserves, are operated by Argentine oil company Pluspetrol. The pipelines that transport the output have suffered various bursts and spills since operations began in 2004.
