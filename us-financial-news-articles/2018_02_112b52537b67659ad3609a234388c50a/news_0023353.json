A return of risk appetite hurt the U.S. currency and helped higher-yielding emerging market currencies as well as commodity-linked currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars.\nVolatility picked up, with the major indexes on Wall Street climbing more than 1 percent shortly after the open, paring about half the advance to once again rise more than 1 percent.\nMSCI’s all-country world index of stock performance in 47 countries rose 0.95 percent, led by Apple Inc and Amazon.com.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.33 percent while MSCI’s gauge of emerging market stocks rose 0.92 percent.\nA major shift in outlook is taking place that involves the reallocation across different areas and sectors of the market, said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York.\n“We’re at an inflection point in the market,” Kenny said. “It’s very significant for a lot of reasons. It involves fear of inflation, a long overdue and much-anticipated pullback, and it involves elevated equity valuations,” he said.\nA man looks at an electronic stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 291.75 points, or 1.21 percent, to 24,482.65, the S&P 500 gained 26.62 points, or 1.02 percent, to 2,646.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 88.03 points, or 1.28 percent, to 6,962.52.\nU.S. Treasury yields rose across most maturities, with the benchmark 10-year note hitting a four-year high. The prospect of strong U.S. economic growth and global central banks normalizing years of easy monetary policy drove yields higher.\nThe 10-year Treasury note fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.8585 percent after earlier hitting 2.902 percent.\nEuro zone government bond yields edged higher on signs that policymakers, with their eyes on inflation, will maintain a monetary tightening path regardless of equity market volatility.\nGermany’s 10-year bond yields, the euro zone’s benchmark, traded around 0.76 percent after earlier rising as high as 0.786 percent.\nThe dollar index fell 0.18 percent, with the euro up 0.29 percent to $1.2269. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.13 percent versus the greenback at 108.67 per dollar.\nOil began to recoup some of last week’s steep losses as global equities steadied.\nBrent crude futures rose 30 cents to $63.09 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for March delivery rose 51 cents to $59.71 a barrel.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T04:46:31.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
