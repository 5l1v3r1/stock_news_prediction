After the disaster, some areas near the plant became no-gone zones, forcing many residents to flee their homes. \nA Tepco spokesman said a ruling was made by the Tokyo court today, but declined to comment further. \nTepco has long been criticized for ignoring the threat posed by natural disasters to the Fukushima plant, and the company and government were lambasted for their handling of the crisis. \nLast year, a district court in Fukushima ruled in the largest class action lawsuit brought over the 2011 nuclear disaster that the company and the Japanese government were liable for damages totaling about 500 million yen. \nA group of about 3,800 people, mostly in Fukushima prefecture, filed the earlier class action suit, the biggest number of plaintiffs out of about 30 similar class action lawsuits filed across the nation.
