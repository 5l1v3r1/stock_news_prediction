In 2016, more than 1 million children died before turning five, the highest number for any nation in the world, the United Nations said.\nJaitley also announced pension reforms to encourage more women to take up formal jobs, by reducing deductions from their pay packets and with the government contributing 12 percent for the first three years.\nLabor rights campaigners said the government was catering only to the formal workforce, ignoring casual workers and the self-employed.\n“The government has offered nothing to the informal sector which constitutes 93 percent of the Indian workforce,” said Chandan Kumar, a campaigner with the charity ActionAid.\n“Workers have been completely ignored by the budget.”\nReporting by Anuradha Nagaraj and Roli Srivastava, Editing by Katy Migiro.
