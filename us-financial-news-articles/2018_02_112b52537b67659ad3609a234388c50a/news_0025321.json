Akzo’s decision to sell the unit was made as part of its strategy to reject a 26 billion euro takeover bid from U.S. rival PPG Industries.\nAkzo rejected the idea of an American owner, saying PPG would be a poor cultural fit and the takeover would lead to job losses.\nCandidates to buy the chemicals division include the Apollo group, private equity firm Carlyle, a teamup between private equity firms Bain Capital and Advent, and Luxembourg-based Hal Investments.\nThe firms have all either declined comment or have not responded to requests for comment on their possible interest in Akzo’s chemicals business..
