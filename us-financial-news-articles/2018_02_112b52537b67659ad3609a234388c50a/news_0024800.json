She did not disappoint.\n”In other competitions and performances, if I made a mistake I would be able to make it up next time. But this was the only chance, this was the moment the world was watching.\n“When I was on the ice rink I couldn’t really see the spectators in the stadium. I was only thinking that I could fall, or that I shouldn’t make any mistakes... that was the only thing on my mind.”\nThe Pyeongchang Olympics run until Feb. 25.\nEditing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:13:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
