The index hit its highest level since August 2015 on Tuesday.\nInvestors are weighing whether the sharp swings are the start of a deeper correction or just a temporary bump in the nine-year bull market, spurred by concerns over rising interest rates and bond yields.\n“While volatility in the markets has eased over the last couple of days, it has remained at very high levels - probably a sign of the ongoing nervousness among investors which may leave markets vulnerable to further declines,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda said in a note.\nAt 9:49 a.m. ET (1449 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 185.41 points, or 0.74 percent, at 24,707.94, and the S&P 500 was down 14.11 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,667.55.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was down 30.45 points, or 0.43 percent, at 7,021.53.\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the industrials index’s 0.57 percent fall leading the decliners.\nDallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Thursday the central bank could hike rates three times this year and the recent market volatility in itself was not enough to change his base scenario.\nMinneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari and Kansas City Fed President Esther George are expected to make appearances at different events later in the day.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield crept back to 2.875 percent, near Monday’s four-year peak of 2.885 percent.\nEconomic data showed weekly jobless claims fell to 221,000 below the 232,000 rise expected by economists, dropping to its lowest level in nearly 45 years as the labor market tightened further.\nAmong stocks, Twitter jumped 23 percent after it reported its first quarterly net profit and topped Wall Street targets as video ad sales rose.\nTeva Pharmaceutical fell 5 percent after the world’s largest generic drugmaker forecast 2018 would be weaker than analysts estimate as the U.S. generics market continues to deteriorate.\nYelp was down 8.5 percent after a host of brokerages cut their price targets on the consumer review website operator’s stock following quarterly results.\nTyson Foods rose 2 percent after the No. 1 U.S. meat processor reported better-than-expected quarterly results.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,782 to 823. On the Nasdaq, 1,658 issues fell and 827 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 12 new highs and 24 new lows.
