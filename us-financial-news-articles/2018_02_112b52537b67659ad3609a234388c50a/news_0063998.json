REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo The entertainment unit is one of few services that Baidu hasn’t opted to fold or sell off as part of a wide-scale restructuring to focus on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.\nThe search engine pulled resources from on-demand services site Nuomi last year and sold its food delivery business to Alibaba-backed Ele.me in August.\nBeijing-based iQiyi has posted losses since its inception in 2010, and reported a net loss of 3.74 billion yuan ($592 million) for 2017, compared with a 3.07 billion yuan loss a year earlier.\nRevenue, however, rose to 17.38 billion yuan from 11.24 billion yuan.\nIt has over 50 million subscribers and more than 420 million monthly active users on mobile devices. The site has a mix of user-generated and original content, including several successful local web-series as well as licensing deals for foreign content.\nLast year the firm became the first Chinese site to ink a licensing deal with Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ), which has struggled to enter the Chinese market due to strict censorship standards.\niQiyi said it plans to use half of the net proceeds from the offering to expand and enhance it content offerings.\nGoldman Sachs (Asia) LLC, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are the lead underwriters to the IPO.\nReporting by Cate Cadell in Beijing and Nikhil Subba in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:16:00.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
