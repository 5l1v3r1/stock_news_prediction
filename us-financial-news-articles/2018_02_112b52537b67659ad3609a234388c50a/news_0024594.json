It also outlined more conventional measures such as low emissions zones.\nFrance’s environment minister in turn said in a statement on Tuesday that it plans a meeting on Thursday with local officials in areas in breach of pollution limits to draft a plan by the end of March. It said that a national plan presented last May should help reduce health-harming emissions.\nItaly sent its own letter to Brussels last week outlining plans to spend 6.5 billion euros to improve air quality “in coming years”, according to a ministry statement. Among the projects are upgrades to local and regional buses and incentives for sustainable transportation projects.\nThe EU Commission can take countries to Europe’s top court if they breach EU law. Poland as well as Bulgaria have already faced legal action over air quality issues.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels; additional reporting by Steve Scherer in Rome, Michelle Martin in Berlin and Nina Chestney in London; Writing by Alissa de Carbonnel; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T19:14:27.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
