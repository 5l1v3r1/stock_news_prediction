Sales in the sterile injectables business rose 16 percent to $167.3 million, while its specialty drugs business, which includes Xiaflex, raked in $124 million, up 8 percent from a year earlier. Xiaflex is approved to treat Peyronie’s disease, a condition that causes painful erections, and Dupuytren’s contracture, a disease that impairs a person’s ability to use their fingers. Net loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to $368.4 million, or $1.65 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $3.34 billion, or $14.98 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Endo earned 77 cents per share, above the average analysts’ estimate of 61 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company booked asset impairment charges of $130.45 million in the latest quarter, well below the $3.52 billion in charges it recorded a year ago. Total revenue fell to $768.6 million from $1.24 billion, but was above analysts’ estimate of $760.1 million.
