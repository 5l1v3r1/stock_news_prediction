Yet China’s manufacturing growth remained elevated in January, suggesting some resilience. \n“The world economy and China in particular have started the year on a relatively firm footing and that’s good news for emerging stocks and assets,” said Hammarlund. \nIn India, stocks initially fell more than 1 percent after the announcement of a long-term capital gains tax on equities. The market later steadied to trade flat. \nThe government also unveiled a budget allocating billions of dollars for rural infrastructure and a health insurance programme. The rupee weakened about 0.35 percent. \nSouth Africa’s rand was the other main currency underperformer, down 0.2 percent. President Jacob Zuma has asked prosecutors to drop corruption charges, responding as pressure mounts for him to step down. \nThe Czech crown was steady against the euro ahead of a central bank meeting today at which it is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent. Czech manufacturing sentiment held at a seven-year high in January. \n“All the signs are that the economy is red hot, the labour market is booming, wage growth is picking up strongly ... so even though inflation hasn’t picked up as much, the central bank is correct in expecting that there will be a pick up at some point,” said Hammarlund. \nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5 \nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets \nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see \nFor TURKISH market report, see \nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) \nEmerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg \non year \nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1251.82 -2.77 -0.22 +8.06 \nCzech Rep 1138.53 +7.62 +0.67 +5.60 \nPoland 2571.72 +17.91 +0.70 +4.49 \nHungary 40345.48 +156.97 +0.39 +2.46 \nRomania 8392.87 +22.41 +0.27 +8.24 \nGreece 890.68 +11.85 +1.35 +11.01 \nRussia 1294.92 +12.56 +0.98 +12.17 \nSouth Africa 52877.66 +263.01 +0.50 +0.66 \nTurkey 20629.81 +1101.02 +0.92 +4.59 \nChina 3446.24 -34.59 -0.99 +4.21 \nIndia 35927.84 -37.18 -0.10 +5.49 \nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local \nclose currency currency", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T12:43:11.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
