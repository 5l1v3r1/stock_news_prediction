At the bottom were the southern states of Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Alabama.\nFuture Now first announced the list of goals in October when it launched a bid to elect candidates who back such an agenda. It offers support to candidates who sign on to the goals.\nThe group said it planned to release a report on the states’ progress every year.\nReporting by Ellen Wulfhorst, Editing by Robert Carmichael; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
