The statement from the DUP was so unwelcome and so disappointing, but that doesn’t mean we give up.”\nThe two parties, representing mainly Catholic proponents of a united Ireland and Protestant supporters of continued rule by Britain, have failed to meet a number of deadlines, and the latest round of talks fell apart over disagreement on additional rights for Irish-language speakers.\nAppearing to agree with Sinn Fein, Coveney said he had thought the parties had reached an accommodation on the issue in recent days that would have legislated for additional rights as part of a broad recognition of cultural and language diversity.\nSources close to the negotiations told Reuters that some DUP members had issues with the proposed compromise and “robustly raised” their concerns earlier this week.\n“Those gaps were closed, that’s why I don’t understand (that) the commentary yesterday was as definitive as it was,” Coveney said.\nThe absence of an executive has limited Belfast’s say in Britain’s negotiations to leave the European Union, which are set to have a bigger impact on Northern Ireland than on any other part of the United Kingdom.\nMany fear a return to British direct rule would further destabilize a delicate balance between nationalists and unionists who, until last year, had run the province since 2007 under the terms of the 1998 accord that mostly ended decades of sectarian conflict that killed more than 3,600 people.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T11:00:24.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
