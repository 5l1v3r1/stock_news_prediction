The new formulation is twice the potency (300 IU/mL) of currently available rabies immune globulin options, offering a greater concentration of anti-rabies virus antibodies within each mL of volume, and for patients, the potential for fewer injections by significantly reducing the volume of medication administered in each dose.\n\"This is the first advancement in administration of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) treatment in over 40 years,\" said Dr. Charles Rupprecht, expert technical advisor on rabies for the PAHO/WHO, and former chief of the rabies program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \"Because patients are required to be dosed by weight, the increased potency of this new formulation allows more rabies antibodies per mL to go directly into wounds in delicate areas, such as the extremities or face. Administration in these areas has proven to be very uncomfortable for patients, especially children, and challenging for healthcare professionals in administration of the full dose.\"\nThe most common adverse reactions during clinical trials were injection-site pain and headache.\nApproximately 60,000 people in the U.S. each year are treated with postexposure prophylaxis following exposure to an animal that is known, or thought, to have rabies. For patients who have not been vaccinated before, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC recommend immediate prophylaxis following exposure to rabies, including a rabies immune globulin injection directly into the wound site to prevent the virus from entering the central nervous system, which eventually leads to death.\nGrifols has been a trusted provider of rabies immune globulin for over 40 years. This new formulation is the latest version of Grifols' current rabies immune globulin, HyperRAB S/D, which is presently the number one prescribed rabies immune globulin in the United States.\n\"Since the launch of the first version of HyperRAB 40 years ago, nearly a million patients worldwide have received treatment with this product to decrease risks associated with rabies exposure,\" said Bill Zabel, President, Grifols North America Sales and Commercial Operations. \"With HyperRAB now available in a 300 IU/mL strength, physicians can significantly reduce the volume of medication delivered in each dose, which is the single biggest challenge today. This new formulation increases the long-standing confidence physicians have in what Grifols' rabies immune globulin treatment can deliver to patients who need protection from a condition that is essentially 100 percent fatal.\"\nHyperRAB will now be available to U.S. patients in two sizes (1 mL/300 IU and 5 mL/1500 IU). This new formulation is manufactured using a sophisticated caprylate chromatography process, which significantly reduces procoagulant activity and product impurities such as IgG aggregates. This product is manufactured according to the highest quality and safety standards and includes labeling for prion removal. Grifols plans to expand its vial size offerings in the coming months.\nIndications and Usage\nHyperRAB ® (rabies immune globulin [human]) 300 IU/mL is indicated for postexposure prophylaxis, along with rabies vaccine, for all persons suspected of exposure to rabies, except persons who have been previously immunized with rabies vaccine and have a confirmed adequate rabies antibody titer, who should receive only vaccine.\nHyperRAB is now manufactured at a higher strength (300 IU/mL) relative to the predecessor solvent/detergent treated product (HyperRAB S/D, 150 IU/mL).\nEvaluate risks of contracting rabies infection. Consult with local or state public health officials if questions arise about the need for rabies prophylaxis.\nLimitations of Use\nFor unvaccinated persons, the combination of HyperRAB and vaccine is recommended for both bite and nonbite exposures regardless of the time interval between exposure and initiation of postexposure prophylaxis.\nBeyond day 7 after administering rabies vaccine, HyperRAB is not indicated, because an antibody response to vaccine is presumed to have occurred.\nImportant Safety Information\nAdminister HyperRAB cautiously to patients with a history of prior systemic allergic reactions following the administration of human immunoglobulin preparations. Have epinephrine available for treatment of acute allergic symptoms, should they occur.\nWeigh the benefits of administering HyperRAB to persons with isolated immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency against the potential risks of hypersensitivity reactions. Such persons have increased potential for developing antibodies to IgA and could have anaphylactic reactions to subsequent administration of blood products that contain IgA.\nInject intramuscularly only. Do not administer HyperRAB intravenously because of the potential for serious reactions. Do not inject into a blood vessel.\nAs with all preparations administered by the intramuscular route, bleeding complications may be encountered in patients with thrombocytopenia or other bleeding disorders.\nHyperRAB is made from human blood and may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, eg, viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent, and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.\nThe most common adverse reactions during clinical trials were injection-site pain and headache.\nPlease see full Prescribing Information for HyperRAB .\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.
