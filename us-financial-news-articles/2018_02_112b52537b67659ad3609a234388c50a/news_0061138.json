It has fallen 3.1 percent since the start of the year.\nBut a sustained rise in volatility could give investors an opportunity to shift money into the TSX’s cyclical sectors at cheaper levels.\n“Financial stocks should rebound alongside renewed inflation expectations and steeper yield curves,” said Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager, global asset allocation at Fiera Capital Corporation.\nEarlier this month, Canada’s 10-year yield touched its highest since May 2014 at about 2.40 percent. Higher bond yields reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities and increase the net interest margins of banks. Still, an uncertain outlook for the North American Free Trade Agreement could weigh on the shares of auto parts, railroad and energy companies that depend on trade with the United States.\n“Valuations for Canada are cheaper than for the U.S. but NAFTA renegotiations are a wild card,” said Ben Jang, a portfolio manager at Nicola Wealth Management. “Until that is settled, multiple expansion is tough to envision.”\nMultiple expansion occurs when investors are willing to pay a higher price for each dollar of a company’s earnings.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the NAFTA trade agreement with Canada and Mexico if he cannot rework it in favor of the United States.\nOther potential challenges for Canada’s economy could include the uncertain impact of tighter mortgage rules, which took effect at the start of January on a once red-hot housing market, and past interest rate hikes on highly indebted consumers.\nThe Bank of Canada has raised its benchmark interest rate three times since July to 1.25 percent. Money markets expect two further rate hikes this year.\nInvestors worry that rising global interest rates will hurt growth and weigh on the valuation of equities.\n“I think there is going to be more of a fear of recession coming to the U.S. market (in 2019), that’s going to cause more multiple contraction,” Redwood Asset Management’s Taylor said.\nEditing by Ross Finley and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:34:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
