The timing of the IPO has not been decided, and the deliberations have not been affected by this week’s stock market volatility, the sources added. \nThe sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. BMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Bain and Golden Gate declined to comment. \nBased in Houston, BMC provides software that helps corporations organize their information technology management functions. It generated revenue of $1.8 billion for the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, according to Moody‘s. \nBMC has been facing increasing competition from so-called software-as-a-service technology rivals, and last year explored a merger with peer CA Inc ( CA.O ). That deal fell through over challenges in agreeing upon debt financing terms, sources said at the time. \nBMC’s mainframe software business is estimated to generate approximately half of the company’s operating profit and cash flow, yet it is a flat to modestly declining business, Moody’s said in a research note in November. \nJanuary was the strongest month for IPOs on record in terms of proceeds, however IPO activity was blunted this week by wild swings in the U.S. stock market. The receptivity of the IPO market will hinge on such volatility subsiding.
