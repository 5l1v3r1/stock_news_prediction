The co-defendant, Jamal Armstead, later pleaded guilty to attempted murder.\nWriting for Thursday’s majority, Judge Eugene Fahey said prosecutors cannot indefinitely delay trials to gather evidence, and delays such as Wiggins’ erode faith in the “fundamental fairness” of the criminal justice system.\nEven if prosecutors acted in good faith, “their decision to pursue a strategy for Armstead’s cooperation that continued to be unsuccessful after five years cannot justify that extraordinary delay,” Fahey wrote.\nChief Judge Janet DiFiore dissented. She said five years was “an extensive amount of time, even for a murder case,” but prosecutors made “diligent efforts” to move forward and Wiggins “apparently acquiesced” in some of the delay.\nNow 26, Wiggins has been imprisoned at the Green Haven correctional facility, about 65 miles (105 km) north of Manhattan.\n“A 16-year-old kid was held at Rikers Island for over six years without a trial,” said Ben Schatz, a lawyer for the nonprofit Center for Appellate Litigation, who handled Wiggins’ appeal. “We’re glad the court saw this as a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial.”\nA spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance said that office disagreed with the decision, and that some of the delay was “beyond the parties’ control.”\nOfficials including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have been working on a timeline to close Rikers Island, which has been marred by overcrowding and reports of violence.\nThe case is People v Wiggins, New York State Court of Appeals, No. 15.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T00:27:56.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
