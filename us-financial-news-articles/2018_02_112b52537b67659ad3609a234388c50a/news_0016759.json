TPAC is utilizing the services of ICO Advisory Services ( www.icoadvisoryservices.com ) to develop its white paper and to launch its Pre-ICO offering. The digital coins or cryptocurrency will be offered via private placement utilizing a public blockchain platform, which will enable investors to purchase the digital coins in cash. The ICO will be offered as a registered security.\nTPAC is currently developing blockchain technology and apps that enable utilization of bike rentals and compilation of data to track bike usage and carbon reduction. We believe the blockchain technology will provide useful information to end-users to assist them in obtaining Federal and State funding for green energy and carbon reduction compliance. The ebike ICO will also have a ride-sharing app, allowing people in one locale to travel elsewhere and identify, locate and rent our ebike from a local owner.\nAbout TPAC:\nTPAC has been instrumental in designing and manufacturing leading-edge green, ebikes and utility vehicles and is leveraging that knowledge by importing these vehicles into North America, Europe, and Africa through public and private ventures. TPAC is developing additional green energy ventures in Europe and East Africa, including ventures involving ICOs. TPAC also designs and manufactures aerospace spherical bearings and is the only so approved manufacturer in China.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements involving a number of risks and uncertainties.
