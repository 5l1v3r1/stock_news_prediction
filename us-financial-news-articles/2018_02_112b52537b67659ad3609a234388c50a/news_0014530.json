Unemployment is at 4.1 percent, lower than most economists think is sustainable in the long run.\nMany Fed officials, including Williams, see inflation picking up this year after several years when it lingered below the Fed’s 2-percent target. On Friday Williams said wage growth has been “ratcheting up” and is likely to intensify, helping lift inflation along with it.\nStill, Williams, in his prepared remarks to the Financial Women of San Francisco, said he was pleased by what he termed “healthy growth,” but is neither surprised nor concerned.\n“I have boosted my growth forecasts for this year, but I don’t see an economy that’s fundamentally shifted gear,” he said. “Given that the economy’s performing almost exactly as expected, you can expect policymakers to do the same.”\nMarkets are currently pricing in the same three rate hikes this year that the Fed has forecast.\nReporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-03T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T23:55:31.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
