It is set to announce the full-year results on March 9. \nCEO Meinie Oldersma took over in April to lead a turnaround of SIG’s business across Europe. His predecessor, Stuart Mitchell, stepped down after a profit warning. \n“The previous management described SIG as a loose federation and the current management is tightening things up. Inevitably as word gets round there is a new sheriff in town, cracks start to appear and weak practices are identified”, Jefferies analysts said in a client note.
