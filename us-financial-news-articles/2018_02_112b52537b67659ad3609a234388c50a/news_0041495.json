We are now doing things that enable people to book hotels, homes, apartments, rental cars, flights, dinner reservations. Booking Holdings unifies all of these different things,\" Fogel said.\nBooking Holdings currently has six brands: Booking.com, priceline.com, KAYAK, agoda.com, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable.\nBut why make the announcement now?\n\"We've been thinking about this for some time. It is a new year. I have been in the CEO position now for over a year. I felt like it was the right time to do it,\" said Fogel.\nThe timing of the announcement comes as the broader online travel industry faces intense competition from Google , Airbnb and traditional hotel operators.\nGoogle has been criticized for using its dominant position in the internet to advertise its travel services while undercutting online travel players. At the same time, hotels are attempting to lure travelers to book directly on their sites by unveiling more attractive deals and loyalty programs.\nIt seems to be working. Marriott , Hilton and Hyatt all posted higher bookings in the last quarter, despite higher room rates.\nWith competition on the rise, Booking Holdings, Expedia and TripAdvisor and others have been increasing their capital expenditure on marketing and advertising to differentiate their brands and expand their reach into new regions.\nIncreased costs, however, have weighed on profits, which in turn has contributed to the underperformance in online travel stocks.\nExpedia earnings earlier this month missed analyst estimates by a wide margin, prompting the stock to fall 15 percent. On the earnings call, Expedia CEO Mark Okerstrom said the year \"did not end up as we had planned from a financial perspective.\"\nInvestors are now awaiting fourth quarter results from Booking Holdings, which reports results next Tuesday, when it changes its stock symbol to BKNG.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T16:05:09.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
