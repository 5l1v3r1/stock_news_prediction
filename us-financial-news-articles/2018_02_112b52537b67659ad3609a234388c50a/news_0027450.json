Flat glass production rose 3.5 percent to 790 million weight cases.\nThe Chinese building materials industry achieved revenues of 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.19 trillion) in 2017, up 8 percent year on year, as average material prices rose by 8.2 percent after falling for two straight years previously, the MIIT said.\nFlat glass prices have been steadily rising since September, it added.\nReporting by Tom Daly; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T06:32:20.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
