Please refer to a reconciliation to the most applicable GAAP measure and additional information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial information later in this release.\nMANAGEMENT REMARKS\n\"2017 was an excellent year for AGNC,\" commented Gary Kain, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Investment Officer. \"The Company generated a 12.1% economic return on tangible common equity, consisting of $2.16 in dividends per common share and a $0.19 increase in tangible net book value per common share. AGNC's total stock return for the year, assuming reinvestment of dividends, was 23.7%. Finally, AGNC's operating efficiency continued to lead the industry in 2017 with total operating expenses, net of management fees received from MTGE Investment Corp., representing 0.72% of average equity. In today's environment, a low fee structure is a critical consideration for many investors, and we believe our management structure is a significant competitive advantage that will improve as we grow.\n\"Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on opportunities to improve returns for our shareholders through careful asset selection, disciplined risk management, and our operating cost advantage. Within the mortgage investment landscape, we continue to believe that Agency mortgage-backed securities (\"Agency MBS\") provide very favorable risk-adjusted returns for levered investors. As the Federal Reserve (the \"Fed\") reduces its balance sheet and, specifically, its Agency MBS position, we anticipate attractive opportunities will persist, and we strongly believe AGNC is well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.\"\n\"AGNC's financial performance in 2017 is particularly notable given our conservative risk profile throughout the year,\" added Peter Federico, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"In fact, our hedge ratio - the ratio of our interest rate hedges to total borrowings and TBA funded assets - exceeded 90% throughout the year. In addition, we took advantage of favorable equity capital markets to raise over $1.5 billion in accretive capital, while redeeming some of our higher cost preferred stock. As an internally-managed company, we do not have additional management fees associated with new capital, and, as a result, the incremental capital enhanced our net book value and reduced our operating costs as a percentage of our equity.\"\nTANGIBLE NET BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's tangible net book value per common share was $19.69 per share, a decrease of $(0.09) per common share, or -0.5%, from $19.78 per common share as of September 30, 2017. The Company's tangible net book value per common share excludes $551 million, or $1.41 per common share, of goodwill and other intangible assets as of December 31, 2017.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's investment portfolio totaled $72.8 billion, comprised of:\n$71.9 billion of Agency MBS and TBA securities, including: $70.8 billion of fixed-rate securities, comprised of: $45.4 billion 30-year fixed-rate securities, $10.7 billion 30-year TBA securities, $8.9 billion 15-year securities, $5.0 billion 15-year TBA securities, and $0.7 billion 20-year fixed-rate securities; $0.9 billion of collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\"), including principal and interest-only strips; and $0.3 billion of adjustable-rate securities; $0.9 billion of CRT and non-Agency securities; and $29 million of investments in REIT equity securities consisting of shares of MTGE Investment Corp. common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2017, inclusive of TBA securities, 30-year and 15-year Agency MBS fixed rate securities represented 77% and 19% of the Company's investment portfolio, respectively, largely unchanged from 76% and 20%, respectively, as of September 30, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's fixed-rate Agency MBS, inclusive of TBA securities, had a weighted average coupon of 3.55%, compared to 3.54% as of September 30, 2017, comprised of the following weighted average coupons:\n3.65% for 30-year fixed-rate securities; 3.16% for 15-year fixed rate securities; and 3.48% for 20-year fixed-rate securities.\nThe Company accounts for TBA securities (or \"dollar roll funded assets\") as derivative instruments and recognizes dollar roll income in other gain (loss), net on the Company's financial statements.

Refer to \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for additional discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. Amount reported in gain (loss) on derivatives instruments and other securities, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Amount is net of TBAs used for hedging purposes. Amount excludes TBA mark-to-market adjustments. Represents periodic interest costs/income on the Company's interest rate swap portfolio. Amount excludes interest rate swap termination fees and mark-to-market adjustments. \"Catch-up\" premium amortization (cost)/benefit is reported in interest income on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. TBA implied cost of funds is derived from the Company's executed TBA roll levels and TBA delivery assumptions sourced from Barclays for the associated weighted average coupon, weighted average maturity, and 1-month projected CPR. TBA implied asset yields derived from the implied funding costs and gross executed TBA roll levels. Interest rate swap cost of funds represents interest rate swap periodic costs measured as a percent of total mortgage funding (Agency repurchase agreements, other debt and TBA securities). Capital losses in excess of capital gains are not deductible from the Company's ordinary taxable income, but may be carried forward for up to five years from the year of loss and applied against future net capital gains. Investment securities include Agency MBS, CRT and non-Agency securities. Amounts exclude TBA securities. Average repurchase agreements and other debt includes Agency repo, FHLB advances and debt of consolidated VIE's. Amount excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements. Average stockholders' equity calculated as the average month-ended stockholders' equity during the quarter. Tangible net book value per common share excludes preferred stock liquidation preference and goodwill and other intangible assets, net. Average tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage during the period was calculated by dividing the sum of the daily weighted average Agency repurchase agreements, other debt and net TBA position (at cost) outstanding for the period by the sum of average stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude investments in REIT equity securities and goodwill and other intangible assets. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements. Tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage as of period end was calculated by dividing the sum of the amount outstanding under Agency repurchase agreements, other debt, net TBA position (at cost) and net receivable / payable for unsettled investment securities outstanding by the sum of total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude investments in REIT equity securities and goodwill and other intangible assets at period end. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements. Cost of funds excludes swap termination fees, forward starting swaps and costs associated with other supplemental hedges (such as swaptions, U.S. Treasury positions and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements). Average cost of funds for the period was calculated by dividing the total Agency repurchase agreements, other debt, and implied TBA cost of funds and periodic interest rate swap costs by the average Agency repurchase agreement, other debt and TBA balance (at cost) outstanding for the period. Includes forward starting swaps not yet in effect as of reported period-end. Economic return (loss) on tangible common equity represents the sum of the change in tangible net book value per common share and dividends declared on common stock during the period over the beginning tangible net book value per common share.\nSTOCKHOLDER CALL\nAGNC invites stockholders, prospective stockholders and analysts to attend the AGNC stockholder call on February 1, 2018 at 8:30 am ET.

For further information, please refer to www.AGNC.com .\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains . Forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management of the Company at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Actual results could projected in these due to a variety of important factors, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, changes in the yield curve, changes in prepayment rates, the availability and terms of financing, changes in the market value of the Company's assets, general economic conditions, market conditions, conditions in the market for Agency securities, and legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect the business of the Company. Certain factors that could cause actual results to contained in , are included in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Copies are available on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov . The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt or new information, or otherwise.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company's results of operations discussed in this release include certain non-GAAP financial information, including \"net spread and dollar roll income,\" \"net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization,\" \"economic interest income\" and \"economic interest expense\" (both components of \"net spread and dollar roll income\"), \"estimated taxable income\" and the related per common share measures and certain financial metrics derived from such non-GAAP information, such as \"cost of funds\" and \"net interest margin.\"\"Net spread and dollar roll income\" is measured as (i) net interest income (GAAP measure) adjusted to include TBA dollar roll income, interest rate swap periodic costs and dividend income from REIT equity securities (referred to as \"adjusted net interest and dollar roll income\"), plus (ii) management fee income (GAAP measure) and less (iii) total operating expense (GAAP measure). \"Net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization,\" further excludes retrospective \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost or benefit due to changes in projected CPR estimates. Related amounts available to common stockholders exclude non-recurring issuance costs of redeemed preferred stock.\nBy providing users of the Company's financial information with such measures in addition to the related GAAP measures, the Company believes users will have greater transparency into the information used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company also believes that it is important for users of its financial information to consider information related to the Company's current financial performance without the effects of certain transactions that are not necessarily indicative of its current investment portfolio performance and operations.\nSpecifically, in the case of \"adjusted net interest and dollar roll income,\" the Company believes the inclusion of TBA dollar roll income is meaningful as TBAs, which are accounted for under GAAP as derivative instruments with gains and losses recognized in other gain (loss) in the Company's statement of operations, are economically equivalent to holding and financing generic Agency MBS using short-term repurchase agreements. Similarly, the Company believes that the inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements in such measure, which are recognized under GAAP in other gain (loss), is meaningful as interest rate swaps are the primary instrument the Company uses to economically hedge against fluctuations in the Company's borrowing costs and inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlement costs is more indicative of the Company's total cost of funds than interest expense alone. In the case of \"net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization,\" the Company believes the exclusion of \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost or benefit is meaningful as it excludes the cumulative effect from prior reporting periods due to current changes in future prepayment expectations and, therefore, exclusion of such cost or benefit is more indicative of the current earnings potential of the Company's investment portfolio. The Company also believes the exclusion of issuance costs of redeemed preferred stock reported as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders under GAAP is meaningful as they represent non-recurring costs associated capital transactions and are not representative of ongoing costs. In the case of estimated taxable income, the Company believes it is meaningful information as it is directly related to the amount of dividends the Company is required to distribute in order to maintain its REIT qualification status.\nHowever, because such measures are incomplete measures of the Company's financial performance and involve differences from results computed in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, results computed in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, estimated taxable income can include certain information that is subject to potential adjustments up to the time of filing the Company's income tax returns, which occurs after the end of its fiscal year.\nA reconciliation of GAAP net interest income to non-GAAP \"net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization\" and a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP \"estimated taxable income\" is included in this release.\nCONTACT:\nInvestors - (301) 968-9300\nMedia - (301) 968-9303\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agnc-investment-corp-announces-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-results-300591453.html\nSOURCE AGNC Investment Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agnc-investment-corp-announces-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-results-300591453.html", "http://www.agnc.com/"], "published": "2018-02-01T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T01:43:25.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
