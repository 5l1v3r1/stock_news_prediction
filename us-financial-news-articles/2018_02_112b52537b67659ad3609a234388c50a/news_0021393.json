But top officials, including the president, have said that Indonesia’s cultural and religious norms do not accept the LGBT movement.\nActivists have raised concerns that, if approved, the new rules could violate basic rights and be misused to target minorities.\nCurrently, Indonesian law does not regulate homosexuality, except in the ultra-conservative Islamic province of Aceh.\nZeid, a member of the Jordanian royal family who has been in the U.N. post since 2014, said Indonesia was among the most progressive states in Southeast Asia on human rights.\nBut he also urged Jakarta to address past atrocities - like the 1965 massacre of nearly half a million suspected communists, - and human rights abuses in the easternmost province of Papua, and the use of the death penalty.\n“There are some dark clouds on the horizon but ... I hope the common sense and strong tradition of tolerance of the Indonesian people will prevail over populism and political opportunism,” he said.\nReporting by Kanupriya KapoorEditing by Ed Davies and Christopher Cushing\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T11:01:18.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
