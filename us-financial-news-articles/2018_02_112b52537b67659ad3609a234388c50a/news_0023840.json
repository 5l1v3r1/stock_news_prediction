South Korea’s figure skating superstar and Olympic gold medalist Kim Yuna lit the Olympic cauldron.\nThe high-ranking North Korean delegation had landed in South Korea earlier in the day aboard Kim Jong Un’s white private jet which had the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official name, inscribed in black in Korean on its side, followed by the North Korean flag.\nKim Yo Jong and her delegation were greeted by government officials, including Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon, before boarding a bullet train to Pyeongchang. A special train had been prepared just for the visitors, a Blue House pool report said.\nSmiling and seemingly unfazed by cameras flashing during the airport meeting, Kim Yo Jong wore a black coat, matching ankle boots and carried a black purse. Dozens of South Koreans at the airport tried to snap photographs of her on their mobile phones.\nShe was the first member of North Korea’s ruling family to visit the South, while Kim Yong Nam was the most senior North Korean official to make a cross-border trip.\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his wife Kim Jung-sook, North Korea's nominal head of state Kim Yong Nam, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's younger sister Kim Yo Jong, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Buedenbender sit at the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea February 9, 2018. Yonhap via REUTERS The pair will have lunch with Moon at the Blue House on Saturday, Moon’s office said.\nRIOTS AND GAMES Pence had kept open the possibility for some contact with the North Koreans in South Korea, while reiterating Washington’s insistence that denuclearisation by North Korea is a necessary condition for permanent peace.\nPence, Kim Yo Jong and other world leaders attended the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, just 80 km (50 miles) from the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea.\nSlideshow (11 Images) Pence stood to welcome the U.S. athletes as the Korean pop hit Gangnam Style blared around the stadium, sparking the ‘Horse Dance’ in the crowd and among the volunteers.\nHundreds of anti-North Korea protesters scuffled with riot police hours not far from the main stadium before the opening ceremony began, with some of their banners reading “Moon regime is leading Korea to destruction”.\nThousands of spectators, including a squad of more than 200 North Korean cheerleaders, packed the frigid stadium for the opening ceremony.\n“It is not as cold as I expected. It is a blessed day. I like the reconciliatory mood and I have high expectations,” said Kim Sang-yoon, a 44-year-old businessman who drove nearly five hours to see the opening ceremony with his wife and two sons.\nNearly 500 North Koreans have arrived in South Korea for the Olympics, which run until Feb. 25.\nAthletes from the 93 countries marched to the beat of K-pop songs, which also included global sensation boy band BTS’ ‘DNA’.\nElsewhere in the stadium, a Kim Jong Un impersonator was not made as welcome as the North Koreans in the VIP box and was ejected by security.\n“Well is my sister getting the same treatment?” he demanded to know.\nDespite freezing temperatures, Tongan athlete Pita Taufatofua bore his country’s flag again, oiled up and shirtless as he was when his appearance at the 2016 Rio Olympics went viral.\nReporting by Hyonhee Shin and Christine Kim in SEOUL, Heekyong Yang in INCHEON, Jane Chung and Hyunjoo Jin in PYEONGCHANG; and Linda Sieg and Kaori Kaneko in TOKYO; Writing by Lincoln Feast; Editing by Paul Tait and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T03:10:47.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
