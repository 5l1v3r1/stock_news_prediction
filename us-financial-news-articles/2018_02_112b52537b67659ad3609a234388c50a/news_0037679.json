I was maybe a little bit surprised. It’s nice for me to beat her for once because she has been beating me so many times,” said Hansdotter.\n“It’s completely magic. I’ve battled so hard for this medal. Winning Olympic gold is a dream”.\nAustria’s Katharina Gallhuber, who has never reached the podium in a World Cup race and is ranked 10th in slalom in the World Cup, was in the bronze medal position with Shiffrin fourth, 0.40 behind Hansdotter.\nShiffrin had been aiming to become the first skier to defend an Olympic slalom title but she looked flat in her first leg and needing to make up time in her second run, she was actually slower.\nAlpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Women’s Slalom – Yongpyong Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 16, 2018 - Frida Hansdotter of Sweden, Wendy Holdener of Switzerland and Katharina Gallhuber of Austria react during the victory ceremony. REUTERS/Mike Segar After the race the 22-year-old stepped back from her suggestion that she was struggling with her health and said she had no excuses.\n“The only one who can beat myself in slalom is me and I beat myself in the wrong way today,” she said.\nSlideshow (8 Images) “It’s a really big bummer but I will learn. Coming here and skiing the way that I did, really conservative, was a huge, huge disappointment. It’s hard to explain how that feels but that’s how life goes.”\nHansdotter, a 32-year-old veteran of the World Cup circuit, will become the second Swedish woman to win Olympic slalom following Anja Paerson in Turin in 2006.\nShe was the season World Cup winner in slalom in 2006 and had won slalom silver in the 2015 World Championships in Beaver Creek.\nHoldener wasn’t able to capitalize fully on beautiful first run of 48.89 seconds, as the first skier of the day, but she was delighted to have a silver medal.\n“My legs weren’t that fast on the second run, I felt the pressure so I fought to the end and I’m really happy to get the second place,” she said.\nThe biggest upset was 20-year-old outsider Gallhuber finishing ahead of Shiffrin into bronze after a near perfect second run of 48.83 -- the fastest leg of the day.\n“After the first run I was a bit behind so I knew I needed a really good second run and I had to all in. Yeah, unbelievable that it happened. I am speechless and I can’t believe it,” she said.\nAdditional reporting by Ian Ransom and Rory Carroll; Editing by Greg Stutchbury/Sudipto Ganguly/Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T04:19:45.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
