WHAT IS LACTALIS? \nThe privately held firm is the world’s largest producer of cheese and one of the world’s largest dairy groups. \nFounded in Laval, southwest of Paris, in 1933, the company has expanded steadily over generations of the Besnier family. Its takeover of Italy’s Parmalat in 2011 turned it into a major global player. \nIt now has 75,000 employees and 246 factories in 47 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa, and says its annual sales are around 17.3 billion euros ($21 billion). \nIts most famous product is the President brand of Camembert cheese. \nThe crisis has forced the famously private company to try to be more transparent. Chief Executive Emmanuel Besnier, a 47-year-old who rarely shows his face in public, has been forced to give his first interviews since he took office in 2000. WHEN DID THE LATEST CRISIS BEGIN? \nOn Dec. 1, 2017, tests by the French Health Ministry confirmed that 20 babies had been contaminated by formula produced at the Lactalis factory in Craon, western France. \nOn Dec. 2, it issued a recall of 12 suspected baby milk batches, followed by a further recall of 625 batches on Dec. 12 and a third on Dec. 21. \nLactalis halted operations at the factory on Dec. 8 and announced on Jan. 11 the temporary layoff of 250 workers. \nOn Jan. 12, Lactalis said it would take back all products ever produced at Craon. \nThe recall concerns more than 12 million baby milk tins in France and abroad, from China to Algeria and Spain. Lactalis said the recall targeted 83 countries in all. \nOn Feb. 1, Besnier said Lactalis could have been producing salmonella-tainted baby milk at Craon since 2005. He said the crisis was likely to cost the company hundreds of millions of euros. HOW WAS THE MILK INFECTED? \nLast year’s contaminations have been linked to a salmonella outbreak in 2005 at the Craon plant, then owned by Celia, which contaminated over 140 babies. Lactalis took over Celia in 2006. \nThe salmonella is believed to have been revived following work in the factory in the first half of the year. HOW HAS LACTALIS REACTED? \nAs well as the recalls and promising to compensate affected families, it has said it will permanently close the facility at the Craon plant in which the salmonella was discovered. \nBesnier has questioned the effectiveness of 16,000 tests performed by an unidentified private laboratory last year that had revealed nothing. \n“If the analysis of end-products had revealed the presence of Salmonella Agona, we would of course not have marketed the products and we would have avoided the crisis,” Lactalis said in a statement. \nIt has pledged to reinforce controls on baby milk products and have tests performed by a second laboratory. NUMBER AND LOCATION OF AFFECTED BABIES \nFrance’s Institut Pasteur, the research centre that monitors salmonella, says more than 200 babies have been contaminated since 2005 with Salmonella Agona, the bacteria found at Lactalis’ Craon factory. \nOf these, 141 were contaminated in 2005, another 25 between 2006 and 2017, and 38 in the latest outbreak. \nFrench health authorities have said 36 of the 38 cases last year were clearly linked to Lactalis milk, as well as one in Spain and a suspected one in Greece. A group representing victims’ families say at least 10 more cases are unaccounted for. WHAT IS SALMONELLA? \nThe main symptoms of salmonella infection are stomach ache and diarrhoea, which can lead to dehydration. \nIt can be life-threatening for infants or people weakened by illness. Most healthy people recover within a few days without specific treatment. LEGAL ACTION \nSeveral families have already filed complaints against Lactalis. Some are also planning to take action against French supermarket chains which were selling recalled products despite the recall. \nFrench supermarket chains Leclerc, Auchan, Carrefour and Systeme U have all acknowledged that some of the baby milk remained on their shelves after the recall. \nTwo complaints are already targeting Auchan and Leclerc. \nClass action lawsuits are not possible in France. Each family must file a complaint separately. \nA group of victims said they would pursue their legal complaints regardless of any compensation offered.
