Consumers have also been hit by high inflation and interest rates.\nMexicans’ willingness to buy a big-ticket item like a TV or washing machine fell 1.6 percent from the previous month.\nSimilarly, Mexicans’ perceptions of the economic prospects of their households and the nation as a whole fell 1.4 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.\nThe unadjusted index was 84.2 during the month.\nReporting by Julia Love; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:32:50.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
