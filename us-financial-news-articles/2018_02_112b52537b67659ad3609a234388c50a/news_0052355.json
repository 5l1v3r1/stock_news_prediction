REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch “What I do when I can’t write a song is I just put the guitar down and go and do something else for about a couple of weeks and then come back and then I’ll be able to write a song,” the 27-year-old said.\n“So the way that my mind is now is, I will be able to write songs forever - they probably will start being about pretty mundane things because my life is getting more and more calm.”\nSlideshow (5 Images) Sheeran said he liked the documentary because it showed a song being written from start to finish, rather than just an album being recorded.\n“I like that Murray found a niche that hasn’t really been done before. It’s quite difficult to find something that hasn’t been done in a music movie,” Sheeran said.\nSheeran, who said he planned to make a film next year in which he would play something other than himself, listed “Goodfellas”, “Cool Runnings” and “Love Actually” as his favorite movies.\nCummings told Reuters the documentary would give fans an insight into Sheeran off-stage.\n“When he’s on his own he’s kind of very like relaxed and chilled and stuff. So I think they’re going to see that’s what he’s like because this film just kind of shows what I see every day,” Cummings said.\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Rantala; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T00:22:07.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
