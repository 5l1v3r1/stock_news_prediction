Firms also noted success in entering new markets and securing new clients abroad, the survey’s authors said. \n“While the headline PMI eased slightly from the all-time high that was recorded in December, January’s 57.6 reading is consistent with a sharp improvement in activity,” said Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O‘Sullivan. \n“There is evidence that manufacturers are positioning themselves for ongoing strong customer demand in the months ahead, with stocks of purchases increasing, while stocks of finished goods rose for a third successive month, notwithstanding the uptick in client orders.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T08:21:34.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
