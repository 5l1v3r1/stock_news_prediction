REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo \nAs part of the consultation, which is due to close in May, the government will consider whether new legislation is needed to make it easier to differentiate between employment categories, affecting rights and tax obligations. \nIt comes after a review by the Chief Executive of The Royal Society of Arts Matthew Taylor said last year that many Britons working for firms in the gig economy deserved more entitlements. \nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which is part of legal action over workers’ rights against Uber, said Wednesday’s government response to the review did not go far enough. \n“More than anything else, it is an exercise in kicking the problem into the long grass,” said General Secretary Jason Moyer-Lee. \n“What we needed to see was a serious extension of rights to workers and a serious proposal on government enforcement of employment law, not just a consultation on the topic.” Editing by Stephen Addison", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T02:56:06.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
