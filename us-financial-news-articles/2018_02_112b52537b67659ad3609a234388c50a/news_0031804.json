Still x-ray images online show a person in high heels kneeling among bags and other items.\nThe woman rode through the security screening machine on Sunday in the southern city of Dongguan because she wanted to protect her money, the People’s Daily’s Facebook post and other media reports said.\nMany Chinese migrant workers carry their annual earnings home to family in cash during the Lunar New Year holiday, the busiest travel period of the year.\n“Passengers are warned that not only is this kind of behavior forbidden, but also the radiation from the machine is incredibly harmful to human health,” the People’s Daily said.\nReporting by John Ruwitch; Editing by Nick Macfie\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T08:15:08.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
