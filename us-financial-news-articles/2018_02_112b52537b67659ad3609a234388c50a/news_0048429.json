The call will be simultaneously web cast on PDF Solutions’ website at http://ir.pdf.com/webcasts . A replay of the web cast will be available at the same website address beginning approximately two hours after completion of the live call. A copy of this press release, including the disclosure and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measures, which non-GAAP measures may be used periodically by PDF Solutions’ management when discussing financial results with investors and analysts, will also be available on PDF Solutions’ website at http://www.pdf.com/press-releases following the date of this release.\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Commentary Available Online\nA Management Report reviewing the Company’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results, as well as providing updated first quarter 2018 financial outlook, will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and published on the Company’s website at http://ir.pdf.com/financial-reports .\nInformation Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), PDF Solutions also provides certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of non-recurring items (including severance payments), stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets, and their related income tax effects, as applicable, as well as adjusts for the non-cash portion of income taxes. EBITDAR is calculated by taking GAAP net income, adding back the effects of non-recurring items, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangibles, depreciation expense and income tax provision (benefit). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management internally to measure the Company’s profitability and performance. PDF Solutions’ management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental measures to investors regarding the Company’s ongoing operations in light of the fact that none of these categories of expense has a current effect on the future uses of cash (with the exception of certain non-recurring items) nor do they impact the generation of current or future revenues. These non-GAAP results should not be considered an alternative to, or a substitute for, GAAP financial information, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In particular, these non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures of income or loss as a measure of performance, or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Since management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to measure profitability and performance, PDF Solutions has included these non-GAAP measures to give investors an opportunity to see the Company’s financial results as viewed by management. A reconciliation of the comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures is provided at the end of the Company’s financial statements presented below.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe statements made on the planned conference call regarding the Company's future expected business performance and financial results are forward looking and are subject to events and circumstances of the future.
