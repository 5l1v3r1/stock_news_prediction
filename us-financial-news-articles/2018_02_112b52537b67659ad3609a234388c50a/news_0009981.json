The troops have been mostly training and advising Iraqi forces. \nIn a statement, the coalition said it would “shift its focus in Iraq from enabling combat operations to sustaining military gains against” Islamic State militants. \n“The Coalition will tailor our forces in consultation with our Iraqi partners in order to ensure the lasting defeat of Daesh,” the director of operations for the coalition, Brigadier General Jonathan Braga, said. \nBraga said that even if the composition of the force changes, the coalition would maintain the capabilities and presence to continue to train, advise and equip Iraqi forces to ensure that Islamic State does not re-emerge. \nU.S. officials say that while Islamic State has lost most of the territory it once controlled in Iraq and Syria, there is concern about the remaining fighters returning to insurgency tactics.
