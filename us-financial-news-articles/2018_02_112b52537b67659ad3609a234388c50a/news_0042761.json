That could take months.\nCongressional aides say the publication will trigger a 60-legislative-day deadline for Congress to vote on whether to overturn the FCC’s decision. U.S. Senate Democrats, which hold 49 seats in the 100-person chamber, have the backing of 50 senators for repeal, leaving them one vote short of a majority.\nDemocrats need 51 votes to win any proposal in the Republican-controlled Senate because Vice President Mike Pence can break any tie.\nEven if Democrats do win a Senate majority, reinstatement of net neutrality would also require a favorable vote in the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a larger majority, and would still be subject to a likely veto by President Donald Trump.\nThe repeal of the net neutrality rules was a victory for internet service providers like AT&T Inc ( T.N ), Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ), conferring power over what content consumers can access.\nOn the other side, technology companies including Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL.O ) and Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) have thrown their weight behind the congressional bid to reverse the net neutrality repeal.\nThe FCC December order also seeks to preempt states from imposing their own net neutrality rules. But governors in Vermont, Hawaii, Montana, New Jersey and New York have signed orders pledging to only do business with internet providers that abide by net neutrality rules.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:01:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
