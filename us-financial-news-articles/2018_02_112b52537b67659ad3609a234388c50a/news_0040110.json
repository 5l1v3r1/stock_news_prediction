While it is not a sanctions list, Western banks may be reluctant to deal with Russian companies whose owners are on the list.\nEn+ has invited international banks to pitch for the sale of $1 billion of shares in the company, three sources told Reuters last week. However, the inclusion of Deripaska on the U.S. list is making some U.S. banks who worked with En+ on its initial public offering in November wary about participating this time, one of the sources said.\nDeripaska’s En+ owns assets in metals and energy, including a 48 percent stake in Rusal, a Hong Kong-listed Russian aluminum producer, which is a big consumer of hydroelectricity produced by En+’s power companies.\nDeripaska has decided to relinquish direct operational control in the two companies because En+ became a publicly-listed company after its share sale in November, one of the sources told Reuters. The boards of directors of En+ and Rusal will consider the management changes at their meetings on Feb. 22, the source added.\nThe upcoming management re-shuffle was first reported by the Russia’s Kommersant newspaper on Monday. Maxim Sokov, En+ current chief executive officer, will become En+’s president, Kommersant said.\nVladislav Soloviev, Rusal CEO, will become CEO of En+ and president of Rusal, while Rusal’s current chief financial officer, Alexandra Bouriko, will be appointed Rusal CEO, one of Reuters’ sources said.\nRusal and En+ declined official comment.\nMost metal sector analysts saw the news as neutral for Rusal and En+ given that a succession plan has already been lined up, drawing on existing company managers, which should ensure continuity.\nBut some analysts questioned the timing of Deripaska stepping down.\nRusal owns a stake in Norilsk Nickel ( GMKN.MM ), and a power struggle over the nickel producer resurfaced on Friday. Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin has offered to buy the $1.5 billion stake in the mining group held by Roman Abramovich, owner of the Chelsea soccer club. Deripaska tried to block the deal.\n“The timing looks a bit strange, coinciding with the resumption of the shareholder conflict at Norilsk Nickel,” analysts at Aton said in a note.\nReporting by Polina Devitt and Anastasia Lyrchikova; editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T15:18:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
