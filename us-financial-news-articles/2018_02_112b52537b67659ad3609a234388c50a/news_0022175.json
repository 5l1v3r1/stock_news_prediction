Things haven’t quietened down,” said Jason Ware, chief investment officer and chief economist at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n“As rates rise, things, as far as equity investors are concerned, are getting worse,” he said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 762.23 points, or 3.06 percent, to 24,131.12, the S&P 500 lost 72.46 points, or 2.70 percent, to 2,609.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 202.47 points, or 2.87 percent, to 6,849.52.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.74 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.98 percent.\nEmerging market stocks lost 1.10 percent.\nThe recent selloff, sparked by last Friday’s jump in Treasury yields, sent the VIX index, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” sharply higher. The index was back up above the 30 level on Thursday.\nA visitor is seen as market prices are reflected in a glass window at the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in Tokyo, Japan, February 6, 2018.

The Bank of England raised its growth forecasts for Britain due to the strong global recovery.\n“We’ve got yet another confirmation that a major central bank is wringing its hands over the possibility that economic growth is accelerating beyond current capacity,” said Jim Vogel, an interest rate strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.\nAlso underpinning yields, U.S. congressional leaders Wednesday reached a two-year budget deal to raise government spending by almost $300 billion.\nWhile the deal was a rare display of bipartisanship that should stave off a government shutdown, it looks set to widen the U.S. federal deficit further and could fan inflation.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.8367 percent, from 2.832 percent late on Wednesday.\nEuropean bond yields also rose, lifted by the prospect of increased fiscal spending after Wednesday’s coalition government deal in Germany.\nRelated Coverage Meltdown raises fears of 'financial innovation the planet doesn't really need' Oil prices fell after data showed U.S. crude output had reached record highs and the North Sea’s largest crude pipeline reopened following an outage.\nU.S. crude oil dropped 1 percent to settle at $61.15 a barrel, while Brent fell 1.1 percent to $64.81.\nIn the foreign exchange market, the dollar was flat after earlier hitting two-week highs against a basket of major currencies as investors reduced bearish bets on the greenback.\nThe dollar index rose 0.03 percent, with the euro down 0.11 percent to $1.2248.\nAdditional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, Megan Davies and Karen Brettell in New York, Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo and Sujata Rao in London; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T03:32:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
