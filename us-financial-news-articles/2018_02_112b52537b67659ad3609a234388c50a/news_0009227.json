Hong Kong is particularly exposed to U.S. rate moves because its currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar.\nThe HSCE, an index tracking Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms, tumbled 5.9 percent, its biggest single-day drop since July 2015.\nThe market was little helped by a second-day of heavy bargain-hunting from Chinese investors, who on Tuesday spent more than 8 billion yuan ($1.27 billion) buying Hong Kong stocks via the Stock Connect linking the mainland and Hong Kong.\nAlbert Xu, Hong Kong-based strategist at Zhongtai International Securities Ltd, said investors had been too complacent and that a correction in global equities was overdue.\n“A sharp correction at such a high level is a normal thing,” Xu said.\nReflecting surging investor anxiety, the HSI Volatility Index which has been climbing this year, surged to its highest level since June 2016.\nStocks fell across the board. China’s biggest lenders and insurers such as ICBC, Bank of China, China Life and Ping An slumping around 6 percent.\nStill, some investors believe the tumble creates a buying opportunity.\n“Overall valuations in Hong Kong stock market are still relatively low, so it will attract fund inflows that hope to buy at the bottom after a short-term adjustment,” Yang Delong, managing director at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund.\n“The downside for Hong Kong stocks is smaller than for the U.S. market and after this round of adjustment, Hong Kong stock market is likely to regain momentum,” Yang said.
