X-ray shows no damage, according to team doctor Jacob Swanberg,” the team wrote in an email to Reuters, a day after the crash during the final jump in Hedberg’s first run at the snowboard slopestyle qualifications. \nThe 24-year-old Hedberg was taken from the slopes in a neck brace after Friday’s accident. \nHedberg broke his neck last March in an accident during an event in Italy and underwent surgery. He returned to competition last November.
