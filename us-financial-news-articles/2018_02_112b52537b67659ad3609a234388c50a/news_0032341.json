He took the platter.” Figure Skating – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Team Event Men's Single Skating Free Skating competition final – Gangneung Ice Arena - Gangneung, South Korea – February 12, 2018 - Patrick Chan of Canada reacts. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson DRASTIC CHANGES \nTo make the most of his final Games and the last months of his competitive career, Chan made a bold coaching change just weeks ahead of Pyeongchang, a move he said has helped him rekindle his passion for figure skating. \nAfter finishing a disappointing fourth at the Skate Canada grand prix event last year, Chan -- who has said he would retire after Pyeongchang -- realised he needed a change.

I know the competitor that Patrick is. I can’t wait to see what he does in his individual event.” Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber, additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T12:50:16.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
