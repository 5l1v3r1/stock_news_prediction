REUTERS/Dondi Tawatao “Most likely, he is here with the intention to recruit ISIS sympathisers in Mindanao,” dela Rosa said, using another acronym for Islamic State.\nHe said Lassoued has been travelling to Malaysia, the Philippines and Turkey in the last two years and first arrived in Manila in June 2016 on a Tunisian passport, which was found to be fake.\nLassoued was born in the United Arab Emirates and is of Libyan and Tunisian descent but lived in Syria for many years, he added.\nThe suspect may have helped recruit for the pro-Islamic State Maute group, which led a siege of southern Marawi City last year, he added.\nAppearing before a prosecutor, Lassoued denied the police allegations. He said he had fled Syria as Islamic State militants sought to establish a foothold there.\nReporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T10:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T11:18:34.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
