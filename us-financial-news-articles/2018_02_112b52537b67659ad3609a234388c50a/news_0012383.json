With the combined success of our results last year, our outlook for 2018, and the recent change in the federal tax law, we are awarding an equity grant of approximately $2,000 for each Blackbaud employee not currently receiving equity so that all employees are owners and can participate in the company's success.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016 Results:\nTotal GAAP revenue was $217.0 million, up 9.4%, with $181.9 million in GAAP recurring revenue, representing 83.8% of total GAAP revenue, and $151.9 million in GAAP subscription revenue, representing 70.0% of total GAAP revenue. Total non-GAAP revenue was $218.8 million, up 10.3%, with $183.7 million in non-GAAP recurring revenue, representing 84.0% of total non-GAAP revenue, and $153.7 million in non-GAAP subscription revenue, representing 70.3% of total non-GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP organic revenue increased 4.4%, non-GAAP organic recurring revenue increased 8.8%, and non-GAAP organic subscription revenue increased 16.2%. GAAP income from operations decreased 22.0% to $18.7 million, with GAAP operating margin decreasing 350 basis points to 8.6%. Non-GAAP income from operations increased 5.0% to $46.0 million, with non-GAAP operating margin decreasing 110 basis points to 21.0%. GAAP net income increased 77.7% to $30.7 million, with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.64, up $0.28. Non-GAAP net income increased 5.1% to $29.4 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.61, up $0.02. Non-GAAP free cash flow was $43.4 million, a decrease of $0.6 million.\n\"We achieved our 2017 full-year financial guidance, exceeding the mid-point of our estimates and topping the high-end of our free cash flow range, executed against our long-term aspirational goals, and as our 2018 full-year financial guidance shows, we're optimistic about the year ahead,\" said Tony Boor, Blackbaud's executive vice president and CFO. \"Our free cash flow improvement is particularly strong for a second consecutive year. We're updating our non-GAAP tax rate to correlate with our GAAP estimate, reducing our full-year tax rate from 32% in 2017 to 20% in 2018, which is primarily driven by the U.S. federal rate change. We're also adopting ASC606 in 2018 and expect the largest financial effect to be associated with the deferral of commissions expense, which will positively impact our profitability.\"\nAn explanation of all non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this press release, including Blackbaud's definition of non-GAAP free cash flow, is included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" A reconciliation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.\nRecent Company Highlights:\nBlackbaud announced it will integrate its cloud fundraising and engagement solutions with Facebook fundraising solutions .

Such reconciliations would require unreasonable efforts at this time to estimate and quantify with a reasonable degree of certainty various necessary GAAP components, including for example those related to compensation, acquisition transactions and integration, tax items or others that may arise during the year. These components and other factors could materially impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures, which may differ significantly from their non-GAAP counterparts.\nAdoption of Statement of Cash Flow Presentation Accounting Standard\nDuring the three we early adopted ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Restricted Cash, which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. We retrospectively applied the changes in presentation to the statements of cash flows and no longer classify changes in restricted cash due to customers and due to customers as operating activities. Instead, changes in due to customers are now classified as financing activities. The impacts of adoption are reflected in the financial information herein. Future financial information presented in accordance with ASU 2016-18 will also include immaterial adjustments to reflect certain prior period errors. We will provide more detailed information regarding the impact of the early adoption of ASU 2016-18 in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nConference Call Details\nWhat:\nBlackbaud's 2017 Fourth Quarter Conference Call\nWhen:\nFebruary 7, 2018\nTime:\n8:00 a.m. (Eastern Time)\nLive Call:\n800-289-0462 (US/Canada); passcode 492095.\nWebcast:\nBlackbaud's Investor Relations Webpage\nAbout Blackbaud\nBlackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB) is the world's leading cloud software company powering social good.

These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Although Blackbaud attempts to be accurate in making these forward-looking statements, it is possible that future circumstances might differ from the assumptions on which such statements are based. In addition, other important factors that could cause results to differ materially include the following: management of integration of acquired companies; uncertainty regarding increased business and renewals from existing customers; a shifting revenue mix that may impact gross margin; continued success in sales growth; risks related to our dividend policy and stock repurchase program, including the possibility that we might discontinue payment of dividends; and the other risk factors set forth from time to time in the SEC filings for Blackbaud, copies of which are available free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or upon request from Blackbaud's investor relations department. Blackbaud assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nTrademarks\nAll Blackbaud product names appearing herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of Blackbaud, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nBlackbaud has provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information includes non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP recurring revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Blackbaud has acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred revenue. In accordance with GAAP reporting requirements, Blackbaud recorded write-downs of deferred revenue to fair value, which resulted in lower recognized revenue. Both on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, the revenue for the acquired businesses is deferred and typically recognized over a one-year period, so Blackbaud's GAAP revenues for the one-year period after the acquisitions will not reflect the full amount of revenues that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value. The non-GAAP measures described above reverse the acquisition-related deferred revenue write-downs so that the full amount of revenue booked by the acquired companies is included, which Blackbaud believes provides a more accurate representation of a revenue run-rate in a given period. In addition to reversing write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue, non-GAAP financial measures discussed above exclude the impact of certain items that Blackbaud believes are not directly related to its performance in any particular period, but are for its long-term benefit over multiple periods.\nIn addition, Blackbaud uses non-GAAP organic revenue growth, non-GAAP organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP organic subscriptions revenue growth and non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth, in analyzing its operating performance. Blackbaud believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, for evaluating the periodic growth of its business on a consistent basis. Each of these measures excludes incremental acquisition-related revenue attributable to companies acquired in the current fiscal year. For companies acquired in the immediately preceding fiscal year, each of these measures reflects presentation of full-year incremental non-GAAP revenue derived from such companies as if they were combined throughout the prior period, and it includes the non-GAAP revenue attributable to those companies, as if there were no acquisition-related write-downs of acquired deferred revenue to fair value as required by GAAP. In addition, each of these measures excludes prior period revenue associated with divested businesses. The exclusion of the prior period revenue is to present the results of the divested businesses within the results of the combined company for the same period of time in both the prior and current periods. Blackbaud believes this presentation provides a more comparable representation of its current business' organic revenue growth and revenue run-rate.\nNon-GAAP free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, including costs required to be capitalized for software development, and capital expenditures for property and equipment.\nBeginning in 2018, Blackbaud intends to update the non-GAAP tax rate it applies when calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in future periods. Since the first quarter of 2016, for the purposes of determining non-GAAP net income, Blackbaud has utilized a non-GAAP tax rate of 32.0% in its calculation of the tax impact related to non-GAAP adjustments. Blackbaud intends to adjust this rate to 20.0% to better reflect its periodic effective tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP and its current expectations related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017 and, among other items, reduces the federal tax rate for corporations from 35.0% to 21.0% beginning in 2018. The non-GAAP tax rate utilized in future periods will be reviewed annually to determine whether it remains appropriate in consideration of Blackbaud's financial results including its periodic effective tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP, its operating environment and related tax legislation in effect and other factors deemed necessary. All fourth quarter and full year 2017 measures of the tax impact related to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included in this news release are calculated under Blackbaud's historical methodology.\nBlackbaud uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating Blackbaud's ongoing operational performance. Blackbaud believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect the Blackbaud's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparison and analysis of trends in its business. In addition, Blackbaud believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial results from period-to-period with other companies in Blackbaud's industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nConsolidated balance

acquisition-related revenue excludes incremental acquisition-related revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP that is attributable to companies acquired in the current fiscal year. For companies acquired in the immediately preceding fiscal year, non-GAAP acquisition-related revenue reflects presentation of full-year incremental non-GAAP revenue derived from such companies, as if they were combined throughout the prior period, and it includes the non-GAAP revenue from the acquisition-related deferred revenue write-down attributable to those companies.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP revenue for the prior year periods presented herein may not agree to non-GAAP revenue presented in the respective prior period quarterly financial information solely due to the manner in which non-GAAP organic revenue growth is calculated.\n(3)\nTo determine non-GAAP organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis, revenues from entities reporting in foreign currencies were translated to U.S. Dollars using the comparable prior period's quarterly weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. The primary foreign currencies creating the impact are the Canadian Dollar, EURO, British Pound and Australian Dollar.\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2017\n2016\nGAAP net cash provided by operating activities\n$\n176,290\n$\n153,628\nLess: purchase of property and equipment\n(10,208)\n(17,694)\nLess: capitalized software development costs\n(28,345)\n(26,359)\nNon-GAAP free cash flow\n$\n137,737\n$\n109,575\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackbaud-announces-2017-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results-300593849.html\nSOURCE Blackbaud, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://blackbaudnews.com/press-release/giving-tuesday-2017-donations.htm", "https://blackbaudnews.com/press-release/catherine-lacour-blackbaud-cmo.htm", "https://blackbaudnews.com/press-release/blackbaud-facebook-integration.htm", "http://www.blackbaud.com/press-room", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackbaud-announces-2017-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results-300593849.html", "http://www.sec.gov/", "https://blackbaudnews.com/company-blog/blackbaud-forbes-best-employers-for-diversity.htm", "http://www.blackbaud.com/", "http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176673&p=irol-irhome", "https://blackbaudnews.com/press-release/blackbaud-acquires-justgiving.htm"], "published": "2018-02-07T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T04:01:28.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
