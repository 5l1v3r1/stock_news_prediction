Labor shortages have become so pronounced that companies in retail and other services have started to shorten operating hours or scale back business operations.\nThe government is scheduled to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in 2019. The last time the sales tax was hiked in 2014, it caused big fluctuations in consumer spending and a temporary contraction in gross domestic product.\nReporting by Stanley White; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:46:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
