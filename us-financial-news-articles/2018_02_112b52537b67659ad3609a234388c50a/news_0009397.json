These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, without limitation: relationships with key customers; levels of residential and commercial construction activity; competitive and pricing factors; levels of global industrial production; demand for our products; industry and economic conditions that affect the market and operating conditions of our customers, suppliers or lenders; domestic and international economic and political conditions, including new legislation, policies or other governmental actions in the U.S. or elsewhere, including the impact of recent tax reform legislation and related actions, interpretations, and regulatory guidance on our financial condition and results of operations (including the assumptions we make related thereto); foreign exchange and commodity price fluctuations, our level of indebtedness; weather conditions; availability and cost of credit; availability and cost of energy and raw materials; issues involving implementation and protection of information technology systems; labor disputes; legal and regulatory proceedings, including litigation and environmental actions; our ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards; research and development activities and intellectual property protection; interest rate movements; uninsured losses; issues related to acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures; achievement of expected synergies, cost reductions and/or productivity improvements; defined benefit plan funding obligations; price volatility in certain wind energy markets in the U.S.; and factors detailed from time to time in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The information in this news release speaks as of February 5, 2018, and is subject to change. The company does not undertake any duty to update or revise forward-looking statements except as required by federal securities laws. Any distribution of this news release after that date is not intended and should not be construed as updating or confirming such information.\nThis release contains references to certain “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined by the SEC, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). Earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), when used outside of a segment profitability measure, is also a non-GAAP measure. Management believes these measures, and exclusions from GAAP therein, provide useful information to investors. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the corresponding GAAP measures. When the company provides forward-looking expectations for non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures are generally not available without unreasonable effort due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from the non-GAAP measures in future periods. The variability in timing and amount of adjusting items could have significant and unpredictable effects on future GAAP results.\nOwens Corning Investor Relations News\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180205005532/en/\nOwens Corning\nMedia Inquiries:\nChuck Hartlage, +1-419-248-5395\nchuck.hartlage@owenscorning.com\nor\nInvestor Inquiries:\nThierry Denis, +1-419-248-5748\nthierry.j.denis@owenscorning.com\nSource: Owens Corning", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180205005532/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.owenscorning.com&esheet=51753390&newsitemid=20180205005532&lan=en-US&anchor=www.owenscorning.com&index=1&md5=a8e34f7540a9b5ccc13126f0f6ac844a"], "published": "2018-02-05T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T20:16:01.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
