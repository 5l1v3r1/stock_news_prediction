However, this is not likely to be without cost as should it seek to do so it could become embroiled in lengthy litigation,” analysts at Berenberg said.\nReporting by Patricia Uhlig; Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Tom Sims and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T12:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T12:55:24.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
