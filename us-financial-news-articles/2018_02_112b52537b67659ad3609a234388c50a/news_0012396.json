The new round was funded by JAWS, the family office of Sternlicht, chairman of investment firm Starwood Capital Group and Starwood Property Trust Inc ( STWD.N ), a real estate investment trust; real estate brokerage Marcus & Millichap ( MMI.N ) and billionaire businessman John Catsimatidis, among others.\nReonomy takes disparate data about a commercial real estate property to create a composite view of the asset, using both public and third-party information, said Richard Sarkis, the firm’s founder.\nReonomy also has been building a database to identify the owners behind limited liability companies to help underwriters of commercial real estate debt better assess an asset’s risk, he said.\nReonomy will use the funds to develop new products and use technology, such as machine learning, to gather data in an industry that often uses manual input, Sarkis said.\nInformation for commercial real estate is dominated by Washington-based CoStar Group Inc ( CSGP.O ), with a market capitalization of $12.4 billion.\nCoStar has no real competition and is so far ahead in the commercial real estate data business that it is unrealistic for new entrants, said Brad Schwer, a Morningstar analyst.\n“What we are seeing are companies honing in on subsections of particular markets. But in terms of taking on the country as a whole, we view it as a hopeless endeavor,” Schwer said.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:18:12.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
