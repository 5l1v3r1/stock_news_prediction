He instructs the co-founders to bottle them, which Gabuzzi agrees to do.\nThe businessman is also concerned about the small size of their company. He requests that they write up a pro-forma, which is a summary of present and projected finances that includes revenue and expenses. Ratto volunteers to complete this assignment.\nWhen they next meet with Fertitta, Gabuzzi impresses him with two cases of bottled tea that she packaged and designed herself. But when it comes time to look at Ratto's pro-forma, the financial report falls short of his expectations.\n\"This isn't a pro-forma,\" he tells her. The document is lacking vital information from previous years, details on how they plan to grow their company and there are basic financial errors.\n\"I just have a bunch of words with a bunch of numbers next to it,\" says Fertitta. \"This pro-forma looks like you started it last night.\"\nThe billionaire notes that if he can't rely on them to provide a completed pro-forma, he can't rely on them to provide his tea.\nStill, he offers to buy 5,000 bottles of their drink at $3 each because they have a unique high-quality product. But there's a caveat: Fertitta will only commit to buying 5,000 if they go out and sell another 5,000 to someone else.\nHe explains that if they \"hustle\" to sell those other 5,000 bottles, it will prove to him that they are serious about their business. If they can't, then there's no deal.\n\"Y'all need to show me that you can get off your behinds and really make something happen,\" says the billionaire.\nLike this story?
