The drug was already approved in the United States last year.\nHemlibra is among the new medicines that the Basel-based pharmaceuticals maker hopes will offset falling sales of its three biggest drugs, Rituxan, Avastin and Herceptin. Some analysts expect peak Hemlibra sales of more than $4 billion a year.\n‍​ Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz, Editing by Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T19:07:07.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
