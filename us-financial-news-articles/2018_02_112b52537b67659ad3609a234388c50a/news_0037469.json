Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA reflects Mattersight's resources available to invest in its business and strengthen its balance sheet. In addition, expense reduction activities can vary significantly between periods on the basis of factors that management does not believe reflect current-period operating performance. Although similar adjustments for expense reduction activities may be recorded in future periods, the size and frequency of these adjustments cannot be predicted. The Adjusted EBITDA measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nContact\nDavid Mullen\nChief Financial Officer\n312.954.7380\ndave.mullen@mattersight.com\nMATTERSIGHT CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited and in thousands, except per share data) Quarter Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue: Subscription revenue $ 12,787 $ 11,423 $ 43,712 $ 38,720 Other revenue 862 1,136 2,798 3,377 Total revenue 13,649 12,559 46,510 42,097 Operating expenses: Cost of subscription revenue 2,583 2,525 10,159 10,365 Cost of other revenue 1,099 1,379 3,394 3,423 Total cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 3,682 3,904 13,553 13,788 Product development 3,100 2,914 13,295 12,502 Sales and marketing 3,851 3,397 13,389 16,848 General and administrative 2,841 2,877 12,166 11,827 Depreciation and amortization 1,473 1,650 6,347 5,946 Total operating expenses 14,947 14,742 58,750 60,911 Operating loss (1,298 ) (2,183 ) (12,240 ) (18,814 ) Non-operating income (expense): Interest and other borrowing costs (432 ) (1,027 ) (2,785 ) (2,319 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — (1,834 ) — Change in fair value of warrant liability 69 109 377 167 Other non-operating income 2 6 56 39 Total non-operating expense (361 ) (912 ) (4,186 ) (2,113 ) Loss before income taxes (1,659 ) (3,095 ) (16,426 ) (20,927 ) Income tax benefit (provision) 110 (24 ) 106 (50 ) Net loss (1,549 ) (3,119 ) (16,320 ) (20,977 ) Dividends related to 7% Series B convertible preferred stock (146 ) (146 ) (584 ) (586 ) Net loss available to common stockholders $ (1,695 ) $ (3,265 ) $ (16,904 ) $ (21,563 ) Per share of common stock: Basic net loss available to common stockholders $ (0.05 ) $ (0.13 ) $ (0.56 ) $ (0.86 ) Diluted net loss available to common stockholders $ (0.05 ) $ (0.13 ) $ (0.56 ) $ (0.86 ) Shares used to calculate basic net loss per share 31,581 25,366 30,451 25,209 Shares used to calculate diluted net loss per share 31,581 25,366 30,451 25,209 Stock-based compensation expense is included in individual line items above: Total cost of revenue $ 77 $ 72 $ 353 $ 371 Product development 174 271 667 1,134 Sales and marketing 130 282 348 1,697 General and administrative 422 404 1,559 2,122\nMATTERSIGHT CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited and in thousands, except share and per share data) December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 ASSETS Current Assets: $ 9,044 $ 12,538 Receivables net of allowances of $41 and $311, at December 31, 2017 and December 31,\n2016, respectively 6,565 8,508 Prepaid expenses 5,805 4,440 Other current assets 65 296 Total current assets 21,479 25,782 Equipment and leasehold improvements, net of accumulated depreciation and\namortization of $24,955 and $19,748, at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016,\nrespectively 8,572 9,576 Goodwill 972 972 Intangible assets, net of amortization of $4,357 and $3,820, respectively 2,952 3,201 Other long-term assets (includes $2,675 and $4,210 of restricted cash, at December 31, 2017\nand December 31, 2016, respectively) 5,960 6,033 Total assets $ 39,935 $ 45,564 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current Liabilities: Short-term debt $ 93 $ 738 Accounts payable 1,474 1,835 Accrued compensation and related costs 3,312 2,302 Unearned revenue 3,032 4,911 Capital leases 1,967 1,982 Other current liabilities 3,399 3,374 Total current liabilities 13,277 15,142 Long-term debt 17,056 20,839 Long-term unearned revenue 914 757 Long-term capital leases 1,190 1,602 Other long-term liabilities 6,475 5,945 Total liabilities 38,912 44,285 7% Series B convertible preferred stock, $0.01 par value;
