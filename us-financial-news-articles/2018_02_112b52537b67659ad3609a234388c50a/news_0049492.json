Oxfam CEO Mark Goldring said 7,000 individuals canceled donations in the past 10 days.\nHaiti’s president has called for investigations into other groups which went to the Caribbean nation after the earthquake.\nOther agencies that receive money from Mordaunt’s department have until Feb. 26 to provide assurances they effectively safeguarded people or to give details of any breaches.\nPaula Donovan, co-director of Code Blue, a campaign seeking accountability for abuses by U.N. personnel, said it was the hypocrisy of these organizations that irked people.\n“They’re preaching the highest ideals, they have employed people with public monies to abolish and eradicate exactly what they’re accused of committing,” she said.\nFIRINGS The Norwegian Refugee Council said it fired five employees over allegations of sexual abuse, harassment and exploitation last year. The Danish Refugee Council (DRC) dismissed 12 people.\n“Each case is one too many and we work every day to avoid that it happens,” DRC Secretary General Christian Friis Bach told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nCARE International said it sacked 11 staff and another four resigned, contracts were not renewed or left the company.\nU.S. group International Medical Corps said it severed relations with five people over reports of sexual exploitation and abuse in 2017, and was investigating several other cases.\nBangladesh-based agency BRAC dismissed one person and terminated relations with 22 over reports of sexual harassment.\nBritish relief agency Christian Aid said it dismissed a staff member and disciplined another for sexual misconduct.\n“In both cases, no laws were broken, and neither involved incidents against minors,” the charity said in a statement.\nConcern Worldwide said it averaged up to two such incidents a year over the past decade, three quarters of which resulted in dismissals, but could not provide a detailed breakdown.\nCompassion International said it had no reports of staff using prostitutes or sexual exploitation of aid recipients in 2017. Aid agency Catholic Relief Services said it too received no reports of serious violations.\nVatican-based Caritas Internationalis said it had no reports of sexual harassment involving its 30-staff secretariat, while its 165 member organizations globally report into local bishops.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had no reliable historical data about staff misconduct.\nA FIRST STEP Action Against Hunger, Islamic Relief, Action Aid and Plan International said they were working to collate data ahead of the Feb. 26 deadline given by the government.\nThe International Rescue Committee (IRC) did not respond to requests for figures but said it advised donors of misconduct.\n“When allegations against staff members are substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action is taken, which may include termination,” it said in a statement.\nAid experts said it was key for charities to come clean about such cases.\n“Transparency is an important step to having difficult conversations about an issue that we have long struggled to address,” said Megan Nobert, founder of Report the Abuse, a Geneva-based campaign group that collects data on sexual abuse against aid workers.\n“It’s important that we work together to address it.”\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Additional reporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
