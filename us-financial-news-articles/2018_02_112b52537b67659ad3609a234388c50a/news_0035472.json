Importantly, we refined Xperi’s long-term strategy to better position us to drive long term growth, increased cash flow and enhanced shareholder value. Over the year, we generated $147 million in operating cash flow, returned approximately $55 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases, and paid down $100 million of debt just after year end.”\nFinancial Highlights ($ in millions, except per share data)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nRevenue $126.6 $70.1 $373.7 $259.6 GAAP Net Income (Loss) $5.6 $(9.3) $(56.6) $56.1 Non-GAAP Net Income $40.1 $23.3 $71.8 $106.7 GAAP EPS (LPS) $0.11 1 $(0.19)\n$(1.15) $1.12 Non-GAAP EPS $0.77 $0.45 $1.37 $2.06 Other Relevant Metrics Q4 2017\nQ4 2016\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nPurchase Accounting Impact $6.0 2 $0 $51.6 2 $0 Operating Cash Flow $61.6 $40.6 $147.3 $153.9 Cash, Cash Equivalents & S-T Investments $200.7 $113.0 $200.7 $113.0 Total Debt $594.0 $600.0 $594.0 $600.0 Debt Principal Paid $1.5 $0 $6.0 $0 1 GAAP EPS for Q4 2017 reflects the impact of tax adjustments, primarily from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which increased the tax provision by approximately $6.3 million as compared to the estimate in the Company’s preliminary GAAP EPS disclosure on January 24, 2018. This adjustment reduced the Company’s earnings per share from the previous estimate of $0.24 per diluted share to $0.11 per diluted share.\n2 Purchase Accounting Impact represents receipts from contracts with customers that are not recorded as revenue due to purchase accounting rules, but which would have been recorded as revenue if not for the acquisition of DTS. Internally, management includes the cash flow impact from these contracts when evaluating the Company's operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of its management team.\nStock Repurchase Program\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 269 thousand shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $5.3 million. These purchases were executed under the Company's stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $142.8 million remaining under its current repurchase program.\nDividends\nOn December 13, 2017, the Company paid $9.9 million to stockholders of record on November 22, 2017, for the quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock.\nAdditionally, on February 1, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock, payable on March 22, 2018, to stockholders of record on March 1, 2018.\nDebt Repricing\nOn January 23, 2018, the Company completed a successful repricing of its Term B Loans, reducing its borrowing rate by 75 basis points, to a new rate of Libor plus 250 basis points. In connection with the repricing, the Company paid down $100 million of its outstanding debt.\nFinancial Guidance\nConsequent with the introduction of the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606, the Company announced it would begin using billings as a key measure of business progress. As a result, the Company’s outlook is now based on billings rather than revenue. For additional information regarding the Company’s approach to guidance, please review the “ASC 606 Business Metrics and Guidance Approach” presentation given by the Company on January 25, 2018 at http://investor.xperi.com/events.cfm .\nQ1 2018\nGAAP Outlook\nNon-GAAP Outlook\nBillings\n$99M to 104M $99M to 104M FY 2018\nGAAP Outlook\nNon-GAAP Outlook\nBillings\n$415M to 445M $415M to 445M Operating Expense\n$394M to 412M $245M to 263M Cash Tax Payments\n$16M to 20M $16M to 20M Fully Diluted Shares\n50.5 million 52.5 million Operating Cash Flow\n$120M to 145M $120M to 145M Conference Call Information\nThe Company will hold its fourth quarter 2017, earnings conference call at 2:00 PM Pacific time (5:00 PM Eastern time) on Tuesday, February 13, 2018.

Material factors that may cause results to differ from the statements made include the plans or operations relating to the businesses of the Company; market or industry conditions; changes in patent laws, regulation or enforcement, or other factors that might affect the Company's ability to protect or realize the value of its intellectual property; the expiration of license agreements and the cessation of related royalty income; the failure, inability or refusal of licensees to pay royalties; initiation, delays, setbacks or losses relating to the Company's intellectual property or intellectual property litigations, or invalidation or limitation of key patents; fluctuations in operating results due to the timing of new license agreements and royalties, or due to legal costs; the risk of a decline in demand for semiconductors and products utilizing our audio and imaging technologies; failure by the industry to use technologies covered by the Company's patents; the expiration of the Company's patents; the Company's ability to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions of businesses; the risk of loss of, or decreases in production orders from, customers of acquired businesses; financial and regulatory risks associated with the international nature of the Company's businesses; failure of the Company's products to achieve technological feasibility or profitability; failure to successfully commercialize the Company's products; changes in demand for the products of the Company's customers; limited opportunities to license technologies due to high concentration in applicable markets for such technologies; the impact of competing technologies on the demand for the Company's technologies; and other developments in the markets in which the Company operates, as well as management's response to any of the aforementioned factors. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the , which speak only as of the date of this release.\nThe foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included herein and elsewhere, including the Risk Factors included in the Company's recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and other documents of the Company on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The Company's SEC filings are available publicly on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . Any made or incorporated by reference herein are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, the Company or its business or operations. Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nAbout Xperi Corporation\nXperi Corporation (Nasdaq: XPER) and its brands, DTS, FotoNation, HD Radio, Invensas and Tessera, are dedicated to creating innovative technology solutions that enable extraordinary experiences for people around the world.

IP episodic revenue is Semiconductor and IP licensing business revenue payable within one year pursuant to a contract. IP episodic revenue includes non-recurring engineering fees, initial license fees, back payments resulting from audits, damages awarded by courts or other tribunals, and lump sum settlement payments.\nImportantly, a source of IP episodic revenue may become a source of recurring revenue, when, for example, a company settles litigation with the Company by paying a settlement amount and entering into a license agreement that calls for an initial license fee and ongoing royalty payment over several years. In this scenario, the settlement amount would be episodic revenue, as would the initial license fee, and the ongoing royalties would be recurring revenue.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company’s earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures adjusted for discontinued operations, either one-time or ongoing non-cash acquired intangibles amortization charges, acquired in-process research and development, acquisition and related expenses, all forms of stock-based compensation, restructuring and other related exit costs, and related tax effects. The non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the effects of FASB Accounting Standards Codification 718, “Stock Compensation” upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per share. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide investors with important perspectives into the Company’s ongoing business performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. All financial data is presented on a GAAP basis except where the Company indicates its presentation is on a non-GAAP basis.\nSet forth below are reconciliations of Company’s reported GAAP net income (loss) to non-GAAP net income and GAAP to non-GAAP operating expenses guidance for 2018.\nXperi PR:\nJordan Miller, +1 818-436-1082\njordan.miller@xperi.com\nor\nXperi Investor Relations:\nGeri Weinfeld, +1 818-436-1231\ngeri.weinfeld@xperi.com\nSOURCE: XPERI CORP\nXPER-E\nXPERI CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (in thousands) December 31, December 31, 2017 2016* (unaudited) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 138,260 $ 65,626 Short-term investments 62,432 47,379 Accounts receivable, net 17,010 15,863 Unbilled contract receivables 10,866 51,923 Other current assets 16,949 19,150 Total current assets\n245,517 199,941 Property and equipment, net 34,442 38,855 Intangible assets, net 431,789 541,879 Goodwill 385,574 382,963 Other assets 12,702 22,798 Total assets\n$ 1,110,024 $ 1,186,436 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 4,233 $ 7,531 Accrued legal fees 7,483 7,505 Accrued liabilities 47,969 29,086 Current portion of long-term debt 34,451 6,000 Deferred revenue 2,686 895 Total current liabilities\n96,822 51,017 Long-term deferred tax liabilities 15,085 32,565 Long-term debt, net 545,211 577,239 Other long-term liabilities 17,330 17,830 Stockholders' equity: Common stock 60 59 Additional paid-in capital 686,660 644,194 Treasury stock (319,397 ) (300,114 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (303 ) (148 ) Retained earnings 68,556 163,794 Total stockholders' equity\n435,576 507,785 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$ 1,110,024 $ 1,186,436 * Derived from audited financial statements XPERI CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (in thousands, except per share amounts) (unaudited) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue:\nRoyalty and license fees\n$ 126,647 $ 70,135 $ 373,732 $ 259,565 Total revenue\n126,647 70,135 373,732 259,565 Operating expenses: Cost of revenue\n1,938 313 6,308 551 Research, development and other related costs\n27,684 15,740 105,849 44,738 Selling, general and administrative\n36,446 37,315 144,649 72,065 Amortization expense\n27,455 13,744 111,930 31,870 Litigation expense\n9,129 8,531 36,496 20,953 Total operating expenses\n102,652 75,643 405,232 170,177 Operating income (loss) 23,995 (5,508 ) (31,500 ) 89,388 Interest expense (7,416 ) (2,409 ) (28,292 ) (2,409 ) Other income and expense, net 444 1,264 1,449 3,736 Income (loss) before taxes 17,023 (6,653 ) (58,343 ) 90,715 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 11,379 2,649 (1,785 ) 34,626 Net income (loss) $ 5,644 $ (9,302 ) $ (56,558 ) $ 56,089 Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share: Net income (loss) per share -
