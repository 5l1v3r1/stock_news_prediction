REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo “We will never forget the dark chapters of Austrian history, and we clearly deny any downplaying of National Socialism,” said Vilimsky, a member of the European Parliament group that includes the parties of France’s Front National and a Dutch nationalist party led by Geert Wilders.\nNazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938.\nA commission of 30-50 researchers led by FPO politician and historian Wilhelm Brauneder will examine the party’s past, the FPO’s parliamentary group leader, Walter Rosenkranz, said.\nThe FPO has struggled to divert attention from its close ties with German nationalist student networks, widely seen as a gateway between the political far right and neo-Nazis.\nRosenkranz said he hoped the commission could get access to fraternities’ private records.\n“We also want to persuade all critics to provide us with everything still slumbering in their archives,” he said.\nAndreas Schieder, parliamentary leader of the center-left Social Democrats, called the panel “completely implausible” with Brauneder as its head. Schieder said the commission needed independent experts to do a proper job.\nAbout 40 percent of FPO members of parliament, several FPO ministers and numerous FPO ministry staff - including Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache - are members of right-wing fraternities, Austria’s Jewish community has said.\nReporting by Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T16:53:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
