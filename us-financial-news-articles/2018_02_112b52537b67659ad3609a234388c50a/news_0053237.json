The transaction is subject to customary due diligence that will be completed in the coming weeks. Once completed, the Companies will enter into a definitive agreement shortly thereafter.\nPaul Ogilvie, CEO, commented: “The relationship between our properties is directly in the same historical past producing zones, this will greatly increase our holdings.

Our goal to be the largest holder of properties in SW Quebec continues to grow.”\nDr. Christian Derosier, P.Geo., President of C.D.G.C.
