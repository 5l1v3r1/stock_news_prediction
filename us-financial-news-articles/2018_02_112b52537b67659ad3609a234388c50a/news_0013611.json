My choice was very poor I think.” \nMid-table Watford had taken the lead in the 43rd with a Troy Deeney penalty after Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois brought down on-loan Barcelona winger Gerard Deulofeu.

Deulofeu sealed the win in the 88th with his first goal for the club before Pereyra got the fourth in added time.

It is the same. I stay here, try to work and put all myself in the work,” Conte told Sky Sports. “The pressure? What is the pressure? I work - if this is enough it is, OK. Otherwise the club has to take another decision.” Related Coverage Chelsea slump again but Conte not losing any sleep \nIt was a different story for new Watford manager Javi Gracia who modestly described the victory in his first home match in charge as a “good beginning” for his side, who sit in 11th place but are still only six points clear of the relegation zone. \n“I think it is important not only for three points but for the motivation to believe in our possibilities,” Gracia told reporters. “I think it is very important today.” Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T00:43:42.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
