It made use of tax breaks to promote film productions, but it was challenged by the tax authorities.\nRandell said he repaid 114,000 pounds ($159,645.60) plus interest after an “error of judgment”.\nRandell, who will step down as a board member of the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Committee before taking up his new post, said the scheme was recommended by his financial advisor, and that he had been assured at the time that the tax authorities approved it.\n“I probably did not ask the right questions,” Randell said.\nRandell spoke of a gap between what the public expects of the FCA, which regulates 56,000 firms, and what the watchdog can deliver in a timely way.\nThe committee on Tuesday published a report the FCA had commissioned into alleged mistreatment by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) of its small business customers.\nIt lost patience with the FCA, which had refused to publish it after saying it was required by law to allow those criticized in it to have a right of reply.\nThe watchdog was also accused in a parliamentary report last week for being too slow to protect steelworkers from being ripped off over their pensions.\nRandell said his first priority will be to look at whether the watchdog can move faster in such instances to avoid any perception of justice being delayed.\n“I want to conduct my own assessment ... It may be there isn’t a silver bullet,” Randell said. “The FCA can’t be everywhere all the time.”\nReporting by Huw Jones, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T06:09:41.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
