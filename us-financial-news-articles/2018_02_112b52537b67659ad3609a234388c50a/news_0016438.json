The Journal's daily digital subscriber base rose 28.6 percent year over year, hitting 1,389,000. \nCEO Robert Thomson, in a candid statement within the release \nThe company said print circulation had declined in the quarter, and attributed a 6 percent year-over-year decline in advertising revenue to \"weakness in the print advertising market and the decision to cease The Wall Street Journal's international print editions in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\" \nStill, News Corp., like other major media outlets, has felt a boost in overall subscribers during President Donald Trump 's often tumultuous first year in the White House. \nTrump has shown a clear preference toward programming from Murdoch-owned Fox News. Even still, News Corp. properties have on occasion collided with his administration, which has had a contentious relationship with the press. Trump: Thank you to @ foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that's why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition \nTrump, in an exclusive interview with the Journal, was quoted as saying \"I probably have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un .\" Days later, the White House asserted that Trump had actually said \" I'd probably have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,\" ultimately leading the Journal to release a recording of the interview in its own defense.
