The DUP failed to close the deal. They have now collapsed this process,” Sinn Fein’s Michelle O‘Neill said in a statement. “These issues are not going away. Sinn Fein are now in contact with both governments and we will set out our considered position tomorrow. The DUP should reflect on their position.” Reporting by Amanda Ferguson, writing by Padraic Halpin", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T20:20:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
