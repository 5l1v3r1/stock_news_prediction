A separate lawsuit in the Manhattan court targets this alleged practice.\nFriedman said Lockette is not now employed in financial services. His lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, back pay, and an injunction against further discrimination.\nThe case is Lockette v Morgan Stanley et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-00876.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T01:23:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
