It is part of the reason why many Fed policymakers remain confident in continuing to gradually raise interest rates without stalling economic growth.\nBanks also reported they had seen weaker demand for auto loans and residential mortgages, according to the survey.\nThe Fed surveyed loan officers at 71 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.\nReporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:59:54.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
