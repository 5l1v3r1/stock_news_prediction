He spoke hours after the United Nations adopted a resolution demanding a 30-day truce across Syria to allow aid access and medical evacuation.\n“In these days my thoughts have often been taken up by the beloved and martyred Syria,” he said, noting there had been thousands of civilian victims of violence that had not spared even hospitals.\n“You can’t fight evil with another evil,” he said, asking his listeners to join together in a moment of silent prayer.\nFrancis called for an immediate end to the violence so food and medicine can get in and the sick and wounded can leave.\nReporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by John Stonestreet and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T00:00:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
