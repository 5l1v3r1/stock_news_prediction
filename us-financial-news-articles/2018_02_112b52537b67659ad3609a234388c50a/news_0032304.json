The wedding service itself will be conducted by Dean of Windsor, David Conner.

Harry’s father, Prince Charles, would later host an evening reception for close friends and family. \nMarkle, who is a divorcee, met Harry in July 2016 after they were introduced through a mutual friend, with both knowing little about the other. After just two dates, the couple decided to go on holiday together to Botswana.
