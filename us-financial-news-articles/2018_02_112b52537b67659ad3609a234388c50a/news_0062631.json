This compares to the Company’s portfolio as of September 30, 2017, as of which date the fair value of our investments was approximately $1,964,117, comprised of 108 investments in 92 portfolio companies/structured finance obligations/investment fund across 29 industries with 59 sponsors.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, investments consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 Type—% of Fair Value Fair Value % of Fair Value Fair Value % of Fair Value First Lien Debt (excluding First Lien/Last Out) $ 1,293,641 65.75 % $ 1,259,983 64.15 % First Lien/Last Out Unitranche 237,635 12.08 230,667 11.74 Second Lien Debt 246,233 12.51 268,783 13.69 Structured Finance Obligations — — 2,585 0.13 Equity Investments 17,506 0.89 13,552 0.69 Investment Fund 172,516 8.77 188,547 9.60 Total $ 1,967,531 100.00 % $ 1,964,117 100.00 %\nThe following table shows our investment activity for the three month period ended December 31, 2017:\nFunded Sold/Repaid Principal amount of investments: Amount % of Total Amount % of Total First Lien Debt $ 171,724 60.96 % $ (131,771 ) 45.58 % Second Lien Debt 50,239 17.83 (74,854 ) 25.89 Structured Finance Obligations — — (11,750 ) 4.06 Equity Investments 3,562 1.26 — — Investment Fund 56,200 19.95 (70,750 ) 24.47 Total $ 281,725 100.00 % $ (289,125 ) 100.00 % Overall, total investments at fair value increased by 0.2%, or $3,414, during the three month period ended December 31, 2017 after factoring in repayments, sales, net fundings on revolvers and delayed draws and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation).\nTotal investments at fair value held by Middle Market Credit Fund (“Credit Fund”) increased by 19.6%, or $161,644, during the three month period ended December 31, 2017 after factoring in repayments, sales, net fundings on revolvers and delayed draws and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation). As of December 31, 2017, Credit Fund had total investments at fair value of $984,773, which was comprised 99.4% of first lien senior secured loans and 0.6% of second lien senior secured loans at fair value. All investments in the Credit Fund portfolio were floating rate debt investments with an interest rate floor.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the weighted average yields for our first and second lien debt investments on an amortized cost basis were 8.62% and 10.44%, respectively, with a total weighted average yield of 8.86%. Weighted average yields include the effect of accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums and are based on interest rates as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, on a fair value basis, approximately 1% of our debt investments bear interest at a fixed rate and approximately 99% of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate, which primarily are subject to interest rate floors.\nAs part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as “Internal Risk Ratings”:\nInternal Risk Ratings Definitions\nRating Definition 1 Performing—Low Risk: Borrower is operating more than 10% ahead of the base case. 2 Performing—Stable Risk: Borrower is operating within 10% of the base case (above or below). This is the initial rating assigned to all new borrowers. 3 Performing—Management Notice: Borrower is operating more than 10% below the base case. A financial covenant default may have occurred, but there is a low risk of payment default. 4 Watch List: Borrower is operating more than 20% below the base case and there is a high risk of covenant default, or it may have already occurred. Payments are current although subject to greater uncertainty, and there is moderate to high risk of payment default. 5 Watch List—Possible Loss: Borrower is operating more than 30% below the base case. At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have occurred. Loss of principal is possible. 6 Watch List—Probable Loss: Borrower is operating more than 40% below the base case, and at the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have already occurred. Additionally, the prospects for improvement in the borrower’s situation are sufficiently negative that impairment of some or all principal is probable. Our Investment Adviser’s risk rating model is based on evaluating portfolio company performance in comparison to the base case when considering certain credit metrics including, but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA and net senior leverage as well as specific events including, but not limited to, default and impairment.\nOur Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. In connection with our quarterly valuation process, our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings on a regular basis. The following table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings of our debt portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017:\nDecember 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 Fair Value % of Fair Value Fair Value % of Fair Value (dollar amounts in millions) Internal Risk Rating 1 $ 73.7 4.15 % $ 75.1 4.27 % Internal Risk Rating 2 1,399.6 78.74 1,376.0 78.20 Internal Risk Rating 3 170.2 9.57 187.7 10.67 Internal Risk Rating 4 103.3 5.81 84.1 4.78 Internal Risk Rating 5 30.7 1.73 36.6 2.08 Internal Risk Rating 6 — — — — Total $ 1,777.5 100.00 % $ 1,759.5 100.00 % As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, the weighted average Internal Risk Ratings of our debt investment portfolio were 2.2.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nTotal investment income for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 was $49,510 and $42,648, respectively. This $6,862 net increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income from our debt portfolio, an increase in other income from higher prepayment fees resulting from full paydowns on select investments, and an increase in interest income and dividend income from Credit Fund during the three month period ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal expenses (net of management fee waiver) for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 were $22,994 and $17,568, respectively. This $5,426 net increase during the three month period ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable due to an increase in management fees as a result of an increase in investments and termination of the fee waiver and an increase in interest expense as a result of an increase in LIBOR.\nDuring the three month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net realized gain and change in unrealized appreciation of $467. This was primarily due to net change in unrealized appreciation on our debt investments from changes in various inputs utilized under our valuation methodology, including, but not limited to, market spreads, leverage multiples and borrower ratings, and the impact of exits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $32,039, notes payable (before debt issuance costs) of $273,000, and secured borrowings outstanding of $562,893. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $250,107 of remaining commitments and $164,647 available for additional borrowings on its revolving credit facilities, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions.\nDividend\nOn February 26, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, which is payable on April 17, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 29, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. EST on Wednesday, February 28, 2018 to discuss these quarterly financial results.
