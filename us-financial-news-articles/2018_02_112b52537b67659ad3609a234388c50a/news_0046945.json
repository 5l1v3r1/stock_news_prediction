Their initial high cost means the vast majority of the cars will be bought by fleets offering shared mobility services.\nThe average electric car is expected to be driven about two and a half times more than an internal combustion car, according to Dale.\n“What we expect to see in the 2030s is a huge growth in shared mobility autonomous cars ... Once you don’t have to pay for a driver, the cost of taking one of those share mobility fleets services will fall by about 40 or 50 percent,” Dale said.\nThe vast majority of the shared mobility is expected to be EVs because of their lower maintenance costs.\nCar makers including General Motors and high-tech giants such as Google Waymo and Uber Technologies have poured billions into the autonomous vehicles industry hoping gain a first-mover advantage. Robo-taxi services are seen as the main use for most self-driving vehicles.\nBP sharply raised its estimate of growth in electric vehicles in the coming decades from last year’s forecast that EVs would reach 100 million by 2035. The big upwards revision is due to an increase in hybrid cars and an expected sharp growth in EV purchases in the second half of the 2030s, Dale said.\nPEAK OIL London-based BP joined other oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell in forecasting a peak for oil demand in the late 2030s, when it is expected to slightly decline at around 110 million bpd.\nIt did not foresee a peak in demand in its previous outlooks that stretched into 2035.\nWhile the transportation sector will continue to dominate the growth in oil consumption, demand for plastic manufacturing will become the main source of growth in the 2030s.\nOil companies such as BP, Shell and France’s Total are betting on growing demand from the petrochemical sector in the coming decades.\nDale however said changes in regulations for plastics consumption such as stringent policies on plastic bags and packaging could dent oil demand by as much as 2 million bpd, roughly the same as the impact of EVs.\nOverall energy demand will continue to grow in the coming decades, rising by a third into 2040, or roughly 1.3 percent per year, driven by growth in China and India, but the world is learning to “do more with less energy” as economies become more efficient, Dale said.\nFor example, the European Union’s gross domestic product is set to treble in 2040 from 1975 but the level of energy demand will be the same.\nChina’s energy demand will continue to grow but at a slower pace by the 2030s, when India will become the main driver of growth.\nBP once again revised upwards its forecast for growth in renewable power, which is set to grow by 40 percent by 2040, with its share in the energy mix increasing from 4 percent to 14 percent.\nThe revision is due to technological gains as well as more aggressive government policies, particularly in India and China.\n“There is plenty of scope for policy to continue to surprise us” to further boost the growth in the renewables, Dale said.\nReporting by Ron Bousso, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:54:55.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
