Norway currently leads the all-time list with 121 golds, ahead of the U.S. (100) and Germany (92).\nSwimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time with 28 medals, 23 of them gold, was quick off the blocks to express his delight on Twitter.\n“Let’s go @shaunwhite !!! Way to go man!! Nothing like a good comeback right?? Redemption always feels great!” Phelps wrote on his verified account, alluding to White’s failure to win a medal at Sochi four years ago.\nFrom the NFL, Houston Texans defensive end J.J Watt was also impressed.\n“That pure emotion from @shaunwhite. That’s what it’s all about. So awesome,” he tweeted.\nREFILE - CORRECTING ID Snowboarding - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's Halfpipe Finals - Phoenix Snow Park – Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 14, 2018 - Shaun White of the U.S. warms up.
