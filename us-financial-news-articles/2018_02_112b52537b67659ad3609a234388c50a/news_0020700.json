Under the deal, it was to keep a 25 percent stake in the insurance unit. \nIn an emailed press release, Calamos Family Partners (CFP) said it was seeking immediate repayment of more than $41 million in principal, plus interest, owed to them by EXIN under a series of loan agreements. The full amount was payable on December 31 2017, and was now in default. \nIt said EXIN has repeatedly failed to provide requested financial statements and other financial, accounting and regulatory information and records as required by the applicable loan agreements. In addition, the lawsuit seeks a full accounting of when and how EXIN used the borrowed funds. \nEXIN later responded with a statement on its website. \n“EXIN has recently been made aware that one of its partners has chosen to issue a press release regarding the existence of a litigation against EXIN. EXIN does not comment on litigation nor threats of litigation,” the company said. \n“EXIN remains fully committed to the expeditious close of the (National Insurance) transaction within the prescribed timeframe.” \nNational Bank of Greece had put its insurance subsidiary up for sale as part of a restructuring plan approved by the European Union to exit non-banking operations and focus on core banking.
