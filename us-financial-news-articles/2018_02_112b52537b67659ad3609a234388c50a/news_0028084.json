He took the platter.”\nFigure Skating – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Team Event Men's Single Skating Free Skating competition final – Gangneung Ice Arena - Gangneung, South Korea – February 12, 2018 - Patrick Chan of Canada competes. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson DRASTIC CHANGES To make the most of his final Games and the last months of his competitive career, Chan made a bold coaching change just weeks ahead of Pyeongchang, a move he said has helped him rekindle his passion for figure skating.\nAfter finishing a disappointing fourth at the Skate Canada grand prix event last year, Chan -- who has said he would retire after Pyeongchang -- realized he needed a change.\nSlideshow (4 Images) He withdrew from a grand prix event in Japan, parted ways with coach Marina Zoueva, with whom he trained in the United States, relocated to Canada and hired Ravi Walia as his new coach.\nWalia told Reuters last week that Chan’s return to Canada had helped him fall in love with skating again.\nHis team mates rallied behind him after a shaky short program.\nThey now have great expectations for his individual event, where he will face Hanyu, American quad specialist Nathan Chen, six-time European champion Javier Fernandez, among other top skaters.\n“I felt he was going to do it today,” ice dancer Scott Moir told a news conference.\n“I knew he was pissed off from two days ago (over his short program). I know the competitor that Patrick is. I can’t wait to see what he does in his individual event.”\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber, additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T12:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T12:39:41.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
