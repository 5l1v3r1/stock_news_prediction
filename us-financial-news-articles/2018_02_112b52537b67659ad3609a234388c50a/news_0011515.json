That act, in turn, drew derision from a number of people, including Bryce, who began fundraising off it.\nTweet \nIn the 48 hours after Bryce's tweet, his campaign had collected $151,850.80 in donations, his spokeswoman, Lauren Hitt, told CNBC on Monday.\nThere were 12,253 individual donations for an average contribution of $12.39. And there were nearly 5,800 donations in the amount of $1.50. \nHitt said that more than $49,000 was pledged in recurring donations that will continue through the election.\nHitt said that Ryan's tweet \"hit such a huge core with people because of feelings they already had about the tax plan.\"\n\"The immediate backlash was pretty strong,\" she noted.\nRyan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\nPolitico, in an earlier story about the fundraising effort , noted that Bryce remains well short of Ryan in cash on hand.\nRyan has $9.6 million available for his campaign, while Bryce has $1.3 million, Politico reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T21:18:06.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
