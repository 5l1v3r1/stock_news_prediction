SoftBank is an existing investor in Didi, which raised $4 billion to fund its global push in December at a valuation of more than $50 billion.\nDidi has expanded overseas rapidly in the past year since sealing its dominance in China with the purchase of Uber’s local business, ending a cash-burning subsidy war that cost the U.S. firm roughly $2 billion.\nReporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T04:48:28.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
