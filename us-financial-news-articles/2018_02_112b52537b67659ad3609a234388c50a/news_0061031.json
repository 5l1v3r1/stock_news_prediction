Broadband internet subscriptions rose by 25,000, up from 16,000 in the previous quarter.\nAltice One is currently available to its Optimum customers, in the New York tri-state area and will be rolled out later this year to Suddenlink customers in the U.S. West, Midwest and South later this year, CEO Dexter Goei said on a call with reporters.\nEarlier this month, Altice USA reached a distribution agreement with cable network Starz, ending a six week blackout [nB8N19C052]. As part of that deal, Altice will sell Starz’ online streaming service to customers of Altice One.\nNet income attributable to the company was $2.25 billion, or $3.06 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $236.7 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue for the company rose 2.6 percent to $2.37 billion. However, the adjusted loss per share of 11 cents was wider than the 1 cent loss that analysts’ on average expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, as Altice spent more on programming.\nAltice’s total programming costs rose 4.7 percent, while Suddenlink saw an 8.8 percent jump in programming costs in the fourth quarter, largely due to bringing back Viacom channels after a three-year blackout, the company said.\nIn January, Altice founder Patrick Drahi decided to split the U.S. and European operations of the heavily indebted telecoms and cable group into Altice USA and Altice Europe, a move intended to shield the U.S. operation from investor concerns about Europe. [nL4N1P3572]\nThe Netherlands-based Altice NV expects to complete the spinoff of its 67.2 percent interest in Altice USA by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018, following regulatory and shareholder approvals.\nReporting by Muvija M in Bengaluru and Jessica Toonkel in New York; editing by Arun Koyyur and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T00:34:11.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
