Three of the top 10 are located in Silicon Valley, where the experience for many female tech workers has been more treacherous, as Emily Chang’s new book Brotopia portrays. \nThe list is based on employee reviews that evaluate key factors affecting work happiness including one’s relationship with their boss and coworkers, the work environment, job resources, compensation, growth opportunities, company culture, company reputation, daily tasks, and job control over work performed daily. \nCities that have opportunities for higher education, personal growth, and year-round activities are more likely to have happier residents and employees, CareerBliss cofounder Heidi Golledge said . \nEach city is also assigned a “BlissScore,” which is the overall job happiness score assigned by employees. This score is derived from company reviews, which evaluate each of the key factors that contribute to the overall happiness in the workplace on a scale of one to five. The 10 U.S. cities with the happiest workers are: Mountain View, Calif.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T20:05:12.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
