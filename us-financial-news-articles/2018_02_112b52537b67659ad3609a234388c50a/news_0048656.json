REUTERS/David W Cerny “With everything that happened to them, prior to the Olympics, for them to come together like this and to compete like this in the Olympics, it’s remarkable.”\nMurray, a 29-year-old Canadian, had to grapple with the challenge of reshaping a team of South Koreans she had coached for four years to make room for the players from the North with only a couple of weeks to go before the Winter Olympics opened.\nSlideshow (9 Images) While that was highly disruptive, she said the team found a way to gel in only a handful of practice sessions before the Games began, as well as with the incessant attention of the media.\nTheir games have become a political showcase as well, with the first attended by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s younger sister Kim Yo Jong.\nNorth Korea’s official cheerleading squad attended all three of their group-stage games.\nMurray called her players’ attitudes and commitment to one another “incredible” and said it was a testimony to the bonding power of sport.\n“I’ve never imagined our team connecting this well. After our last practice yesterday, we had eight players from the North and five players from our team and they were hugging and taking pictures together,” Murray said.\n“Sports are breaking down the barrier.”\nWriting By Dan Burns; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T12:20:57.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
