The administrators have encouraged customers to redeem gift cards and vouchers \"as soon as possible.\" \nThe lead-up to today's news is a Â£15 million ($20.8 million) VAT bill that the retailer is unlikely to be able to pay off due to poor sales. The U.K. branch had staved off administration in December after striking a deal to inject more money into its pension fund in order to win the state-backed fund's support for a restructure. \nAt that point, at least 26 loss-making stores were scheduled for closure by spring 2018. \n\"We will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business,\" Thomas said. \"The newer, smaller, more interactive stores in the portfolio have been outperforming the older warehouse-style stores that were opened in the 1980s and 1990s.\" \nThe demise of the iconic children's retailer, which has more than 1,500 stores worldwide, is just one in a stream of companies shutting their doors and seeing shrinking market presence as big box retailers struggle to compete with e-commerce contenders like Amazon. \nMacy's, Sears and J.C.
