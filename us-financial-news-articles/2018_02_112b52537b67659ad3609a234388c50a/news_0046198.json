Rome turned off its public fountains and only narrowly avoided rationing water supplies to homes.\nBritain and Germany have experienced severe flooding in recent years, and Paris was forced to evacuate 1,500 people when the Seine flooded last month.\n“There is an awful lot of extreme weather hitting us,” said co-author Richard Dawson.\nThe drought now threatening water supplies in Cape Town is a stark example of how cities need to adapt long before a drought or flood hits.\nOnce a drought kicks in and the water starts to run dry, it may be too late to build another reservoir or desalination plant, Dawson said. Heatwaves and floods pose similar problems.\n“So you have to really start thinking longterm in terms of preparing and adapting cities for any sort of climate event,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nCities can build large infrastructure such as reservoirs or flood barriers, or can make smaller incremental changes repeatedly, he said.\nBuildings also could be designed to be naturally cooler, use less water, or be more resilient to flooding. People, too, can change their behavior to use less water, he said.\n“A combination of all of those things is probably the best way to (adapt),” Dawson said.\nIf a city can reduce its need for water, or its exposure to climate risks - by cutting the number of people living in flood plains, for example - then its overall vulnerability goes down, he said.\n“And if we make buildings more resilient to floods and heat, and more effective at using water resources, then we can create more headroom for adaptation to more extreme events,” he said.\nReporting by Alex Whiting @Alexwhi, Editing by Laurie Goering.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.
