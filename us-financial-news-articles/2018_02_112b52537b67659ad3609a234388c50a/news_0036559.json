The reading in January was 0.2 percent from 1.0 percent in December. The data also showed the headline consumer price index turned negative at -0.2 percent year-on-year from 0.7 percent in the previous month. Greece had been in a protracted deflation mode since March 2013 based on its headline index, as wage and pension cuts and a multi-year recession took a heavy toll on Greek household incomes. Deflation in the country hit its highest level in Nov. 2013 when consumer prices registered a 2.9 percent year-on-year decline. The economy emerged from deflation in June 2016.
