The agreement promises an unusual half-time review after two years - already being seen as a possible opportunity for Merkel finally to step down.\n“If it happens, the fourth Merkel cabinet will in some respects resemble the last cabinets of Helmut Kohl and Helmut Schmidt,” wrote Kurt Kister, editor of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. “This government could be captioned ‘Won’t last long’.”\nSPD MEMBERS’ VOTE\nEven that may prove optimistic if SPD leader Martin Schulz fails to persuade his party’s 464,000 members to ratify the deal in a postal ballot, whose result will be announced on March 4.\nFinancial markets are watching closely, keen to see a stable government in Europe’s largest economy. Reflecting the continuing uncertainty, Germany’s 10-year government bond yield hit 0.777 percent, the highest since September 2015.\nA survey of 5,127 voters conducted by pollster Civey on Wednesday for t-online indicated that almost 60 percent of SPD supporters want the party’s members to back the coalition deal.\nBut the same poll found that a clear majority of Germans overall wanted party members to reject it.\nChristian Democratic Union (CDU) leader and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Christian Social Union (CSU) leader Horst Seehofer and Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Martin Schulz give a statement after coalition talks to form a new coalition government in Berlin, Germany, February 7, 2018. The center-left SPD saw its previous four years in “grand coalition” rewarded with its worst result in decades in September’s national election, and the slide has continued.\nThe SPD registered 18 percent in a GMS poll conducted before the deal was announced, the lowest reading GMS had ever recorded, and only four points ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Together, the two grand coalition parties, which have between them shaped Germany’s postwar politics, barely scored 50 percent.\nOpponents of the deal say Schulz’s team failed to put a left-wing stamp on the program, which continues to promise the budget discipline that has been the hallmark of Merkel’s three governments. It is unclear if they will be persuaded by his response that the SPD will control top ministries including finance, foreign affairs and labor.\n“CHANCELLOR AT ANY PRICE”\nSchulz’s defenders emphasize commitments on welfare spending, housing and pensions, and worker-friendly labor law reforms.\nAn SPD source said lawmakers had read out emails from SPD supporters at a party meeting on Wednesday, with some emails saying they had not backed Schulz as party chair only for him to switch to the foreign ministry, as he plans to do. There was unanimous approval for the coalition contract though, the source said.\nParadoxically, the political right’s dismay could win over more reluctant SPD members. The mass-selling daily Bild said Merkel had sold out. “Chancellor at any price,” Bild wrote on its front page. “Merkel gifts the SPD the government.”\nRelated Coverage Germany's SPD bets on first female chair in 154 years to revive fortunes EU hears and likes change of tune from Germany Factbox: Fate of Germany's future government hangs on SPD members' vote But the ill temper in Germany was not matched in other capitals, where news of a prospective end to four months of uncertainty was greeted with relief.\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the coalition agreement opened the way for convergence with France on reform of the euro zone, something that the SPD had championed.\nThe European Union leaders’ chairman, Donald Tusk, also welcomed the deal, which contains commitments to contribute more to the EU budget, develop the euro zone’s bailout fund into a full-blown European Monetary Fund, and support the use of budgetary means to shield the euro zone from crises.\n“Now it is high time to build an inclusive pan-European Grand Coalition for an ambitious budget, wise agreement on migration and a better Eurozone,” Tusk tweeted.\nReporting by Andreas Rinke, Gernot Heller, Hans-Edzard Busemann, Leigh Thomas, Yann Le Guernigou and Michelle Martin; Writing by Thomas Escritt and Paul Carrel; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T10:22:18.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
