The Japanese yen weakened 0.45 percent versus the greenback at 107.42 per dollar.\nMSCI’s stock index of 47 countries shed 0.53 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.13 percent to close at 1,498.06.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 162.37 points, or 0.63 percent, to 25,546.9. The S&P 500 lost 21.07 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,758.53 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 55.93 points, or 0.75 percent, to 7,365.54.\nEuro zone bond yields initially rose after Powell’s early comments but soon trimmed those gains in line with U.S. bond yields.\nGermany’s 10-year bond yields rose 1.5 bps to 0.674 percent, shrugging off news that German inflation has slowed.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 13/32 in price to push yields up 2.9062 percent.\nOil fell in its first decline in five days, pressured by a firmer dollar and expectations that upcoming weekly data will show an increase in U.S. crude inventories.\nOil dipped before weekly data that is forecast to show rising U.S. crude inventories, though investor confidence in OPEC’s ability to curb output helped stem the price slide.\nBrent crude futures settled at $66.63 a barrel, down 87 cents on the day, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 90 cents to settle at $63.01.\nApril U.S. gold futures settled down $14.20, or 1.1 percent, at $1,318.60 per ounce.\nEditing by Bernadette Baum and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T02:24:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
