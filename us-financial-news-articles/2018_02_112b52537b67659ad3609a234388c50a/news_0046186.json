But Lim said it will be difficult to resume contract negotiations by mid-March because its umbrella union has to come up with its demands first.\n“The union will make some concessions, if needed, and the government will provide financial support to GM only if it presents a thorough turnaround plan,” he said.\nGM has proposed a debt-for-equity swap and fresh investment in its South Korea unit as part of a plan to get financial support and tax benefits from Seoul, officials and sources have said. The South Korean government wants an audit on the company and its “opaque management” before any aid is approved.\nLim said the union will discuss a full strike and other options at a meeting tomorrow.\n“We don’t want to go as far as a full strike,” he said, citing negative public views of South Korea’s auto unions.\n“But if GM says it will completely withdraw from South Korea, we will down our tools. This will be over. When GM left other markets, they did so boldly. I hope that does not happen in South Korea.”\nGM’s Engle has said it will produce two new models in South Korea, but Lim said that would still fall short of turning around GM’s operations in the country.\nLim said it will take four years for one of the models, which is a crossover, to begin production. Another model, the next-generation Trax SUV which is due early 2020, will not be able to revive factory utilization rates by itself.\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Lincoln Feast\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T08:51:36.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
