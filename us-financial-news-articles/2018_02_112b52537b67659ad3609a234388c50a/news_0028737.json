Forty-eight ships passed through the canal on Saturday amid extensive security measures, the authority said.\nThe success or failure of the military’s latest push will most likely not affect the result of the March 26-28 election. Sisi is widely expected to win as all opposition figures thought to pose a serious challenge to him have pulled out of the race.\nReporting by Cairo Bureau; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Clelia Oziel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T18:46:30.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
