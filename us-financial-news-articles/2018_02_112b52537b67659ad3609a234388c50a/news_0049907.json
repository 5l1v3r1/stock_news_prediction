(UEI), (NASDAQ: UEIC) reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nPaul Arling, UEI’s chairman and CEO, stated, “2018 began with a strong showing at CES, where we demonstrated devices with the latest voice navigation technology as well as Netflix and TiVo buttons. We also revealed our microphone, data compression, radio, fit and finish, and automatic speech recognition (ASR) capabilities in the new voice remote control for DISH. These and many more ongoing technological advances keep UEI at the forefront of control. Our fourth quarter revenue grew 13% reflecting strong performance from our home security products, European subscription broadcasting and OEM relationships in the Asia Pacific region. We expect this trend toward advanced, intuitive 2-way home entertainment systems to continue as additional customers launch their version of advanced platforms with us throughout 2018.”\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended December 31: 2017 Compared to 2016\nGAAP net sales were $181.2 million, compared to $160.5 million; Adjusted Non-GAAP net sales were $180.7 million, compared to $160.1 million.

Improving our gross margin is a top priority, and to accomplish this goal we have implemented several measures including product rationalization and improvements in factory production. We expect our gross margin rate to expand sequentially, which is embedded in our first quarter guidance, and to continue to improve throughout the remainder of 2018.”\nFinancial Outlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the company expects GAAP net sales to range between $169 million and $177 million, compared to $161.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.

References to Adjusted Non-GAAP information are to non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not required by, in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. UEI’s management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of UEI, for budget planning purposes, and for making operational and financial decisions and believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors, as a supplement to GAAP financial measures, helps investors evaluate UEI’s core operating and financial performance and business trends consistent with how management evaluates such performance and trends. Additionally, management believes these measures facilitate comparisons with the core operating and financial results and business trends of competitors and other companies.\nAdjusted Non-GAAP net sales is defined as net sales excluding the impact of stock-based compensation for performance-based warrants. Adjusted Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as gross profit excluding stock-based compensation expense, cost of goods sold and depreciation expense related to the increase in inventories and fixed assets from cost to fair market value resulting from acquisitions, amortization of intangibles acquired, excess manufacturing costs resulting from the closure of our Guangzhou factory, and factory transition costs. Adjusted Non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as operating expenses excluding amortization of intangibles acquired, stock-based compensation expense, employee related restructuring costs, litigation settlement costs, transaction costs related to the sale of our Guangzhou factory, and changes in contingent consideration related to acquisitions as well as other acquisition related costs and nonrecurring items. Adjusted Non-GAAP net income is defined as net income excluding the aforementioned items, foreign currency gains and losses, and the related tax effects of all adjustments, as well as income tax expense representing the estimated tax impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the income tax effects of nondeductible projected losses to be incurred as a result of the shutdown of the company's Guangzhou factory, the effect of net deferred tax asset adjustments related to tax incentives at one of our other China factories, and other nonrecurring income tax items. Adjusted Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to Universal Electronics Inc. is calculated using Adjusted Non-GAAP net income attributable to Universal Electronics Inc. A reconciliation of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this press release.\nAbout Universal Electronics\nUniversal Electronics Inc. is the worldwide leader in universal control and sensing technologies for the smart home.
