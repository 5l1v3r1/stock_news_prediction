They were up 7.1 percent at 27.49 euros by 0910 GMT.\n“This morning Edenred released solid 2017 results, slightly above consensus,” wrote analysts at brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux, who retained a “hold” rating on the shares.\nEYES MORE ACQUISITIONS Edenred, which employs 8,000 people in 45 countries, sells prepaid meal vouchers that employers offer to workers, but its development of products such as fuel cards aims to tap into a sector that is growing faster than other employee benefits as companies seek to control business expenses more effectively.\nIts ‘Employee Benefits’ division now makes 65 percent of revenue while Fleet and Mobility Solutions 25 percent of revenue against 14 percent in 2015, it said.\nThe company is also accelerating its shift from paper-based vouchers towards digital cards in order to cut costs.\nAt the end of 2017, digital solutions accounted for 78 percent of Edenred’s business volume, up 8 percentage points from 2016 and on track to meet a target of 85 percent in 2020.\nEdenred added it expected more strong growth in 2018 in Latin America, which makes up 41 percent of its business, even though conditions remained challenging in Brazil, which is emerging from recession.\nEdenred, whose recent acquisitions include buying a Slovakian meal voucher company and acquiring a 51 percent stake in a Poland-based fuel card distribution firm, added it would consider further acquisitions this year.\nFor 2018, the company confirmed its medium-term objectives of like-for-like growth in operating revenue of more than 7 percent and operating EBIT growth of more than 9 percent.\nEdenred shares rose 28 percent last year and are up around 14 percent in 2018 versus a flat Paris SBF-120 index.\n$1 = 0.8078 euros Reporting by Dominique VidalonAdditional reporting by Blandine Henault; editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:38:37.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
