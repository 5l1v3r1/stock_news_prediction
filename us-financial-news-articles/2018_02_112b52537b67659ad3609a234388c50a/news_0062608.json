Early in the month, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both fell into correction territory —marked by a 10% decline from their most recent highs—while the latter experienced its biggest-ever intraday point swing .\nYet many individual investors said they had been humbled trying to time big market moves in the past and so didn’t try to do so this time. Their calm may have helped share prices rebound. As of Tuesday, the S&P and Dow were up 6.3% and 6.5%, respectively, from their Feb. 8 lows and are now down just 4.5% each from their Jan. 26 highs. Both indexes are also up year to date, after briefly pulling into negative territory early on.\nJustin Beghly of Fayetteville, Ark., was one investor who decided against selling. He said he used the recent market dip to buy more Facebook Inc. shares.\nMr. Beghly’s decision sprang from a move out of stock holdings in early 2017 based on the idea Donald Trump’s presidency would spook stocks. Instead, markets raced higher . He has since returned to stocks.\n“It’s a terrible thing to try to time the market,” said Mr. Beghly, 40, who is studying for a master’s degree in education.\nInvestors did pull a record amount of money out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track stocks at the beginning of February. But they withdrew less the following two weeks, according to EPFR Global, a fund-tracking firm. That suggested an initial rush out of stocks quickly subsided.\nAlthough institutional investors dominate stock trading, how individual investors react to market moves is important for overall market sentiment as well as the flow of funds into and out of different asset classes held in mutual funds, retirement accounts and employer-sponsored programs.\nMany of those investors, though, find themselves stuck with today’s market, despite worries that valuations have become stretched . Although interest rates have begun to rise—that was one factor that recently hurt share prices—they remain low enough that government and corporate bonds are considered expensive and cash isn’t much of an alternative.\nMatt Phillips, a retired cardiologist in Austin, Texas, said that in 2008 he fretted over the market while his wife, Sherry, remained sanguine. This time, they have reversed roles.\nAt her urging, Dr. Phillips called their financial adviser when the market started to spiral in early February, but was told the best course of action was to do nothing. He heeded the advice.\nThe 61-year-old said he prefers the risk that the couple’s investment balances might shrink than the certainty that they would stagnate if the holdings were moved to cash.\n“If you took it out, what would you do with it then?” Dr. Phillips said. “The only option is to leave it in and hope for the best.”\nThe danger is that individual investors become complacent, which could leave them less prepared for some big market move.\nRisks of complacency are potentially amplified by a broader shift in investor behavior. Over the past decade, investors have veered from active stock picking to passive investing, buying baskets of stocks and other investments rather than trying to beat the market.\nA more passive approach can also be a benefit, though, and helped some investors to avoid being reactive. Barbara James, a 50-year-old romance writer in New York, said she panicked during the 2008 crash and sold stocks when the market was falling—missing out on the rally that began in 2009.\nThis time around, she kept her money in stocks and makes a conscious effort to not check her accounts as often. “Now I just look when I know the markets went up,” she said.\nSurveys, too, suggest the recent volatility has done little to dampen investor optimism for long-term gains. The week after the S&P 500 fell into correction territory, 48.5% of investors told the American Association of Individual Investors that they thought stocks would rise over the next six months—up from 37% the week before.\nEven so, individual investors aren’t as upbeat about stocks as at the heights of previous stock rallies—like before the tech bubble burst in March 2000, or during the run-up to the 2007 housing crisis. To investors who believe bull markets wither when euphoric investors begin taking extreme risks, the current, relatively contained level of enthusiasm is a positive.\nOne reason investors are likely feeling upbeat: They are sitting on years of gains. This gives many a different perspective on sudden market gyrations.\nAnna Howard, who teaches engineering at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, N.C., said she was skeptical of January’s surge in share prices, which took major indexes to levels many analysts had forecast for year-end.\n“January was too hot, too fast,” she said. “It felt like funny money.”\nDespite that, and the prospect of having to probably liquidate some holdings due to a child starting college later this year, Ms. Howard left her investments untouched. She held fast, too, when markets then fell.\n“My funds are about where they were in October, but it’s hardly the end of the world,” she said. “Now if they start being where they were in October of 2012, then I’m going to be unhappy.”\nWrite to Christina Rexrode at christina.rexrode@wsj.com , Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com and Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:46:18.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
