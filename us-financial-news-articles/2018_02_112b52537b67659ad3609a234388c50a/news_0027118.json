I never made a podium at a World Cup and now here I am at the top of the podium.”\nLuge – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Singles Competition – Olympic Sliding Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 11, 2018 - David Gleirscher of Austria celebrates his win.

REUTERS/Edgar Su Mazdzer’s camp, consisting of parents, two sisters, his girlfriend and two buddies, duly went ballistic at the finish-line terrace.\nThe celebrations continued even after he was leapfrogged by Gleirscher in the final run. The American and the Austrian stood side by side as Loch made his mistake and it was bear-hugs all round when their medals were confirmed.\n“One very bad run but that’s sport,” said Loch, who was consoled by IOC President and luge fan Thomas Bach at the venue.\nMazdzer was thrilled with his silver, having been almost at “rock bottom” with his form only weeks before.\n“It’s 16 years in the making (and) what you dream about as a young child and 20 years later you’re finally on the podium,” the 29-year-old said. “I don’t know how to describe it.”\nEditing by Clare Fallon and Clare Lovell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:43:58.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
