Broadcom has refused and continues to refuse to engage with Qualcomm on price.\nThe acquisition of NXP Semiconductors will be 40% accretive to our Non-GAAP results 1 , enables us to accelerate our growth strategy, and provides stockholders greater certainty around Qualcomm's fiscal 2019 Non-GAAP EPS commitment of $6.75-$7.50, which includes $1.50 per share of accretion from NXP.\nIn deciding unanimously to amend its original offer, made in October 2016, the Qualcomm Board concluded that Qualcomm is far more valuable with NXP than without, and took into account the following:\nNXP's non-GAAP operating income has increased by 20% – which means the $127.50 per share price is actually at a lower multiple than the original deal price NXP provides significant strategic benefits to Qualcomm including increased revenue diversification, substantial expansion of total available markets (TAM) and greater scale in higher growth end markets of Auto and IoT The strong market dynamics and positive outlook for key segments High confidence in annualized cost synergies of at least $500 million based on integration planning\nBroadcom is well aware there is no 'reduction of value by $4.10 per share' because the transaction could not be completed at $110.00 per share.\nThe Qualcomm Board is committed to maximizing value for Qualcomm stockholders, whether that be through executing its growth strategy or selling the company. Broadcom's revised $79.00 per share proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm, fails to take into account the strategic and financial benefits of acquiring NXP, and continues to face a long and highly uncertain path to regulatory approvals.\"\nAbout Qualcomm\nQualcomm invents breakthrough technologies that transform how the world connects and communicates.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates.\nNOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, \"Non- GAAP\" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.\nThe Company uses Non-GAAP financial information: (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against competitors. Non-GAAP measurements used by the Company include revenues, cost of revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, other income or expenses, operating income, interest expense, net investment and other income, income or earnings before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share. The Company is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors uses certain Non-GAAP financial measures in establishing portions of the performance-based incentive compensation programs for our executive officers. The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to its use of such information in financial and operational decision-making. This Non-GAAP financial information is also used by institutional investors and analysts in evaluating the Company's business and assessing trends and future expectations.\nNon-GAAP information used by management excludes its QSI segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items.\nQSI is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments in the foreseeable future, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation expense primarily relates to restricted stock units. Management believes that excluding non-cash share-based compensation from the Non-GAAP financial information allows management and investors to make additional comparisons of the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses over time and with respect to other companies. Certain other items are excluded because management views such items as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses, as follows: Acquisition-related items include amortization of certain intangible assets, recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and the related tax effects of these items, as well as any effects from restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. Additionally, the Company excludes expenses related to the termination of contracts that limit the use of the acquired intellectual property, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and costs related to temporary debt facilities and letters of credit executed prior to the close of an acquisition. Starting with acquisitions in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company excludes recognition of the step-up of property, plant and equipment from the net book value based on the original cost basis to fair value. Such charges related to acquisitions that were completed prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 continue to be allocated to the segments, and such amounts are not material. The Company excludes certain other items that management views as unrelated to the Company's ongoing business, such as major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, goodwill and indefinite- and long-lived asset impairments and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. Certain tax items that are unrelated to the fiscal year in which they are recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nQualcomm Fiscal 2019 Estimated Earnings Per Share (EPS)\nFiscal 2019\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$4.47 - $5.22\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to QSI\n$0.02\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to share-based compensation\n($0.73)\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to other items (1)\n($1.57)\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS\n$6.75 - $7.50\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to income from customers involved in licensing disputes\n$1.50 - $2.25\nNon-GAAP EPS, before impact of expected licensing resolution\n$5.25\nFiscal 2019 Accretion from NXP\nFiscal 2019\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$0.08\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to QSI\nN/A\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to share-based compensation\n($0.16)\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to other items (1)\n($1.26)\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS\n$1.50\nFiscal 2019 estimated EPS and EPS accretion assume close of the pending NXP acquisition. Estimated amortization of intangible assets included in other items was based on a preliminary purchase price and are subject to change when the formal valuation and other studies are finalized. The differences that will occur between the preliminary estimates and the final purchase accounting could be material.\n(1) Other items excluded from Non-GAAP consist primarily of acquisition-related items.\nSums may not equal totals due to rounding.\n1 Versus consensus EPS.\nQualcomm Contacts:\nPete Lancia, Corporate Communications\nPhone: 1-858-845-5959\nEmail: corpcomm@qualcomm.com\nJohn Sinnott, Investor Relations\nPhone: 1-858-658-5431\nEmail: ir@qualcomm.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qualcomm-issues-statement-on-reduced-broadcom-proposal-300602172.html\nSOURCE Qualcomm Incorporated", "external_links": ["http://www.qualcomm.com/", "http://www.sec.gov/", "https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qualcomm-issues-statement-on-reduced-broadcom-proposal-300602172.html", "http://www.facebook.com/qualcomm", "http://www.twitter.com/qualcomm"], "published": "2018-02-21T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T23:40:51.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
