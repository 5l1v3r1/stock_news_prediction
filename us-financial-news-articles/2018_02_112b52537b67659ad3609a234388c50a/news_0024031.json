Antetokounmpo knocked down a jumper with 3.3 seconds left in the quarter but Milwaukee, which went 0-for-3 from beyond the arc, went into the second down 29-24 to the Magic, who connected on five long-range attempts.\nThe Magic stretched their lead to nine in the second before Milwaukee responded, but Mack made all six of his shots in the first half, including a pair of 3-pointers, and Orlando held on to a 54-50 lead at halftime.\nMilwaukee outscored Orlando 13-8 to open the second half and regained the lead when Middleton fed Antetokounmpo for a dunk with 8:04 left in the third.\nA jumper from Middleton gave the Bucks a 100-93 lead with 3:04 left. Simmons and Fournier followed with buckets to get the Magic within three with 2:19 remaining, but a 9-3 run including five from Antetokounmpo put Milwaukee up nine and the Bucks held on for the victory.\nOrlando had won three straight coming into the game while Milwaukee improved to 8-2 under Joe Prunty, who took over as head coach when Jason Kidd was fired on Jan. 22.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:10:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
