The 40-year-old suffered a cut to his throwing hand prior to the AFC Championship and has been coy about the extent of the injury. Ailing or healthy, the four-times Super Bowl MVP has proven that no lead is safe against him and the savvy Patriots. - -\n*Fletcher Cox*\nAt 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds, Cox is a defensive anchor and the veteran tackle has spent his entire career with the Eagles as the franchise has climbed to the top. Philadelphia must get pressure to quarterback Tom Brady to have a chance against him, and the three-times Pro Bowl Cox will lead the defensivepush up front. - -\n*Jay Ajayi*\nFeb 1, 2018; Bloomington, MN, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Fletcher Cox during a press conference in advance of Super Bowl LII against the New England Patriots at Mall of America. Mandatory Credit: Jerry Lai-USA TODAY Sports Acquired in a trade with the Miami Dolphins at midseason, the running back has given the Eagles extra punch in the backfield. While he has scored just one touchdown in an Eagles’ uniform, Ajayi has teamed well with back LeGarrette Blount and is the more dynamic of the two. Philadelphia must run the ball effectively to keep New England’s offense off the field and Ajayi will be critical in the Eagles’ ploy to control the ball. - -\n*Nick Foles*\nSlideshow (2 Images) The Philadelphia QB will be under the spotlight after his improbable journey from backup to Super Bowl starter. Foles, who began his career with the Eagles, tossed three touchdowns and 352 yards in Philadelphia’s NFC title triumph, but is he built for the pressure of the Super Bowl? New England’s defense is eager to find out.\n- - *Malcolm Butler*\nThe New England cornerback was the hero of Super Bowl XLIX with his game—clinching interception at the goal line against Seattle. The Patriots ranked near the bottom of the NFL in pass defense and are prone to allowing chunks of yardage through the air, but Butler’s championship presence could be critical in testing the readiness of Foles.\nReporting by Jahmal Corner, Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-03T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:42:05.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
