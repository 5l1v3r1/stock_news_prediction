It also says it will do nothing to help ease tensions with North Korea over Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear programmes. \nSouth Korea and the United States say the THAAD deployment is simply to deter North Korean missile attacks. \nChina has given few details about its own missile programmes, aside from occasional brief statements by the Defence Ministry or in state media. \nIn 2016, the Defence Ministry confirmed it was pressing ahead with anti-missile system tests after pictures appeared on state television. \nState media says China has been conducting anti-missile system tests since at least 2010. China says such technology is needed for its own national defence and security.
