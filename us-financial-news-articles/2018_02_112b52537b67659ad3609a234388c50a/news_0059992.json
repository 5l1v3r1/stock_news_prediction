A company spokeswoman said the company was “encouraged by the significant progress made in optimizing the Rosebank facilities and we remain focused on improving project value.”\nSiccar Point, headed by Jonathan Roger, a former Centrica executive, and backed by private equity firm Blue Water Energy and Blackstone ( BX.N ), expects the partners to reach a final investment decision by early 2019, according to its website.\nSiccar Point and Chevron declined to comment on the sale process.\nBy selling up to half of its 20 percent stake, Siccar Point aims to reduce its financial commitment to the project, the sources said.\n“Siccar’s exposure to Rosebank is big, possibly too big if it wants to develop its other projects,” one source said.\nThe company, one of several new private equity-back oil companies in the North Sea, emerged as a major player following the $1 billion acquisition of Austrian oil and gas company OMV’s ( OMVV.VI ) UK business in November 2016.\nSiccar Point holds stakes in a number of producing fields and developments, including the Statoil-operated Mariner field and BP’s Schiehallion field, both around the Shetland Islands.\nThe Rosebank project, some 130 kilometers (80 miles) northwest of the Shetlands in seas over a kilometer deep, would be one of the biggest new fields in the UK North Sea. With reserves estimated at around 300 million barrels of oil, it could help boost the aging basin’s production.\nMORE WORK San Ramon, California-based Chevron is now tendering for a floating production, storage and offshore loading (FPSO) unit, after cancelling a $1.8 billion order for an FPSO from Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea in 2016.\nOn Wednesday, the Chevron spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: “The Rosebank project is advancing through Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) and Chevron is committed to working with the project coventurers and stakeholders to make the right decisions for the Rosebank development.”\nThen-Chief Executive Officer John Watson said last October costs had been reduced but “there’s more work yet to do.”\n“It’s fair to say that in a $50 (a barrel) world, we’ve got strong opportunities in the unconventional space and elsewhere,” Watson said at the time, referring to Chevron’s focus on U.S. shale such as the Permian basin.\nAnish Kapadia, an analyst at consultancy AKap Energy, said the project was likely to go ahead with today’s oil prices around $65 a barrel.\n“Chevron’s Permian acreage will out-compete Rosebank for capital,” Kapadia said. “However, Chevron still wants some diversification, so it will need to invest in some higher-cost projects that still have favorable economics.”\nReporting by Ron Bousso, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:37:06.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
