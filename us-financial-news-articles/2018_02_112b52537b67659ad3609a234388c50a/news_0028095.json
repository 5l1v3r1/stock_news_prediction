(NASDAQ:RPD), a leading provider of analytics solutions for security and IT operations, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017.\n“Rapid7 finished a strong 2017 with a great fourth quarter,” said Corey Thomas, President and CEO of Rapid7. “Our end markets are healthy, and our SecOps portfolio is resonating with customers. Security and IT teams are finding that they have more suspicious events on their network than they could possibly investigate and more vulnerabilities than they can patch, and Rapid7 can help provide the visibility, analytics, and automation necessary to prioritize and accelerate remediation and reduction of risk. These strong results were driven across multiple regions and multiple products, and we’re especially pleased with the progression of our subscription transition.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $57.7 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year.\nDeferred revenue as of December 31, 2017 was $224.5 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year.\nCalculated billings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $93.6 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year.\nAnnualized recurring revenue of $164.9 million, an increase of 36% year-over-year.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP loss from operations was $(13.4) million, compared to GAAP loss from operations of $(9.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

For additional details on the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures and certain other business metrics to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the accompanying financial data tables posted in this press release.\nFirst Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Guidance\nThe guidance provided below reflects the impact of ASC 606, which Rapid7 is adopting for its fiscal year 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. As required by the new standard, Rapid7 will report its financial results under both ASC 606 and the previous standard (ASC 605) for the 2018 transition year. In order to provide additional transparency, in addition to the guidance under ASC 606, this quarter, Rapid7 is providing guidance for revenue and non-GAAP operating loss under ASC 605 for first quarter and full-year 2018, and an estimate of the changes to its guidance resulting from the transition from ASC 605 to ASC 606. Rapid7 believes that providing this additional disclosure will help investors and analysts better understand the impact that the adoption of ASC 606 has on Rapid7’s guidance and reported results.\nThe reduction in 2018 revenue under ASC 606 relative to ASC 605 is principally due to:\na reduction in perpetual software license revenues recognized on a ratable basis in 2018 caused by the extension of the recognition periods from (i) the initial contract term, which has historically been approximately two years, to (ii) the customer’s estimated economic life of five years, and the loss of bundled professional services revenues which were delivered as of December 31, 2017. These professional services revenues were recorded in deferred revenue and were generally recognized ratably over the initial contract term under ASC 605, which could span multiple years. As the professional services were already delivered prior to December 31, 2017 and qualify for separate recognition, no revenue will be recognized under ASC 606 in 2018.\nThese impacts to revenue are anticipated to be greatest in the first quarter of 2018, and to decrease throughout the year. The actual impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on revenue will depend on the dollar value of our 2018 bookings, the mix of bookings between subscriptions and perpetual software licenses, and the initial contract term of perpetual software license deals.\nExpenses under ASC 606 relative to ASC 605 will be reduced primarily as a result of the capitalization and amortization of sales commissions.\nRapid7 anticipates ARR growth of at least 30% for both the first quarter of 2018, and the full-year 2018, and we anticipate first quarter and full-year 2018 results to be in the following ranges:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance (in millions, except per share data) Impact of Adoption Under ASC 606 Under ASC 605 of ASC 606 Revenue $ 50.1 to $ 52.1 $ 54.6 to $ 56.0 $ (4.5 ) to $ (3.9 ) Year-over-year growth 21 % to 24 % Non-GAAP operating loss $ (10.1 ) to $ (8.8 ) $ (7.4 ) to $ (6.5 ) $ (2.7 ) to $ (2.3 ) Non-GAAP loss per share $ (0.22 ) to $ (0.19 ) Weighted average shares outstanding 45.1 Full-Year 2018 Guidance (in millions, except per share data) Impact of Adoption Under ASC 606 Under ASC 605 of ASC 606 Revenue $ 225.0 to $ 234.0 $ 239.0 to $ 245.0 $ (14.0 ) to $ (11.0 ) Year-over-year growth 19 % to 22 % Non-GAAP operating loss $ (26.0 ) to $ (20.0 ) $ (25.0 ) to $ (21.0 ) $ (1.0 ) to $ 1.0 Non-GAAP loss per share $ (0.55 ) to $ (0.42 ) Weighted average shares outstanding 46.4 Guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2018 does not include any potential impact of foreign exchange gains or losses.\nNon-GAAP guidance excludes estimates for stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and certain non-recurring items. Rapid7 has provided a reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in the financial statement tables included in this press release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nRapid7 will host a conference call today, February 12, 2018, to discuss its results at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures under our executive bonus plan. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information and other business metrics is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. While our non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics are an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, we urge investors to review the reconciliation of these financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA . We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (1) interest income (expense), net, (2) other income (expense), net, (3) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (4) depreciation expense, (5) amortization of intangible assets, (6) stock-based compensation expense, and (7) certain acquisition-related expenses. We believe that the use of adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using this non-GAAP financial measure, including that other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do, that it does not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and that it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital and excludes some items that are cash based.\nWe also monitor operating measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, certain acquisition-related expenses, and certain non-recurring items. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. While our non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, you should review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nCalculated Billings (non-GAAP) . Calculated billings is a non-GAAP measure that we define as total revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period. We consider calculated billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, as a supplement to the corresponding GAAP measure of total revenue, because billings drive deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of trends in our business, and represents a significant percentage of future revenue. We regularly monitor calculated billings because we believe the measure offers valuable information regarding the performance of our business and will help investors better understand the sales activity and performance of our business for a particular period. With the expansion of our subscription, cloud-based product offerings (InsightVM, InsightIDR, InsightAppSec, and InsightOps) on the Insight platform, the shift of our other products to subscription pricing, and the shift of our sales compensation plans to Annualized Recurring Revenue, we may realize a shortening of our average contract duration, which should be taken into consideration when evaluating calculated billings. Our use of calculated billings has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue recognition or revenue measurement, or an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Also, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use calculated billings as a measure of their business, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of calculated billings as a comparative measure.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) . ARR is a non-GAAP measure that we define as the annual value of all recurring revenue related contracts in place at the end of the quarter. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items.\nWhile a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, many of these costs and expenses that we may incur in the future, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial statement tables included in this press release.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this press release other than statements of historical facts, including, without limitation, statements regarding our market opportunity, demand for our product and service offerings, expectations regarding our reoccurring revenue and our future financial and business performance for the first quarter and full-year 2018, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, risks related to our rapid growth and ability to sustain our revenue growth rate, the ability of our products and professional services to correctly detect vulnerabilities, competition in the markets in which we operate, market growth, our ability to innovate and manage our growth, our ability to operate in compliance with applicable laws as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 8, 2017, and subsequent reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\nInvestor contact:\nJeff Bray, CFA\nVice
