TCU (21-9, 9-8 Big 12) further cemented a bid for the NCAA Tournament, which would be its first appearance in 20 years.\nThe Horned Frogs trailed 56-55 before the Wildcats committed turnovers on five straight possessions. That stretch enabled TCU to take control with nine straight points as part of a 13-5 run to close the game.\nSophomore guard Desmond Bane added 15 points as part of a balanced attack, though TCU had to overcome 15-for-26 free throw shooting and 15 misses on 20 3-point attempts.\nJunior forward Dean Wade, who has scored in double figures in every Big 12 game, scored a game-high 24 points to pace Kansas State, which dropped its second straight.\nJunior guard Barry Brown added 17 points for the Wildcats before fouling out late in the game. He added six assists, but had five of the Wildcatsâ€™ 19 turnovers. Point guards Cartier Diarra and Kamau Stokes combined for three points on 1-for-10 shooting, with two assists and six turnovers.\nKansas State (20-10, 9-8) fell into a fourth-place tie with TCU in the Big 12. The Wildcats remain on the bubble for the NCAA Tournament, largely because of a soft nonconference schedule.\nWilliams scored nine points to lead a balanced first-half attack for the Frogs, who carried a 33-29 lead into the break. TCU committed 10 first-half turnovers, but still managed a 10-8 scoring edge off turnovers.\nThe Wildcats got 11 points from Wade and 10 from Brown, overcoming an 0-for-6 spell with buckets in the final minute by freshman center James Love and sophomore forward Xavier Sneed.\nTCU coach Jamie Dixon, who was ejected from the first matchup won by Kansas State 73-68, was tagged with a first-half technical. Kansas State converted that T into just one point on the possession as Brown made 1 of 2 free throws before a turnover.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:44:14.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
