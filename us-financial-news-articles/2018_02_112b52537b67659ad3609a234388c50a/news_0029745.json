Thiele said on Wednesday he still hoped the purple bill would make a comeback when a new series of euro banknotes is unveiled.\nWRONG RESPONSE Speaking at the same conference, the Bundesbank’s president Jens Weidmann said getting rid of cash or replacing it with digital money issued by central banks would be the “wrong response” to the challenges faced by central banks at times of low inflation.\nThe idea of a digital currency giving holders a direct claim on the central bank is under study by Sweden’s Riksbank and has been touted by some academics as a way to extend the reach of monetary policy when interest rates on deposits are below zero.\nBut Weidmann rejected it and defended the use of cash and means of payments that go through commercial banks.\n“(Getting rid of cash) would be the wrong, completely disproportionate response to the policy challenges of the zero lower bound,” he said.\n“The same goes, obviously, for the introduction of digital central bank money with the aim of crowing out cash and enforcing negative rates across the board.”\nHis views were echoed by Swiss National Bank board member Fritz Zurbruegg, who told the same event the central bank had no plan to issue a digital currency.\nBoth argued that allowing money to be held directly at a central bank would worsen bank runs at times of trouble.\nWeidmann added that it was up to central banks to promote more efficient payment systems that would quash the appetite for private digital tokens such as Bitcoin.\nReporting By Francesco Canepa; Editing by William Maclean and Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:15:03.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
