REUTERS/Desmond Boylan NEW PRESIDENT Cuba will select a new president in April, after nearly six decades of rule by the Castro brothers.\n“Cuba is changing,” said U.S. Representative James McGovern. “Regrettably at this historic moment in Cuban history, U.S. engagement is limited.”\nU.S.-Cuban relations have nosedived since Trump became president and rolled back elements of the detente negotiated by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, returning to Cold War-era rhetoric.\nTies have also been severely strained by a series of unexplained illnesses that the United States says have struck diplomatic personnel and their relatives stationed in Cuba.\nThe Trump administration says “health attacks” caused those illnesses and has blamed Havana for not ensuring the safety of U.S. diplomats although it has stopped short of accusing Cuba of being the perpetrator.\nThe United States has cut its diplomatic presence in Cuba by more than half last year, warned U.S. citizens not to visit and expelled 17 Cuban diplomats.\nThe congressional delegation condemned those moves for endangering cooperation on matters from security to science and the arts that was beneficial to both countries and for limiting U.S. reach in Cuba.\n“We don’t have a human rights officer here anymore as a result of the cutback in staff,” said McGovern.\nMcGovern said he was concerned the United States did not appear to have a game plan for moving forward in its relationship with Cuba if the U.S. and Cuban investigations into the diplomats’ illnesses failed to come to a conclusion.\nMany previous U.S. congressional visits to the island have included Republicans as well as Democrats.\nReporting by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:03:22.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
