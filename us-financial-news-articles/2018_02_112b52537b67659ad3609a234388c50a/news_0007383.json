(“First Mining” or the “Company”) (TSX:FF) (OTCQX:FFMGF) (Frankfurt:FMG) is pleased to announce the drilling results of the four drill holes from its deep diamond drill exploration program within Zone 7 (see Tables 1 and 2) at First Mining’s 100% owned Goldlund Gold Project (“Goldlund”) located near the town of Sioux Lookout in northwestern Ontario, Canada.\nFigure 1. Plan Map\nFigure 2. Cross-Section through the Goldlund Project\nDrilling Highlights:\nHole GL-17-010 intersected 83.0 metres of 1.35 grams per tonne gold including 1.0 metre of 74.95 grams per tonne gold Hole GL-17-051 intersected 72.0 metres of 0.65 grams per tonne gold including 2.0 metres of 6.18 grams per tonne gold Hole GL-17-106 intersected 56.0 metres of 0.40 grams per tonne gold including 2.0 metres of 4.74 grams per tonne gold\nNote: Assaying for the 2017 and 2018 Goldlund drill programs is being done by SGS Canada Inc. (“SGS”) at their laboratories in Red Lake, ON. and Burnaby, BC. Reported widths are drilled core lengths; true widths are unknown at this time. Assay values are uncut.\nThe primary goal of the deep hole drilling campaign at Goldlund, which was comprised of four diamond drill holes, was to gain further knowledge on the geology and gold mineralization within the deeper sections of Zone 7 (See Figures 1 and 2). Each of these holes were originally drilled during the Phase 1 drilling campaign and were extended during the Phase 2 exploration and infill drilling program. Today’s assay results demonstrate that gold mineralization at Goldlund continues to considerable depths.\nThe Company is now focusing on exploration and infill drilling within the Zone 1 area and will soon shift to drill targets outside of the current resource estimate boundary.\nKeith Neumeyer, the Chairman of First Mining, stated, “When First Mining acquired the Goldlund Project we knew that it had considerable upside. With our shift from infill drilling to exploration drilling outside of the current resource area, we hope to be able to demonstrate that Goldlund has exceptional exploration upside which we believe will yield considerable value for our shareholders.”\nAll four drill holes (GL-17-010; 051; 106; and 108) were previously drilled during the infill drilling campaign which was completed in May 2017. Drill hole GL-17-010 was originally drilled to a depth of 305.0 metres, with assay results made public in the Company’s news release dated July 10, 2017. Subsequently this hole was extended to a depth of 629.0 metres during the Phase 2 campaign. Drill holes GL-17-051, GL-17-106 and GL-17-108 were originally drilled to depths of 341.0, 302.0, and 328.5 metres, respectively, with the assay results of these holes detailed in the Company’s news release dated July 27, 2017. Subsequently, the Company decided to extend the depth of these drill holes so as to investigate the presence of additional gold mineralization at depth. Drill holes GL-17-051, GL-17-106 and GL-17-108 were extended to depths of 629.0, 455.0 and 500.0 metres respectively, during the Phase 2 campaign. In all four holes significant intersections of gold mineralization were encountered at depth.\nGold observed during the current drilling program at Goldlund occurs both as fine disseminations in quartz vein stockworks and as more discrete larger grains up to 2 mm spatially associated with pyrite in the quartz veins. Calaverite, a gold telluride mineral, has been noted occasionally in higher grade intervals on fracture surfaces in the quartz veins. Higher grade gold distribution in the granodiorite dikes is often, but not always, associated with zones of more intense quartz stockworking and potassic alteration. Figure 2 below displays a cross-section of the geology and gold mineralization with drill holes GL-17-010 to GL-17-014.\nTable 1.

Prepared samples are analyzed for gold by either Bulk Leach Extractable Gold (BLEG) assay techniques or by lead fusion fire assay with an atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) finish. Multi-element analysis on the mineralized zones is also being undertaken by two-acid aqua regia digestion with ICP-MS and AES finish.\n* These holes were drilled in Phase 1 then extended in Phase 2 therefore some intervals (not shown here) have been reported in earlier First Mining news releases.\nFigure 1.

These are inserted at a rate of one standard for every 20 samples (5% of total) and one blank for every 30 samples (3% of total). The standards used in the 2017 program consist of 5 different gold grades ranging from 1 to 9 g/t, and are sourced from CDN Resource Laboratories in Langley, BC. Blanks have been sourced locally from barren granitic material.\nField duplicates from quartered core, as well as ‘coarse’ or ‘pulp’ duplicates taken from coarse reject material or pulverized splits, are also submitted at regular intervals with an insertion rate of 4% for field duplicates and 4% for coarse or pulp duplicates. Additional selected duplicates are being submitted for screened metallic fire assay analysis and to an umpire lab for check assaying. SGS also undertake their own internal coarse and pulp duplicate analysis to ensure proper sample preparation and equipment calibration.\nFigure 2.

These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this news release. Forward-looking statements are frequently, but not always, identified by words such as \"expects”, \"anticipates”, \"believes”, “plans”, “projects”, \"intends”, \"estimates”, “envisages”, \"potential”, \"possible”, “strategy”, “goals”, “objectives”, or variations thereof or stating that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms and similar expressions.\nForward-looking statements in this news release relate to future events or future performance and reflect current estimates, predictions, expectations or beliefs regarding future events and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: (i) the estimated amount and grade of Mineral Resources at Goldlund; and (ii) the potential for exploration upside at Goldlund. All forward-looking statements are based on First Mining's or its consultants' current beliefs as well as various assumptions made by them and information currently available to them. The most significant assumptions are set forth above, but generally these assumptions include: (i) the presence of and continuity of metals at Goldlund at estimated grades; (ii) the capacities and durability of various machinery and equipment; and (iii) success in realizing proposed drilling programs. Although the Company’s management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be incorrect.\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, and risks exist that estimates, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not be achieved or that assumptions do not reflect future experience. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as a number of important factors could cause the actual outcomes to differ materially from the beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates assumptions and intentions expressed in such These risk factors may be generally stated as the risk that the assumptions and estimates expressed above do not occur as forecast, but specifically include, without limitation: (i) risks relating to variations in the mineral content within the material identified as Mineral Resources from that predicted; (ii) general risks related to exploration drilling programs; (iii) developments in world metals markets; (iv) risks relating to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar; (v) management’s discretion to refocus the Company’s exploration efforts and/or alter the Company’s short and long term business plans; and (vi) the additional risks described in First Mining's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities under the Company’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com , and in First Mining’s Annual Report on Form 40-F filed with the SEC on EDGAR.\nFirst Mining cautions that the foregoing list of factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive. When relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions with respect to First Mining, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. First Mining does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by the Company or on our behalf, except as required by law.\nCautionary Note to United States Investors\nThis news release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of U.S. securities laws. Unless otherwise indicated, all resource and reserve estimates included in this news release have been prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum 2014 Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”), and mineral resource and reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term \"resource” does not equate to the term \"reserves”. Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve” unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. The SEC's disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning \"measured mineral resources”, \"indicated mineral resources” or \"inferred mineral resources” or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute \"reserves” by U.S. standards in documents filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. U.S. investors should also understand that \"inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an \"inferred mineral resource” will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimated \"inferred mineral resources” may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an \"inferred mineral resource” exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of \"contained ounces” in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves” by SEC standards as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of \"reserves” are also not the same as those of the SEC, and reserves reported by the Company in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as \"reserves” under SEC standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.\nSource:First Mining Gold Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/28a67f32-70b2-4ce8-96e5-ae8404250966", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ab93b9fc-8c57-40ed-8864-7d2203ec744d", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/28a67f32-70b2-4ce8-96e5-ae8404250966/en", "http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/64d648c8-fb5e-488b-a039-df8ece2d3a7e", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/64d648c8-fb5e-488b-a039-df8ece2d3a7e/en"], "published": "2018-02-05T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T15:59:29.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
