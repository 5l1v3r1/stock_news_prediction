The CEOs of J.P. Morgan, Cisco, Apple, Walmart and many more lauded the tax cuts, and several companies issued bonuses for their employees .\nApple announced in January it would contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy and create 20,000 jobs over the next five years, thanks to the new tax law.\nThe most common corporate reaction so far has been in the form of share buybacks and dividend increases. Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan told investors in January that the \"largest portion\" of tax savings would \"flow to the bottom line through dividends and share buybacks,\" and Rubenstein has echoed that outlook .\nshow chapters Trump recognizes US-China is the world's most important bilateral relationship: The Carlyle Group 7 Hours Ago | 01:14 Lawmakers remain sharply divided over whether the new rates will either be a boon to the American middle-class or exacerbate income inequality. Supporters of the bill claim it will boost middle-class wages by an average of $4,000 annually, while its detractors argue it will balloon the national deficit.\nWall Street investor Paul Tudor Jones is among a few of the financial titans critical of the changes â€” he said in early February that policymakers should have rejected what he saw as \"fiscal impropriety associated with this most recent tax cut.\"\nBut the markets remain \"in very good shape,\" according to Rubenstein. More generally, while accepting the likelihood of an eventual slowdown, the financier and philanthropist was optimistic on the current state of the global economy.\n\"The economy will probably slow down at some point, but I don't see a slowdown in the European or U.S. economies this year, and probably not next year,\" Rubenstein said. \"At some point maybe in 2020, but right now I think the U.S. and European economies are in very good shape.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T17:18:27.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
