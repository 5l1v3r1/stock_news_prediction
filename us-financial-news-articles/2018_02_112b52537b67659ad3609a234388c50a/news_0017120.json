Investors were still nervous following the biggest intraday fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday. \n* ALUMINIUM: LME aluminium shed 0.6 percent to end at $2,158 a tonne after touching $2,152, the weakest since Jan. 9. \n* ALUMINIUM SPREAD: The premium for cash aluminium over three-month aluminium CMAL0-3 rose to $2.75 a tonne, its highest since August, from a discount of $12.50 a tonne at the start of the year. Tightness was seen in the spread between the February and March contracts, traders said. \n* LEAD PRICES: LME lead tumbled 4.4 percent to close at $2,507 a tonne, the lowest since Jan. 2 and the biggest one-day fall since last April. Just last week, the battery metal hit its highest since July 2011 at $2,885. \n* LEAD STOCKS: Stocks of lead held in LME-registered warehouses fell another 1,375 tonnes to their lowest since late 2015, exchange data showed. \n* OTHER METALS: Zinc finished 2.2 percent lower at $3,380 a tonne, the lowest since Jan. 18, while nickel dropped 1.6 percent to $13,175. LME tin gave up 0.5 percent to $21,610 a tonne.
