It also means Russian officials can take part at IOC meetings.\nOn Sunday the IOC said Russia, which has repeatedly denied state involvement in doping, would be automatically readmitted if there were no more doping violations from the Games.\n”The final notification of all remaining test results from the Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR) delegation has been received,“ the IOC said in a statement on Wednesday. ”The IOC can confirm that all the remaining results are negative.\n“Therefore, as stated in the Executive Board decision of Feb. 25, the suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee is automatically lifted with immediate effect.”\nThe decision was announced earlier on Wednesday by ROC president Alexander Zhukov on state television.\n“The Russian Olympic Committee has had its rights fully restored,” he said. “It’s a decision of the utmost importance for us.”\nFILE PHOTO: A view through a fence shows the Russian Olympic Committee headquarters in Moscow, Russia December 5, 2017.
