Analysts at JPMorgan said in a note the numbers were in line with their estimates.\nShares were down 0.2 percent at $61.95 in premarket trading.\nT-Mobile’s net income was $2.71 billion, or $3.11 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $390 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned 48 cents per share.\nRevenue rose 5.1 percent to $10.76 billion.

It has plans to launch a new streaming service this year.\nReporting by Anjali Athavaley in New York and Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T16:12:11.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
