The webcast will remain available for replay during the next 12 months.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Radware uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating income, financial income, net income and earnings per share, which are adjustments from results based on GAAP to exclude stock-based compensation expenses, in accordance with ASC No. 718, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition costs, litigation costs and gains, exchange rate differences, net on balance sheet items included in finance income and changes in the federal rate. Such exchange rate differences may vary from period to period due to changes in exchange rates driven by general market conditions or other circumstances outside of the normal course of Radware's operations. Management believes that exclusion of these charges allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent across past, present and future periods. Furthermore, Radware uses a measure called “total deferred revenues” which is defined as the sum of short and long term deferred revenues on the balance sheet and uncollected billed amounts that were offset against trade receivables, and are not presented on the balance sheet. Radware’s management believes the non-GAAP financial information provided in this release is useful to investors for the purpose of understanding and assessing Radware’s ongoing operations. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, is included with the financial information contained in this press release. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP information in evaluating and operating business internally and, as such, has determined that it is important to provide this information to investors.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release may contain statements concerning Radware’s future prospects that are “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements preceded by, followed by, or that otherwise include the words \"believes\", \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"plans\", and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as \"will\", \"should\", \"would\", \"may\" and \"could\" are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts.
