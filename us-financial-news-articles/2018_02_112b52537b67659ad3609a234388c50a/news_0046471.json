(Nasdaq: UCTT), a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems for the semiconductor and display capital equipment industries, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 29, 2017.\n\"UCT reached a new revenue milestone in the fourth quarter, capping off an extraordinary year of expansion and profitability,\" said Jim Scholhamer, President and CEO. \"Our operational flexibility enabled us to increase the amount of UCT's content on our customers' platforms, allowing us to deliver additional value and outpace the broader semiconductor capital equipment market. With a balance sheet strengthened by our recent equity offering, we are focused on opportunities to further expand our capabilities, broaden our worldwide footprint and enhance long-term shareholder value.\"\nGAAP Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $248.9 million, an increase of 2.6% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and 42.6% compared to the same period a year ago. Semiconductor revenue increased 5.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and 50.8% compared to the same period a year ago. Total revenue from outside the U.S. rose 5.6% sequentially and 55.0% compared to the same period a year ago. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 17.7%, compared to 17.6% for the prior quarter and 17.0% for the same period a year ago. Net income for the fourth quarter was $20.8 million, or $0.62 and $0.60 per basic and diluted share respectively, compared to net income of $19.7 million, or $0.59 and $0.57 per basic and diluted share respectively, in the third quarter of 2017, and net income of $10.0 million, or $0.30 per basic and diluted share for the same period a year ago.\nNet cash at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $7.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents were $68.3 million, an increase of $2.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Outstanding debt was $52.3 million, a decrease of $5.1 million compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nFor fiscal year 2017 revenue was $924.4 million, an increase of 64.3% from fiscal year 2016. Semiconductor revenue was 92.9% of total revenue for fiscal year 2017 and 90.3% for fiscal year 2016. Revenue outside the U.S. was 53.6% of total revenue in fiscal year 2017 compared to 48.0% in fiscal year 2016. Gross margin for fiscal year 2017 was 18.1% compared to 15.4% for fiscal year 2016.

Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude pre-tax charges of $1.7 million for intangible assets amortization in addition to the corresponding decrease in tax expense of approximately $2.3 million. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $21.3 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.62 for the third quarter of 2017, and non-GAAP net income of $12.0 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.36 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2017 was $80.3 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.34.

This compares to prior fiscal year non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $21.4 million and $0.65, respectively.\nThe Company has provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables included in this press release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Outlook\nThe Company expects revenue to be between $275 million to $290 million. Taking into account the additional shares issued during the recent financing, the Company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.59 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.63. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be within the targeted range of 8% to 10% and the non-GAAP tax rate should be between 14% and 16%.\nConference Call\nUCT will conduct a conference call today, Wednesday, February 21, 2018, beginning at 1:45 p.m. PDT.

Additional information is available at www.uct.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses non-GAAP net income and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release. A reconciliation of our guidance for non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 is not available due to fluctuations in the geographic mix of our earnings from quarter to quarter, which impacts our tax rate and cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts and we are unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThe foregoing information contains, or may be deemed to contain, \"forward-looking statements\" (as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
