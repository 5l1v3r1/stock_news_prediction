Agriculture and Specialty Products are expected to follow by June 1, 2019.\nThe chemicals giant saw prices rise by about 5 percent across markets in the fourth quarter, while volumes — a proxy for demand — rose 6 percent.\n\"In developed economies in particular, such as the United States, Germany, France, Canada and the U.K., we continue to see strong leading indicators of broad-based growth,\" executive chairman Andrew Liveris said in the results statement.\n\"Furthermore, early signs from the business community point to U.S. tax reform as a catalyst for further domestic capital investments.\"\nCurrently trading at a market value of about $176.9 billion, Dow and DuPont completed the $130 billion mega-merger in September. That created the world's largest chemical maker, until the company goes through with a plan to split into three companies.\nDowDuPont's merger was welcomed by investors as a way to streamline the companies' sprawling operations by combining overlapping businesses.\nThe company said on Thursday it was now planning to save $3.3 billion in costs on the back of the merger — slightly more than the $3 billion it expected to save earlier.\nFor the reported quarter DowDuPont saw a $1.1 billion benefit from lower U.S corporate taxes, but still posted a net loss of $1.2 billion from continuing operations — substantially the result of merger-related costs.\nAdjusted for those and other one-time effects, the company said it earned 83 cents on a share. Ahead of the numbers, Wall Street was expecting it to make 67 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S numbers.\nShares of the company dipped to $75 in premarket trading on Thursday compared to the previous close of $75.58.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T13:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:23:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
