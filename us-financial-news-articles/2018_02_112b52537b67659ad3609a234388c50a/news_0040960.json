Of those, seven are now being leased to Lufthansa’s Eurowings and four are flying this winter for TUI.\nJoussen said TUI would like to fly two planes out of Duesseldorf and was interested in slots there. Duesseldorf was a hub for Air Berlin and is located in Germany’s most populous region, making it attractive for airlines.\n$1 = 0.8118 euros Reporting by Victoria Bryan; Additional reporting by Sarah Young in London; Editing by Maria Sheahan and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:21:58.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
