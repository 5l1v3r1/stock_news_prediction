For winter it will base seven wide body jets there, including four which were previously based in Cologne/Bonn. \nOverall, German air traffic measured in revenue passenger kilometres rose 3.1 percent in 2017, but would have grown around 5 percent had Air Berlin not collapsed, the BDL said. \nThat underperformed Europe as a whole. The International Air Transport Association said on Thursday that European traffic rose 8.2 percent last year thanks to strong economic activity in the region driving demand.
