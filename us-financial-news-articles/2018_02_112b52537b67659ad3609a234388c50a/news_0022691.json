I‘m probably going to be supportive of removing monetary policy accommodation,” he said.\nDudley also played down the impact of the recent stock market sell-off on the U.S. economic outlook, saying that so far the declines were “small potatoes” compared to the rise in equity valuations over the past few years.\nStocks in world markets remained on shaky ground on Thursday, with major U.S. stock indexes down around 2 percent, as U.S. bond yields earlier crept back toward four-year highs.\nThe Fed has forecast three rate rises this year and investors widely expect the central bank to lift borrowing costs again when it meets on March 20-21.\nDudley said the forecast of three rate hikes still seemed a “very reasonable projection” but added there was a potential for more.\n“If the economy looks stronger as we go through the year, could that three turn out to be more? Perhaps,” he said.\nReporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:35:36.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
