I think this is good for football, that there are these new teams. Everyone should be grateful.” \nPSG have an 11-point lead at the top of Ligue 1 and play faltering European and Spanish champions Real Madrid in a blockbuster Champions League encounter next week. \nEmery thanked the club’s owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi for allowing them to follow Barca and Real’s example in breaking the bank to sign players who are among the world’s best. \n“I always remember this with Real Madrid, the signing of Zinedine Zidane, Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez. And Barca did it, too, paying Rivaldo’s release clause, and we are now seeing this financial capacity in France,” Emery added. \n“I think that’s good for this country, which should be grateful to the investment from Qatar for making sure the best players come here.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by David Goodman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T16:33:51.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
