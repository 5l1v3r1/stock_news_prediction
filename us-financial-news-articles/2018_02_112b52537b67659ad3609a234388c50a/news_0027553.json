REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Broadcom raised its cash-and-stock offer last week to $82 per share from $70, and made other concessions, including offering to pay Qualcomm an $8 billion breakup fee should antitrust regulators block the deal.\nQualcomm rejected the revised offer, as it did the first bid, saying the proposal undervalued the company and fell well short of commitments on regulatory issues.\nBroadcom had nominated a slate of 11 directors to replace Qualcomm’s board, after it rejected the first bid, worth $103 billion.\nBroadcom’s six nominees are Samih Elhage, David Golden, Veronica Hagen, Julie Hill, John Kispert and Harry You.\nMoelis and Co, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities were Broadcom’s financial advisers.\nQualcomm’s shares were up marginally premarket at $65.69, while Broadcom’s stock dipped 0.5 percent to $243.18.\nReporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T16:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T17:04:42.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
