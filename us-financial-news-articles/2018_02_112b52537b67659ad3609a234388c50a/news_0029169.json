Besides chips and soda, the study counts among ‘ultra-processed’ foods mass-produced packaged breads and buns, chocolate bars and sweets, chicken nuggets, instant noodles, and ready-made meals. \nAmong the subjects of the study, those who ate 10% more ultra-processed foods had a 12% increased likelihood of developing some form of cancer. \nThe finding is especially worrisome since processed foods were found to comprise up to 50% of the average person’s diet in many developed countries. \nWhile some health experts noted that the study isn’t conclusive, it is widely accepted that a person’s diet can affect the risk of cancer.
