O‘Leary told reporters he expected a deal within two weeks at most, adding that tax issues were holding up the accord. The airline averted widespread strikes ahead of Christmas by announcing plans to recognise pilots’ unions for the first time in its 32-year history and is talking with various organisations around Europe. O‘Leary said Ryanair was also negotiating with Italy’s ANPAV flight assistants’ union and hopes to reach a deal with them too shortly.
