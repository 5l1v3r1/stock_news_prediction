Clergymen closed the church on Sunday to protest city taxes and a proposed Israeli parliamentary bill to confiscate land sold by church authorities.\nThe clash underscored friction between the mainly Palestinian Christian community in Jerusalem and Israeli authorities after President Donald Trump’s controversial decision to recognize the city as the capital of Israel . Palestinian officials want the eastern part of Jerusalem, where the church is located, to be the capital of a future Palestinian state.\nThe Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic and Roman Catholic denominations all share custody of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nRelated\nJerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre Closed Amid Dispute With Israelis (Feb. 27) Israeli Police Recommend Charging Netanyahu With Bribery, Fraud (Feb. 14) Leaders from the three denominations said they reopened the holy site after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intervened to reach an agreement with Jerusalem’s city hall to solve the tax dispute.\n“Israel is proud to be the only country in the Middle East where Christians and believers of all faiths have full freedom of religion and worship,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday.\nChristians and tourists from the U.S., Europe and Asia thronged around the church on Wednesday after it reopened.\nJames and Susie Toynton, both Christians from the British island of Guernsey, said they had tried to visit Monday but the church was closed. Their tour guide had explained to them the details of the dispute between Israel and the church leaders, and said they understood both sides.\n“It’s a very complicated situation,” said Ms. Toynton.\nCynthia Stott, 59, was visiting Israel from Salt Lake City and said she would have been disappointed to miss a trip to the church. She had visited Christian sites in Bethlehem, Jericho and other sites of Jerusalem, and was also eager to visit the church.\n“It feels very sacred,” she said. “Some people are having a seriously authentic experience in there.”\nAlongside the tax issue, Christian leaders said they had taken the rare decision to close the church to protest a proposed Israeli parliamentary bill that would allow the state to expropriate lands sold by the churches to private investors.\nMr. Netanyahu said parliament would suspend legislative activity on the controversial land-expropriation bill while a government team studies the issue.\nLawmaker Rachel Azaria proposed the bill after the Greek Orthodox Church in recent years sold swaths of land in Jerusalem and other Israeli cities to private investors.\nChurch authorities had previously leased the land to the state and lawmakers fear that private investors would increase real-estate prices for Israelis. The bill wasn’t focused on current land held by the church, a spokesman for Ms. Azaria said.\nJerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat on Sunday said the city was due 650 million shekels ($186 million) in uncollected taxes on church-owned properties. He said the taxes didn’t apply to holy sites, only to hotels, offices and other commercial space owned by church authorities.\nIn all, the Israeli attempts to collect taxes and impose a new law had angered the Palestinian Christian community and its leaders, who in a statement Sunday likened Israeli actions to persecution of Jews during “dark periods in Europe”—an oblique reference to Nazi Germany.\nPalestinian officials in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, and the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip both issued acrimonious statements in response to the dispute between Israel and church leaders.\nIslamist militant group Hamas also called for an escalation in the “Jerusalem uprising” against Israel, echoing a rallying cry it made after the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.\nWrite to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:14:41.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
