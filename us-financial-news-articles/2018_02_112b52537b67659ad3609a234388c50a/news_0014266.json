Koji Tsuruoaka, Japan's ambassador to Britain, speaks outside 10 Downing Street after a meeting between Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and senior members of Japanese companies, in London, February 8, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls \nMay and her ministers assured Japanese businesses of the importance of maintaining free and frictionless trade after Brexit during the meeting but said nothing firm on the matter, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. \n“The point about frictionless trade and tariff-free trade was made in the meeting and acknowledged by the government and all sides as being important but nothing firm,” said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. CUSTOMS UNION UNCERTAINTY \nA spokesman at May’s office said she had agreed with them on the need to move on quickly in the Brexit talks to secure a trading relationship with the EU that is as tariff-free and frictionless as possible after the transition period. \nThursday’s meeting came after a Brexit sub-committee of ministers discussed their Brexit strategy including how closely Britain should remain aligned with the EU and its customs union, a divisive issue for the ruling Conservatives. \nBrexit minister David Davis said there was still progress to be made in the committee, after disagreements between ministers erupted into the public domain.
