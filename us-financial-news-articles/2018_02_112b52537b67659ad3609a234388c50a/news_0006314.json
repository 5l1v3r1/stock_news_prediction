They continue to show very strong growth in Europe in spite of tough comparison figures.”\nThe Swedish manufacturer said order intake of trucks at the group, which also includes brands such as Mack, Renault and UD Trucks, grew 29 percent in the quarter, beating the 15 percent rise seen by analysts.\nThe strong demand has put pressure on production and strained supply of components such as engines and axles, denting Volvo’s profitability during most of last year as it sought to clear costly bottlenecks.\n“With the high order intake we will continue to have a stretched supply chain,” Lundstedt said.\nFortified by a completed 10-billion-crown cost cutting drive, Volvo has seen its shares climb 43 percent in the past year. But while the company has benefited from upbeat markets, the deck has been reshuffled in terms of its ownership.\nIn late December, activist fund Cevian announced the sale of its Volvo stake - the second biggest by votes after Industrivarden’s - to Geely Holding.\nWith Cevian’s exit, the main champion for splitting up the sprawling group, above all spinning out its construction equipment arm, has left the building while Geely’s longer-term ambitions with the holding remain largely unclear.\n$1 = 7.8646 Swedish crowns Reporting by Niklas Pollard and Johannes Hellstrom.
