I hope the BOJ continues to promote bold monetary easing to achieve its 2 percent inflation target,” Abe told parliament. \nHe also said it was premature to declare an official end to deflation despite growing signs of strength in the economy. \n“An end to deflation means prices aren’t falling consistently and there is assurance Japan won’t slip back into deflation in the future,” Abe said. “We need to look at developments more.” \nThe remarks come ahead of a leadership change at the BOJ with the five-year terms of Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and his two deputies expiring in April and March, respectively.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nThe government is seen presenting to parliament its nominees around mid- to late February at the earliest, sources say, with a strong chance Kuroda will be reappointed. \nKuroda told the same parliamentary committee the BOJ was in no rush to withdraw its massive stimulus programme. \nHe conceded that prolonged monetary easing was adding to strains for regional banks, already suffering from narrowing margins due to an ageing population. \n“Still, it’s extremely important to achieve our 2 percent inflation target,” Kuroda said. “Japan’s inflation remains distant from our target, so we need to patiently continue with powerful monetary easing.” \nA strengthening economy and subdued inflation have posed a dilemma for the BOJ, which is forced to sustain crisis-mode stimulus despite rising costs, such as the drag on bank profits from near-zero rates. \nKuroda has struggled to hose down speculation the BOJ could follow in the footsteps of its U.S. and European peers in dialling back stimulus, driven in part by signs of recovery in the economy.
