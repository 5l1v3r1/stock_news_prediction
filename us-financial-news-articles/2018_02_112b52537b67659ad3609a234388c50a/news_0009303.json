Entered into a joint venture agreement as a majority partner to develop, build and own an estimated $23 million Lowes Foods-anchored retail center in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, increasing the Company's development pipeline to $484 million. Added approximately 132,000 square feet of retail space through the acquisitions of a Harris Teeter-anchored center in Virginia Beach, Virginia and a Publix-anchored center in Moultrie, Georgia in January 2018. The Company has also agreed to terms regarding the acquisition of two Lowes Foods-anchored centers in the Greenville and Columbia areas of South Carolina. Both acquisitions are expected to close in the late first quarter or early second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. Invested in the development of a second Whole Foods-anchored center in Delray Beach, Florida.

We expect another strong year for our company in all aspects of our business. Portfolio leasing and accretive acquisitions combined with another stellar year from our construction company will continue to deliver value to our shareholders. We also expect significant NAV and earnings growth occurring with the delivery and stabilization of several development projects beginning in the latter half of 2018.\"\nFinancial Results\nThe fourth quarter changes in net income, Normalized FFO and FFO as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by higher interest income from mezzanine lending activities and lower interest expense and were negatively impacted by lower construction segment gross profits.\nFull year changes in net income, Normalized FFO and FFO were positively impacted by higher construction segment gross profits and higher interest income from mezzanine lending activities and were negatively impacted by increased general & administrative expenses and increased interest expense. Full year net income and FFO were positively impacted by mark-to-market gains on interest rate derivatives. The full year change in net income was negatively impacted by lower gains on real estate dispositions.\nOperating Performance\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, the Company’s office, retail and multifamily core operating property portfolios were 89.9%, 96.5% and 92.9% occupied, respectively.\nTotal construction contract backlog was $49.2 million at the end of the year.\nBalance Sheet and Financing Activity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $523 million of total debt outstanding, including $66 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility. Total debt outstanding excludes unamortized GAAP fair value adjustments and deferred financing costs. Approximately 44% of the Company’s debt had fixed interest rates or were subject to interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2017. After considering LIBOR interest rate caps with strike prices at or below 150 basis points, as of December 31, 2017, 100% of the Company’s debt was fixed or hedged.\nOutlook\nThe Company is introducing its 2018 full-year Normalized FFO guidance in the range of $1.00 to $1.05 per diluted share, as set forth in the presentation that can also be found on the Investors page of the Company's website at www.ArmadaHoffler.com . The following table outlines the Company's assumptions along with Normalized FFO per diluted share estimates for 2018. The Company's executive management will provide further details regarding its 2018 earnings guidance during today's webcast and conference call.\nFull-year 2018 Guidance [1] Expected Ranges Total NOI $80.7M $81.4M Construction Segment Gross Profit $4.4M $7.5M G&A expenses $10.7M $11.0M Interest income $9.0M $9.5M Interest expense $19.7M $20.3M Normalized FFO per diluted share [2] $1.00 $1.05 [1] Includes the following assumptions:\n• Raising $55 million through the ATM program for a full year weighted average share count of 64.5 million\n• Interest expense is calculated based on the Forward LIBOR Curve, which forecasts rates rising to 2.2% by year end\n• Acquisition of four retail centers\n• Disposition of a newly constructed distribution center in the fourth quarter of 2018\n[2] Normalized FFO excludes certain items, including debt extinguishment losses, acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, mark-to-market adjustments for interest rate derivatives and other non-comparable items. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" The Company does not provide a reconciliation for its guidance range of Normalized FFO per diluted share to net income per diluted share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure, because it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate estimate of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort as a result of the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and/or amounts of various items that would impact net income per diluted share. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information and believes that providing a reconciliation for its guidance range of Normalized FFO per diluted share would imply a degree of precision for its forward-looking net income per diluted share that could be misleading to investors.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nFurther details regarding operating results, properties and leasing statistics can be found in the Company’s supplemental financial package available on the Investors page at www.ArmadaHoffler.com .\nWebcast and Conference Call\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call on Tuesday, February 6, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to review financial results and discuss recent events. The live webcast will be available through the Investors page of the Company’s website, www.ArmadaHoffler.com , or through www.viavid.com .

These forward-looking statements may include comments relating to the current and future performance of the Company’s operating property portfolio, the Company’s development pipeline, the Company’s construction and development business, including backlog and timing of deliveries, financing activities, as well as acquisitions, dispositions and the Company’s financial outlook, guidance and expectations. For a description of factors that may cause the Company’s actual results or performance to differ from its forward-looking statements, please review the information under the heading “Risk Factors” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company calculates FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nFFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. The Company uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the Company’s operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared period-over-period, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the Company’s operating performance with that of other REITs.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the Company’s properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company’s properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the Company’s results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the Company’s performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the Company does, and, accordingly, the Company’s FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs’ FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the Company’s performance.\nManagement also believes that the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT’s definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by the Company’s operating property portfolio and affect the comparability of the Company’s period-over-period performance. Accordingly, management believes that Normalized FFO is a more useful performance measure that excludes certain items, including but not limited to, debt extinguishment losses and prepayment penalties, property acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, mark-to-market adjustments for interest rate derivatives and other non-comparable items.\nFor reference, as an aid in understanding the Company’s computation of FFO and Normalized FFO, a reconciliation of net income calculated in accordance with GAAP to FFO and Normalized FFO has been included in the final page of this release.\nARMADA HOFFLER PROPERTIES, INC.
