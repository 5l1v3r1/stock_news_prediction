Analysts said the metal had found technical support around $2,140 in the last few sessions.\nLEAD INFLOWS: Lead inventories jumped 12 percent by 12,925 tonnes to 125,800 tonnes on Wednesday after falling to their lowest since August 2009.\nLME LEAD: Lead was the biggest decliner on the exchange, with a bid at $2,532 per tonne, representing a 1.7 percent fall.\nOTHER METALS: Tin shed 0.5 percent to $21,605, zinc dipped 0.8 percent to $3,459 while nickel was largely flat at $13,830.\nAdditional reporting by Tom Daly in BEIJING Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T14:12:32.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
