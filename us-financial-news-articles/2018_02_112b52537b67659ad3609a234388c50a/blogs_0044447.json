The new target is 33 percent higher than Friday's closing price.

He predicts that strong Chinese growth will enable management to meet its targeted $6 billion in revenue by 2020.\n\"A premium multiple is warranted as we are confident that the SKX business is on the verge of a material positive inflection,\" Poser concludes in his Feb. 9 report.
