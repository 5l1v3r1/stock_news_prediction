Her decision comes days after she rejected the funding for the utility, known as Prepa, saying the cash-strapped power utility hadn’t looked hard enough for alternative funding before seeking court approval of a loan\nPrepa, which had sought approval to tap $550 million of a proposed $1 billion financing package, is in desperate need of funding to maintain restoration work on the island’s power grid and to prevent additional blackouts .\nPrepa’s chief financial adviser had told the court last week that the government-run utility must have additional financing in place by later this week or parts of the Island would begin to go dark within a matter of days.\nA group of Prepa bondholders opposed the government-backed loan and had offered their own $534 million financing package which it claimed wouldn’t disadvantage other lenders.\nPuerto Rico was already struggling with a $73 billion debt load and a decade of economic stagnation when Hurricane Maria struck in September.\nThe utility’s cash balances have dwindled as hundreds of thousands of customers remain without service months after Maria devastated the island. Offline customers aren’t paying electric bills, eating into Prepa’s revenues while construction bills pile up.\nThe federal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances placed the central government under what amounts to bankruptcy in May and two months later voted to move Prepa under court protection as well. Governor Ricardo Rosselló said recently he wants Prepa privatized to cut costs while attracting private partners to invest in upgrading its assets.\nWrite to Tom Corrigan at tom.corrigan@wsj.com and Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T08:49:59.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
