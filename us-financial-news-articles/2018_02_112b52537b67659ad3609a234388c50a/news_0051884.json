Period. I am the best at this,“ McGregor wrote on his official Instagram page. ”I put my name forward to step in at UFC 222... but I was told there wasn’t enough time to generate the money that the UFC would need.\n”I was excited about bouncing in last minute and taking out the final featherweight, without all the rest of the stuff that comes with this game. Please respect the insane amount of work outside the fight game that I have put in.\n“On top of the fighting. I am here. It is on them to come and get me. Because I am here...”\nMcGregor is yet to fight following his TKO loss to Mayweather, the second biggest pay-per-view fight in history, but has previously said that he does not want to compete in the WWE.\nEdgar was expected to take on American Max Holloway for the featherweight title at UFC 222 but the 26-year-old withdrew due to injury and has been replaced by Brian Ortega.\nReporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:09:40.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
