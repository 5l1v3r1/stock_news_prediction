A spokesman for T-Systems confirmed that the business relationship was over.\nEarlier, business weekly WirtschaftsWoche cited a source at Thyssenkrupp as saying the company had scrapped the seven-year contract, worth 700 million euros ($870 million), because T-Systems “had promised solutions it could not deliver”.\nA spokesman for Thyssenkrupp said these statements were untrue.\nThe cancellation of the IT deal comes as Thyssenkrupp faces pressure from activist shareholders to restructure its conglomerate structure after several years of weak share price performance.\nDeutsche Telekom has meanwhile appointed a new CEO for T-Systems, Adel Al-Saleh, to halt a slide in profits at the business. It plans to break up the company into two in order to bring it closer to its customers.\nDeutsche Telekom could not immediately be reached for comment.\nDeutsche Telekom booked a 1.2-billion-euro ($1.5-billion)charge against goodwill at T-Systems in the third quarter, reflecting the adverse business environment as clients increasingly shift to cloud service providers.
