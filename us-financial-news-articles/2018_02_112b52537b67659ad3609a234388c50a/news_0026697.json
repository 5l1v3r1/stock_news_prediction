It will now have about 200 sales representatives, Purdue said.\n\"We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers,\" the Stamford, Connecticut-based company said in a statement.\nDoctors with opioid-related questions will be directed to its medical affairs department. Its sales representatives will now focus on Symproic, a drug for treating opioid-induced constipation, and other potential non-opioid products, Purdue said.\nOpioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAmong other opioid producers, Endo International Plc agreed in July to pull its Opana ER painkiller after the Food and Drug Administration called for its withdrawal.\nPurdue and other drugmakers have been fighting lawsuits by states, counties and cities that have accused them of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing.\nThe lawsuits have generally accused Purdue of downplaying OxyContin's addiction risk and of misleading marketing that overstated the benefits of opioids for treating chronic, rather than short-term, pain.\nAt least 14 states have sued privately held Purdue. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday accusing Purdue of deceptively marketing prescription opioids.\nshow chapters New Hampshire sues OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma 6:34 PM ET Wed, 4 Oct 2017 | 00:48 Purdue is also facing a federal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut.\nPurdue has denied the allegations in the various lawsuits. It has said its drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and account for only 2 percent of all opioid prescriptions.\nPurdue and three executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal charges related to the misbranding of OxyContin and agreed to pay $634.5 million to resolve a U.S. Justice Department probe.\nThat year, Purdue also reached a $19.5-million settlement with 26 states and the District of Columbia. It agreed in 2015 to pay $24 million to resolve a lawsuit by Kentucky.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for his response to the opioid crisis.
