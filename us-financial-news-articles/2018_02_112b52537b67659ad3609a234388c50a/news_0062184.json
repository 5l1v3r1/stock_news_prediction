( reut.rs/2orFV8S )\n“This is great news, but the market is still currently closed,” said Sarah Li, director for Greater China at the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council in Hong Kong.\nThe industry association visited China’s Ministry of Agriculture in January to urge the government to remove the import ban, which it considers to be no longer valid after an absence of outbreaks of highly lethal forms of the virus, she said.\nExports of poultry and eggs to China were worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year before the restrictions.\nThe withdrawal of the white-feathered broiler levy comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser, Liu He, was due to arrive in the United States for trade talks.\nThe official China Daily struck a conciliatory tone in a Tuesday editorial, saying Liu’s visit highlights that Beijing is seeking to work with Washington to tackle trade differences head-on.\n“Frank and sincere talks with a willingness to agree on quid pro quo actions to achieve a mutually satisfactory solution are the best, if not only way, to avoid escalating retaliatory measures that would lead to a trade war that would be damaging for both,” the China Daily said.\nReporting by Josephine Mason, Dominique Patton and Hallie Gu; Editing by Joseph Radford and Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://reut.rs/2orFV8S"], "published": "2018-02-27T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:22:48.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
