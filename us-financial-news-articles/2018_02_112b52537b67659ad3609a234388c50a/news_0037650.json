The JCBA accomplishes those goals and provides for a smooth path to combine the two Flight Attendant groups,\" said Jeffrey Peterson, AFA president at Alaska Airlines .\nHighlights of the agreement will be released to members and include contractual improvements and pay increases for all Alaska Flight Attendants. The agreement also provides for immediate parity on pay rates for former Virgin America Flight Attendants who will transition onto the Alaska JCBA.\nThe JCBA will be sent out for full membership vote. Virgin America Flight Attendants joined AFA in April 2017 shortly after the announced merger of Alaska Airlines and Virgin America.\nThe Association of Flight Attendants is the Flight Attendant union. Focused 100 percent on Flight Attendant issues, AFA has been the leader in advancing the Flight Attendant profession for 72 years. Serving as the voice for Flight Attendants in the workplace, in the aviation industry, in the media and on Capitol Hill, AFA has transformed the Flight Attendant profession by raising wages, benefits and working conditions. Nearly 50,000 Flight Attendants come together to form AFA, part of the 700,000-member strong Communications Workers of America (CWA), AFL-CIO.
