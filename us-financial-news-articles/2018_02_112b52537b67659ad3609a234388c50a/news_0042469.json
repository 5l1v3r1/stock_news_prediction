There was also a big risk that shelling could inadvertently result in a catastrophic chemical spill at a water filtration plant near the front, he said.\n“The risk is growing that one day you will have an incident that gets out of control,” he said.\nGreminger said he worried about a general increase in tensions between Russia and the West in the region, at a time when both have staged snap military exercises.\nLater, in a fiery speech to the conference, Ukraine’s President Pedro Poroshenko urged delegates to push for United Nations peacekeepers to be deployed across the entire region controlled by pro-Russian separatists.\n“There is a chance for Moscow to show the sense of compromise and agree to U.N. peacekeepers throughout the whole territory of Donbass including the uncontrolled part of Ukraine on the Russian border,” he said.\nGreminger said discussions about a U.N. peacekeeping force could represent a first step toward a “face-saving move” to end the fighting in the Donbass region. He said one option might be a joint OSCE-UN peacekeeping force.\nThe OSCE, set up during the Cold War as a forum that would include both sides, is still one of the few bodies which regularly brings Russia together with the United States and its Western allies.\nIt has initiated a dialogue aimed at lowering military and political risks, which Greminger said could lead to some confidence-building measures in 12-18 months, with an eye to working on conventional arms reduction in 3-5 years.\nBut the prerequisite was rebuilding trust among the parties, Greminger said. “We need some political leadership ... and we need to do that now because we are on the brink of major conflict,” he said.\nGreminger said he hoped Ukraine could agree to some concessions on a dispute over visas that prompted Russian military officers to withdraw from a Ukrainian-Russian ceasefire control group in December.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Peter Graff and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T00:28:34.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
