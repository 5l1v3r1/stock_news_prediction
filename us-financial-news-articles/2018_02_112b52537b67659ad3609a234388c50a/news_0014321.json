And we will continue to isolate North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile program once and for all,” Pence said after meeting with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \nFollowing talks that showcased the U.S.-Japan security alliance, Abe said the two had agreed they could ”never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea. \nPence reiterated Washington’s stance that “all options are on the table” to deal with North Korea. \nPence’s trip to South Korea from Thursday will coincide with a visit to the Games by North Korea’s ceremonial leader, Kim Yong Nam, the most senior North Korean official to enter the South since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce. \nPence had stopped short of ruling out the prospect of meeting senior North Korean officials but President Donald Trump has cast doubt on U.S. negotiations with Pyongyang any time soon. The White House has also cautioned against reading too much into remarks Pence made en route to Japan. \nPence warned against allowing North Korea, which has sent a team to the Games, to use the Olympics for propaganda.

Besides extending the range and increasing the accuracy of its Patriot system, it will add two U.S.-made ground-based Aegis radar stations and interceptors and plans to add to its arsenal air-fired cruise missiles that can strike North Korean missile sites.
