Recent opinion polls have shown just 2 percent support for the party, which has focused its 2018 platform on fighting poverty. \n“For the moment we have decided to suspend campaign activities until we have sufficient guarantees,” said party leader Pablo Catatumbo. “We ask all parties and political movements, without exception, to reject these type of provocations.” \nCatatumbo said the suspension would continue until the government is able to provide adequate security for the candidates. \nThe FARC has repeatedly raised concerns that they may be assassinated by right-wing paramilitary gangs or drug traffickers, in a replay of about 5,000 targeted killings during the 1980s, when the group first attempted to found the Patriotic Union political party.

Londono was greeted at campaign events over the weekend by protesters who shouted “murderer, terrorist” as they pelted him and his vehicle with eggs, tomatoes and plastic bottles. \nSenate candidate Ivan Marquez, one of 74 FARC members running for legislative posts, canceled an event on Sunday in the southern city of Florencia because of dozens of protesters. \nFARC, guaranteed 10 seats in Congress through 2026 under the terms of the peace deal, have accused the right-wing Democratic Center political party, run by former president Alvaro Uribe, of provoking the attacks. \nPresident Juan Manuel Santos has committed to ensuring the FARC’s safety as they campaign and urged Colombians to protest peacefully. \n“I ask that we be tolerant and generous between ourselves. I don’t think this is in the interest of democracy and we all must reject these aggressions that some candidates are suffering, especially the FARC candidates,” Santos said on Thursday.
