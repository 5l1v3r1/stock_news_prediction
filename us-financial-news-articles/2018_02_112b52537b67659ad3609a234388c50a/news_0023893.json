Deliveries are to start as soon as in 2020, the Dubai-based carrier said. \nAirbus had previously said it would have to end production of the A380 if it failed to secure the huge Emirates deal. \nAlongside the contract signing, visiting French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum discussed the expansion of air services between France and the United Arab Emirates, the airline said without elaborating. \nThe latest order brings Emirates’ commitment to the A380 programme to 178 aircraft, it said, adding that it was evaluating engine options for the new planes.
