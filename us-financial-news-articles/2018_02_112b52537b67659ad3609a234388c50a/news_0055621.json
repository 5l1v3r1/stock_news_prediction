REUTERS/John Sibley When the “Garlic Girls”, nicknamed after the county from which they hail that is known for garlic, were introduced the crowd cheered and let out a mighty roar after every shot.\nAfter the Korean rink put a three on the scoreboard in the opening end it looked as if they might romp to victory but Japan would not buckle and when they took two in the ninth and stole another point in the 10th to level at 7-7 the crowd were on the edge of their seats.\nRUMBLING STONE\nSlideshow (8 Images) The tension built with every rock until ice-cool Kim settled in for her final shot and the arena fell silent, the only sound the stone rumbling across the ice.\nWith the bespectacled Kim barking commands to her sweepers the rock slowed to stop on the button and the crowd erupted as the foursome embraced and tears flowed.\nAfter shaking hands with Japan the Korean foursome came together and bowed to the crowd, blowing kisses to wild applause as they walked off the ice.\nAs “Garlic Girls” mania swept the arena a high quality semi-final on another sheet between Sweden and Britain played out almost unnoticed.\nSweden, gold medal winners in 2006 and 2010 and silver medalists in 2014, took a 2-0 lead in the second end and battled Britain to a 3-3 draw after five.\nBut Swedes put away Eve Muirhead’s foursome with a pair in the six and stole three in the seventh to bring the contest to a quick end.\n”The sixth end she made a fantastic shot for two and then in the seventh end of course coming up slightly light on that draw and nicking the guard was crucial,“ Muirhead said. ”That’s curling isn’t it.\n“It comes down to inches and millimeters and there it was. But giving up a steal three, you’re going to be on the back foot.”\nAdditional reporting by Jane Chung, Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:32:54.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
