Wu, who in qualifying broke the previous record set by American John Celski in 2012, went 0.216 seconds faster in the final, with another South Korean, Lim Hyo-jun, taking the bronze medal. The 23-year-old Chinese skater clenched his fists above his head in celebration as he took a victory lap around the rink at Gangneung Ice Arena. “Today, I didn’t give my competitors a chance and I kept my speed from the start,” he said. “More importantly I think I believed in myself.” Short Track Speed Skating Events - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's 500m Finals - Gangneung Ice Arena - Gangneung, South Korea - February 22, 2018 - Gold medallist Wu Dajing of China skates to victory ahead of silver medallist Hwang Dae-heon of South Korea and bronze medallist Lim Hyo-jun of South Korea.
