CIRCULATION BOOST \nTrinity Mirror ( TNI.L ) said it planned to save 20 million pounds in annual costs by 2020 by cutting back-office jobs and sharing editorial teams in sport and features. \nIts shares jumped 12 percent on the announcement, which was accompanied by an upbeat trading statement showing that the company had paid down debt and was on track to beat forecasts. \nBoth the Daily Mirror and the Express have seen their circulation tumble in recent years, forcing them to slash costs and invest in their online sites to remain profitable. \nWhile other media owners have sold out of newspapers in recent years, such as Pearson ( PSON.L ) selling the Financial Times and Rupert Murdoch putting his newspapers in a separate company, Trinity Mirror has doubled down on the industry. \nFox, who took over the company in 2012 after running music retailer HMV, has stripped out costs, shared content across its many titles and bought smaller rivals. \nHe said the acquisition would be materially earnings enhancing in the first full year of ownership and give the larger group a more robust source of income based on circulation revenue rather than the more volatile advertising. \nThe combined group will have a digital audience of 234 million monthly unique browsers, excluding those on apps. \nIn areas such as sport, the new group will increase its coverage by assigning one reporter to cover a match for multiple titles, freeing up other reporters. \n($1 = 0.7164 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T12:30:10.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
