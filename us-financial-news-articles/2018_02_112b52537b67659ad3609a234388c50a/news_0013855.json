The company reported earnings Tuesday night.\nThe company's net income was $19.1 million, or 11 cents per share, from $91.6 million, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier, the drop being due to one-time charges including changes to the U.S. tax code.\nExcluding those charges, the company earned 69 cents per share, 6 cents above analysts' average estimate.\nAkamai also announced it cut 400 positions, or 5 percent of its global workforce. \n\"As part of our effort to improve operational efficiency, we reduced headcounts in targeted areas of business, most notably in areas tied to our media business,\" Chief Executive Tom Leighton said on a post-earnings call with analysts.\nActivist investor Elliott Management said in December it took a 6.5 percent stake in Akamai and that it would push the company to curtail wasteful spending. \nShares of Akamai are up 2.5 percent year to date. \n--Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T18:47:27.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
