War Crimes Tribunal found him guilty of genocide. \n“A thousand life sentences and an honourable Serb would still hail you,” said the banner displayed by Red Star fans, who also chanted Mladic’s name during the match. \nHowever, UEFA said on Monday the stadium ban had been “deferred for a probationary period of two years”. It also cut a fine on Red Star from 50,000 euros ($62,000) to 30,000. \nRed Star said last month they had done everything in their power to be good organisers and described the original decision as draconian.
