Company’s 2018 booked position at all-time high entering the year with load factor and pricing higher than prior year across all three brands driven by strong demand across all core markets.

Norwegian Bliss, the first custom-designed ship for the lucrative Alaska cruise market, will join the fleet in the second quarter.\n“The strong, record performance we delivered in 2017 was the perfect end to a historic year as we celebrate the five year anniversary of our initial public offering. Over the last five years we have continued our track record of consistent financial performance with a more than sixfold increase in EPS, a doubling of revenue and the expansion of Adjusted ROIC to double-digit levels,\" said Frank Del Rio, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “It has been a remarkable journey for our Company with more major milestones to come and an amazing trajectory of profit growth for 2018 and beyond. Our solid revenue and earnings performance will continue in 2018, having entered the year in the best booked position in our Company’s history with pricing above prior year across all three of our brands.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nGAAP net income was $98.8 million or EPS of $0.43 compared to $72.2 million or $0.32 in the prior year. The Company generated Adjusted Net Income of $156.8 million or Adjusted EPS of $0.68 compared to $127.7 million or $0.56 in the prior year.\nRevenue increased 11.1% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion in 2016. Adjusted Net Revenue increased 12.6% to $969.7 million compared to $861.6 million in 2016.

Gross Yield increased 2.5% and Adjusted Net Yield increased 3.4% on a Constant Currency basis and 3.9% on an as reported basis.\nAn increase in Capacity Days along with an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses increased total cruise operating expense 8.4% in 2017 compared to 2016.

The Company generated Adjusted Net Income of $907.7 million or Adjusted EPS of $3.96 compared to $776.3 million or $3.41 in the prior year, despite unprecedented weather-related headwinds experienced in 2017. This strong growth follows a 49.5% increase in GAAP EPS and an 18.4% increase in Adjusted EPS from 2015 to 2016, further demonstrating the Company’s continued underlying earnings power.\nRevenue increased 10.7% to $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion in 2016. Net Revenue increased 11.2% to $4.2 billion compared to $3.8 billion in 2016. These increases were primarily attributed to a 6.0% increase in Capacity Days due to the delivery of Norwegian Joy in April 2017, Regent’s Seven Seas Explorer in June 2016 and Oceania Cruises’ Sirena in April 2016 and strong organic pricing growth across all core markets. Gross Yield increased 4.4% and Adjusted Net Yield increased 5.0% on a Constant Currency basis and 4.8% on an as reported basis.\nAn increase in Capacity Days along with an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses increased total cruise operating expense 7.5% in 2017 compared to 2016.

The Company reported fuel expense of $361.0 million in the period.\nInterest expense, net decreased to $267.8 million in 2017 from $276.9 million in 2016.

In connection with refinancings of our senior notes and certain of our credit facilities, interest expense, net included losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of $23.9 million in 2017 and $39.2 million in 2016.\nOther income (expense), net was an expense of $10.4 million in 2017 compared to an expense of $8.3 million in 2016. In 2017, the expense was primarily related to losses on foreign currency exchange. In 2016, the expense was primarily related to $16.1 million of unrealized and realized losses on fuel swap derivative hedge contracts partially offset by $4.5 million of gains on foreign currency exchange and $3.9 million of gains on foreign currency exchange derivative hedge contracts.\n2018 Outlook\n“The continued strong global demand for our portfolio of brands will enable us to further grow revenue, resulting in our sixth consecutive year of Net Yield growth. This, coupled with the benefit of the launch of Norwegian Bliss and a continued focus on costs, will drive 2018 earnings to record highs,” said Wendy Beck, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n2018 Guidance and Sensitivities\nIn addition to announcing the results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, the Company also provided guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018, along with accompanying sensitivities. The Company does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of certain gains and charges. These items are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company has not provided reconciliations between the Company’s 2018 guidance and the most directly comparable GAAP measures because it would be too difficult to prepare a reliable U.S. GAAP quantitative reconciliation without unreasonable effort.\nFirst Quarter 2018\nFull Year 2018 As Reported Constant\nCurrency As Reported Constant\nCurrency Adjusted Net Yield Approx. 1.25% Approx. 0.50% Approx. 2.75% Approx. 2.0% Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day Approx.

An unfunded defined benefit pension plan for certain crew members which computes benefits based on years of service, subject to certain requirements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Net Revenue, Adjusted Net Revenue, Net Yield, Adjusted Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost, Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted ROIC, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, to enable us to analyze our performance. See “Terminology” for the definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Net Revenue and Net Yield to manage our business on a day-to-day basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.\nAs our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the U.S., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar, which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-GAAP measures on a Constant Currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures on both a reported and Constant Currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are appropriate as supplemental financial measures as they are used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense and Adjusted EBITDA Margin is useful for period-over-period comparisons. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not defined terms under GAAP nor are they intended to be measures of liquidity or cash flows from operations or measures comparable to net income as they do not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and they include other supplemental adjustments.\nIn addition, Adjusted Net Revenue and Adjusted Net Yield, which exclude certain business combination accounting entries, are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating business and provide greater transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net income and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. Our management believes the presentation of Adjusted ROIC, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides a useful performance metric to both management and investors for evaluating our effective use of capital. In addition, management uses this measure as a component of our incentive compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Revenue, Adjusted Net Yield, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted ROIC may not be indicative of future adjustments or results. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a write-off of $11.2 million of deferred financing fees due to the refinancing of certain credit facilities, a similar write-off was not incurred in either of the years ended December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2015. We included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income since this amount was not representative of our day-to-day operations and we have included similar adjustments non-representative in prior periods.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
