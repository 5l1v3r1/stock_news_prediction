It touched a fresh three-year low of 88.438 earlier this week.\nAgainst the euro, the dollar also gave up its gains and was down 0.1 percent as the single currency once again pushed past $1.24 to trade at $1.24275.\n“While the kneejerk reaction has been a higher dollar, we expect the positive effect on the dollar to fade rather soon,” ING analysts said.\n“Not only is there already a fair degree of tightening priced in, but synchronised economic recovery elsewhere and still very much present U.S. political uncertainty...suggest that the overnight dollar strength is unlikely to transform into a trend.”\nThe euro rose around 3.5 percent in January, during which it scaled a three-year peak above $1.25, amid prospects for the European Central Bank to begin normalising monetary policy this year.\nThat prospect got a boost earlier on Wednesday after last month’s underlying euro zone inflation picked up pace.\nTraders are awaiting European manufacturing survey data, as well as comments by the European Central Bank chief economist, due later on Thursday.\nThe dollar did hold on to its gains against the yen. It edged up 0.3 percent to 109.56 yen, moving away from a four-month low of 108.28 plumbed on Friday.\nThe U.S. currency lost 3.1 percent against the yen in January, weighed by a bevy of factors including concerns about U.S. trade protectionism and lingering speculation the Bank of Japan was gearing up to begin an exit from its easy monetary policy.\n“Dollar/yen is still in a consolidation phase,” said Tareck Horchani, head of Asia-Pacific sales trading for Saxo Markets in Singapore, adding that the dollar’s bounce was still looking tepid.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets (Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in TOKYO and Masayuki Kitano in SINGAPORE)\n ", "external_links": ["http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:42:35.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
