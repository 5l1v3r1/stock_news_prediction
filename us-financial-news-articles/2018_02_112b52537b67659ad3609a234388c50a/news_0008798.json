LITE did $200 million in 3D sales in December and is guiding to only about $60 million in March. However, after reports from VIAV (Viavi Solutions) and AAPL this is not a surprise,” said Genovese. \nApple will halve its iPhone X production target for the first three months of the year to around 20 million units, Nikkei reported late last month. \nLumentum said it expected demand to rebound in the second half of its fiscal year. \nRosenblatt’s Jun Zhang estimated Apple to procure 120-150 million 3D sensing components for its product ramp in second half of 2018, which comes in line with Lumentum’s expectations. \nLumentum’s shares were up 21 percent at $51.70 in afternoon trading. They had touched a high of $52.40.
