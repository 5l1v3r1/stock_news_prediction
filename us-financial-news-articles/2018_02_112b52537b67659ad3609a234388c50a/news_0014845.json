It is hard for me to get real bearish in crude given that the global economy is doing well,\" said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, Missouri.\nU.S. stocks plunged in highly volatile trading on Monday, with the Dow industrials and S&P 500 posting their biggest one-day percentage drop since August 2011.
