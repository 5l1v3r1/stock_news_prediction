Since the snowboard is attached to your feet, almost any backwards spinning move starts with a Cab,” Hawk said.\nSnowboarding - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's Halfpipe Finals - Phoenix Snow Park – Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 14, 2018 - Chase Josey of the U.S. competes. REUTERS/Mike Blake WHITE MCTWIST It is not uncommon for tricks to be named after the people who first performed them, including the McTwist, a forward flipping backside 540.\nAmerican Shaun White, who won his third Olympic gold medal in the men’s halfpipe on Wednesday, is credited with creating a double McTwist, which includes a 720 degree rotation, and performing it for the first time when winning halfpipe gold at Vancouver in 2010.\nSlideshow (3 Images) White also performed a trick named a “Tomahawk” after a large steak enjoyed at the Winter X Games in his gold medal run on Wednesday.\nThe performance showcased White’s stunning repertoire but the tricks that won him the title were the 1440s at the beginning of his set.\nIt was the first time two tricks involving eight full spins have been performed back-to-back in the same run at a major competition.\n“I was fearful of doing that trick,” White told reporters.\n“I did a couple of them in practice during the holiday break but then I fell and got sick, so I guessed it would have to wait for the Olympics.”\nWhite knew he had to deliver this set of tricks to take gold from Japan’s Ayumu Hirano, another man capable of back-to-back 1440s.\n“I knew I had it in me and the fear was out of the door because I am at the Olympics and I have got to do it,” White said.\n”So I am standing at the top, in my favorite position, with the pressure of the world, one run to go.\n“I put it down, linked the combinations and landing the first 14 really set the tone for the other one as I landed really well.”\nReporting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T16:12:46.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
