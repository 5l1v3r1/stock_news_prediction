AURA is not capable of delivering food items yet, so we ordered several bottled waters and towels. \nAs a hotel guest, the experience was relatively seamless. The only notable flaw was when AURA indecisively turned in circles in front of our hotel room after the delivery was made before finally cruising back down the hallway toward the elevators. M Social Hotel Aura, a hotel robot which delivers items to guests \nBut during a separate trip in which CNBC followed AURA from its charging station in the lobby to the hotel room, things weren't completely smooth. \nAURA has the ability to wirelessly call for an elevator (the staff says it has a preferred one), but this time it hesitated to enter an opened elevator with several guests already inside with large luggage waiting to go to their rooms.

In fact, maybe small flaws are simply part of the design to make it feel more ... human?
