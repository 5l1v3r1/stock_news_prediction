The pension reform requires changes to the Constitution, so there was doubt if the operation in Rio would stop that process. Temer said the government would suspend the intervention to allow for the vote, when the Congress defines a date for it.\nReporting by Lisandra Paraguassu; Writing by Marcelo TeixeiraEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T00:25:30.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
