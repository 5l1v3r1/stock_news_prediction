The companyâ€™s North America distribution business, its biggest, rose 8 percent. \nTotal revenue increased about 7 percent to $53.62 billion. \nNet income attributable to McKesson jumped 42.6 percent to $903 million, or $4.33 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. \nExcluding items, McKesson earned $3.41 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $2.94, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThe company also narrowed its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast range to between $12.50 and $12.80 per share, from $11.80 to $12.50 as a result of a lower tax rate and share count. \n(This version of the story corrects paragraph 5 to say net income rose 42.6 percent, not 42.5 percent) Reporting by Anuron Kumar Mitra and Manas Mishra; Editing by Maju Samuel", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:29:58.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
