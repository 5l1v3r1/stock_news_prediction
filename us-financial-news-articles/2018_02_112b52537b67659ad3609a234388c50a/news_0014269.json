She is a talented athlete and wonderful role model,” said British ski and snowboard performance director Dan Hunt. \nOrmerod last year became the first Briton to win a World Cup big air title. She was also third in slopestyle at the 2016 X Games in Aspen. \nBritain has set a ‘best ever’ target of at least five medals from Pyeongchang after more than doubling funding since Sochi four years ago. \nBritain won four medals in Sochi, the country’s best haul since 1924.
