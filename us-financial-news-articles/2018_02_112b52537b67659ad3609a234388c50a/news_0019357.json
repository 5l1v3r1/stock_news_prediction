The bolivar is down some 40 percent against the dollar in the last month alone.\nA million dollars of Venezuelan bolivars bought when the currency controls were introduced would now be worth just $7 on the black market.\nThe government has not published inflation data for more than two years though has increased the minimum wage repeatedly in a nod to rising prices.\nThe government raised the minimum wage 40 percent on Jan. 1, making it roughly equivalent now to just over $1 per month.\nAdditional reporting by Leon Wietfeld; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T06:10:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
