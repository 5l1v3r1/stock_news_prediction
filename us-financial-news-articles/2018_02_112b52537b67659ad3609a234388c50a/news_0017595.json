At that level, U.S. production would overtake the current output in Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\nOPEC and other producers, including Russia, have cut production since January 2017 to force down global inventories, but these cuts have been somewhat offset by rising U.S. oil production.\nOil prices were also pressured by an announcement from Iran that it is looking to boost production over the next four years.\n“The Iranians are looking to increase production...despite their alleged adherence to the OPEC-Russia deal. Everybody is itching to produce more oil,” said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York.\nTraders also noted the restart of the Forties pipeline in the North Sea, added to losses in crude prices.\nThe pipeline, which carries around a quarter of all North Sea crude output and roughly a third of Britain’s offshore natural gas production, shut on Wednesday for the second time in two months after a valve closure at a Scottish facility.\n“It is now clear that oil prices in late January were too high to keep the oil market balanced in the long term,” Commerzbank analysts wrote. “This is because U.S. oil production is now rising so sharply that there is a risk of renewed oversupply if OPEC does not voluntarily renounce market share.”\nEarlier this week, the EIA projected U.S. production would rise to a record high annual average of 10.6 million bpd in 2018 and 11.2 million bpd in 2019, up from 9.3 million bpd in 2017.\nThe current all-time U.S. annual output peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data.\nAdditional reporting by Scott DiSavino in New York; Amanda Cooper in London; and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2EtJgen", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:05:21.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
