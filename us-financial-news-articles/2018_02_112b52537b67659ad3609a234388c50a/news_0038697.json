The Fanta and Diet Coke maker reported a net loss of $2.75 billion (1.95 billion pounds), or 65 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to the charge. A year earlier, the company had posted a profit of $550 million, or 13 cents per share. ( bit.ly/2Eyyffi ) Net operating revenue fell to $7.51 billion from $9.41 billion a year earlier, mainly due to the refranchising of its bottling operations, but beat analystsâ€™ estimate of $7.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
