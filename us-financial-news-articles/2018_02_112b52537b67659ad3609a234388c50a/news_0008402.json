Its shares rose 2 percent in extended trading.\nSkyworks earned $2 per share, excluding items, beating the estimate of $1.92. Revenue rose 15 percent to $1.05 billion, in line with analysts’ expectation.\nHowever, net income fell to $70.4 million, or 38 cents per share, for the first quarter ended Dec. 29, due to a $315.2 million income tax provision.\nReporting by Shariq Khan and Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T01:57:35.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
