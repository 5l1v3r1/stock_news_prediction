Jobs and friend Steve Wozniak founded Apple about three years later. Jobs died of cancer in 2011 at the age of 56. \nThough Jobs responded on the form that he had a driver’s license, he said his access to transportation was “possible, but not probable.” Next to “Phone:” he wrote “none.” \nThe document will be part of a pop culture sale by RR Auction that will take place between March 8 and 15. \nTwo other Jobs items will appear in the same auction - a Mac OS X technical manual signed by Jobs in 2001, valued at $25,000, and a signed 2008 newspaper clipping, valued at $15,000, with a photo of Jobs and a headline that reads “New, faster iPhone will sell for $199.” \nThe auction will also feature an original fingerprint card from Jimi Hendrix’s 1969 arrest in Toronto on drug charges, signed by the late rock musician, which is valued at $15,000. \nIt will include a love letter from the late British singer Amy Winehouse to her husband Blake Fielder-Civil. In addition to the text, the one-page Winehouse letter features a sketch of a baby crocodile surrounded by hearts. \n“Do nothing ‘til you hear from me handsome, I need your arms around me so I can inhale, open my eyes, breathe my heart’s breathe out,” the letter reads, in part. It is valued at about $4,000. \nWinehouse died of alcohol poisoning in London in 2011 at age of 27. \nReporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T03:02:59.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
