Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a February reading of 127.0.\n”Despite the recent stock market volatility, consumers expressed greater optimism about short-term prospects for business and labor market conditions, as well as their financial prospects.” said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. \nFebruary’s reading was the highest monthly level since November 2000.\nThe increase in the Conference Board reading reflected that Americans feel better about both the current and future state of the economy. The present situation index rose to 162.4 from 154.7; the expectations index rose to 109.7 in February from 104.0.\nMs. Franco said the labor force was the main driver of the improvement. The unemployment rate has held at a 17-year low since October , and wages grew at a faster rate in January.\n”Short-term prospects are increasing and that shows the much-anticipated improvement in the labor markets is finally helping household budgets,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union.\nThe Conference Board survey ran through February 15, so it captured the most severe financial market volatility this month. U.S. equity markets fell sharply in early February, in part because emerging signs of stronger inflation caused investors to worry that the Federal Reserve could be more aggressive in raising interest rates, a move that could hurt stock values. Stock prices rose later in the month, but haven’t fully recovered losses.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in prepared testimony to Congress on Tuesday that “the economic outlook remains strong.” He said that justifies further gradual increases in the federal-funds rate .\nLarger paychecks for most workers this month, reflecting changes to the tax code that recently took effect, may have supported better confidence. Solid confidence could be a sign that Americans plan to spend that extra cash. Spending at U.S. retailers fell in January , before the tax-law changes showed up in take-home pay.\nConsumer confidence and sentiment figures are watched as indicators for whether shoppers will step up spending. However, they aren’t always reliable gauges for actual outlays.\nConsumer confidence trended near the highest level in two decades for much of 2017, but consumer spending increased at a similar pace last year as it had the previous three years.\nWrite to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T17:19:54.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
