CRISPR, ZFN and TALEN are the proteins commonly used in different gene editing platforms.\nIn late 2017, Inscripta released a CRISPR enzyme, with no up-front licensing fees for its use by researchers. The company ultimately hopes to develop and commercialize gene-editing tools, including instruments, reagents and software.\n“We want to supply the full suite of tools to do high-speed, high throughput, low-cost ... precision editing, where we supply the complete solution,” Chief Executive Officer Kevin Ness told Reuters.\nInscripta has raised $84.5 million in total. It had raised $23 million in a series B funding round led by venture capital firm Venrock in February last year.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:41:47.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
