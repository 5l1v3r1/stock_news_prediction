(Nasdaq: QADA) (Nasdaq: QADB), a leading provider of flexible, cloud-based enterprise software and services for global manufacturing companies, today reported preliminary results for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018.\nQAD expects to report total revenue of approximately $305 million for fiscal 2018, compared to previously-issued guidance of $300 to $302 million. Total revenue includes approximately $70 million of subscription revenue. For the fiscal year, the company expects a pre-tax loss of approximately $4 million, compared to previously-issued guidance of about breakeven. In fiscal 2017, QAD reported total revenue of $278 million, including subscription revenue of $52 million, and pre-tax income of $4 million.\nStronger than anticipated new cloud business bookings in the fourth quarter resulted in higher commissions and bonuses without the associated revenue, as the company currently recognizes these expenses up front, while the revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period. These higher sales expenses, combined with the negative impact of foreign exchange and lower margins in the professional services business, resulted in the pre-tax loss. The company anticipates operating profit will improve in fiscal 2019. The company notes that with the adoption of ASC606 in fiscal 2019, the company will capitalize sales commission expenses and recognize them ratably over the useful life of the customer contract.\n\"Our cloud business continues to grow, delivering 33 percent subscription revenue growth over last year,\" said Karl Lopker, Chief Executive Officer. \"With a continued strong global manufacturing environment and a highly flexible cloud ERP suite, we have driven subscription revenue to nearly one-quarter of our total business. Our strong new cloud business performance in Q4 gives us a solid start to our next fiscal year.\"\nQAD expects to report full financial results for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year on Wednesday, March 21, 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call\nWhen: Wednesday, March 21, 2018\nTime: 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET)\nPhone: 800-230-1059 (domestic); 612-234-9960 (international)\nReplay: Accessible through midnight March 26, 2018; 800-475-6701 (domestic); 320-365-3844 (international); passcode 443403\nWebcast: Accessible at www.qad.com ; archive available for approximately one year\nAbout QAD â€“ The Effective Enterprise\nQAD Inc.
