Users are anonymous but can see other people’s questions, and the answers they receive.\n“It is a very good idea,” said Achu Lordfred, an advisor on reproductive health for UNFPA in Congo.\n“There is enough information available, but young people have issues of ignorance and access.”\nAbortion is illegal in Congo and many people use dangerous methods to end unwanted pregnancies, Lordfred said.\nSexual and reproductive health services are also unaffordable for much of the population, he added.\nOther mobile services in Congo give basic information on sexual health, but Doctor Love is the only one that provides personal responses, said Lokulutu.\nThree months after launching, the website has had about 11,000 visits.\n“It makes people feel comfortable because they’re actually talking to somebody,” Lokulutu said.\nOther African entrepreneurs have created similar apps.\nIn Rwanda, two medical students created a mobile app called Tantine last year to provide sexual health information and counseling to teenagers in refugee camps.\nFunded by UNFPA, the app is now available across the whole country and has 1,500-odd users, said co-founder Sylvie Uhirwa.\n“Being medical students, we were able to meet with doctors who had clear and reliable knowledge on sexual health issues,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“But that is a privilege denied to many young people, especially vulnerable refugees.”\nReporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Kieran Guilbert, Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.
