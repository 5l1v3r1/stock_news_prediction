Tension came to a head when President Abdulla Yameen’s government rejected the ruling, imposing an emergency on Monday and then arrested the chief justice and another judge of the court the next day.\n“President Yameen has, to put it bluntly, usurped the authority of the State’s rule-of-law institutions and its ability to work independently from the executive,“ Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement. ”...what is happening now is tantamount to an all-out assault on democracy.”\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T06:05:21.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
