That means there will be no hard border - and that is north-south but also east-west,” Bradley told a parliamentary committee.\n“Let’s be absolutely clear, the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom is paramount. We’ve also been clear that our desired way of resolving the issue of the border is through the overall UK/EU relationship, that is what the government is determined to achieve.”\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:36:34.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
