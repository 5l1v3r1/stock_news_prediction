MEXICAN CONTRAST \nShares in Mercado Libre were trading down 0.5 percent late on Friday after the Reuters report, in a slightly higher U.S. equities market, while the stock of Brazilian rivals slumped. \nAppliance retailer Via Varejo SA ( VVAR3.SA ) was down 6 percent at 23.72 reais, while Magazine Luiza SA shed 5 percent to 72.32 reais. B2W was trading 8.5 percent lower at 20.80 reais. \n“Markets get spooked when they see an investment by Amazon”, a Brazilian trader said. “There is fear that the company will become more aggressive with its strategy in Brazil.” \nIn Mexico, Amazon launched its third-party marketplace coupled with its own shipping service, called “Fulfillment by Amazon,” in 2015. \nThe contrast has been stark. Nearly 20 percent of reviews on Amazon’s Brazilian marketplace are negative, compared with 10 percent in Mexico and just 4 percent in the United States, according to e-commerce analytics firm Marketplace Pulse. \nComplaints in Brazil often focus on delayed or canceled orders - a problem dramatically reduced in other countries when Amazon itself packs and posts orders of third-party goods stored at its warehouse facilities. \nIn an early sign of Amazon’s Brazilian logistics push, the company posted more than a dozen listings for distribution jobs in the country to LinkedIn last year, including “Site leader, Fulfillment Center”. \nThe new warehouse site outside of Sao Paulo, in the municipality of Cajamar, looks to be a step in that direction. \nThere San Francisco-based logistics company Prologis Inc ( PLD.N ) has offered a 50,000-square-meter space to Amazon in a new industrial park that hosts DHL and Samsung, according to sources, who said adaptation of the warehouse had not begun. \nPrologis, which also partnered with Amazon on a mega-warehouse north of Mexico city last year, declined to comment. \nThe preparations in Brazil come as Luft, the local logistics operator for Amazon’s book business, readies a move into another Prologis site nearby in Cajamar, sources said, leaving its current 12,000-square-meter facility in the city of Barueri. \nAmazon registered in October to conduct operations in Cajamar, according to municipal records seen by Reuters. \nThe new logistics investment could spell trouble for rivals. \nMercado Libre has been a success story among Latin America tech start ups: its shares have nearly tripled since 2014, bringing its market capitalization to more than $15 billion. \nMagazine Luiza’s stock has risen sixfold in each of the past two years as it shifted its rolled out an ambitious e-commerce strategy built on its brick and mortar stores.
