Smith had to be helped off the ice, and David Rittich came in for the final faceoff with 1.1 seconds left.\nCasey Cizikas and Anthony Beauvillier scored for the Islanders, who lost for the fifth time in seven games.\nHalak made 39 saves.\nCizikas single-handedly opened the scoring 3:08 into the first, when he swiped the puck from Flames defenseman TJ Brodie along the boards deep in the Calgary zone. Cizikas immediately lost his balance but pushed the puck past Smith with his stick.\nBeauvillier scored 2:59 into the second when his shot sailed past Flames right winger Garnet Hathaway, who tried to deflect the puck with his stick, and under the stick of Smith.\nThe Flames cut the gap in half with a power-play goal at the 10:35 mark of the second. Jankowski cut in front of Cizikas, and from point-blank range, tapped home a pass from Sam Bennett.\nAn Islanders turnover led to Tkachuk’s tying goal with 10:22 left in the third. Michael Frolik stole the puck along the boards by the New York net and dished to Tkachuk, who tucked his shot past Halak.\nFrolik registered two assists.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:45:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
