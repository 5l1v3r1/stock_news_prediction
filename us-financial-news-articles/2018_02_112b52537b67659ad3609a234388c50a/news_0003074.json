The goals by Dermott and Holl were the first of their NHL careers.\nWhile the Maple Leafs peppered the Islanders with 50 shots, Andersen was rarely tested in earning his fourth shutout of the season and the 14th of his career. New York’s biggest threat came in the first two minutes of the third period, when Andersen turned back a point-blank backhanded attempt by center John Tavares.\nThomas Greiss made 45 saves for the Islanders, who lost for the second time in as many nights. New York fell to the Florida Panthers, 4-1, on Tuesday.\nThe scoring began with what amounted to an “own goal” for the Islanders 5:37 into the first. Mathew Barzal tried clearing the puck from in front of the net, but the puck bounced off Kapanen and skittered to the red line, where Barzal accidentally shoved it into the net.\nThe Maple Leafs doubled their lead with 6:21 left. Greiss turned back a semi-breakaway shot by Zach Hyman but was unable to stop the rebound by Matthews, whose shot sailed over Greiss’ glove hand.\nMarner extended the lead to 3-0 just beyond the midway point of the second, when he was stationed in front of the net, took Nazem Kadri’s pass from the right faceoff circle and tucked the puck past Islanders defenseman Nick Leddy and Greiss with 9:28 remaining.\nDermott scored off a Barzal turnover deep in the Maple Leafs’ zone with 1:01 left in the second before Holt capped the scoring 3:42 into the third.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:55:55.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
