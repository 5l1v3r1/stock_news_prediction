The four suspects are all charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist act and murder, or being an accomplice to murder, in the waterfront bomb blast that killed Hariri and 21 others.\nBut Milne said circumstantial evidence was compelling.\n“The pattern only emerges when you see all the pieces,” Alexander Milne said.\nEarlier, court-appointed defense lawyer Vincent Courcelle-Labrousse said the prosecution’s evidence, based mainly on analysis of telecoms data, is “built on a fictional world”.\nRepresenting suspect Hussein Hassan Oneissi, the lawyer argued were “no prints, no photos, no texts, no email” nor any video evidence linking his client to the alleged bomb plot to kill Hariri. Lawyers for Salim Jamil Ayyash also said the prosecution had not met its burden of proof.\nLawyers for the two other suspects, Hassan Habib Merhi and Assad Hassan Sabra, did not seek early acquittal.\nThe suspects -- all with links to Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement -- are all fugitives.\nThe tribunal was established in the Netherlands in 2009 after Lebanon’s then-government said it lacked the resources and means to investigate the killing, which pushed the eastern Mediterranean country to the brink of civil war.\nJudges will rule on the applications for acquittal as soon as practicable, a court spokeswoman said.\nReporting by Stephanie van den Berg, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T17:55:11.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
