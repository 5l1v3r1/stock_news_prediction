The two will formally take charge in October. \nInvestec has largely prospered under Koseff, Kantor and Burger. \nIts assets have surged more than 10-fold to over 50 billion pounds ($70 billion) during their tenure and its stock soared more than five-fold thanks to a string of deals. \nThe company escaped largely unscathed from the global banking crisis a decade ago thanks to tough South African regulation which stopped local lenders buying toxic U.S. mortgage-related assets and a more cautious approach to borrowing. SAFE HANDS \nTiti and du Toit are being promoted to the helm of a company pressing hard to stay focused as a niche player targeting relatively wealthy individuals with banking and wealth management products. \nInvestec recently launched a life insurance product, initially targeting its high net-worth clients. \nDu Toit is expected to be in charge of Investec overseas divisions and while Titi would oversee the company’s business in South Africa, where he is based, Koseff told a conference call. \nKoseff, whose hobbies include watching English soccer and supporting Tottenham Hotspur -- which once counted Investec as its shirt sponsor -- did not expect a ‘dramatic shift” in the company’s strategic direction. \nOthers shared that view. \n“Stephen is handing over the reins to two safe pair of hands,” said Graeme Körner, a fund manager at Körner Perspective. \n“Fani and Hendrik have been with the company for a long time and it’s a probably wise move to have joint CEOs because banking is a different animal to asset management,” he added. \nOther managements changes included the promotion of the company’s head of finance at asset management, Kim McFarland, to group CFO while Perry Crosthwaite, a non-executive director, replaces Titi as chairman. \nShares in Investec fell nearly 4 percent to 89.40 rand in Johannesburg, tracking broader declines on the bourse and in the sector, before recovering later in the day.
