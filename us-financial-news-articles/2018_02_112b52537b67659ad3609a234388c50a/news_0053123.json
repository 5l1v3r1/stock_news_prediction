The Friars beat Georgetown 73-69 in a home game earlier this month.\nProvidence (18-11, 9-7 Big East) trailed for much of the first half and was down, 40-35, at the break, but the Friars rallied in the second half.\nGeorgetown (15-12, 5-11) held a 46-41 lead when Cartwright sank back-to-back 3-pointers 50 seconds apart. That gave the Friars a 47-46 lead and started a 10-point Providence run.\nThe Friars kept rolling as Bullock and Jamorko Pickett also made threes and helped Providence stretch the lead to 59-49.\nThat 18-3 run put the Friars in front for good although Georgetown rallied late in the second half. The Hoyas twice cut the lead to one late, the last time coming on a Marcus Derrickson basket with 1:11 left that made it 70-69.\nBut Alpha Diallo (14 points) hit a driving layup for a three-point lead. Bullock, who also made five 3-pointers, then sank two key free throws with 12.6 seconds left to lock things up.\nJessie Govan led the Hoyas with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Derrickson helped with 11 points and 15 rebounds.\nProvidence was coming off of an unusual 89-77 loss to Seton Hall. The game was stopped due to slippery floor conditions, and they finished the final 13:03 the next afternoon on Thursday.\nGeorgetown now has lost five of its last seven games. Both teams have two games left in the regular season with the Hoyas taking on Marquette and Villanova, and the Friars will play Xavier and St. John‘s.\nIn the first half, the game was close although Georgetown led much of the time. The Hoyas repeatedly pounded the ball down low to their big men and scored 22 points en route to the 40-35 halftime lead.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:01:29.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
