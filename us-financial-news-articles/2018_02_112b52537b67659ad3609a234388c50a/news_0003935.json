He ripped a shot off the crossbar and into the net after Paul Stastny won an offensive zone faceoff. It’s Gunnarsson’s fifth goal of the season, which is a career high.\nFrom there, it was Hutton’s turn to stand out, although the final frame was a solid display from both he and counterpart Robin Lehner, as after an uninspiring first two periods, the goaltenders were front and center for the duration.\nLehner was tested often in the first half of the third period and answered the bell with a trio of scintillating saves against Vladimir Sobotka, Brayden Schenn and Vladimir Tarasenko to keep it scoreless.\nHutton responded when the Sabres finally gained momentum thanks to a power-play opportunity, making clutch stops on Jack Eichel and Ryan O‘Reilly.\nIn the final minute, and with the Sabres goalie on the bench for an extra attacker, Hutton kept the hosts off the board with a huge stop against Sam Reinhart. Buffalo’s Rasmus Ristolainen rang a shot off the crossbar just before time expired.\nHutton has surrendered only two goals in his last four games, and appears poised to wrestle the No. 1 goalie role from Jake Allen.\nLehner finished with 32 saves for the Sabres, who are now on a three-game losing skid and ahead of only the Arizona Coyotes in the league standings.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:42:04.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
