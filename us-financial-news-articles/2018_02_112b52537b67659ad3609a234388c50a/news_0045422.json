(NASDAQ:ANSS), today reported fourth quarter 2017 GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth of 9% in constant currency. For FY 2017, GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth was 10% and 11%, respectively, in constant currency. Recurring revenue, which comprises lease license and annual maintenance revenue, totaled 70% and 71% of revenue for the fourth quarter on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively. For FY 2017, recurring revenue totaled 75% of revenue. For the fourth quarter, the Company reported decreased diluted earnings per share of 24% on a GAAP basis and 9% growth in diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis. For FY 2017, the Company reported a decrease of less than 1% and an increase of 10% in diluted earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively. The GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts were significantly impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nAjei Gopal, ANSYS President and CEO, commented, “Our performance in 2017 significantly exceeded my expectations coming into the year. We broke through the $1 billion revenue barrier, we grew our annual revenue by double-digits for the first time in five years, and we were added to the S&P 500 Index. We have made continued progress with our go-to-market initiatives, as illustrated by the 21% annual growth in our deferred revenue and backlog, ending the year at a record $770 million. We did all of this while maintaining industry-leading margins, delivering higher-than-expected EPS and extending our technology lead against the competition.\"\nIn addition, Gopal stated, \"In January 2018, we released ANSYS ® 19, the most feature-rich release in our nearly 50-year history of innovation. We are excited about the pipeline of opportunities that lie ahead for 2018 and beyond. Customer feedback has been outstanding, and product downloads have been strong. Our flagship products are the heart of our success, and we'll continue to support the core use cases for these solutions and expand them to support emerging customer initiatives like autonomous vehicles and smart connected products. We are also reaching new audiences with solutions like Discovery Live TM , which is available for trial and sale through a new e-commerce portal that premiered this month.”\nMaria Shields, ANSYS CFO, stated, “The strength of our core business and our dedication to execution is reflected in our strong financial performance for both the quarter and the year. Our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 revenues and earnings represented new company records. We also ended the year with record operating cash flows and deferred revenue and backlog, demonstrating progress toward our stated long-term goal of sustained, double-digit revenue growth. To achieve our growth objectives, we will continue to move forward with investments in our core products, high-growth adjacent markets and our business infrastructure.”\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). Tax Reform makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. The new law adversely impacted our GAAP income tax provision for Q4 2017. In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of Tax Reform, a discrete net tax expense of $17.9 million was recorded in the period ending December 31, 2017, primarily consisting of $1.9 million for the revaluation of net deferred tax assets related to the corporate rate reduction and $16.0 million for the transition tax. In addition to the $17.9 million charge, we would have recognized a $4.8 million benefit in the fourth quarter related to foreign earnings repatriation, but this benefit was eliminated due to Tax Reform. These items were excluded for non-GAAP purposes as discussed in the Non-GAAP Measures section below.\nFinancial Results\nANSYS' fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 and 2016 financial results are presented below. The 2017 and 2016 non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of acquisition adjustments to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction costs, restructuring charges and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nGAAP and non-GAAP results:\nGAAP Non-GAAP (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 %\nChange Q4 2017 Q4 2016 %\nChange Revenue $ 302.3 $ 270.6 12 % $ 303.4 $ 270.6 12 % Net income $ 52.6 $ 70.0 (25 )% $ 92.8 $ 86.1 8 % Earnings per share $ 0.61 $ 0.80 (24 )% $ 1.07 $ 0.98 9 % Operating profit margin 33.3 % 35.8 % 42.6 % 45.1 % Operating cash flow $ 103.5 $ 99.2 4 %\nGAAP Non-GAAP (in millions, except percentages and per share data) FY 2017 FY 2016 %\nChange FY 2017 FY 2016 %\nChange Revenue $ 1,095.3 $ 988.5 11 % $ 1,098.1 $ 988.6 11 % Net income $ 259.3 $ 265.6 (2 )% $ 347.9 $ 322.9 8 % Earnings per share $ 2.98 $ 2.99 — % $ 4.01 $ 3.63 10 % Operating profit margin 35.7 % 38.1 % 46.4 % 47.0 % Operating cash flow $ 430.4 $ 366.0 18 % The non-GAAP financial results highlighted above, and the non-GAAP financial outlook for 2018 discussed below, represent non-GAAP financial measures.

These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A detailed explanation of each of the adjustments to such financial measures is described below. This press release also contains a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nManagement uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow the Company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested and the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.\nWhile management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThe adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:\nAcquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact. Historically, the Company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives. In accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. Although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on the Company's business or cash flow, it adversely impacts the Company's reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past and future reports of financial results of the Company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.\nAmortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and its related tax impact. The Company incurs amortization of intangible assets, included in its GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions it has made. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the Company during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past reports of financial results of the Company as the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures.\nStock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact . The Company incurs expense related to stock-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of software licenses; cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, expense. Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) incurred in connection with the Company's deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit (charge) recorded in other income (expense). Although stock-based compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company. Management similarly excludes income (expense) related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with the Company's deferred compensation plan. Specifically, the Company excludes stock-based compensation and income related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the Company's and management's performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the Company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the Company's historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, the Company records stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, management is able to review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the Company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the Company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the Company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.\nRestructuring charges and the related tax impact. The Company occasionally incurs expenses for restructuring its workforce included in its GAAP presentation of cost of software licenses; cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, expense. Management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company, as it generally does not incur these expenses as a part of its operations. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the Company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the Company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the Company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.\nTransaction costs related to business combinations. The Company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in its GAAP presentation of research and development expense and selling, expense. These expenses are generally not tax-deductible. Management excludes these acquisition-related transaction expenses, derived from closed acquisitions, for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company, as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its operations. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the Company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the Company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the Company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company recorded charges in its income tax provision related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including charges for the transition tax related to unrepatriated cash and the impacts of the tax rate change on net deferred tax assets. In addition, the Company was not able to realize a tax benefit related to foreign earnings repatriation due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Management excludes these charges and the unrealized benefit for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company, as (i) the charges are not expected to recur as part of its normal operations and (ii) both the charges and unrealized tax benefit resulted from the extremely infrequent event of major U.S. tax reform, the last such reform having occurred in 1986. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the Company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the Company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the Company's financial reporting.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below:\nGAAP Reporting Measure Non-GAAP Reporting Measure Revenue Non-GAAP Revenue Operating Income Non-GAAP Operating Income Operating Profit Margin Non-GAAP Operating Profit Margin Net Income Non-GAAP Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share About ANSYS, Inc.\nIf you’ve ever seen a rocket launch, flown on an airplane, driven a car, used a computer, touched a mobile device, crossed a bridge, or put on wearable technology, chances are you've used a product where ANSYS software played a critical role in its creation.
