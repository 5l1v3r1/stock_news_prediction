We need rain this week to secure them, or else there will be losses,” said Kouassi Kouame, who farms near Soubre.\nSimilar growing conditions were reported in center-western region of Daloa, which accounts for a quarter of Ivory Coast’s national output.\nTemperatures rose above average last week, ranging from 27.9 to 31.7 degrees Celsius.\nReporting by Loucoumane Coulibaly; Editing by Sofia Christensen/Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T18:49:37.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
