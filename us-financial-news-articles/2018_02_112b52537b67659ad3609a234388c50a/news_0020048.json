It seems we have found a good way to go forward. We have to forget the dark period,” Jukka Ruusunen, Fingrid chief executive told Reuters.\n“There will be unanimity in the decision making. We agreed this to move the process forward,” Henrik Glette, a spokesman for Stattnet told Reuters.\nFinland imports up to a fifth of its electricity at times of peak winter demand, and being outside the deal would have created uncertainty over its power security, key for its energy-hungry industrial sector.\nIndustry lobby group Finnish Energy in January warned of a higher risk that local firms may have to cut their power usage.\nA common balancing system will secure Finland with a flexible mechanism when in need of extra power.\nThe five operators, Svenska Kraftnat, Fingrid, Statnett, Energinet and Kraftnat Aland, signed a memorandum of understanding and will come up with a joint proposal by March.\nHowever, the MoU, seen by Reuters, does not constitute a legally binding agreement.
