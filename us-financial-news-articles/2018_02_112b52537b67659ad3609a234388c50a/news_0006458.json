Another round of settlement talks is set for late this month.\nFeinberg and Fiat Chrysler declined to comment.\nIn July, Fiat Chrysler won approval from federal and California regulators to sell 2017 model year diesel vehicles after it came under scrutiny for alleged excess emissions in older diesel models.\nTo resolve the excess pollution issue, Fiat Chrysler lawyer Robert Giuffra said in December at a court hearing the company remains confident it can use updated emissions software in the 2017 vehicles as the basis of a fix to address agencies’ concerns over 2014-2016 diesel vehicles.\nThe Justice Department said in December that company testing on the proposed fix began on Dec. 17 and would take about three months. The government will then have 30 days to review the results and expects to make a determination by the end of April.\nNo settlement is expected before testing is completed, people briefed on the talks said.\nSeparately, the company is still trying to settle lawsuits filed by owners of the diesel vehicles. A separate settlement session is set with lawyers for the owners and Fiat Chrysler in the coming weeks.\nRegulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed emissions controls that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving. The company has denied wrongdoing, saying there was never an attempt to create software to cheat emissions rules.\nFiat Chrysler’s emissions case comes after Volkswagen AG’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) diesel emissions scandal prompted increased industry scrutiny.\nReporting by David Shepardson; editing by Cynthia Osterman and G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T00:18:43.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
