It did not give further details.\nThe exchange has received withdrawal requests from customers totaling about 30 billion yen ($280 million), a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.\nThe Coincheck statement was posted after Friday business hours. It could not be reached for comment on size of withdrawal requests.\nAfter the late January heist, Japan’s Financial Services Agency ordered Coincheck to raise its standards, and gave the exchange until Tuesday to submit a report on the hack and measures for preventing a recurrence.\nThe Coincheck hack highlighted the risks in trading an asset that policymakers are struggling to regulate and put the focus on Japan’s framework for overseeing these exchanges.\nJapan’s financial regulator has also launched on-site checks of two other cryptocurrency exchange operators it sees as potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.\nRepresentatives of the exchanges, Tokyo-based GMO Coin and Osaka-based Tech Bureau Corp, were not immediately available for comment. The FSA could not be reached for comment outside business hours.\nEarly next week, the FSA may widen its inspections to other exchanges it sees as lacking in security, the person said.\nAfter the Coincheck heist, the FSA said it would investigate Japan’s other 31 cryptocurrency exchanges for security flaws. It ordered them to submit a report on their system risk management and storage of cryptocurrencies, and said it would follow up with on-site checks if it found vulnerabilities.\nReporting by Takahiko Wada and Thomas Wilson; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Clarence Fernandez\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T06:24:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
