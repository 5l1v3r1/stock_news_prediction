A man, his wife and his two brothers were deported on Feb. 1, the group said. The ninth person was abroad when the sentence was passed.\nBahraini officials did not respond to a request for comment.\nA total of 578 people have been stripped of citizenship since the kingdom began using the punishment against people convicted of security offences, the rights group said.\nA Bahraini court stripped a total of 72 people of citizenship in two separate cases on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1 after they were convicted on terrorism charges.\n“Bahraini authorities have dropped all pretence of pluralism and tolerance for dissent and are clearly stripping away the citizenships of people whom they find undesirable,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW.\nThe Interior Ministry uses amendments to the 1963 Citizenship Act to revoke the citizenship of individuals it sees as damaging state security, the group said.\nThe Supreme Court has confirmed a decision to revoke the citizenship of the spiritual leader of Bahraini Shi‘ites, Ayatollah Isa Qassim, HRW said in the statement. It also upheld a one-year prison sentence against him on charges related to the collection of an Islamic tax called Khums.\nQassim has been confined to his home since his citizenship was revoked last year. He has undergone surgery at a hospital in Bahrain and been discharged, activists said.\nReporting by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T07:22:14.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
