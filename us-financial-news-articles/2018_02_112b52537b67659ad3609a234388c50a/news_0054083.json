It’s a possibility and will depend on demand,” Petitcolin told reporters.\nThe new plant, the third joint venture between the firms, was officially inaugurated on Wednesday but already delivered its first parts in October. It makes 3D woven composite fan blades for the LEAP engine from CFM International.
