The Same Day as the Florida Shooting\nIn light of the deadly mass shootings in Florida last week, Caraway said he was seeking to put citizens first, and found hosting the convention at this time to be inappropriate. The convention will include firearms displays and exhibits, and Caraway warned that if the event went forward, it would be met with “marches and demonstrations.”\nFor its part, the NRA told a local ABC news affiliate that politicians cannot “tell the NRA not to come to their city.” Andrew Arulanandam, the NRA’s public affairs director continued that the NRA is “already there. Dallas, like every American city and community, is populated by NRA members.”\n“Our members work in fire stations and police departments,” Arulanandam said. “They save lives in local hospitals and own businesses in communities urban and rural throughout this country.”\nRead: The 10 Politicians That Have Received the Most Money From the NRA\nCaraway, meanwhile, asserted that the NRA “needs to step up to the plate” and “show leadership” by establishing better gun laws. He said that while he is a “believer” in the second amendment, “we should not allow people to possess assault rifles and weapons.”\nDespite Caraway’s conviction, not all of his fellow council members share his belief that the convention should be moved. It remains to be seen whether the NRA will bow to his pressure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:12:00.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
