What those alternatives are - we haven’t got a specific list, but clearly it’s not our mantra to sit here and lose money,” Holland said.\nSouth Deep production fell 11 percent below original guidance to 281,000 ounces, versus 290,000 ounces the previous year, after two fatal accidents and three ground collapses resulted in a delay in mining higher-grade areas, the firm said.\nSouth Deep had also incurred a 3.5 billion rand ($294 million) accounting writedown from the slow adoption of new mining methods, a reduction in the gold price and resource-price assumptions used in gauging the mine’s lifespan.\nGold Fields unveiled a plan in February 2017 to make its mechanised South Deep mine profitable and set a production target of 500,000 ounces to be reached by 2022.\n“Broadly, South Deep is not about the ore body, it’s not about a technical solution, it’s actually about getting people to work in an effective way,” Holland said.\nShares in Gold Fields were down 7.32 percent at 44.67 rand by 1401 GMT after reporting a 4 percent drop in profit to $0.24 per share for 2017 from $0.25 the previous year.\n“The second half of the year was an improvement on the first but it was not sufficient to satisfy the market’s demand for an enhancement of the performance of South Deep,” said the chief investment officer at Gryphon Asset Management, Reuben Beelders.\nGold Fields, which also operates in Ghana and Peru, declared a final dividend of 0.50 rand ($0.04) per share, taking the total dividend for the year to 0.90 rand per share compared with 1.10 rand per share in the previous period.
