Negotiations over Britain’s future ties to the EU have yet to begin in earnest.\nNIESR’s forecasts were based on an assumption that London secures a deal that causes almost no disruption to British trade with the bloc. This would require politically sensitive concessions on immigration and long-term payments to the EU by Prime Minister Theresa May, it said.\nIf Britain instead resorts to World Trade Organisation rules to govern its trade with the EU, the economy would suffer a mild recession and would be 7 percent smaller in around 10 years’ time than it would be if a favorable deal is done, NIESR said.\nThat would leave people in Britain an average of 2,000 pounds ($2,791) a year worse off.\nNIESR kept its forecast for the Bank of England to raise rates by 25 basis points every six months, quicker than most investors expect, until they hit 2 percent.\nThe BoE said in November it expected Britain’s economy would grow by 1.6 and 1.7 percent in 2018 and 2019 respectively. It is due to publish fresh forecasts on Thursday.\nReporting by William Schomberg, editing by David Milliken\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T13:32:51.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
