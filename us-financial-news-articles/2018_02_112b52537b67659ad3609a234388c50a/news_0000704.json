To halt any movements in the street,” Amal said in a statement. \nAmal thanked its supporters for condemning Bassil’s remark but said this had led to “some problems which do not reflect the image and position of the Amal Movement”. \nThe FPM said on Tuesday that Bassil had already expressed regret for the comments and that it regarded the issue as over. Berri said on Wednesday he must apologize “to the Lebanese people” for the remark.
