We shipped 221 megawatts DC and 755,000 microinverters. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 24.2%, an increase of 240 basis points from 21.8% in the prior quarter.

This return to profitability represents a significant milestone for the company.\nWe exited the quarter with approximately $29.1 million in cash. Inventory was $26 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $25.3 million in the third quarter, and down from $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn summary, we are well on track towards achieving our 30-20-10 target operating model by the end of 2018.
