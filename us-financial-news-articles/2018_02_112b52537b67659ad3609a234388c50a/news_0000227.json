Powell is expected to hew closely to the policies embraced by Yellen.\nYellen had previously said she would step down from the Fed's Board of Governors after finishing her term as chair.\nThe Fed said on Wednesday that Powell would become the central bank's chairman on Saturday and would be officially sworn in on Monday.\nYellen will join former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke at the Brookings Institution.
