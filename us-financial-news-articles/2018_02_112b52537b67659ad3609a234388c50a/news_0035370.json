Around half have arrived so far. Refugee groups had originally hoped Britain would take 3,000.\n“I think Britain can afford to be more generous ... it’s a first-world country,” said Evdokimenko, who moved to the United Kingdom from Russia as a child.\nEvdokimenko’s 16-minute-long film focuses on a boy driven to an act of violence when he cannot find a door for his shelter.\n“He was absolutely desperate for a door. He felt very exposed, very unsafe,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“These kids get angry ... There’s a lot of trauma, there’s a lot of issues and I wanted to show an imperfect portrait of a child refugee, but one that was relatable,” Evdokimenko added.\nLOCKED IN BOOT The director said the children she met told “horrific” stories about their experiences at the hands of smugglers.\nSome described beatings. Others were locked in car boots, sometimes for days, with just a tube to breathe through.\nThe film highlights the children’s vulnerability - Aamir is robbed after being drugged by men who appear to befriend him.\nIt also conveys the physical misery as relentless rains pour through flimsy shelters, turning the ground into a mudbath.\nEvdokimenko, who worked at the camp in 2016 packing food rations, described a bleak dune-like landscape engulfed in the stench of a nearby chemical factory and littered with rubbish.\nThe production team had originally hoped to cast one of the boys in the camp as Aamir, but decided it would be wrong to ask the children to relive their experiences for the camera.\nThey were also disturbed to find that whenever they returned to the camp, the boys they met on the last visit had vanished.\nEvdokimenko said she was sure many had been trafficked.\nDespite the Jungle’s demolition, Evdokimenko said her film was still relevant given the tens of thousands of unaccompanied refugee and migrant children scattered throughout Europe.\nThere are signs the Calais camp is being rebuilt, she said.\n“My main anxiety about these kids is how they can ever recover from these things they’ve been through,” she added.\n“The longer we leave them in these places, which are just so unsuitable for kids ... the more we lose our opportunity to allow them to become amazing members of our communities.”\nReporting by Emma Batha.
