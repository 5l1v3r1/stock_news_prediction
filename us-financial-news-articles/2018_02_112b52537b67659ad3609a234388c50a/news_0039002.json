It would sell its 1.25 percent stake in Los Pelambres to JX Metals and trading company Marubeni Corp.\nMitsui said the deals would boost its equity copper output volume by about 15,000 tonnes a year to 140,000 tonnes a year.\nThe move is part of its effort to optimize its portfolio by replenishing and accumulating high-quality assets, it said. Financial terms were not disclosed.\nJX Metals’ holding in Los Pelambres will rise to 15.79 percent from 15 percent, and Marubeni’s stake will rise to 9.21 percent from 8.75 percent, according to JX and Marubeni.\nJX said the transactions were aimed at concentrating its resources on its key assets. Funds from the sale will be used to reinforce its processing business.\nMarubeni’s purchase of an additional stake comes as it strengthens its copper platform from a long-term viewpoint, it said in a statement.\nJapanese trading houses are scouting for assets as they enjoy their best profit outlook in six years, driven by higher prices for commodities from metals and coking coal to oil and natural gas.\nChilean mining company Antofagasta PLC owns 60 percent of Los Pelambres, while Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Materials Corp and Mitsubishi Corp, hold the rest.\nGlencore and Anglo American each own 44 percent of Collahuasi, while 12 percent is held by Japanese companies including Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co Ltd.\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Tom Hogue and Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T12:05:19.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
