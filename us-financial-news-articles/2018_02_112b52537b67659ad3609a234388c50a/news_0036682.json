REUTERS/Phil Noble “The most games we can play here is 12 and we have a pair of pants for each game.”\nWhat started as lark has turned into a long-term sponsorship deal with LoudMouth Golf although Svae would not reveal any details, including whether the team had any input into design.\nAlmost overshadowed by the sartorial splendor is the fact that the Norwegians are very good curlers.\nThe team took silver at the Vancouver Olympics and were crowned world champions in 2014.\n”A lot of time people think we have won even if we didn’t so that’s good,“ laughed Svae. ”But it’s brought attention to the sport and younger people get drawn to it.\n“In Vancouver it was special because we had never done it before but after that now we play in every crazy patterned pants we can find so we don’t really notice anymore.”\nEditing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:34:47.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
