Still, Congress has sought to quickly seek a resolution to end uncertainty for the immigrants. \nIn a tweet Tuesday, Trump said \"this will be our last chance\" to \"solve the DACA puzzle.\" Trump tweet \nOn Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he supported the proposal put forth by the GOP senators. It protects up to 1.8 million immigrants and offers them a path to citizenship. It also would put more funding toward border security, limit extended family migration and end the diversity visa \"lottery\" system. \nRepublicans argue the plan is the only one with a chance of passing the more conservative House and getting Trump's signature. Democrats have rejected it. \nOn Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said finding a bipartisan compromise to shield the young immigrants and boost border security \"should be the focus of all of our energies.\" He argued that the Senate could \"take the lead\" on drafting a bipartisan plan as it did with a recent budget agreement. \n\"It's still hard, we're not there yet, but we can get something done. Let's work toward that,\" he said on the Senate floor. \nOn Monday, Schumer called for a \"narrow bill\" rather than an overhaul of the immigration system. \nLast month, Trump flatly rejected a bipartisan proposal brought to him by Sens. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., and Dick Durbin , D-Ill. \nTrump has proven difficult to pin down on immigration, and senators on both sides of the aisle have been frustrated with the process of striking a deal with him. Last month, only days after he told bipartisan lawmakers he would sign a compromise that can pass Congress, he retrenched and pushed for his own plan. \nDemocrats aim not to alienate an energized liberal base, which wants a quick resolution to DACA protections and opposes Trump's pledges to crack down on immigration and build a wall along the Mexican border. Many House Democrats, and some of the party's lawmakers in the Senate, held out on supporting a massive bipartisan budget deal last week because of immigration. \nTrump, meanwhile, does not want to anger his supporters who cheered his push to limit immigration. Conservative House Republicans will also be reluctant to back a bill that does not include restrictions on legal immigration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T16:49:37.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
