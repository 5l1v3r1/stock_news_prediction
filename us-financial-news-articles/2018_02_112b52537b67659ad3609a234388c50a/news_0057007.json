Yet they’re still now going to be first city in the world that runs out of water completely, just because of the severity of climate impacts,” said Watts.\n“And they’re not going to be the last unfortunately,” he said.\nTen cities in the C40 network, including London, Mexico City and Sao Paulo, are on “danger watch” and could run out of water if rainfall is lower than average, he said.\nCities could help save scarce supplies be reusing water that flows into drainage systems and is otherwise lost, and by installing features such as permeable pavements to capture rainwater, he said.\n“You’ve really got to plan for the worst now,” said Watts.\nReporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Jared Ferrie.
