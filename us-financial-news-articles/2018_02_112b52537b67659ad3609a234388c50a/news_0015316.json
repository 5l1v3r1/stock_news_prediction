Another security guard shot and killed the attacker, the military said in a statement. \nTensions have risen in the West Bank since U.S. President Donald Trump’s Dec. 6 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. His declaration overturned decades of U.S. policy that its status should be decided in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. \nLate on Tuesday, Israeli forces shot dead at least one Palestinian during a raid in the West Bank city of Nablus that led to confrontations with residents, Palestinian health officials said. \nIn a statement, the military said its troops had been searching for an assailant who fatally stabbed an Israeli man at the entrance to the Jewish settlement of Ariel in the West Bank on Monday. \n“During the activity, a violent riot was instigated as approximately 500 Palestinians hurled rocks, fire bombs and explosive devices and fired live rounds at IDF (Israel Defence Forces) soldiers, and in addition the rioters built rock barriers,” a military statement said.

The Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service said stone-throwers had clashed with the soldiers. \nThe alleged attacker in the Ariel incident was an Arab citizen of Israel and Israeli media reports said his father is a Nablus resident. The military said the suspect was not apprehended in the operation and seven people were detained for questioning. \nEarlier on Tuesday, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian gunman in the West Bank village of Yamoun and said he was the head of a militant cell responsible for an ambush in which a Jewish settler was shot dead on Jan. 9. \nIsrael had been looking for the final member of the cell which it said killed Rabbi Raziel Shevah in a drive-by shooting. Commandos had already killed one of the gunmen involved and captured another. \nIsrael’s government regards Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the country, although that is not recognised internationally. Palestinians say East Jerusalem, captured along with the West Bank by Israel in a 1967 war, must be the capital of a state they seek. \n(This version of the story corrects name of city in paragraph 2) Writing by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Nick Macfie", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T07:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T08:36:51.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
