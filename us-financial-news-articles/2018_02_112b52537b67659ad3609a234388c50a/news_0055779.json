The list includes the U.K., Turkey, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Canada. Getty Images \nThe U.S. plans to eventually have more than 2,400 jets. Currently, more than 265 have been delivered and there's approximately 560 trained pilots around the world. \nThe program has drawn controversy and criticism over its cost overruns and delivery delays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T07:21:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
