I’ve hardly been asked about that until recent months,” said Welsh in the build-up to Scotland’s opening Six Nations clash against Wales in Cardiff on Saturday, where he wins his first cap since the ill-fated incident. \n”The worst thing you can do as a professional, in rugby or any sport, is to dwell on mistakes. We train hard on the rugby pitch to not make mistakes but they are going to happen. \n“It’s something I don’t look back on at all. Obviously it’s unfortunate, nobody wanted it to happen. But it did and it was on to the next thing for me.” \nThe decision by South African referee Craig Joubert was later labelled wrong by World Rugby but Welsh took a conciliatory tone as he reflected on the heart-breaking 35-34 defeat. INSTINCTIVELY GRABBED \nJoubert adjudged Welsh to have been offside as he instinctively grabbed at the ball after it looked to have been knocked-on off the shoulder of teammate Josh Strauss. But it was Wallaby scrumhalf Nick Phipps who made contact with the ball last before Welsh, who then should not have been deemed offside. \n“He made the call. In the game of rugby you respect the ref’s call. Has anybody tried to referee a game before? There are a thousand things going on. Obviously if he had gone to the TMO he would have seen it came off Phipps. It is tough for a referee. He didn’t get the call right there.” \nWelsh went immediately off to join Newcastle in the English Premiership after the World Cup and lost his place in the Scotland side. \n”I’d never abandoned hope that I’d get back into the Scotland side. I’ve always been in training squads or at least called back into them. I don’t think the desire ever goes away to play for Scotland. I just kept training away and I’ve been lucky enough to be given another shot.” \nSaturday’s match will be a 12th cap for the 31-year-old, profiting from an injury crisis among the Scotland front rowers.
