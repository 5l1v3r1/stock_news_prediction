If elected, these six highly qualified nominees would constitute a majority of Qualcomm's 11-person board. Electing a majority of new board members is the only way for Qualcomm stockholders to obtain the benefit of Broadcom's best and final offer for Qualcomm of $82 per share, which will be withdrawn following the determination of results at the 2018 Annual Meeting unless Broadcom has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Qualcomm or Broadcom's six independent nominees are elected.\nHock Tan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Broadcom, said, \"Qualcomm stockholders have consistently communicated to us their support for our $82 per share cash and stock offer. In addition, they have welcomed our willingness to provide for appropriate continuity on the Qualcomm board, and have also expressed a desire for a definitive mechanism of achieving such continuity. Reducing the number of nominees we are seeking to a simple majority provides precisely that mechanism.\"\nTan continued, \"Given the compelling value and clear regulatory commitments we have demonstrated, we believe that any rational board would make negotiating a merger agreement its top priority. Qualcomm stockholders can ensure genuine engagement on this transaction and express their support for superior value by voting on the BLUE card and electing our six independent nominees.\"\nThe six nominees are Samih Elhage, David Golden, Veronica Hagen, Julie Hill, John Kispert and Harry You. By electing all of the Broadcom nominees, Qualcomm stockholders will direct a simple majority of the board to transact with Broadcom on its highly compelling proposal, while also ensuring that there is board continuity with the remaining five directors.\nBroadcom will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a supplement to its proxy statement, accompanied by a revised BLUE proxy card on which Qualcomm stockholders can vote to elect Broadcom's six director nominees. Broadcom urges Qualcomm stockholders to vote the revised BLUE proxy card for all six nominees today to preserve the benefit of Broadcom's best and final offer for Qualcomm of $82 per share.\nStockholders should not vote the white proxy card if they want to receive the benefit of Broadcom's highly compelling proposal.\nMoelis & Company LLC, Citi, Deutsche Bank, J.P.
