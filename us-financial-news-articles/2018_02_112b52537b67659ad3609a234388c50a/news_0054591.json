Granny didn’t know.\n“I still don’t understand what they are doing.” (Reporting by Hyun Oh and Lucien Libert; Editing by Patrick Johnston)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:38:46.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
