At least what we had last year, if not more,” Tan said on the sidelines of the event.\nSome analysts, however, have forecast price rises of as much as 10 percent this year, and Singapore’s central bank has warned about an “excessive exuberance” in the property market.\nEager to refill their project pipeline after a long property slowdown, developers have recently been bidding aggressively at government land sales and on “en bloc” or collective sales of residential apartment buildings.\nTan said developers could become more “selective” about these collective sales going forward, partly due to the higher taxes.\n“They might want to consider in their bidding for the land that there is an additional cost...Developers could be more selective but those who have not bought yet will buy,” he said.
