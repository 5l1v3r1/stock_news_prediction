REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader/File Photo Trump sees three defects in the deal: its failure to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme; the terms under which international inspectors can visit suspect Iranian nuclear sites; and “sunset” clauses under which limits on the Iranian nuclear programme start to expire after 10 years.\nHe wants all three strengthened if the United States is to stay in the JCPOA.\nAraqchi said Trump’s interpretation of the sunset clauses was wrong.\n“There is no sunset clause in the JCPOA. Although the U.S. administration and Trump are talking about sunset clause and that JCPOA is just for 10 years, that is not true,” he said.\n“Iran’s commitment in the JCPOA not to go for the nuclear weapons is permanent.”\nHe also reiterated Iran’s position that the JCPOA was a non-proliferation treaty and could not be linked to any other issue.\nIf the nuclear deal is linked to Iran’s ballistic missile programme or its regional activities, world powers “not only will lose the JCPOA, but will make other issues more complicated and more difficult to resolve,” he said.\n“If we lose the JCPOA, we will face another nuclear crisis,” Araqchi said.\n“For the Europeans or the world community, when we talk about maintaining the JCPOA and saving it, it’s not a choice between the Iranian or the U.S. market, it’s not a choice for economic cooperation: it’s a choice between having security or insecurity,” he said.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T12:13:40.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
