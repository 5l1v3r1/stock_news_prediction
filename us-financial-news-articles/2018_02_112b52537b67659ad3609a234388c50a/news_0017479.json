So far this year the pan-European benchmark is down 5.3 percent. \nBanks .SX7P, whose lending businesses benefit from rising rates, ended the week down 4.6 percent, in line with the broader market weakness following a strong start to the year. \n“As rates begin to normalize (and that’s what they are doing) bank margins should begin to recover. So ... the banks represent an oasis of opportunity in a tumultuous market,” said Rob James, financials analyst and manager at Old Mutual. \nCiti strategists said in the medium term financials should do well, keeping their overweight rating on the sector within their positive stance on cyclicals. \nOn Friday, Italian investment bank Mediobanca ( MDBI.MI ) rose 0.7 percent after it raised its dividend guidance and quarterly profit beat forecasts on higher net interest income and fees. \nUBI Banca ( UBI.MI ) declined 0.4 percent as it planned to sell a “substantial package” of bad loans over the next three years in an acceleration of efforts to clean up its balance sheet. \nStill among financials, French asset manager Amundi ( AMUN.PA ) lost 5.8 percent after publishing its annual results and new financial targets. \nEnergy shares fell as oil prices dropped for a sixth day after Iran announced plans to boost production and U.S. crude output hit record highs. \nThe oil and gas index .SXEP lost 1.9 percent with Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.AS ) and BP ( BP.L ) both down more than 2 percent. \nA.P. Moller-Maersk ( MAERSKb.CO ) missed fourth-quarter profit expectations and edged 0.3 percent lower. \nBelgium’s Umicore ( UMI.BR ) jumped 7.8 percent after raising 892 million euros in equity for new investments in rechargeable battery materials at a discount of only 2.7 percent to Thursday’s closing price. \nShares in French cosmetics group L‘Oreal ( OREP.PA ) rose 0.3 percent after its fourth-quarter sales beat expectations and comments by its CEO regarding its intentions on Nestle’s ( NESN.S ) stake further buoyed the stock. \nAccording to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. European earnings growth forecasts for the fourth quarter have been revised to 11 percent from nearly 18 percent a few months ago. Earning beats so far have been below the 50 percent of the typical quarter.
