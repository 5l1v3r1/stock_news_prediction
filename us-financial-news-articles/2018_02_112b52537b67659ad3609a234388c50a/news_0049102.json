(NYSE: AAC) announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operational and Financial Highlights:\n(All comparisons are to the comparable prior-year period, unless otherwise noted)\nTotal revenue increased 19% to $86.1 million Average daily residential revenue (ADR) increased 58% to $1,054 and average revenue per outpatient visit (ARV) increased 16% to $418 Total average daily census (ADC) increased to 995 compared with 962 Outpatient visits increased 37% to 21,651 Net loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders was $18.8 million, or ($0.80) per diluted common share, including a charge of $23.3 million or ($0.70) per diluted common share, for estimated legal settlement costs and a charge of $3.5 million, or ($0.15) per diluted common share, related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on net deferred tax assets. Adjusted EBITDA increased 35% to $15.1 million (see non-GAAP reconciliation herein) Adjusted earnings per diluted common share was $0.10 compared with $0.15 per diluted common share (see non-GAAP reconciliation herein) Days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased by 10 days to 101\n\"Our strong fourth quarter capped off a year of solid performance, providing excellent momentum as we head into the new year. In 2017, we expanded our outpatient and sober living offerings, consolidated facilities in Southern California, Southern Florida and Louisiana to accelerate operational efficiencies, increased our borrowing capacity with a new $210 million secured term loan facility and a $55 million revolving credit facility, and announced the pending acquisition of AdCare,\" said Michael Cartwright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AAC Holdings, Inc. \"Of course, delivering excellent clinical client care remains our top focus, and our effectiveness in executing against this vision is illustrated in the recent findings of our 12-month clinical outcomes study and in investments we are making in clinical and other technology to further improve client experiences, safety and outcomes.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nAAC breaks down its revenues between client related revenue and non-client related revenue. Client related revenue includes: (1) residential treatment facility services and related professional services; (2) outpatient facility services, related professional services and sober living services; and (3) client related diagnostic services, which includes point of care drug testing and client related diagnostic laboratory services. Non-client related revenue includes marketing and diagnostic services provided to third parties. Prior period results have been conformed to the current period presentation.\nTotal revenue increased 19% to $86.1 million compared with $72.4 million in the same period in the prior year.\nResidential treatment facility revenue increased 40% to $71.5 million compared with $51.2 million in the same period in the prior year. ADR increased 58% to $1,054 compared with $667 in the same period in the prior year.\nOutpatient and sober living facility revenue increased 59% to $9.0 million compared with $5.7 million in the same period in the prior year. ARV increased 16% to $418 compared with $360 in the same period in the prior year.\nClient related diagnostic services revenue was down 78% to $3.1 million compared with $14.2 million in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in client related diagnostic services is a result of previously anticipated lower reimbursements combined with a shift in the mix of client related diagnostic services from higher reimbursed tests to lower reimbursed tests.\nNon-client related revenue increased 104% to $2.5 million compared with $1.2 million in the same period in the prior year.\nNet loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders was $18.8 million, or ($0.80) per diluted common share, compared with net income available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share, in the prior-year period. Included in the net loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders is the accrued litigation liability of $23.3 million, or ($0.70) per diluted common share, related to the estimated settlement of the Tennessee class action litigation and the Nevada derivative litigation matters. Also included in the net loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders is a non-cash increase in the Company's provision for income taxes of $3.5 million, or ($0.15) per diluted common share, related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the net deferred tax assets. These estimates may be refined as further information becomes available.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 35% to $15.1 million compared with $11.1 million for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted net income available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders decreased to $2.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share, compared with $3.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this release.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 14% to $317.6 million compared with $279.8 million in the prior year.\nResidential treatment facility revenue increased 30% to $247.0 million compared with $189.5 million in the prior year. ADR increased 38% to $873 compared with $633 in the prior year.\nOutpatient and sober living facility revenue increased 74% to $29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2107 compared with $16.7 million in the prior year. ARV increased 19% to $403 compared with $339 in the prior year.\nClient related diagnostic services revenue was down 50% to $32.5 million compared with $64.4 million in the prior year. As is the case with fourth quarter results, this decrease is the result of previously anticipated lower reimbursements combined with a shift in the mix of client related diagnostic services from higher reimbursed tests to lower reimbursed tests.\nNon-client related revenue decreased 1% to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $9.2 million in the in the prior year.\nNet loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders was $20.6 million, or ($0.88) per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with net loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders of $0.6 million, or ($0.03) per diluted common share, in the prior year. Included in the net loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders is an accrued litigation liability of $23.3 million, or ($0.70) per diluted common share, and the non-cash increase in the Company's provision for income taxes of $3.5 million, or ($0.15) per diluted common share, outlined above.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $47.7 million for the prior year. Adjusted net income available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders decreased to $13.9 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share, compared with $16.2 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share, for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included at the end of this release.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2017, AAC Holdings' balance sheet reflected cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 million, net property and equipment of $152.5 million and total debt of $201.2 million, net of debt issuance costs of $7.2 million.\nCash flows provided by operations totaled $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with cash flows used in operations of $1.2 million in the prior year period. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $5.9 million.\nDays sales outstanding continue to improve and were 101 days for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 106 days for the third quarter of 2017 and 111 for the prior-year period. Total cash collections increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\n2018 Outlook\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" a replacement of Revenue Recognition Topic 605. The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018. Under ASC 606, the majority of the provision for doubtful accounts, which historically was reported as an operating expense, will now be reported as a direct reduction to revenue in 2018. This change in presentation will reduce revenues and operating expenses by the same amount and is not expected to have an effect on net income or earnings per share.\nAAC introduces its guidance for the full year 2018 in the table below. Results for 2018 full year guidance have been provided inclusive of ASC 606, and for comparability only, 2018 full year guidance has also been provided excluding the impact of ASC 606 (dollars in millions, except share data):\nFull Year 2018 Guidance\nAs Currently\nReported\nAdjusted for\nAdoption of ASC\n606 on January 1,\n2018\nTotal Revenues\n$325 - $335\n$290 - $300\nResidential treatment facility revenue\n$258 - $260\n$234 - $236\nOutpatient and sober living facility revenue\n$38 - $42\n$35 - $39\nClient related diagnostic services revenue (includes point of care drug\ntesting and client related diagnostic laboratory services revenue)\n$18 - $21\n$12 - $15\nNon-client related revenue (includes third-party marketing and\nlaboratory services)\n$11 - $12\n$9 - $10\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$62 - $65\n$62 - $65\nAdjusted Earnings per Diluted Common Share\n$0.70 - $0.75\n$0.70 - $0.75\nThe Company expects an annual effective tax rate of 24% to 26% and diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding of approximately 24 million for the year.\nThis outlook above does not include the impact of any future acquisitions, including the pending acquisition of AdCare, transaction-related costs, litigation settlement or expenses related to legal defenses.\nWith respect to the \"2018 Outlook\" above, reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted common share guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts. This inability results from the inherent difficulty in forecasting generally and quantifying certain projected amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations. In particular, sufficient information is not available to calculate certain adjustments required for such reconciliations, including de novo start-up and other expense and acquisition-related expenses. We expect these adjustments may have a potentially significant impact on future GAAP financial results.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday, February 22, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. CT to further discuss these results.

Management believes the Non-GAAP Disclosures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. We believe the Non-GAAP Disclosures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results. The Non-GAAP Disclosures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The items excluded from the Non-GAAP Disclosures are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other financial statement items presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Because the Non-GAAP Disclosures are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, the Non-GAAP Disclosures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, income tax benefit, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, stock-based compensation and related tax reimbursements, litigation settlement and California matter related expense, acquisition-related expense (which includes professional services for accounting, legal, valuation services and licensing expenses), de novo start-up and other expenses, employee severance expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on contingent consideration and facility closure operating losses and expense.\nAAC HOLDINGS, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES\nUnaudited\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income Available to AAC Holdings, Inc.
