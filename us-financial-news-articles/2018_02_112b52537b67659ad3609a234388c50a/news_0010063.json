Fortum has denied such plans.\nThe offer is still subject to competition and regulatory approvals and Fortum expects to finalize the transaction in mid-2018.\n($1 = 0.8081 euros)\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl and Tuomas Forsell; Additional reporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T13:29:30.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
