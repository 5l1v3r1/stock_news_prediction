The MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed as much as 2 percent in its largest intraday drop since late 2016.\nBut bonds in India turned relatively more stable, with the benchmark 10-year bond yield rising 2 basis points to 7.58 percent after posting its biggest weekly rise since February 2017 last week.\nThe rupee was trading at 64.0325/0375 per dollar, compared with Friday’s close of 64.07.\n“Disappointments include budget provisions and lack of buying on small- and mid-caps, even at lower levels. Expect RBI to maintain the rates and its cautious tone during the policy meet this week,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.\nThe NSE index was down 0.83 percent at 10,671.55 as of 0628 GMT, after declining as much as 1.62 percent to its lowest level since Jan 5.\nThe benchmark BSE index was 0.83 percent lower at 34,777.08, after dropping as much as 1.56 percent.\nBoth indexes were down for a fifth straight session, in what could be their longest losing streak since September 2017.\nThe losses were led by index heavyweight Housing Development Finance Corp, which was trading 3 percent lower.\nMeanwhile, Bharti Airtel Ltd climbed as much as 5 percent after Singapore Telecommunications Ltd said it would raise stake in Bharti Telecom, the holding company for India’s biggest mobile carrier.
