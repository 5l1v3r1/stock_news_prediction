FUNDAMENTALS * LONDON COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper was trading little changed at $7,122 a tonne by 0149 GMT, after losses in the previous session. * SHANGHAI COPPER: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper edged down 0.1 percent to 53,070 yuan ($8,439.89) a tonne. * CHINA DEMAND: Growth in China's manufacturing sector remained elevated in January, a private business survey showed on Thursday, as new business led factories to raise output at the start of the year. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was steady in January at 51.5, matching December's reading, which was the highest in four months and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. * JAPAN DEMAND: Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in almost four years in January, a survey showed on Thursday, with solid output and employment growth supporting a firm recovery in the world's third-largest economy. * NICKEL: Nickel slipped 0.6 percent after it had managed to claw back nearly 2 percent on Tuesday in volatile trade over the past few weeks as traders trim positions ahead of the Lunar New Year, and amid fluctuations in its key demand source, China's steel markets. * COPPER SUPPLY: Chile produced slightly less copper in 2017 than it did the year before, the government said on Wednesday, as output was dogged by a prolonged strike at BHP's Escondida copper mine, the world's largest, early in the year. * For the top stories in metals and other news, click or MARKETS NEWS * Asian shares eked out modest gains on Thursday, pushing back sharp losses from earlier this week.
