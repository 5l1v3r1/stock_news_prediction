The Algeria international is angry about not being allowed to join Manchester City during the January transfer window and has been absent from training sessions. \nManchester United will hope to secure back-to-back wins when they visit another relegation-threatened team, Newcastle United, on Sunday. \nThe Magpies are 16th, one point above the relegation zone, and have not won in four league matches, although they have been boosted by the loan signings of Kenedy from Chelsea and Islam Slimani from Leicester.
