Funding will be allocated by token holders to issues they see as important.\nWittig said this could support causes like combating the persecution of gay men in places like Uganda or Chechnya. The LGBT community in this deeply conservative region of Russia has reported intensifying persecution and abuse by authorities.\nCreating a unified and visible network would also help the LGBT community rally around such rights abuses, allowing it to respond with aid and assistance.\n“All in all, it would brings our community together in a way that I don’t think any current system does,” said Wood.\n(This story has been refiled to clarify location of LGBT Foundation in paragraph 4)\nReporting by Ana Ionova, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
