It did not say how many customers it had lost in the period.\nMobily also said the unblocking of most VoIP applications had impacted revenue.\nSaudi Arabia lifted in September 2017 a ban on online voice and video call services such as Microsoft’s Skype and Facebook’s WhatsApp.\nMobily, an affiliate of the United Arab Emirates’ Etisalat , competes with Saudi Telecom (STC) and Zain Saudi.
