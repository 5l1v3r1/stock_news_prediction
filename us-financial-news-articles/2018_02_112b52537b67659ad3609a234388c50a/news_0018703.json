He loves football, he loves his relationship with his team-mates, he enjoys his football. I think he needs to come back, to play and touch the ball,” Puel said on Thursday. “It is important he comes back.” \nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, whose bid instigated the standoff last month, said on Friday he “hopes” Mahrez faces City on Saturday. \n“I hope he comes back soon to play football. We enjoy watching him.” \nThere was no confirmation from Leicester whether Mahrez will be included in the 18-man match-day squad.
