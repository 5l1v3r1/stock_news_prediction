(Nasdaq:SPRO), a multi-asset clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing novel treatments for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, announced today the appointment of David P. Southwell to its Board of Directors, effective immediately. Mr. Southwell has more than 20 years of corporate leadership and finance experience within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, most recently as the President and Chief Executive Officer at Inotek Pharmaceuticals. He is succeeding director Vikas Goyal, who has been a long-standing director of Spero since it was a private company and is making a planned transition from the Board, effective upon Mr. Southwell’s appointment.\n“We are delighted to welcome David to our Board of Directors,” said Ankit Mahadevia, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Spero Therapeutics. “David’s extensive experience building, growing, and financing clinical and commercial stage organizations will be invaluable as we continue to rapidly advance our clinical-stage pipeline and our leadership in the field of infectious disease.”\nDr. Mahadevia added, “We would also like to thank Vikas for his years of service to Spero’s Board, helping guide us during our years of growth as a private company to our next stage of growth as a publicly traded company.”\nMr. Southwell served as President and Chief Executive Officer, and member of the Board of Directors of Inotek Pharmaceuticals from July 2014 until its merger with Rocket Pharmaceuticals in January 2018. From March 2010 to October 2012, Mr. Southwell served as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Human Genome Sciences until its merger with GlaxoSmithKline plc. Prior to Human Genome Sciences, Mr. Southwell served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sepracor from 1994-2008, and as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers from 1984-1986 and 1988-1994.\n“I am delighted to join Spero at this exciting time for the company,” said Mr. Southwell. “Spero’s derisked clinical pipeline offers an attractive and cost-effective treatment paradigm for the millions of patients that suffer from bacterial infections, yet are not adequately served by current therapies both outside and inside of the hospital setting. This unique mix of products positions it well for growth in the field.”\nMr. Southwell currently serves on the Board of Directors of PTC Therapeutics, since December 2005, and Rocket Pharmaceuticals since January 2018. He previously served on the Boards of Directors of Human Genome Sciences (2008-2010), THL Credit (2007-2016), inVentiv Health (2016), and Biosphere Medical (1998-2010).
