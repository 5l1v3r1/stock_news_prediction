Amgen ( AMGN.O ) became the first company to win approval for such a treatment in 2015.\nMerck’s current research chief Roger Perlmutter was responsible for acquiring the Amgen product during his previous job as head of R&D at the U.S. biotechnology giant.\nViralytics’s leading experimental product, Cavatak, uses a proprietary formulation of a common cold virus and is currently being studied in multiple Phase I and Phase II clinical trials.\nDRUG COMBINATION Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said the acquisition represented “a very nice tuck-in” for Merck and came at an interesting time since Viralytics is expected to have news on clinical tests of its oncolytic virus with Merck’s immunotherapy drug Keytruda in the second quarter of 2018.\nTrials testing Cavatak with Keytruda include experiments to treat melanoma, prostate, lung and bladder cancers.\nRoy Baynes, Merck’s head of global clinical development, said Viralytics’s approach complemented the U.S. drugmaker’s immuno-oncology strategy and opened up the possibility of new synergistic drug combinations.\nThe board of Viralytics said it unanimously recommended shareholders vote in favor of the Merck offer, “subject to there being no superior proposal and an independent expert concluding that the scheme is in the best interest of the company’s shareholders”.\nThe deal comes at a time of booming merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology sector, with $27.5 billion of transactions agreed in January alone as large drugmakers look for promising assets to improve their pipelines.\nOn completion of the transaction - expected by the second quarter of 2018 - Viralytics will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck.\nCredit Suisse is advising Merck on the transaction, while Lazard is working for Viralytics.\n($1 = 1.2740 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Ben Hirschler, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T11:45:55.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
