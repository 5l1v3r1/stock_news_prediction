Maybe see you in four years and maybe it will be different.”\nSlideshow (3 Images) In September last year, Giezendanner suffered a serious right knee injury while training in Chile and did not return to the slopes until November.\n“I won’t complain because I was injured at the beginning of the season, so for me it was already a victory to be here,” he added.\n“I never felt I would be fourth at the Olympics so I think I might be a bit disappointed tonight, but for now I have no regrets and I‘m just happy to be here.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:45:52.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
