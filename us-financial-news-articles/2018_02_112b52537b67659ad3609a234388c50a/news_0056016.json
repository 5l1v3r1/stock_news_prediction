China’s SSE Composite index and the blue-chip CSI300 each rose 0.7 percent.\nAll Asian markets except Philippines eked out gains following a sell-off on Thursday after minutes of the Fed’s last meeting showed policy makers were confident about the economic outlook. That prompted some investors to boost the chance of faster rate hikes.\nSt Louis Fed President James Bullard tried to tamp down of expectations of four rate hikes in 2018, instead of the widely anticipated three, saying on Thursday policymakers need to be careful not to increase rates too quickly because that could slow the economy.\nThat was enough to send U.S. shares rallying, despite the negative lead from Asia and Europe. On Wall Street, the Dow added 0.7 percent, the S&P 500 ended a tad firmer while the Nasdaq lost 0.11 percent.\nThe Fed had caused a so called “taper tantrum” in May 2013 when it signalled it was time to stop pumping cash into the U.S. economy, a move that created havoc in financial markets particularly Asia.\nBut analysts are more upbeat about the outlook for Asia despite prospects of rising U.S. inflation and rates.\n“Financial market volatility has not dented our constructive view on Asia’s growth outlook for this year,” said Khoon Goh Singapore-based Head of Research for ANZ.\n“Higher inflation and a larger fiscal deficit in the United States will likely see U.S. bond yields move higher, but improved fundamentals in Asia mean the region is better placed to weather this than in 2013.”\nAnalysts expect the market to be in a “holding pattern” ahead of a slew of important U.S. January activity data on Tuesday, followed by global surveys on manufacturing activity on Thursday.\nCURRENCIES The dollar sagged broadly on Friday after its recovery this week faded as U.S. Treasury yields declined from their recent peaks.\nBenchmark 10-year note yields were last yielding 2.9317 percent, after rising to a four-year high of 2.957 percent on Wednesday.\nThe euro was little changed at $1.2311 after gaining 0.4 percent the previous day. The common currency has lost 0.75 percent so far this week, following its ascent to a three-year top of $1.2556 on Feb. 16.\nThe yen, which tends to benefit during times of heightened volatility or uncertainty, rose almost 1 percent overnight to last fetch around 106.8 per dollar.\nOil prices hovered near two-week highs, supported by lower U.S. crude inventories, but gains were capped by a surge in U.S. exports.\nU.S. crude added 6 cents to $62.83 per barrel and Brent eased 1 cent to $66.38. Spot gold ticked lower to $1329.01 an ounce.\nReporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:06:03.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
