The Dutch are helping the two Russia-bound teams prepare for this year’s World Cup. \nKoeman has been out of work since being dismissed by Everton last October after a poor run of form in the Premier League. \nHe did, however, enjoy significant success as a club coach in his homeland winning three Eredivisie titles - two with Ajax Amsterdam (2001-02, 2003-04) and one with PSV Eindhoven (2006-07). \nHe has also coached Vitesse Arnhem, Benfica, Valencia, AZ Alkmaar, Feyenoord and Southampton. \nHis coaching career began as an assistant to Guus Hiddink with the Dutch side in 1997 but he left after a year to take up a similar role under Louis van Gaal at Barcelona. \nFormer Dutch international Kees van Wonderen will be Koeman’s assistant with Patrick Lodewijks as goalkeeper coach.
