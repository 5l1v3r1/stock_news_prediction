I realised I didn’t have a passion nearly as big as competing at an Olympic Games or skeleton.”\nThree days later, Daly emailed his federation and made his return to the ice track in January, 2017.\nHe will be back on the big stage for the preliminaries at the Olympic Sliding Centre on Thursday along with good friend Antoine, his room mate at the athletes’ village.\nWisconsin man Antoine also nearly gave away skeleton for good as he battled depression following his Sochi medal, a condition the 32-year-old continues to manage.\nAntoine was among the first to console Daly after his let-down in Sochi and his words struck a deep chord.\n“This guy just won a bronze medal and his first thought was to give me a hug and say, ‘I would have not have won this medal if it wasn’t for you. You and I would never be as good as we are if we didn’t have each other’,” said Daly.\n“That was one of the best things he ever said to me.”\nDaly, who won a team world championship in 2013, has no hesitation to say he is gunning for medals at Pyeongchang.\nFour clean runs would do, of course, but he knows anything can happen.\n“I think all the sliding athletes do it for that reason,” he said. “Things can go wrong, but when they go right it is so sweet.”\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:40:37.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
