The Wells Fargo total is based on the bank’s share price at the time the buyback for up to 350 million shares was announced.\nThe value of some of the buybacks is vastly larger than corporate pledges made to benefit workers, Democrats said.\nTrimTabs Investment Research, which tracks buybacks, said it has seen 69 buyback announcements worth a combined $101.3 billion as of Feb. 7, with the biggest programs from companies expected to benefit most from the tax changes.\n“The number of announcements has been one of the lowest in eight years, while volume has been near the top,” TrimTabs analyst Winston Chua said.\nReporting by David Morgan; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T03:00:53.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
