Vertex’s treatments, Kalydeco, Orkambi and now Symdeko, all address the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, rather than just symptoms.\n“Symdeko is an important treatment option for patients who either never started or discontinued Orkambi, and it also provides increased benefit over Kalydeco alone,” Dr. Patrick Flume, director of the Medical University of South Carolina Cystic Fibrosis Center, said in a statement.\nSymdeko was approved for CF patients aged 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del gene mutation or who have at least one mutation that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor.\nVertex said it expects European approval of the two-drug combination in the second half of this year.
