Another PKR lawmaker is appealing against a 3,000 ringgit fine.\nRafizi was handed a 30-month jail term for revealing to the media bank details of the National Feedlot Corp (NFCorp) and a top executive of the company which was tasked by the government with boosting cattle production, state news agency Bernama said.\nRafizi had at the time alleged that executives at NFCorp had misappropriated about 250 million ringgit($64 million) of public funds in what the media had called the “cow gate” scandal.\nThe judge granted a stay of execution of the sentence to allow Rafizi to appeal the decision.\nNajib faces an unprecedented challenge from his former mentor, former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, whom the opposition have named as their leader.\nMahathir, 92, turned on Najib in 2015 over the prime minister’s handling of a multi-billion dollar scandal linked to state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).\nIn civil lawsuits, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged that about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB. The Malaysian fund has denied any wrongdoing and Najib, who founded 1MDB, has denied all allegations of corruption against him.\n($1 = 3.9040 ringgit)\nReporting by Joseph Sipalan; Editing by Miral Fahmy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T12:54:46.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
