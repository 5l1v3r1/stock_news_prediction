Revenues were slightly lower than expected at 5.036 billion euros.\nMTU is a partner on the geared turbofan engine made by Pratt and Whitney, which powers the Airbus A320neo and which has suffered a fresh round of problems that saw some A320neo jets grounded and certain deliveries halted this week.\nThe German company said its forecast for 2018, including for a “moderate” increase in core profit, was based on the assumption that the latest problems could be rectified quickly, without jeopardising delivery targets.
