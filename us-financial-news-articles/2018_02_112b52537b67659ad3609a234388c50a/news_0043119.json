Fears of rising inflation, along with worries about tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve , lifted rates and pressured stocks during the correction.\nLast week, the Labor Department said the U.S. consumer price index — a widely followed inflation metric — rose 0.5 percent last month , topping a Reuters estimate of 0.3 percent.\n\"At present, the strength of current data … is still acting as a counterweight to inflation concerns, as is a strong 1Q results season. Earnings reported so far have beaten estimates by [about] 5% in the US,\" said Sheets. \"Things get trickier, however, after 1Q. Past March, markets will need to digest rising … core inflation and declining [purchase manager indexes], economic surprises and (quite possibly) earnings revisions.\"\n— CNBC's Pippa Stevens contributed to this report.\nDisclaimer\nWATCH: FMHR traders debate BlackRock's market call show chapters Traders debate BlackRock's US stocks call 4 Hours Ago | 04:59", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:49:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
