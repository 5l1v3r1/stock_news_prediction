This matched the S$1.2 billion average estimate of six analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters. \nCEO Piyush Gupta said the full-year performance was driven by broad-based growth in loans and fee income, which more than offset the impact of less favourable interest rates and trading income. \nThe bank’s net fee income grew 23 percent in the fourth quarter, with the increase spread across most fee income streams and led by wealth management and investment banking. \nDBS proposed a special dividend of 50 Singapore cents per share to return the capital buffers it had built up ahead of the finalisation of new capital rules. \nSince Gupta took over as the CEO in 2009, DBS has more than doubled its group profits and broken into the top five private banks in Asia, helped by medium-sized acquisitions.
