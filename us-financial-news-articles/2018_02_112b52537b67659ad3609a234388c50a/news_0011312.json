Rates up significantly and dollar down significantly with exploding deficits is a dangerous cocktail reminiscent of 1987.” \nLast month, Gundlach predicted the S&P 500 may go up 15 percent in the first part of the year, but “I believe, when it falls, it will wipe out the entire gain of the first part of the year with a negative sign in front of it.” \nOn Saturday, Gundlach said: ”What matters to success this year is understanding that we entered a mania phase in 2017 that went completely out of control after September with the Bitcoin blowoff exhibiting exactly the same lunacy as the dot com blow off back in late 1999. \n“Similar to that period, but even more excessive this time -who’d have thought it possible - is the explosion of bullish sentiment, with some surveys registering 96 percent, 97 percent, even 100 percent bullish respondents. Long Island Blockchain. Kodakcoin. Cryptokitties. Sheer madness.” \nGundlach said overall, the U.S. stock market is an odds-on favorite to turn in a negative return for 2018. “Whether Friday is the start of a crash or just the first chapter in the topping process is not the issue,” he said.
