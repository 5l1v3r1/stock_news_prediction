The facility’s total capacity is $100 million and the revolving period expires on January 30, 2021 with a final maturity date of January 31, 2023.\nManagement Commentary\n“We are glad to report the credit quality of the Oaktree Strategic Income portfolio is strong as the majority of our investments are performing well,” said Edgar Lee, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Oaktree Strategic Income. “Since we began managing the portfolio in mid-October, we have been focused on redeploying capital from loan payoffs and exits into larger, first lien loans to a diversified group of stable, middle-market companies. Looking to the future, we are excited about the opportunity to deploy capital into higher yielding, proprietary originations generated by Oaktree’s platform.”\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the investment portfolio was $541.4 million and was comprised of investments in 65 portfolio companies and the investments in FSFR Glick JV LLC (\"Glick JV\").\nAt fair value, 89.2% of the Company's portfolio as of December 31, 2017 consisted of senior secured floating-rate debt investments, including 86.0% of first lien loans and 3.2% of second lien loans; 10.6% consisted of a subordinated note investment in Glick JV; and 0.2% consisted of equity investments in other portfolio companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Glick JV had $151.5 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 25 portfolio companies. The joint venture generated income of $1.5 million for Oaktree Strategic Income during the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThe weighted average yield on the Company's debt investments as of December 31, 2017, including the return on our subordinated note investment in Glick JV, was 7.1%.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company originated $136.2 million of new investment commitments, including investments in 17 new and three existing portfolio companies and funded $143.9 million of investments across new and existing portfolio companies.\nDuring the quarter, the Company received $71.3 million in connection with the full repayments and exits of eight of its investments, and an additional $90.1 million in connection with other paydowns and sales of investments.\nResults of Operations\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $10.7 million, including $10.0 million of cash interest income from portfolio investments, as compared with total investment income of $11.8 million and cash interest income of $10.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The decline in total investment income was primarily due to a lower weighted average yield on investments and a smaller average portfolio size during the quarter, as loan payoffs and exits exceeded fundings.\nNet expenses for the quarter were $6.2 million, a slight decline from $6.3 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower management and incentive fees and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher professional fees.\nNet unrealized appreciation on the investment portfolio for the quarter was $1.7 million. Net realized loss for the quarter was $4.4 million, which was primarily driven by the sale of the Company's first lien term loan investment in New Trident Holdcorp, Inc. during the quarter.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $46.2 million of cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash), total principal value of debt outstanding of $254.1 million, and $95.9 million of undrawn capacity on its credit facilities and 2015 debt securitization, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 3.57% as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s total leverage ratio was 0.88x debt-to-equity.\nDividend Declaration\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share, payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2018.\nDividends are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Company’s stockholders.\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were three investments on which the Company had stopped accruing cash and/or payment-in-kind (\"PIK\") interest or original issue discount (\"OID\") income that, in the aggregate, represented 4.1% of the debt portfolio at cost and 1.2% at fair value.\n($ in thousands) Non-Accrual - Debt Investments As of December 31, 2017 As of September 30, 2017 Non-Accrual Investments at Fair Value $ 6,352 $ 6,293 Non-Accrual Investments/Total Investments at Fair Value 1.2 % 1.1 %\nOaktree Strategic Income Corporation\nConsolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities\nDecember 31, 2017\n(unaudited) September 30,\n2017 ASSETS Investments at fair value: Control investments (cost December 31, 2017: $71,635,783;
