I would like them to have a personal best for the competition,” Bruno Marcotte, a Canadian coach who consults with the pair, told Reuters after a practice at the Gangneung Ice Arena.\n“The focus in on the fact that every time they perform, their score keeps getting better. If they can score in the high 60s in their short programme or close to 70, that would be great. And the goal for the long programme is above 125.”\nThe pair recorded their current personal best in the short programme, 65.25 points, at a competition where they won bronze last month in Taiwan. They also recorded their best total score, 184.98, at that competition.\nThey achieved their personal best in the long programme, 119.90 points, last year.\nIn late September, the skaters were the first North Koreans to qualify for the Games after they finished in the top six at a competition in Germany.\nNorth Korea did not have any athletes at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.\nRyom, 19, and Kim, 25, spent about two months in Montreal last summer to train with Marcotte.\nMarcotte told Reuters last year that the pair had great potential but they needed more power and consistency to be a threat.\nThey will skate their short programme at the Pyeongchang Games on Wednesday, and their long programme a day later.\nMarcotte said the skaters hadn’t discussed their thoughts about taking part in the Olympics in South Korea with him.\nNorth Korea’s presence in Pyeongchang is viewed as a sign of easing tensions over its nuclear and missile programmes, which it pursues in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\nNorth and South Korea remain technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty.\nTensions escalated dramatically last year as the regime of Kim Jong Un stepped up its programme aimed at developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States.
