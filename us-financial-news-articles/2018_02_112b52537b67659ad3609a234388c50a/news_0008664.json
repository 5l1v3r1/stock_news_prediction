(NASDAQ: SNES), the developer of ContraPest ® , a paradigm shifting technology that focuses on rodent management through fertility control, announced today the appointment of Mr. Joe Malinowski as Vice President of Sales effective February 1, 2018.\nMr. Malinowski joins SenesTech with more than 30 years of experience in the national pest control industry. His industry background includes significant management and operating experience at industry leaders including Terminix, and specifically, Orkin, where he served from 1979 to 2002, in positions of increasing levels of responsibilities during his tenure.\nDr. Loretta Mayer, chairman and chief executive officer of SenesTech, said, \"I am pleased to have an industry executive the caliber of Joe Malinowski join SenesTech at this important point in the history of the Company. His broad industry expertise, as well as contacts throughout the industry, will be instrumental to SenesTech as we work to establish ContraPest ® as one of the most effective solutions in the pest control industry.\"\nMr. Malinowski said, \"I see a great opportunity with a unique solution that can achieve breakthrough results. The demand for effective pest management continues unabated as it has for centuries. I believe ContraPest ® offers a sustainable solution that traditional poison baits have not been able to produce. I look forward toward working with the entire SenesTech team to develop this opportunity.\"\nAbout SenesTech\nSenesTech has developed an innovative technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility control as opposed to a lethal approach.\nContraPest ® 's innnovative technology and approach targets the reproductive capabilities of both sexes in rat populations, inducing egg loss in female rats and impairing sperm development in males. Using a proprietary bait delivery method, ContraPest ® is dispensed in a highly palatable liquid formulation that promotes sustained consumption by rat communities. ContraPest ® is designed, formulated and dispensed to be low hazard for handlers and non-target species such as wildlife, livestock and pets, where the active ingredients break down rapidly. In contrast, the historical approach to managing rat pest populations, poison bait blocks, carries a high risk of environmental contamination and the poisoning of non-target animals, pets, and children. ContraPest ® is a Restricted Use product.\nWe believe ContraPest ® will establish a new paradigm in rodent control, resulting in improved performance in rodent control over poison options, without the negative environmental effects.
