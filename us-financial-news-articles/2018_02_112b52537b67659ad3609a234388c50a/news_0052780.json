City of New York et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-638. \nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T22:40:34.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
