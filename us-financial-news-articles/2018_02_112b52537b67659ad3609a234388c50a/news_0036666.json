On Sunday she reached new heights, becoming the first Briton to successfully defend any Winter Olympic title, while Deas’s bronze means there will be two British medallists on a podium for the first time.\n“What took me maybe five years to get to, took Laura and Lizzy one year,” Williams said.\nThat’s in part thanks to a conscious and calculated effort by British sports officials to find women whose bodies are perfectly suited for the sport via an official “Girls4Gold” recruitment programme.\n“Girls would rock up on a day, get tested, then be popped into different sports that their body was suited to,” Williams said.\nSkeleton races begin with an explosive sprint, with athletes then diving head-first onto a sled which accelerates down the ice at speeds of over 100kph.\nYarnold was a heptathlete with dreams of making it as a pentathlete while Deas had ambitions in eventing but both were found to be naturally suited to the sport they knew nothing about and were allocated training and financial assistance from the UK’s national lottery.\nNO ICE While the lack of a home track puts them at a “massive disadvantage”, it changes the way the federation chooses its athletes, Head of Performance at the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association Danny Holdcroft said.\n“It makes sure that we are detailed in selecting the right athletes,” said Holdcroft, who added that British sliders have, remarkably, only around three hours of actual sliding time on the ice per season.\nInstead, they use a roller-coaster like track on which to practice the crucial fast start to shave off time in an Olympic sport measured in hundredths of seconds.\n“In Germany you might have started at five years old so you may have got really good at driving but you might never be a really fast sprinter,” said British gold medallist Williams.\nStill, even with more access to ice tracks, the fabled “Cresta Run” is not likely to be one of them.\nWomen had been allowed to run the Cresta until a decision to ban them was taken in 1929 for “reasons that are not clear,” according to the club’s official website.\nReporting by James Pearson, editing by Mitch Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:11:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
