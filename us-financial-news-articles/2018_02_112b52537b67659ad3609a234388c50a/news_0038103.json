The Commission, which acts as the competition supervisor in the European Union, said it was particularly concerned about the merger’s impact in the markets for oxygen and helium. “Gases – like oxygen and helium – are crucial inputs for a large variety of products we use every day,” Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. “We will carefully assess whether the proposed merger between Praxair and Linde would lead to higher prices or less choice for European consumers and businesses,” she added. The planned all-share merger of equals between the German and the U.S. group, which was agreed in June, would create the world’s biggest industrial gases group, ahead of France’s Air Liquide ( AIRP.PA ), with total revenue of $28.7 billion and 88,000 staff. The companies said they had set a “pain threshold” of divestments that regulators could require beyond which a merger would no longer make sense. If regulators demand the disposal of businesses with more than $3.7 billion in sales or $1.1 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), either party can withdraw without penalty. The Commission said it had 90 working days, until July 4, to make a decision.
