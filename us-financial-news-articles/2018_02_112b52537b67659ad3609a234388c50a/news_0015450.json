Strong business management and consistent execution has resulted in two consecutive years of steady growth. IMRIS' strong financial performance was driven by 67 percent growth in system bookings – a result of winning multi-million dollar contracts with top-tier hospitals around the world. Due to continued business growth, IMRIS has expanded the organization incrementally with the addition of more than 25 new personnel in the past 12 months.\n\"In 2017, IMRIS focused on adding new talent, organizing the company for continued growth, and completing a major rebrand aligned with our core values,\" says IMRIS President and CEO Andrew Flanagan. \"This year, we're looking forward to building on that momentum with new product launches, growth in research and development spending combined with expanded clinical services that will demonstrate IMRIS' commitment to innovation via product and clinical solutions.\"\nIn September 2017, the company celebrated its two-year anniversary under new ownership – a major milestone substantiated by strong financials. It was at this time that IMRIS unveiled its new brand which reflects the way that they will continue to deliver on their promise to neurosurgeons, patients and customers. Product milestones in 2017 included a completed device listing and registration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a new multi-functional operating room table specifically designed for the IMRIS Surgical Theatre that will provide significant workflow improvements to support better patient outcomes.\nThe company's flagship IMRIS Surgical Theatre features the world's only moving ceiling-mounted intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) or computed tomography (iCT) imaging modality, allowing neurosurgeons to see critical anatomical detail while the patient is on the operating table. The IMRIS solution gives surgeons a way to bring advanced imaging technology to the patient rather than moving the patient in and out of the operating room. The results are life-changing for patients – providing neurosurgeons greater precision and accuracy during surgery, reducing the need for additional operations, and reducing the possibility of complications associated with moving the patient.\nIncreasing numbers of hospitals are now considering the IMRIS Surgical Theatre as the standard of intraoperative care, resulting from the increased efficiency and accuracy it brings to neurosurgeons, as well as improvements in patient outcomes. In the past two years, IMRIS has expanded its customer base to more than 75 customers worldwide in some of the most prestigious hospitals globally including Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Beijing Tiantan Hospital. To date, more than 30,000 patient lives have been impacted by the IMRIS Surgical Theatre.\n\"With tens of thousands of lives impacted thus far, the IMRIS team looks forward to another year of expanded innovation that will bring advanced imaging technology and new data solutions that will transform the way patients receive treatment and hospitals administer care. Our goal is to elevate both the medical experience and the human experience,\" says Flanagan.\nABOUT IMRIS\nAs a leader in image guided therapy solutions, IMRIS offers the most advanced hybrid surgical theatres with the world's first and only moving ceiling-mounted iMRI and iCT technology that gives neurosurgeons access to high-quality image detail pre-, mid- and post-operation. With a unique symphony of engineering and advanced imaging technology, the IMRIS Surgical Theatre is built for the human experience and inspired by the human mind. IMRIS serves leading hospitals worldwide, offering optimized workflow for surgeons, maximum value for hospitals and better outcomes for patients.
