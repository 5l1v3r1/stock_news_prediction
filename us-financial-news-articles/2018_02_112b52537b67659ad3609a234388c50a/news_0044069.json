This guidance includes approximately $5 million of incremental revenue from adopting ASC 606. For the quarter ending March 31, 2018, the Company expects revenue in the range of $119 to $123 million, compared to first quarter 2017 revenue of $101.7 million, representing growth of approximately 17% to 21%.

The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial trends. The Company's 2018 guidance reflects the adoption of this standard on a prospective basis and it anticipates the most significant impact relates to the timing of revenue recognition within its drug delivery product line.\nConference Call:\nInsulet will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on February 21, 2018 to discuss the financial results and outlook.
