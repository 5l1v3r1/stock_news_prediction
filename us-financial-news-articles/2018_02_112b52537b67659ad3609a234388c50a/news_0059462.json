(\"Keane\" or the \"Company\") today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results.\nResults and Recent Highlights\nReported fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $501.5 million, compared to third quarter 2017 of $477.3 million Reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $43.9 million, compared to third quarter 2017 net income of $4.1 million Achieved fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $93.8 million, compared to third quarter 2017 of $71.6 million Increased annualized Adjusted Gross Profit per fleet to $17.3 million, compared to third quarter 2017 of $14.2 million Board of Directors authorized stock repurchase program of up to $100 million Executed dedicated agreement for one previously ordered newbuild fleet; deployment expected by end of second quarter 2018\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $501.5 million, an increase of 5% compared to revenue for the third quarter of 2017 of $477.3 million. Reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $43.9 million, compared to net income of $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2017. Net income per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $0.39, compared to net income per share for the third quarter of 2017 of $0.04. Excluding one-time items and other adjustments further discussed below, net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $38.2 million, compared to net income of $17.4 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $93.8 million, compared to $71.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted Gross Profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $113.1 million, compared to $89.7 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $24.6 million, compared to $28.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. Excluding one-time items, selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $18.4 million compared to $17.5 million for the third quarter of 2017.\n“Constructive market dynamics for completions services continued during the fourth quarter,” said James Stewart, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Keane. “We are proud of our performance and execution during the quarter and throughout the year, grounded by our strategy of partnering with high-quality blue chip customers under dedicated agreements. We are deepening our customer relationships, and in many cases, running multiple fleets per customer, validating our successful partnership model. The outlook for U.S. completions services remains robust, and we are encouraged by current market signals and feedback from our customers, supporting our decision to order 150,000 newbuild horsepower for delivery and deployment later this year.”\n“We achieved another quarter of strong financial performance, maintaining full-utilization, advancing profitability, further optimizing our asset portfolio and strengthening our balance sheet” said Greg Powell, President and Chief Financial Officer of Keane. “During the fourth quarter, we grew adjusted EBITDA by approximately 30% sequentially and improved average annualized Adjusted Gross Profit per fleet by more than 20%. The industry experienced colder than normal weather late in the fourth quarter, resulting in periods of inefficiency in many regions, including the Permian. However, our dedicated customer agreements, combined with quality execution, allowed us to continue our growth and deliver results at the high-end of our profitability guidance.”\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the full year 2017 totaled $1.542 billion, an increase of 266% compared to revenue for the full year 2016 of $420.6 million. Net loss for the full year 2017 was $(36.1) million, compared to a net loss for the full year 2016 of $(187.1) million. Net loss per share for the full year 2017 totaled $(0.34).\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 totaled $214.5 million, compared to $1.9 million for the full year 2016. Adjusted gross profit for the full year 2017 was $275.0 million, compared to $27.8 million for the full year 2016.\nCompletion Services\nRevenue for Completion Services totaled $495.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 6% compared to the third quarter of 2017 of $468.5 million, driven by an additional fleet deployment in October 2017, and price increases from contract re-openers on a portion of our portfolio. Keane averaged 26 deployed hydraulic fracturing fleets for the fourth quarter of 2017, of which 78% were bundled with wireline. Keane exited the fourth quarter of 2017 with 26 hydraulic fracturing fleets deployed.\nAdjusted Gross Profit in Completion Services totaled $112.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $87.9 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nAnnualized revenue per average deployed hydraulic fracturing fleet for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $76.2 million, compared to $75.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. Annualized Adjusted Gross Profit per fleet totaled $17.3 million, an increase of 22% as compared to $14.2 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nOther Services\nRevenue in Other Services for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $6.0 million, compared to $8.8 million for the third quarter of 2017. Revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017 included contribution from the company’s cementing assets, and partial-quarter contribution from its workover rig assets, prior to their sale in November 2017.\nAs part of Keane’s ongoing portfolio optimization, the company executed the sale of the remaining six of its workover rigs during the fourth quarter of 2017, generating approximately $10 million of cash proceeds. Keane also completed the sale of its idled coiled tubing assets for approximately $10 million of cash proceeds. Together, and combined with the previous sale of six workover rigs completed in the third quarter of 2017, Keane has generated approximately $27 million of cash proceeds, while focusing on optimizing utilization of its cementing assets.\nFourth Quarter 2017 One-Time Items and Other Adjustments\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 excludes $5.7 million of one-time net gains, comprised of one-time gains of $12.7 million, partially offset by one-time expenses of $7.0 million. One-time gains primarily include a reduction in our contingent value right (\"CVR\") liability from the acquisition of RockPile in July 2017, insurance recoveries related to the acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations (as defined within) in 2016 and gains related to the sale of coiled tubing assets. One-time expenses primarily include non-cash stock compensation expense, secondary issuance costs and commissioning costs.\nBalance Sheet and Capital\nTotal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was $275.1 million, net of unamortized debt discounts and unamortized deferred charges and excluding capital lease obligations, compared to $275.6 million as of September 30, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and equivalents totaled $96.1 million, compared to $71.7 million as of September 30, 2017. Total available liquidity as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $295.8 million, which included availability under our asset-based credit facility, as amended and further described below. Total operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately $79.7 million.\nIn December 2017, Keane amended and restated its Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility (“New ABL Facility”). The New ABL Facility expands the Company’s total availability by $150 million to a total of $300 million, subject to a borrowing base. In addition, subject to approval by the applicable lenders and other customary conditions, the New ABL Facility also allows for an increase in commitments of up to an additional $150 million, up from a previous amount of up to $75 million. The New ABL Facility also amended certain terms to reflect Keane’s growth and provide additional flexibility under its covenants.\n“We remain committed to running a conservative balance sheet position that provides us the financial flexibility to capitalize on today’s supportive market conditions,” said Mr. Powell. “This was further evidenced by the successful amendment of our ABL facility completed during the fourth quarter, which enhances our financial flexibility through increased capacity and lower interest costs.”\nStock Repurchase Program\nKeane’s Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $100 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, subject to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, stock market conditions and corporate working capital needs. The duration of the stock buy-back program will be 12 months. The program does not obligate Keane to purchase any particular number of shares of common stock during any period and the program may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company's discretion.\n“2017 was about establishing our track record of execution, and because of our success and continued market momentum, we are now in a position to return additional value to shareholders,” said Greg Powell. “Returning value through the implementation of a repurchase program reflects the confidence we have in our business, including our expectation for further growth and profitability.”\nOutlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018, normalized revenue is expected to increase to approximately $530 million, driven by price increases from contract re-openers on a portion of our portfolio. Normalized annualized Adjusted Gross Profit per fleet is expected to be approximately $18 million for the first quarter of 2018. Normalized expectations exclude transitional factors, including inclement weather experienced early in the first quarter, combined with ongoing frac sand supply challenges. These factors are expected to impact first quarter results by up to approximately $30 million of revenue and between $0.5 million and $2.0 million of annualized Adjusted Gross Profit per fleet. Keane expects to remain at full utilization of 26 hydraulic fracturing fleets.\n“The industry continues to face strain in frac sand supply, driven by weather-induced rail congestion, combined with mine issues due to rail-related output constraints, flooding impacts, delays on local mine start-ups and continued growth in demand,” said Greg Powell. “We are proactively managing these transitory issues facing the entire industry to limit the impact to our customers and business.”\nKeane recently entered into a dedicated agreement with an existing customer for one of the newbuild fleets on order, and expects to deploy the fleet upon delivery by the end of the second quarter of 2018. Keane remains on schedule for the remaining two of its previously ordered newbuild fleets, with one to be delivered and deployed by the end of the second quarter of 2018, and a second by the end of the third quarter of 2018. We remain in advanced discussions with multiple existing and new customers for the remaining two fleets, and expect to execute dedicated agreements by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Keane continues to expect all three newbuilds to initially generate annualized Adjusted Gross Profit per fleet of greater than $20 million.\nWithin the Other Services segment, Keane expects to ramp activity in its cementing business throughout the year, and by the end of 2018, expect to generate run-rate revenue of between $70 and $90 million on margins of between 20% and 25%.\nConference Call\nOn Tuesday, February 27, 2018, Keane will hold a conference call for investors at 7:30 a.m. Central Time (8:30 a.m. Eastern Time) to discuss Keane’s fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results.

Keane's primary service offerings include horizontal and vertical fracturing, wireline perforation and logging, engineered solutions and cementing, as well as other value-added service offerings.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items\nKeane has included both financial measures compiled in accordance with GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit and ratios based on these financial measures. These measurements provide supplemental information which Keane believes is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate its ongoing results of operations, when considered alongside GAAP measures such as net income and operating income. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing Keane’s ongoing operating performance, and thereby facilitate review of Keane’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different capital structures, and comparability to Keane’s results of operations may be impacted by the effects of acquisition accounting on its depreciation and amortization. As a result of the effects of these factors and factors specific to other companies, Keane believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit provide helpful information to analysts and investors to facilitate a comparison of its operating performance to that of other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate the impact of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, along with certain items management does not consider in assessing ongoing performance. Adjusted Gross Profit is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted to eliminate the impact of all activities in the Corporate segment, such as selling, general and administrative expenses, along with cost of services that management does not consider in assessing ongoing performance.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe statements contained in this release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
