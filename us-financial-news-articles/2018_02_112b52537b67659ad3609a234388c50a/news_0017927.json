By doing so, we were able to take out $94 million of full-year operating expense,” Chief Financial Officer Frank Verdecanna told Reuters. \nFireEye, which is transitioning to a software-as-a-service model (SaaS) from its traditional business that centered around the sale of hardware boxes, said the subscription and services business grew 8.5 percent to $164 million. \n“We released cloud versions of pretty much all our spot products - which really has helped drive our product subscription growth,” Verdecanna said. \nTotal revenue rose 9.5 percent to $202.3 million.
