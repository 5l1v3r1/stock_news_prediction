Slideshow (7 Images) \nLast year, the world-renowned contest for purebred canines drew 2,798 competitors. \nThe competition features dogs from 201 breeds and varieties, from muscular French bulldogs to butterfly-eared papillons. \nDogs are divided into seven groups: hounds, toys, nonsporting, herding, working, sporting and terrier. The dogs crowned champion of each of the seven groups then vie for the Best of Show trophy. \nRumor, a female German shepherd, was named Best in Show at last year’s competition.
