Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: kit.rees.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net MISTAKEN FOR A BOND PROXY, NOW AN OPPORTUNITY (1454 GMT) Some interesting thoughts from analysts at Northern Trust Capital Markets, who point to this morning's slightly disappointing PMI readings from France and Germany as suggesting that the data might have peaked \"for a time\". For this reason, they think we could see some rotation, and have been taking a look at some of the recently unloved sectors such as those seen as \"bond proxies\". \"We are on lookout for category error, for stocks perceived as bond proxies that display characteristics not commonly associated with bonds like growth, pricing power and inflation links,\" they say. \"We are looking for names sold for stylistic reasons, not substantive ones.\" So far they have identified road builder Vincim French power utility EDF, as well as business information provider RELX and software firm Sage within the \"quality\" universe. (Kit Rees) DO WORRY ABOUT INFLATION... JUST NOT RIGHT NOW (1330 GMT) Don't waste your time analyzing the \"long overdue\" correction in early February as you might miss the bigger picture, and it's not that grim, says Kevin Gardiner from Rothschild Wealth Management. What we do know, he says, is that the sell-off began with the Feb. 2 U.S. wage data, which hit a market that had notched up 15 monthly gains, and was amplified by bets on volatility-linked products, high frequency and algorithmic trading. \"What we have suggested to our clients is tha0t not only is it (the sell-off) overdue but we must be careful about not overanalyzing what we think is likely to be a short-term movement\", the bank's global investment strategist told us this morning. The point is, at this stage in the cycle inflation may be picking up slightly but it's not about to burst out of the bottle. Yes, he says, central banks are tightening - and that's a good thing - but global synchronised growth is real and it's translating into corporate profits: stocks are not worryingly overvalued and there is no need at this stage to restructure investment portfolios against risk assets. Even if a new scare linked to rising interest rates were to rattle markets again, when the dust settles, there would be buying opportunities and portfolio managers at Rothschild Wealth management have \"shopping lists\" ready, Gardiner said. In the longer term however, it's a very different story, Gardiner says. \"If central banks respond to what they perceive to be a low-growth world ... by keeping monetary policy too lenient for too long, eventually ... they may succeed in reintroducing a bit more inflation in the system, and a bit more than they want\", Gardiner says. \"When inflation does come back, often it comes back in a big way and it gets out of control\", he argues. \"I can find instances when societies have collapsed as a result of inflation ... I can't find instances in which deflation has materialised on its own and triggered the same sort of societal effects. It's an asymmetric game.\" Below, courtesy of the German National Archives, a German banker taking his money to tellers during the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic. (Julien Ponthus) ANGLO AMERICAN, DIA AMONG MOST-SHORTED STOCKS SET TO REPORT (1231 GMT) Talking of earnings, looking at an IHS Markit report of firms which have been shorted the most ahead of earnings a couple of names such as Anglo American, Vallourec, DIA and Ingenico stand out. IHS Markit's analysts say the short interest in Anglo American is due mainly to an arbitrage trade opportunity after Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal issued bonds to fund his 20 percent stake in Anglo American via his family trust Volcan Holdings. Here's IHS Markit's list of the most-shorted European stocks which are due to report this week: (Kit Rees) A Q4 EARNINGS SURPRISE: EUROPE LEAPFROGS THE U.S. (1048 GMT) European equities may be dipping today but earnings forecasts have seen another big upwards revision, bringing the fourth-quarter growth rate expected for the STOXX 600 to 16.9 percent, leapfrogging the 15 percent rise seen for the S&P 500. The forecasts from Thomson Reuters analyst David Aurelio are likely to keep investors upbeat about prospects for European equity markets, as they attempt to stabilise following a turbulent start of the month on jitters over volatility and rising global rates. And there is more: the number of European companies beating earnings expectations has also risen to 53.4 percent, remaining above the 50 percent \"beat\" of a typical quarter, but still lagging the 76 percent beat scored by the S&P 500. In this second snapshot you can see how Europe's tech sector has delivered an impressive 84 percent earnings beat rate, followed by the 70 percent beat for the energy sector. The laggards are telecoms and utilities with just 25 percent. (Danilo Masoni) OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE DIPS (0841 GMT) As indicated by stocks futures, European shares have opened lower, with falls among more defensive-type stocks, and rising U.S. bond yields are weighing on sentiment. A well-received earnings update for Lloyds -- which included a share buyback of up to 1 billion pounds -- is helping to prop up banking stocks. Telecoms are the one sector seeing meaningful gains and Orange revealed some much needed good news on top-line growth. Shares in AA have plunged more than 28 percent after the company cut its dividend and said \"While the dividend cut to 2p frees up some cash, risk reward is too negatively skewed on 'show me later' profits,\" Jefferies analysts said about AA's strategy update. We've got the flash PMI for the Euro zone coming up at 0900 GMT so we'll be watching that along with UK employment data due 0930 GMT. Here's your market snapshot: (Kit Rees) WHAT WE'RE WATCHING AHEAD OF THE OPEN (0752 GMT) European shares are set for a slight pullback this morning with stocks futures trading around 0.2 percent lower, though judging by this week’s trading so far, we could well see a push higher later in the session. Earnings dominate the agenda again. While figures from bank Lloyds missed estimates, investors could cheer its 1 billion-pound share buyback, with the shares seen rising as much as 3 percent. Better times for Orange, which reported its first sales growth in France since 2009, could buoy the telecom sector. AA shares are expected to tumble after the roadside recovery firm said it planned to pay lower dividends. (Kit Rees) EUROPEAN HEADLINES: MORNING ROUND-UP (0738 GMT) Lloyds bank profit rises to record $7.4 billion, but misses estimates Orange's annual sales in France grow for first time since 2009 Glencore says full-year results 'best ever' Temenos agrees 1.4 bln pounds deal to buy British software house Fidessa France's Atos reports organic growth in-line with expectations Maersk Energy sees uptick in offshore oil drilling, profit still squeezed OMV's operating profit benefits from higher crude prices Telefonica Deutschland sees steady 2018, plans dividend increases Volkswagen, German union IG Metall reach wage agreement AA to pay lower dividends AccorHotels' increase in 2017 profits beats expectations Deutsche Boerse posts rise in net profit despite weak markets Eramet eyes expansion in electric vehicle metals UK's Metro Bank reports first annual profit MTU Aero eyes further profit rise in 2018, subject to A320neo FirstGroup sees earnings \"slightly\" lower hit by weather, competition BRIEF-Wolters Kluwer FY adjusted net profit beats Reuters poll BRIEF-UK builder Barratt's half-year pre-tax profit rises 6.8 percent BRIEF-Hotel Chocolat first half revenue and profit up 15 pct​ (Tom Pfeiffer) EUROPEAN STOCKS FUTURES OPEN LOWER (0711 GMT) European share futures have opened slightly lower, pointing to a weaker session in which metals and energy stocks are set to weigh. We could see a repeat of yesterday, when European stocks gradually warmed up from a weak start to end the session higher.
