But the lack of financing had delayed work to restart the idled refinery this year and to convert it into an oil upgrader, Citgo said earlier this week.\n“The Aruba government has contacted American authorities to understand what is going on. The Dutch ambassador in Washington and lawyers in New York are also addressing issues related to the contract with Citgo,” Aruba’s Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes said.\nCitgo in 2016 signed a 25-year lease contract with Aruba to refurbish and operate the idled refinery as part of a $685 million project.\n“Sanctions (against Venezuela) are very firm. That is not something we can change. We are in the middle of this situation between the United States and Venezuela, and I don’t think that can be solved soon,” she added.\nThe facilities are open, but the refinery modernization project has been paused, she said.\nReporting by Sailu Urribarri in Jacksonville, Florida; Written by Marianna Parraga\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:12:29.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
