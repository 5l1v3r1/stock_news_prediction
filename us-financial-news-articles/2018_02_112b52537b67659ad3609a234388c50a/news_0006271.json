Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $29 thousand ($0.01 loss per diluted share), compared to $3.8 million ($0.77 income per diluted share) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nNet operating earnings (Non-GAAP) were $781 thousand and net operating earnings per share were $0.16 (Non-GAAP) for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017; these operating results exclude $2.2 million in after-tax compensation expense associated with the termination of the Company's defined benefit pension plan, $241 thousand in after-tax merger-related costs and $1.2 million in nonrecurring tax expenses related to the Company's reevaluation of its deferred net tax asset due to changes in the federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Company's net operating earnings and net operating earnings per share (Non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter of 2017 represent decreases of $114 thousand, or 12.7%, and $0.02, or 13.8%, respectively, in each case compared to net income and income per share for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nHighlights of the quarter are as follows:\nReturn on average assets (ROA) was (1.19%) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 0.32% in the third quarter of 2017 and 0.39% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net operating ROA (Non-GAAP) was 0. 32% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Total revenues, including net interest income and non-interest income, were $11.1 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $17 thousand from the previous quarter, and an increase of $1.0 million or 9.57% from the same quarter in 2016. Total loans held for investment grew $37.5 million or 21.42% (annualized) from September 30, 2017 and increased $134.7 million or 22.30% from December 31, 2016. Deposits increased $1.1 million or 0.59% (annualized) from September 30, 2017 and decreased $0.9 million or 0.12%, from December 31, 2016. Average deposits increased $11.8 million or 6.12% (annualized), from the prior quarter and increased $9.0 million, or 1.16%, from the same quarter in the prior year. The net interest margin was 3.57% for the fourth quarter, compared to 3.68% in the third quarter of 2017 and 3.65% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-performing assets (NPAs) were $16.1 million at December 31, 2017, up $1.9 million or 13.25% from September 30, 2017 and up $5.0 million or 44.70% from December 31, 2016. Non-accrual loans were $12.9 million at December 31, 2017, up from $10.2 million at September 30, 2017 and up from $7.2 million at December 31, 2016. On October 30, 2017 Old Point announced that it entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Old Point will acquire Citizens National Bank (Citizens National) based in Windsor, Virginia in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $7.9 million at signing. This transaction is still subject to regulatory approvals and approval of Citizens National's stockholders and is expected to close in the second quarter.\nRobert Shuford, Jr., President and CEO of Old Point National Bank said, \"The fourth quarter was a continuation of improvement in core operating metrics that were offset in large part by elevated provisioning expense associated with both strong loan growth and problem credit resolutions. The previously disclosed pension adjustment was anticipated and will result in favorable run rate operating expense in the future. Similarly, while the nonrecurring write-down of our deferred tax asset impacted the quarter, the reduction in corporate tax rates associated with the Tax Act should benefit our Company in the future.\nAs we reflect back on the year, we were successful in building some foundation for future success. We added talent to our management team, leveraged our balance sheet and loan portfolio, liquidated our long standing pension plan, acquired a 100% interest in our mortgage company and merged its operations into our Bank, initiated an insurance line of business, announced our first whole bank acquisition and implemented a number of product and business line enhancements for our customer base. We are excited to be adding Citizens National Bank to our Company in the second quarter, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. Our teams are already working on integration plans.\"\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net interest income was $7.7 million, a decrease of $66 thousand or 0.85% from the third quarter of 2017, and an increase of $0.7 million or 10.29% from the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in net interest income relative to the prior quarter was the result of a reduction in average loan yield and an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities which was partially offset by higher average earning asset balances. The year-over-year increase in net interest income was driven by higher earning asset balances and a shift in the portfolio mix from lower-yielding securities to higher-yielding loans. The fourth quarter tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased 11 basis points to 3.57% from 3.68% in the previous quarter, and decreased 8 basis points from 3.65% during the same period in the prior year. The decline in the tax-equivalent net interest margin when comparing the fourth quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2017 was due to a decrease in the yield on average earning assets as well as an increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. The margin contraction when comparing the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 was caused by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities partially offset by an increase in the yield on earning assets.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net interest income was $29.9 million, an increase of $2.7 million or 9.79% compared to same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased interest and fees on loans associated with loan growth.\nASSET QUALITY\nNon-performing assets (NPAs) were $16.1 million at December 31, 2017, up from $14.2 million at September 30, 2017 and $11.1 million at December 31, 2016. NPAs as a percentage of assets increased to 1.64% from 1.49% at September 30, 2017 and 1.23% at December 31, 2016. There was one large commercial credit relationship of $1.5 million added during the fourth quarter that, while continuing to perform under a forbearance agreement, experienced some deterioration in collateral value requiring a valuation adjustment and charge-off during the period. As of December 31, 2017, there are four commercial credit relationships in nonaccrual totaling $9.0 million or approximately 69.73% of total nonaccrual loans. Old Point continues to have no other real estate owned as of December 31, 2017.\nTotal loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing interest were $3.2 million as of December 31, 2017, of which $2.3 million were government-guaranteed student loans. Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing interest totaled $2.9 million as of December 31, 2016, of which $2.6 million were government-guaranteed student loans. Of the loans past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2017, approximately $471 thousand is guaranteed by the SBA.\nThe Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) was $9.4 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $9.0 million at September 30, 2017 and $8.2 million at December 31, 2016. Net loans charged off during the quarter totaled $738 thousand, compared to $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $165 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2016. On an annualized basis, net charge-offs as a percent of average total loans were 0.41% for the fourth quarter of 2017, 0.59% for the third quarter of 2017, and 0.11% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loans charged off for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $3.0 million, or 0.44% of average total loans, which compares to net charge offs of $1.4 million, or 0.24% of average total loans for the year ended December 31, 2016. The ALLL as a percentage of loans receivable was 1.28% at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.28% at September 30, 2017 and 1.37% at December 31, 2016.\nNONINTEREST INCOME\nNoninterest income was $3.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $83 thousand or 2.47% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of $256 thousand or 8.03% from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase compared to the prior quarter can be attributed to increases in revenue from Old Point Mortgage, increases in service charges on deposit accounts, and higher revenues from the Trust Company. The increase compared to the same period in 2016 can be attributed to the same line item increases.\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\nTotal noninterest expense was $12.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up $3.7 million or 41.00% from $9.1 million for the third quarter, and up $4.3 million or 50.06% from the fourth quarter in 2016. The largest component of the increases can be attributed to salaries and employee benefits, which includes a nonrecurring charge of $3.3 million associated with the termination and settlement of the Company's defined benefit pension plan recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Another component of the increase was an additional $208 thousand of salary and benefit expense associated with Old Point Mortgage, the operations of which were merged into Old Point National Bank during the fourth quarter. The increase in other outside service fees compared to 2016 is associated with processing costs involving the Company's indirect auto lending program initiated in late 2016. Legal expenses increased during the period associated with various executive compensation and board related governance activities during the period. Accounting fees increased in the fourth quarter as the Company has reached accelerated filer status and with increased testing required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Lastly, the Company incurred $241 thousand in nonrecurring merger costs associated with the Citizens National acquisition during the fourth quarter.\nBALANCE SHEET\nAt December 31, 2017, total assets were $982.3 million, an increase of $27.8 million from September 30, 2017 and an increase of $79.4 million from December 31, 2016; these increases were both primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio and borrowing activity to fund the growth. At December 31, 2017, loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs) were $738.5 million, an increase of $37.5 million or 21.42% (annualized) from September 30, 2017 and $134.7 million or 22.30% from December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, total deposits were $783.6 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 0.59% annualized from September 30, 2017 and a decrease of $0.9 million or 0.12% from December 31, 2016.\nThe Company's capital ratios were as follows:\nDec.31, 2017\nSept. 30, 2017\nDec. 31, 2016\nCommon equity to total assets\n9.91%\n10.51%\n10.88%\nTangible common equity to tangible assets\n9.85%\n10.45%\n10.88%\nLeverage ratio\n9.98%\n10.47%\n10.68%\nTotal risk based capital\n12.28%\n13.16%\n14.51%\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $0.11 per common share, consistent with the prior quarter and an increase of $0.01, or 10%, compared to the same quarter in the prior year.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures – In addition to the Company's results presented in accordance with GAAP, this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures including net operating earnings, operating earnings per share, and operating ROA.
