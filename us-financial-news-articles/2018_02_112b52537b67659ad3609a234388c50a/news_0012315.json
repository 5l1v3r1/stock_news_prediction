Average revenue per user also climbed, increasing 13.9 percent to 21.9 reais. \nTIM’s campaign to focus on high-end products has been accompanied by a drive to maintain cost discipline. The company said total costs ticked up 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter from the year before. $1 = 3.26 reais Reporting by Gram Slattery, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T01:38:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
