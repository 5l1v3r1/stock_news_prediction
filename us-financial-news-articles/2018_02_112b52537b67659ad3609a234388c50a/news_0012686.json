(“GAMCO”) (NYSE:GBL) today reported fourth quarter 2017 revenues of $98.7 million, net income of $13.5 million, and earnings of $0.46 per diluted share. This compares to fourth quarter 2016 revenues of $100.0 million, net income of $32.7 million, and earnings of $1.07 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2017 net income was $23.1 million, and earnings were $0.78 per diluted share versus fourth quarter 2016 net income of $23.6 million and earnings of $0.78 per diluted share. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures and are explained and reconciled with the most comparable GAAP numbers starting on page 11.\nOur fourth quarter 2017 AUM was up 7.8% from the prior year and unchanged from $43.1 billion at September 30, 2017. Market appreciation of $1.2 billion was offset by net outflows of $1.1 billion and distributions, net of reinvestments, of $0.1 billion.\nAverage AUM was $43.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $42.3 billion for the third quarter of 2017 and $39.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company entered into deferred compensation agreements for the Chief Executive Officer for three distinct periods: 2016 (entire year); the first half of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017. These agreements provided the Company with increased flexibility to pay down debt related to the spin-off of Associated Capital in November 2015. The deferred compensation expense is recognized ratably over its vesting period, resulting in a $12.7 million increase in compensation expense and management fee year-over-year. The Company also incurred expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 relating to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, net, related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) ($8.2 million), early extinguishment of the $110 million 4.5% convertible note ($3.3 million) and the accelerated vesting of RSAs ($1.3 million).\nThis contributed to lowering operating income to $39.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the $52.0 million in the year-ago quarter.\nFinancial Highlights Fourth Quarter YTD ($'s in 000's except AUM and per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 AUM - end of period (in millions) $ 43,063 $ 39,954 (a) $ 43,063 $ 39,954 (a) AUM - average (in millions) 42,965 39,328 42,016 38,878 GAAP Revenues $ 89,613 $ 84,650 $ 351,382 $ 337,579 Incentive fees 9,053 15,300 9,142 15,421 Total revenues $ 98,666 $ 99,950 $ 360,524 $ 353,000 Operating income 39,524 52,031 145,020 191,796 Income before income taxes 34,886 50,569 132,888 182,227 Effective tax rate 61.3 % 35.4 % 41.4 % 35.7 % Net income 13,495 32,692 77,809 117,121 Net income per fully diluted share $ 0.46 $ 1.07 $ 2.60 $ 3.92 Non-GAAP Operating income $ 42,667 $ 41,455 $ 158,949 $ 153,218 Adjusted income before income taxes 37,197 35,995 136,314 129,285 Adjusted effective tax rate 37.8 % 34.5 % 37.8 % 37.0 % Adjusted net income 23,147 23,583 84,811 81,399 Adjusted net income per fully diluted share $ 0.78 $ 0.78 $ 2.82 $ 2.74 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 30,336 31,241 30,947 30,170 Shares outstanding at December 31 28,974 29,463 28,974 29,463 See the reconciliation to the comparable U.S. GAAP measures starting on page 11. (a) Adjusted to include $270 million of Merger Arbitrage assets at December 31, 2016. Revenues\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $98.7 million compared with $100.0 million in the prior year. Investment advisory fees, excluding incentive fees, rose to $78.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $73.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 highlighted by revenues from our open-end and closed-end funds of $51.1 million, an increase from $47.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounted for $26.2 million of the revenues in 2017 compared to $25.3 million in 2016. SICAV revenues accelerated to $1.4 million in 2017 from $0.7 million in 2016. Incentive fees earned were $9.1 million and $15.3 million during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Distribution fees from our open-end equity funds and other income were $10.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $11.1 million in the prior-year quarter.\nOperating Income\nAs noted, there were several distinct items in both quarters that impacted our results. Operating income before management fee was $39.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $52.0 million in the prior-year period. The cash compensation deferrals raised operating costs by $12.7 million, comprised of the absence of the $14.6 million expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 coupled with a $1.9 million expense reduction in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company also recorded $1.3 million of compensation expense for the acceleration of most of the RSAs outstanding. Excluding these items adjusted operating income before management fee was $38.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $37.5 million in the year-ago quarter.\nOther expense\nWe recognized $4.6 million in net other expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus net other expenses of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we repurchased the $110 million convertible note at $103, resulting in a $3.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we also made $0.3 million of charitable contributions. Interest expense decreased by $1.0 million year-over-year, reflecting a reduction in outstanding debt to $89.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $234.0 million at December 31, 2016. Investment income for 2017 was $0.8 million vs. $1.5 million in 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company’s effective tax rate (“ETR”) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 61.3% versus 35.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The Act that was enacted in December 2017 resulted in an $8.2 million, or $0.27 per fully diluted share, write down of net deferred tax assets. Absent this change the effective rate for the quarter would have been 37.8%.\nIncluded in the fourth quarter 2017 income tax expense relating to the Act enacted in the United States in December 2017 were the following:\n$10.7 million tax expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets; $2.5 million non-cash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities\nThese amounts, which are based on reasonable estimates, may require further adjustments as additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury is provided, as changes in GAMCO’s assumptions occur, and as further information and interpretations become available.\nIn addition, the fourth quarter income tax expense included a $0.5 million discrete tax expense related to the acceleration of stock-based compensation awards.\nWe previously disclosed an estimated ETR for 2018 of between 33% and 36%. We now expect the 2018 ETR to be lower than that range, but we continue to evaluate the impact of the Act’s provisions.\nBalance Sheet\nGAMCO made substantial progress in reducing its debt since the November 2015 spin-off of Associated Capital Group, Inc. from $357 million to $89.1 million as of December 31, 2017. As a result, Standard & Poor’s recently revised its outlook to stable from negative and reaffirmed our debt rating at BBB-.\nDuring the quarter, we fully extinguished the $110 million 4.5% convertible note and prepaid $20 million of the amount outstanding on the 4% PIK note.\nTotal deferred compensation payable at December 31, 2017 was $120.5 million, of which $61.5 million is included in the GAAP balance sheet and $59.0 million of which will be recorded in 2018 and 2019, ratably over the vesting periods of each of the three deferral agreements, in accordance with GAAP.\nWe ended the quarter with cash of $17.8 million, investments of $36.8 million, and gross debt of $89.1 million. We have $500 million available on our universal shelf registration. Together with earnings from operations, the shelf provides us with flexibility to pay down debt, do acquisitions, perform lift-outs, seed new investment strategies, and co-invest, as well as to fund shareholder compensation, including share repurchases and dividends.\nDeferred Compensation\nGAMCO entered into a third agreement with its Chief Executive Officer on September 30, 2017, which deferred his cash compensation for the fourth quarter of 2017 until April 2019 under similar terms to the prior two deferrals.\nTotal deferred compensation payable at December 31, 2017 was $120.5 million, of which $61.5 million is included in the GAAP balance sheet and $59.0 million of which will be recorded in 2018 and 2019, ratably over the vesting periods of each of the three deferral agreements, in accordance with GAAP.\nReturns to Shareholder\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 194,226 shares at an average price of $29.33 per share for a total investment of $5.7 million. We also distributed $0.6 million in dividends. Since our IPO in February 1999, we have returned $1.9 billion in total to shareholders consisting of $1.0 billion of spin-offs, $491.0 million in the form of dividends, and $453.1 million through stock buybacks of approximately 10.4 million shares.\nOn February 6, 2018, GAMCO’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share payable on March 27, 2018 to its Class A and Class B shareholders of record on March 13, 2018.\nBusiness Highlights\nOn October 26, 2017, the GAMCO Natural Resources, Gold & Income Trust completed its offering of $30 million of 5.2% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock. The preferred stock is perpetual, non-callable for five years, and was issued at $25 per share. During December 2017, the Company completed two rights offerings for two of its closed-end funds, The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. and The Gabelli Global Small and Mid Cap Value Trust, which raised a combined $203 million. Both offerings were heavily oversubscribed. We will be launching our third exchange traded managed fund, the Gabelli RBI TM NextShares TM Trust (the “Fund”). The Fund will invest primarily in equity securities, such as common stock of domestic and foreign services and equipment companies focused on physical asset development, including roads, bridges, and infrastructure (“RBI”).\nSubsequent Event\nAs previously disclosed, on February 1, 2018, our affiliate, Associated Capital Group, Inc. (“AC”), commenced an exchange offer for up to one million shares of its Class A shares. Tendering shareholders will receive 1.35 GAMCO Class A shares that AC holds in exchange for each share of AC tendered. The exchange offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 5, 2018, unless earlier extended or terminated. This AC exchange offer has no impact on the number of issued and outstanding GAMCO shares.\nAbout GAMCO Investors, Inc.\nGAMCO Investors, Inc., through its subsidiaries, manages open-end funds and closed-end funds (Gabelli Funds, LLC) and private advisory accounts (GAMCO Asset Management Inc.).\nDecember 31, December 31, 2017 2016 Equities: Open-end Funds $ 13,747 $ 13,462 Closed-end Funds 8,053 7,150 Institutional & PWM - direct (a) 13,420 13,441 Institutional & PWM - sub-advisory 5,432 3,783 SICAV 510 320 (b) Total Equities 41,162 38,156 Fixed Income: Money-Market Fund 1,870 1,767 Institutional & PWM 31 31 Total Fixed Income 1,901 1,798 Total Assets Under Management $ 43,063 $ 39,954 (a)\nIncludes $261 million and $290 million of Money Market Fund AUM at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(b)\nAdjusted to include $270 million of Merger Arbitrage assets.\nThe Company reported Assets Under Management as follows (in millions):\nTable I: Fund Flows - 4th Quarter 2017 Fund Market distributions, September 30, appreciation/ Net cash net of December 31, 2017 (depreciation) flows reinvestments 2017 Equities: Open-end Funds $ 13,762 $ 278 $ (255 ) $ (38 ) $ 13,747 Closed-end Funds 7,668 282 230 (127 ) 8,053 Institutional & PWM - direct 13,893 523 (996 ) - 13,420 Institutional & PWM - sub-advisory 5,346 139 (53 ) - 5,432 SICAV (a) 504 12 (6 ) - 510 Total Equities 41,173 1,234 (1,080 ) (165 ) 41,162 Fixed Income: Money-Market Fund 1,890 5 (25 ) - 1,870 Institutional & PWM 26 - 5 - 31 Total Fixed Income 1,916 5 (20 ) - 1,901 Total Assets Under Management $ 43,089 $ 1,239 $ (1,100 ) $ (165 ) $ 43,063 Table II: Fund Flows - Full Year 2017 Fund Market distributions, December 31, appreciation/ Net cash net of December 31, 2016 (depreciation) flows reinvestments 2017 Equities: Open-end Funds $ 13,462 $ 1,632 $ (1,264 ) $ (83 ) $ 13,747 Closed-end Funds 7,150 994 392 (483 ) 8,053 Institutional & PWM - direct 13,441 2,046 (2,067 ) - 13,420 Institutional & PWM - sub-advisory 3,783 661 988 (b) - 5,432 SICAV (a) 320 41 149 - 510 Total Equities 38,156 5,374 (1,802 ) (566 ) 41,162 Fixed Income: Money-Market Fund 1,767 14 89 - 1,870 Institutional & PWM 31 - - - 31 Total Fixed Income 1,798 14 89 - 1,901 Total Assets Under Management $ 39,954 $ 5,388 $ (1,713 ) $ (566 ) $ 43,063 (a)\nAdjusted to include $270 million of Merger Arbitrage assets at December 31, 2016.\n(b)\nIncludes $1.2 billion from being approved as the sub-advisor on two sub-advisory entities as of February 27, 2017.\nTable III GAMCO INVESTORS, INC.

Non-GAAP information and reconciliation:\nGAMCO’s non-GAAP measures include adjusted income before taxes, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per fully diluted share. GAMCO’s calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures.\nThese non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods to understand operating performance without regard to items that we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. For these reasons we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.\nAdjusted income before taxes, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per fully diluted share can be used by investors to review our results on a consistent basis. Examples of adjustments to these measures include the GAAP impact of the 2016 Deferred Cash Compensation Agreement (“DCCA”), First Half 2017 DCCA, and the Fourth Quarter 2017 DCCA that were put in place to enable the Company to more quickly pay down its debt, the acceleration of outstanding RSAs, charitable contributions, closed-end fund launch expenses, extinguishment of debt, and the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nThe following tables reconcile adjusted income before taxes, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share to their closest GAAP equivalent:\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 Reported Fourth Quarter First Half RSA GAAP 2017 DCCA 2017 DCCA 2016 DCCA Acceleration Other Adjusted Total revenues $ 98,666 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 98,666 Compensation costs 36,536 10,318 (4,771 ) (3,148 ) (1,331 ) - 37,604 Distribution costs 11,074 - - - - 11,074 Other operating expenses 7,321 - - - - - 7,321 Total expenses 54,931 10,318 (4,771 ) (3,148 ) (1,331 ) - 55,999 Operating income before management fee 43,735 (10,318 ) 4,771 3,148 1,331 - 42,667 Other expense, net (4,638 ) - - - - 3,300 (1,338 ) Income before management fee and income taxes 39,097 (10,318 ) 4,771 3,148 1,331 3,300 41,329 Management fee expense 4,211 1,064 (891 ) (715 ) 133 330 4,132 Income before income taxes 34,886 (11,382 ) 5,662 3,863 1,198 2,970 37,197 Income tax expense 21,391 (4,325 ) 2,152 1,468 455 (7,091 ) 14,050 Net income attributable to GAMCO Investors, Inc. $ 13,495 $ (7,057 ) $ 3,510 $ 2,395 $ 743 $ 10,061 $ 23,147 Net income per share attributable to GAMCO Investors, Inc.: Basic $ 0.46 $ (0.24 ) $ 0.12 $ 0.08 $ 0.03 $ 0.35 $ 0.80 Diluted $ 0.46 $ (0.23 ) $ 0.12 $ 0.08 $ 0.02 $ 0.33 $ 0.78 For the three months ended December 31, 2016 Reported GAAP 2016 DCCA Adjusted Total revenues $ 99,950 $ - $ 99,950 Compensation costs 24,442 13,718 38,160 Distribution costs 11,403 - 11,403 Other operating expenses 8,932 - 8,932 Total expenses 44,777 13,718 58,495 Operating income before management fee 55,173 (13,718 ) 41,455 Other expense, net (1,462 ) - (1,462 ) Income before management fee and income taxes 53,711 (13,718 ) 39,993 Management fee expense 3,142 856 3,998 Income before income taxes 50,569 (14,574 ) 35,995 Income tax expense 17,877 (5,465 ) 12,412 Net income attributable to GAMCO Investors, Inc. $ 32,692 $ (9,109 ) $ 23,583 Net income per share attributable to GAMCO Investors, Inc.: Basic $ 1.12 $ (0.31 ) $ 0.81 Diluted $ 1.07 $ (0.27 ) $ 0.78 For the year ended December 31, 2017 Reported Fourth Quarter First Half RSA GAAP 2017 DCCA 2017 DCCA 2016 DCCA Acceleration Other Adjusted Total revenues $ 360,524 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 360,524 Compensation costs 134,170 10,318 9,619 (12,322 ) (6,810 ) - 134,975 Distribution costs 44,447 - - - - (1,068 ) 43,379 Other operating expenses 23,221 - - - - - 23,221 Total expenses 201,838 10,318 9,619 (12,322 ) (6,810 ) (1,068 ) 201,575 Operating income before management fee 158,686 (10,318 ) (9,619 ) 12,322 6,810 1,068 158,949 Other expense, net (12,132 ) - - - - 4,336 (7,796 ) Income before management fee and income taxes 146,554 (10,318 ) (9,619 ) 12,322 6,810 5,404 151,153 Management fee expense 13,666 1,064 1,775 (2,887 ) 681 540 14,839 Income before income taxes 132,888 (11,382 ) (11,394 ) 15,209 6,129 4,864 136,314 Income tax expense 55,079 (4,325 ) (4,442 ) 5,818 1,376 (2,003 ) 51,503 Net income attributable to GAMCO Investors, Inc. $ 77,809 $ (7,057 ) $ (6,952 ) $ 9,391 $ 4,753 $ 6,867 $ 84,811 Net income per share attributable to GAMCO Investors, Inc.: Basic $ 2.68 $ (0.24 ) $ (0.24 ) $ 0.32 $ 0.16 $ 0.24 $ 2.93 Diluted $ 2.60 $ (0.23 ) $ (0.22 ) $ 0.30 $ 0.15 $ 0.22 $ 2.82 For the year ended December 31, 2016 Reported GAAP 2016 DCCA Other Adjusted Total revenues $ 353,000 $ - $ - $ 353,000 Compensation costs 86,572 45,734 - 132,306 Distribution costs 44,189 - (638 ) 43,551 Other operating expenses 23,925 - - 23,925 Total expenses 154,686 45,734 (638 ) 199,782 Operating income before management fee 198,314 (45,734 ) 638 153,218 Other expense, net (9,569 ) - - (9,569 ) Income before management fee and income taxes 188,745 (45,734 ) 638 143,649 Management fee expense 6,518 7,782 64 14,364 Income before income taxes 182,227 (53,516 ) 574 129,285 Income tax expense 65,106 (20,069 ) 2,849 47,886 Net income attributable to GAMCO Investors, Inc. $ 117,121 $ (33,447 ) $ (2,275 ) $ 81,399 Net income per share attributable to GAMCO Investors, Inc.: Basic $ 4.01 $ (1.15 ) $ (0.08 ) $ 2.79 Diluted $ 3.92 $ (1.07 ) $ (0.08 ) $ 2.74 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThe financial results set forth in this press release are preliminary. Our disclosure and analysis in this press release, which do not present historical information, contain “ ” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements convey our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” and other words and terms of similar meaning. They also appear in any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance of our products, expenses, the outcome of any legal proceedings, and financial results. Although we believe that we are basing our expectations and beliefs on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of what we currently know about our business and operations, the economy, the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and other conditions, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not what we expect or believe. Therefore, you should proceed with caution in relying on any of these . They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.\nForward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that are difficult to predict and could cause actual results and outcomes to any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such . Some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations or beliefs include a decline in the securities markets that adversely affect our assets under management, negative performance of our products, the failure to perform as required under our investment management agreements, a general downturn in the economy that negatively impacts our operations, and the ongoing impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with respect to tax rates and the non-deductibility of certain portions of NEO compensation. We also direct your attention to the more specific discussions of these and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors contained in our Form 10-K and other public filings. Other factors that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We do not undertake to update publicly any if we subsequently learn that we are unlikely to achieve our expectations whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180206006432/en/\nGAMCO Investors, Inc.\nKieran Caterina or Diane M.
