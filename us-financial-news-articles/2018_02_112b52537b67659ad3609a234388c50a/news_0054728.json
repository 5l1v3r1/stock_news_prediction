Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 26 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nHPE's newly appointed chief executive, Antonio Neri, said the company plans to return $7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends by the end of fiscal 2019 due to the recent U.S. tax reform.\nThe plan includes a 50 percent increase in dividend starting from the third quarter, Neri said in a statement.\n\"My commitment to shareholders is to deliver transparency, predictability and consistency,\" Neri told Reuters in a phone call on Thursday.\nNeri recently replaced Meg Whitman, who surprised Wall Street last quarter by stepping down as CEO after transforming HPE into a company that focuses on areas such as networking, storage and technology services.\nWe would not be here if it was not for Megs leadership in the last six-and-a-half years. She put us on a great path, Neri said.
