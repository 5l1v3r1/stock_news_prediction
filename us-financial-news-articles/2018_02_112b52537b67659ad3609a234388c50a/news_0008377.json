Liberty Global was up 5 percent in New York to a more than two-year high. \nLiberty Global noted Vodafone’s statement and had no further comment, a spokesman said. \nThe world’s second biggest mobile operator and the cable company discussed swapping assets in 2015, but they could not reach agreement on values. \nThe two, however, did agree to form a joint venture in the Netherlands. \nGermany is by far the biggest continental market where they are both major broadband providers, and Vodafone is the second biggest mobile operator there after Deutsche Telekom. \nThey also have overlapping operations in Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania in continental Europe, as well as in Britain and Ireland.
