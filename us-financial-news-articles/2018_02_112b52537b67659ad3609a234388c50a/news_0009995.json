The second-year standout made his free throw, and when Clarkson converted the technical shot, Los Angeles had its biggest lead of the game to that point, 102-92.\nConsecutive hoops by Russell Westbrook and George in the final 64 seconds closed the gap to six, but George missed a shot after a steal and Westbrook committed a turnover following an offensive rebound, stalling the Thunder rally.\nBrook Lopez, who connected on four of his team’s 13 3-pointers, scored 20 points to lead six players in double figures for the Lakers, who completed a 3-2 trip with the 10th win in their last 14 games.\nJulius Randle (19), Clarkson (18), Ingram (16), Josh Hart (14) and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (13) also scored in double figures for the Lakers. Hart had a team-high 11 rebounds to complete a double-double.\nWestbrook had a game-high 36 points for the Thunder, who lost their fourth straight after having won their previous eight in a row. He made 15 of his 25 shots, but failed on all four of his 3-point attempts.\nWestbrook also had a game-high nine assists.\nGeorge (26), Steven Adams (12) and Carmelo Anthony (10) also scored in double figures for Oklahoma City. Anthony completed a double-double with a game-high 13 rebounds, while backup Jerami Grant had 10 to go with nine points.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T15:19:10.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
