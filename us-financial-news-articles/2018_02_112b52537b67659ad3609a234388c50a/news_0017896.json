But the research firm said the region is expected to be \"the driving force behind long term growth in global defense spending.\" \nJapan , for one, approved the country's largest annual defense budget in December. China and India also increased military spending. \nNorth Korea fired 23 missiles in 16 tests in 2017 â€” adding to tensions in a region that's already plagued by territorial disputes in the South China Sea and clashes over the China-India border. \nEdwards said demand for the company's F-35 fighter jets has been \"very strong\" in the region, with deliveries of those planes to Australia , South Korea and Japan . \nHe added he expects other Asian countries, such as Singapore , to make a decision soon on whether to purchase F-35 jets.
