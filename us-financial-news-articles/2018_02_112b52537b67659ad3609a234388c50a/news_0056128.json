For the people, it’s exciting to watch. Most of the time we are (racing) for ourselves, that’s why it’s really special to compete as a team,” Denise Feierabend of Switzerland told reporters.\nJudging by the response of the skiers themselves and the crowd at the Yongpyong Alpine Centre, there was enough drama to make up for the absence of slalom specialists like American Mikaela Shiffrin and Austria’s Marcel Hirscher, who decided to call it a day after their individual events in Pyeongchang.\n“It’s a cool event, to race against another guy in one run,” said Marco Schwarz of Austria. “I think they missed something,” he said of the absentees.\nFeb 23, 2018; Pyeongchang, South Korea; Megan McJames (USA) competes in the mixed team 1/8 final during the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Yongpyong Alpine Centre. Mandatory Credit: Soobum Im-USA TODAY Sports For Clement Noel of France, who were edged out of bronze medal position by Norway, ”it was a super event, it was a great ambiance and a great course and crowd.\n“All the (Winter Olympic) disciplines have team events - biathlon, cross-country and so on - and I think this kind of team race is fun to have for the spectators, and fun for us to do.”\nWinners and losers alike said they hoped the experiment would be repeated in Beijing in four years’ time, and there is even talk of a parallel individual event.\n“It’s new, and we’re still working out the kinks, but both elements - of racing someone head-on-head and being able to train and race with the boys - are super-fun and so I‘m happy to be here,” said Megan McJames of the United States, who were unexpectedly knocked out in the first round by Great Britain.\nBritain’s Dave Ryding was quick to squash the suggestion he might have found it frustrating that the Americans had put out a less than full-strength team on the women’s side.\n“It’s absolutely great for us. Shame on them for not doing it. I mean we stepped up, we put out our strength, we took it seriously. Even if they had Shiffrin we could still have done it,” he said.\nReporting by Mark Trevelyan,; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T19:58:41.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
