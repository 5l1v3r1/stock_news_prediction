Bennell was charged in November 2016 after prosecutors received a file of evidence from Cheshire Police. In testimony, several victims estimated Bennell had sexually abused them on more than 100 occasions. Bennell had been previously convicted three times of child abuse. He received jail sentences in the UK and in the US in 1995, 1998 and 2015. Allegations of child sex abuse in English soccer from the 1970s through to the 1990s have shocked Britain and led to deep soul-searching in the game amid fears hundreds of young boys might have been involved.
