In January, he was taken to the hospital for a sharp drop in blood pressure and irregular heartbeat and in September he underwent emergency surgery to install a pacemaker, his family has said.\nNamazi was granted a four-day medical leave on Jan. 28, which was extended until Feb. 4.\nAfter examining Namazi, the Iranian government’s medical examiner recommended he be granted a three-month leave from prison on medical grounds. The medical examiner’s recommendation was communicated to the Namazi family by phone, Genser said.\nBut instead of being granted the leave, Namazi was told on Tuesday to report back to Evin Prison in Tehran, the lawyer said.\nThe Namazi family released a statement by Baquer Namazi thanking his friends and UNICEF colleagues for their support.\n“Despite the pain inflicted upon my family and myself, I have not lost hope and continue to pray for the great humanitarian causes for which we have all dedicated our lives,” Baquer Namazi said in the statement.\nNamazi’s son, Siamak, an Iranian-American businessman in his mid-40s, was arrested by Iranian security forces in October 2015. Iranian authorities detained Baquer Namazi a few months later when he tried to visit his son. Both are in Evin prison and have denied the charges against them.\nSiamak Namazi has been physically tortured in prison, including being shocked with a stun gun, Babak Namazi said.\nBabak Namazi called in a statement for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to “spare no efforts” to bring his brother and father home.\nReporting by Yeganeh Torbati, writing by Makini Brice; editing by Cynthia Osterman and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T19:38:24.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
