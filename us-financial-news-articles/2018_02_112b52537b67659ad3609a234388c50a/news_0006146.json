REUTERS/David Gray Their deployment on a large scale would also involve high economic costs and have major impacts on terrestrial or marine ecosystems, the EASAC said in a report.\n“Technologies capable of taking out CO2 from the atmosphere are certainly no silver bullet - a point that should drive policymakers to renewed efforts to accelerate emissions reductions,” the report said.\nHowever, the world will need all possible tools to limit warming and some of these technologies can make contributions to remove CO2 from the atmosphere even now, while further research, development and demonstration may allow others to make a limited future contribution,” it added.\nCommenting on the report, Andrew Watson, Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Exeter said that while some technologies for removing CO2 from the atmosphere could have a role to play in reducing climate change, all have drawbacks making them difficult to use them on a large scale.\n“So our main focus and best hope for avoiding the worst effects of climate change still needs to be reducing our emissions,” he added.\nLast week, a leaked draft U.N. report said there is a high chance that the levels of CO2 removal which might be required to meet the Paris goals might not be feasible due to the required scale and speed of technology deployment.\nEditing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T01:27:46.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
