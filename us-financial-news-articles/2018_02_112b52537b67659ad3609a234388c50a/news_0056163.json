I am sure his expertise, experience and network will prove invaluable in this key commercial moment for the Helsinn Group.\n\"I would also like to express my gratitude to William Mann for his leadership in establishing Helsinn Therapeutics, successfully transforming it from a small R&D-focused entity in 2009 into a commercial company with over 100 employees that became profitable in 2016, and we wish him the very best for the future.\"\nPaul Rittman, Chief Executive Officer of Helsinn Therapeutics, commented: \"I have always been impressed with Helsinn's core values of quality, integrity and respect and so I am delighted to be joining at this time.
