He declined to give a timeframe. \nLenovo plans to open 1,000 new retail shops in China over three years to sell a wide range of products from the Lenovo ecosystem, Yang said. \nIt will also launch more high-end PCs and smart devices such as its Mirage Solo virtual reality headset with Google’s Daydream technology that recently debuted at the CES trade show. \nShares of Lenovo, a unit of Legend Holdings ( 3396.HK ), dropped as much as 3 percent in morning trade against a 0.44 percent decline for the benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI .
