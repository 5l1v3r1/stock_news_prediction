Tyson led the Pirates with 24 points while Shawn Williams and Isaac Fleming added 14 and 13 points, respectfully. East Carolina (10-17, 4-12) suffered its second straight blowout defeat, but this game is one that will be hard to forget.\nThe contest was effectively over almost as soon as it began. Trailing 3-2 just 2:37 into the contest, Houston scored 30 of the next 32 points in building a 32-5 lead.\nAnd the pain was just beginning for East Carolina, which trailed by 30 points after a layup by the Cougars’ Breaon Brady with 9:59 to play in the half, by 41 when Gray pumped in a 3-pointer with 3:23 remaining and by 49 points, 62-13, at halftime.\nHouston outshot the Pirates 74.2 percent to 21.7 percent in the first half as the Cougars made as many shots (23) as East Carolina attempted in the first 20 minutes. Houston converted 12 of its 16 3-pointers in the first half, outrebounded the Pirates 22-6 and recorded 18-1 dominance in assists.\nBrooks led Houston with 18 points in the half while Gray had 17 by making all five of his shots from the floor (including all three 3-point attempts) and each of his four free throws. Gary also had 10 assists at intermission.\nTyson’s five points led the Pirates at the break.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T17:00:04.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
