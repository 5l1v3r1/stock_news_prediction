For the year, EQM net income totaled $571.9 million, adjusted EBITDA was $689.5 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $650.6 million, and distributable cash flow was $614.8 million. EQM operating income in 2017 was $580.7 million. For the fourth quarter, EQM net income totaled $146.6 million, adjusted EBITDA was $185.1 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $170.3 million, and distributable cash flow was $159.2 million. EQM operating income in the fourth quarter 2017 was $149.0 million. The Non-GAAP Disclosures section of this news release provides reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nEQT GP Holdings, LP (NYSE: EQGP) today announced net income attributable to EQGP of $262.0 million for 2017 and $70.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017.\nEQM 2017 Highlights:\nIncreased EQM per unit distribution by 20% year-over-year Maintained a 1.34x coverage ratio for the year Generated 91% of operating revenue from firm reservation fees Received FERC Certificate for Mountain Valley Pipeline in October Placed the final phase of the header pipeline for Range Resources in-service in May Added Hammerhead pipeline to organic project backlog\nEQM fourth quarter 2017 operating income was 18% higher compared to 2016, after excluding a $10.5 million non-cash charge to depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter. The non-cash charge related to a revaluation of differences between regulatory and tax bases in property, plant, and equipment. Operating revenue increased $29.5 million, or 15%, compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher contracted firm transmission and gathering capacity. In the fourth quarter, 88% of operating revenue was generated by firm reservation fees. Operating expenses, excluding the non-cash charge, were up $4.6 million versus the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily from higher depreciation and amortization, and operating and maintenance expenses as a result of the growing asset base.\nQUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS\nEQM\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, EQM paid a quarterly cash distribution of $1.025 per unit on February 14, 2018 to EQM unitholders of record at the close of business on February 2, 2018. The quarterly cash distribution was 5% higher than the third quarter of 2017 and was 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016.\nEQM is targeting annual per unit distribution growth of 15% - 20% for several years.\nEQGP\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, EQGP will pay a quarterly cash distribution of $0.244 per unit, which will be paid on February 23, 2018 to EQGP unitholders of record at the close of business on February 2, 2018. The quarterly cash distribution is 7% higher than the third quarter of 2017 and is 38% higher than the fourth quarter 2016 distribution. For the quarter, EQGP expects to receive $65.7 million of cash distributions from EQM and distribute $64.9 million.\nEQGP is targeting annual per unit distribution growth of 30% - 40% for several years.\nEQM EXPANSION & ONGOING MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nExpansion\nExpansion capital expenditures and capital contributions to Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP JV), totaled $115 million in the fourth quarter and $425 million in 2017.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended $MM\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Mountain Valley Pipeline $57 $160 Gathering $43 $152 Transmission $13 $72 Header Pipeline $2 $41 Total $115 $425 2018 Growth CAPEX $B\nForecast Mountain Valley Pipeline $1.0 - $1.2 Gathering $0.3 Transmission $0.1 Total $1.4 - $1.6 Ongoing Maintenance\nOngoing maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures made to maintain, over the long-term, EQM operating capacity or operating income. EQM ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, net of reimbursements, totaled $13 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and $28 million for the year. Ongoing maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be $35 - $40 million in 2018, net of expected reimbursements.\nPROJECT UPDATE\nMountain Valley Pipeline\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) project in October 2017. As of December 2017, MVP JV had received all of the necessary federal permits required for the project. In early January 2018, MVP JV began filing requests for partial Notices to Proceed with the FERC, and subsequently has received permission to begin construction activities in certain areas along the route. The 303-mile pipeline is estimated to cost $3.5 billion, with EQM funding its proportional share, or approximately $1.6 billion. MVP JV has secured a total of 2 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments at 20-year terms and continues to target a late 2018 in-service date.\nHammerhead Pipeline\nThe Hammerhead pipeline is designed as a 1.2 Bcf per day gathering header pipeline that will traverse approximately 55 miles from southwestern Pennsylvania to Mobley, West Virginia, where both the MVP and the Ohio Valley Connector originate. The pipeline is estimated to cost $460 million and is expected to be placed in-service during the third quarter of 2019.\nNON-GAAP DISCLOSURES\nEQM Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nAs used in this news release, EQM adjusted EBITDA means EQM’s net income plus net interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, payments on EQM's preferred interest in EQT Energy Supply, LLC (Preferred Interest) received post conversion and non-cash long-term compensation expense (if applicable) less equity income and AFUDC - equity. As used in this news release, distributable cash flow means EQM adjusted EBITDA less net interest expense excluding interest income on the Preferred Interest, capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt, and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures net of expected reimbursements. Distributable cash flow should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that EQM has available for distributions from operating surplus or that EQM plans to distribute. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of EQM’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, use to assess:\nEQM’s operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; the ability of EQM’s assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to EQM unitholders; EQM’s ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nEQM believes that adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide useful information to investors in assessing EQM’s results of operations and financial condition. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, EQM’s definition of adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measures. The table below reconciles adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow with net income and net cash provided by operating activities as derived from the statements of consolidated operations and cash flows to be included in EQM’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)\nEBITDA means the earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation of the Rice Energy Inc. (Rice) retained midstream assets. EBITDA of these assets is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of EQM’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, use to assess the impact of the potential sale of the retained midstream assets from EQT Corporation (EQT) to EQM through one or more drop-down transactions on EQM’s future results of operations.\nEQM believes that the projected EBITDA of the retained midstream assets provides useful information to investors in assessing the impact of the potential drop-down transactions on EQM’s future results of operations. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in EQM’s industry, the definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measure.\nEQM has not provided projected net income from the retained midstream assets, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or a reconciliation of projected EBITDA to projected net income of the assets. The retained midstream assets are operated as part of EQT’s Production business segment, and EQT does not allocate certain costs, such as interest and tax expenses, to individual assets within its business segments. Therefore, the projected net income of the retained midstream assets and a reconciliation of projected EBITDA of the assets to projected net income from those assets are not available without unreasonable effort.\nReconciliation of EQM Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (Thousands) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Net income $ 146,631 $ 571,904 Add: Net interest expense 10,167 36,181 Depreciation and amortization expense 33,294 97,485 Preferred Interest payments received post conversion 2,746 10,984 Non-cash long-term compensation expense — 225 Less: Equity income (6,758 ) (22,171 ) AFUDC – equity (982 ) (5,110 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 185,098 $ 689,498 Less: Net interest expense excluding interest income on the Preferred Interest (11,850 ) (42,999 ) Capitalized interest and AFUDC – debt (645 ) (4,120 ) Ongoing maintenance capital expenditures net of reimbursements (13,429 ) (27,609 ) Distributable cash flow $ 159,174 $ 614,770 Distributions declared (1) : Limited Partner $ 82,596 $ 308,628 General Partner 43,294 151,628 Total $ 125,890 $ 460,256 Coverage Ratio 1.26x 1.34x Net cash provided by operating activities $ 170,347 $ 650,550 Adjustments: Capitalized interest and AFUDC – debt (645 ) (4,120 ) Principal payments received on the Preferred Interest 1,063 4,166 Ongoing maintenance capital expenditures net of reimbursements (13,429 ) (27,609 ) Other, including changes in working capital 1,838 (8,217 ) Distributable cash flow $ 159,174 $ 614,770 (1) Reflects cash distribution of $1.025 per limited partner unit for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 80,581,758 million limited partner units outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
