French newspaper La Tribune, which first reported the possible deal, said the M88 would be offered as part of a revived version of India’s stalled Kaveri jet engine programme, which was initially linked to the Tejas.\nThe Tejas fighter entered service in 2016, 33 years after it was approved as the country sought to build a modern fighter from scratch for an air force that was entirely dependent on foreign - mostly Soviet-origin - aircraft.\nBut the single-engine plane has been dogged by production delays at state-run Hindustan Aeronautics and only a small number have so far entered the air force, currently powered by engines from General Electric ( GE.N ).\nReporting by Tim Hepher; editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T00:32:44.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
