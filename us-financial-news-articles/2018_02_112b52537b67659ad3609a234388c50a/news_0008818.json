Subsidies accounted for 86 percent of its sales.\nIn a slide seen by Reuters, the company expects 1.7 billion euros of cumulative incentive revenues in the period 2018-2030.\nRTR’s business includes plants Terra Firma has bought since 2011 from companies such as Italian power grid operator Terna , Erg and France’s EDF. Debt in 2016 stood at around 900 million euros.
