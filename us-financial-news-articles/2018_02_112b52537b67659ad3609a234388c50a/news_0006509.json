The sad thing is a lot of people will be burned, because they will continue to buy dips.” \nRead: Bitcoin and Taxes: What You Need to Know About Cryptocurrency and the IRS \nSince reaching a peak of almost $20,000 in early December after the introduction of futures contracts on regulated exchanges in the U.S., a series of negative news has buffeted Bitcoin and rival cryptocurrencies, with losses intensifying since the start of 2018. \nA record $500 million heist of an alternate coin at Japanese exchange Coincheck on Jan. 26 upped the pressure on regulators to probe business practices within the largely unregulated industry, while authorities in trading hotbed South Korea continue to debate more serious measures including a ban on such exchanges. \nInnes sees the cryptocurrency tumbling further to the $5,000-to-$6,000 range before eventually recovering to $10,000-to-$15,000. That road will almost certainly be bumpy given global authorities are only going to increase their scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry from here on, he said.
