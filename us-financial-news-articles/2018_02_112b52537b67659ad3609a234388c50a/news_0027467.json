The proposal also would expand federal loan programs for such projects. \nThe White House expects the spending to spark hundreds of billions more from local governments and private investors to pay for the upgrades, resulting in $1.5 trillion in new investment. \nWhere the federal dollars will come from is unclear. The White House says it will raise the $200 billion through spending cuts to be outlined in the annual budget Trump will send this week to Congress. But that budget already had been rendered largely obsolete after lawmakers last week agreed to a plan to break budget caps and spend $300 billion more than previously planned over the next two years — meaning the White House’s budget relies on outdated figures. Analysts also said Friday that the new two-year agreement, which could boost deficits past $1 trillion by next year, reduced the chances Congress would pursue an infrastructure package this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T00:26:52.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
