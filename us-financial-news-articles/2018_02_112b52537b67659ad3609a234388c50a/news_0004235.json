But each is demanding more willingness from the other to make concessions.\n“There can only be an agreement if the employers improve their stance on all three topics: pay, the right to shorter hours and aid for workers burdened by their situation at home or at work,” IG Metall chief Joerg Hofmann said.\nEmboldened by Germany’s fastest economic growth in six years and record low unemployment, IG Metall is demanding an 8 percent pay rise over 27 months for 3.9 million metal and engineering workers across Europe’s largest economy.\nThe union has also asked for workers to be given the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children, elderly or sick relatives, and to be able to return to full time after two years.\nThis is IG Metall’s first major push for a change in hours since workers staged seven weeks of strikes in 1984 to help secure a cut of the working week to 35 from 40 hours.\nEmployers have offered a 6.8 percent wage increase, but rejected the demand for shorter hours unless they can also increase workers’ hours when necessary.\nThey have also dismissed the idea that they should make up some of the pay shortfall for workers who cut their hours, saying that would mean some being paid a higher hourly wage than others.\nAround 68,000 workers at 80 companies including truckmaker MAN and automotive supplier ZF Friedrichshafen downed their tools on Wednesday, IG Metall said.\nBy Friday, that number is expected to rise to around 260 companies, including Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and Porsche ( VOWG_p.DE ).\nThe DIW economic institute has estimated the strikes could cost companies a total of 62 million euros ($77 million) a day in lost revenue, assuming around 50,000 workers, or on average 200 per company, stop working for one day each.\nThe employers are challenging the strikes in court and seeking damages.\nWorkers at Volkswagen’s headquarters in Wolfsburg and at other sites in western Germany were staging separate strikes on Thursday after IG Metall rejected an improved pay offer for about 120,000 staff at the carmaker.\n($1 = 0.8039 euros)\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Additional reporting by Jan C.
