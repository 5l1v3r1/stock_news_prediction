This was the third consecutive annual loss for Deutsche Bank. \nThe bank's results were impacted by a drop in investment banking as well as tax changes in the U.S. \nDeutsche Bank said Friday morning that it had a non-cash charge of about 1.4 billion euros due to a valuation adjustment on its U.S. Deferred Tax Assets. Without that, the bank said it would have made a full-year net income of about 900 million euros. \n\"Only a charge related to U.S. tax reform at the end of the year meant that we had to post a full-year after-tax loss. We believe we are firmly on the path to producing growth and higher returns with sustained discipline on costs and risks,\" John Cryan, chief executive officer at Deustche Bank, said in a statement. \nOn the investment banking side, the German bank said that low volatility, reduced client activity and challenging trading conditions hurt its revenues. Fourth-quarter revenues for the investment banking arm were 2.7 billion euros, down 16 percent year-on-year. \nThe bank's shares were down by 1.9 percent in pre-market trade.
