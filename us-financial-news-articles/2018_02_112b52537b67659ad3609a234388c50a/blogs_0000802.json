Earnings expectations \n- Earnings: $3.86 per share expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate \n- Revenue: $87.28 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate \n- iPhone unit sales: 80 million unit shipments expected by a FactSet estimate \n- Fiscal Q2 revenue guidance: $65.73 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate \n- Fiscal Q2 margin guidance: 38.9 percent expected by a StreetAccount estimate Trouble with the iPhone X? \nApple made some risky choices over the holiday season, and Thursday it had to reckon with Wall Street. \nApple released three iPhones in the fall — one more than usual. And the flagship phone, the iPhone X, was not only a late add, it had a steep $999 price tag, stoking speculation that sales might be weak. \nNot to mention the smart speaker, HomePod, missed the holiday season altogether. Then there was \"battery gate\" — a miscommunicated software updated that slowed some phones in favor of stable battery life. The outcry spurred a discounted battery replacement program and has drawn the scrutiny of regulators. \nStill, as the world's most valuable company, there are plenty of new opportunities ahead for Apple. \nOne source of growth for Apple is reinvesting its massive pile of overseas cash, which can now come back to the U.S. at a lower tax rate thanks to federal changes. The company has already said it plans to accelerate investment in U.S.-based manufacturing initiatives and a new campus. \nThere's also the company's service business, which includes businesses like the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and Apple Care. Apple has invested in new Apple Music video content over the past year, added peer-to-peer Apple Pay options, and has revamped its stores to deliver better customer care. \nApple has also been investing in markets like China — a competitive market for local brands — and India, which has yet to build a big market for high-end handsets. \nOther greenfield products, the Apple Watch and AirPods, have joined the Apple TV and Beats in Apple's non-iPhone line-up. These products have enabled pushes like a new health record program, announced this month, and a heart study. \nApple has also made recent updates to its tried-and-true Mac and iPad lines. The iMac Pro launched in December . \nThis is breaking news.
