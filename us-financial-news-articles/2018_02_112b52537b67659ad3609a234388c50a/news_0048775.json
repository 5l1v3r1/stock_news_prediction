The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead.\nOn Jan. 17, the Chinese government said the sunken tanker had created two oil slicks.\nJapan’s environment ministry said in January it saw little chance that the spill would reach Japanese shores.\nSeawater samples taken from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 at 14 different locations offshore southern Japan detected no oil pollution from the sunken tanker, the Coast Guard said in a statement on Wednesday.\nAn oil slick continues to be seen near where the Sanchi sank. The slick is located about 315 km (197 miles) west of Amami-Oshima island and is about 700 meters long and 20 meters wide, though oil has been evaporating from the fringes, the Coast Guard said in a statement on Thursday.\nJapanese and Chinese patrol boats have been searching for the missing crew in the area and sailing over the slick to try to dissipate the oil, it added.\nReporting by Osamu TsukimoriWriting by Aaron SheldrickEditing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T02:41:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
