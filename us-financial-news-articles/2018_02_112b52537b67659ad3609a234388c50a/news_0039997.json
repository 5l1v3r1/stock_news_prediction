The index was on track to lose around 2 percent on the week in its largest decline since February 2016.\nThose falls have come as U.S. Treasury yields have hit four-year highs, with U.S. inflation coming in stronger than expected in January, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve could increase interest rates as many as four times this year.\nThat has left many analysts puzzled, as higher Treasury yields are normally associated with a stronger dollar.\nChris Turner, head of currency strategy at ING in London, said the breakdown of the traditional relationship between U.S. Treasuries and the dollar, particularly against the yen, could be explained by the fact that yields are rising on the back of worries over the budget deficit rather than inflation.\n“This year’s rise in Treasury yields has been driven more by the term premium - that’s a risk premium investors require for holding long-term debt,” Turner said. “International investors are requiring a concession in the dollar to hold U.S. assets because of the fiscal risk.”\n“Also, the U.S. Treasury is happy to talk fast and loose about the dollar, which I‘m sure hasn’t gone unnoticed by investors and other central bankers,” Turner added.\nThe dollar slipped to as low as 105.545 yen in Asian trading, its weakest in 15 months. It was on track for a weekly loss of almost 3 percent.\nThe reappointment of Haruhiko Kuroda as Bank of Japan governor and the nomination of BOJ executive director Masayoshi Amamiya and Waseda University professor Masazumi Wakatabe as deputy governors had little impact on the yen, although the proposed leadership trio were seen certain to keep the central bank on an ultra-loose policy path.\nThe euro climbed to a three-year top of $1.2556 and was poised to gain 2.4 percent this week.\nThe Swiss franc reached 0.9190 franc per dollar, its strongest since June 2015.\n“It’s difficult for the market to see the dollar rebounding, especially as decent U.S. fundamentals seem to be providing no support for the currency,” said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\nReporting by Jemima Kelly; Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T12:04:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
