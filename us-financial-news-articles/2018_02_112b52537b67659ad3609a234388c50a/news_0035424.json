REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Duhamel, who with Radford won gold with Canada in the team event earlier in the Games, said that competition could have been the “secret weapon” that helped them to the podium in the individual event.\n“We were comfortable in this arena, we were comfortable in this competition environment,” Duhamel told reporters after what could have been her last competitive skate.\nSlideshow (9 Images) “We knew exactly what to expect. It felt like home. And that always makes you skate better and perform better.”\nThe two-time world champions, who have said they would retire after the season, informed they are not planning to compete at the world championships next month.\nAfter finishing second in the short program, less than one point behind Sui and Han, Olympic Athletes from Russia Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov were inconsistent in their free skate, with Tarasova falling on the throw triple Salchow.\nAnother inspiring performance was that of North Koreans Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik.\nSkating in front of a euphoric crowd, the pair were off sync on a double Axel but their inspired free skate still earned them 124.23 points, a personal best.\nThey finished 13th overall with a combined total of 193.63 points, the best score they have ever achieved.\nReporting by Elaine Lies and Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber; Editing by John O'Brien and Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:13:16.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
