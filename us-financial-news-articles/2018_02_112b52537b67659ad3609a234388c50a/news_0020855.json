Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net revenue increased 1%. Full year net revenue increased 9% to $534.5 million, compared to $490.6 million in the full year 2016. GAAP Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 4% to $1.20 per share from $1.15 per share in the same quarter last year. Full year GAAP Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 17% to $3.10 per share from $2.65 per share in the full year 2016. EBITDA increased to $64.7 million compared to $63.6 million in the same quarter last year. Full year Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $174.6 million from $154.2 million in the full year 2016 (see table at the end of this release). Net cash was $183.3 million at the end of the year, an increase of $64.9 million during the quarter and $109.1 million during the year. The Company continued to execute on its strategic growth plan, investing in new manufacturing capacity and analytical laboratory space at its facilities in Charles City, Iowa, High Point, North Carolina, Karlskoga, Sweden and Milan, Italy. The Company expects full year 2018 Adjusted net revenue, excluding the impact of foreign currency and change in accounting principle, to be between -2% and 2% compared to 2017 and Adjusted EBITDA to be between $150 and $160 million. (see Financial Expectations – Continuing Operations section below for related explanations and additional financial guidance).\n“We are pleased with our strong financial performance in 2017, our seventh straight year of solid growth. The fourth quarter was a record revenue quarter with Net revenue up 2.5% compared to a record fourth quarter last year. Strong performance at our manufacturing facilities resulted in higher profit margins versus last year,” commented Steven M. Klosk, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cambrex.\n“With our recently completed large scale manufacturing capacity projects and the on-going investments in R&D and pilot plant capabilities, we are well positioned to ensure our facilities are able to keep up with the strong market demand.”\nBasis of Reporting\nThe Company has provided a reconciliation of GAAP amounts to adjusted (i.e. Non-GAAP) amounts at the end of this press release. Cambrex management believes that the adjusted amounts provide useful information to investors due to the magnitude and nature of certain expenses recorded in the GAAP amounts.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results – Continuing Operations\nNet revenue was $182.3 million, an increase of $4.4 million, or 2.5%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding a 1.5% favorable impact of foreign exchange compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, net revenue increased 1%. The increase primarily reflects higher volumes in the generic and controlled substance product categories, partially offset by lower volumes and pricing of certain branded APIs.\nGross margin decreased to 43% from 45% compared to the same quarter last year. Excluding a 1% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, margins were relatively flat year over year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $18.7 million, compared to $18.2 million in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to consulting for an operational excellence initiative.\nResearch and development expenses were $4.3 million, compared to $3.5 million in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by costs to develop new generic drug products and higher personnel related expenses.\nOperating profit decreased to $55.9 million from $56.7 million in the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily the result of higher operating expenses as described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $64.7 million compared to $64.4 million in the same quarter last year (see table at the end of this press release).\nIncome tax expense was $15.6 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 28% compared to $18.4 million and an effective tax rate of 33% in the same quarter last year. The favorable impact of immediately recognizing certain effects of share-based compensation as required by a recently adopted accounting standard and the unfavorable impact of U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017, was negligible.\nIncome from continuing operations was $40.2 million or $1.20 per share compared to $37.9 million or $1.15 per share in the same quarter last year. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $42.4 million or $1.27 per share, compared to $40.8 million or $1.23 per share in the same quarter last year (see table at the end of this press release).\nCapital expenditures and depreciation were $13.2 million and $8.3 million, respectively, compared to $11.9 million and $6.6 million, respectively, in the same quarter last year.\nNet cash was $183.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of $64.9 million during the quarter.\nFinancial Expectations – Continuing Operations\nThe following table shows the Company’s current expectations for its full year 2018 financial performance:\nExpectations Adjusted net revenue -2% - 2% Adjusted EBITDA $150 - $160 million Adjusted income from continuing operations per share $2.80 - $3.03 Free cash flow $35 - $45 million Capital expenditures $70 - $80 million Depreciation and amortization $33 - $37 million Adjusted effective tax rate 23% - 25% Consistent with the Company’s usual guidance practices, these financial expectations are for continuing operations and exclude the impact of any potential acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring activities, outcomes of tax disputes and the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance effective January 1, 2018. Adjusted net revenue expectations exclude the impact of foreign exchange and change in accounting principle. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted income from continuing operations per share for 2018 will be computed on a basis consistent with the reconciliation of the 2017 financial results in the tables at the end of this press release. Free cash flow is defined as the change in debt, net of cash during the year. Adjusted effective tax rate excludes certain effects of share-based payments that were possibly deferred under the previous guidance. The tax rate will be sensitive to the Company’s geographic mix of income, changes in the tax laws or rates within the countries in which the Company operates and the effects of certain share-based payments.\nThe financial information contained in this press release is unaudited, subject to revision and should not be considered final until the Company’s 2017 Form 10-K is filed with the SEC.\nConference Call and Webcast\nA conference call to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 results will begin at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on February 8, 2018 and can be accessed by calling 1-888-394-8218 for domestic and +1-323-701-0226 for international.

These and other may be identified by the fact that they use words such as “guidance,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “estimates,” “believes” or similar expressions. Any contained herein are based on current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to current expectations. The factors described in Item 1A of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2016, and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2017, once filed with the SEC, captioned “Risk Factors,” or otherwise described in the Company’s filings with the SEC provide examples of such risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company’s actual results to the expectations the Company describes in its , including, but not limited to, customer and product concentration, the Company’s ability to win new customer contracts and renew existing contracts on favorable terms, pharmaceutical outsourcing trends, competitive pricing or product developments, market acceptance and adoption rate of its customers’ products, government legislation and regulations (including those pertaining to environmental issues), tax rate, interest rate, technology, manufacturing and legal issues, including the outcome of outstanding litigation, environmental matters, changes in foreign exchange rates, uncollectible receivables, the timing of orders or shipments and the Company’s ability to meet its production plan and customer delivery schedules, expected timing of completion of capacity expansions, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, loss on disposition of assets, cancellations or delays in renewal of contracts, lack of suitable raw materials, the Company’s ability to receive regulatory approvals for its products, continued demand in the U.S. for late stage clinical products and the successful outcome of the Company’s investment in new products.\nFor further details and a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, investors are encouraged to review the Cambrex Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, once filed with the SEC, including the Forward-Looking Statement sections therein, and other filings with the SEC. The Company cautions investors and potential investors not to place undue reliance on the contained in this press release and to give careful consideration to the risks and uncertainties listed above and contained in the Company’s SEC filings. The in this press release speak only as of the date of this document, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted effective tax rate and Adjusted income from continuing operations are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net revenue excludes the change in an accounting principle related to revenue recognition and the Company defines EBITDA as operating profit plus depreciation and amortization expense and Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of any potential acquisitions, restructuring activities and any charges related to the sale of the Company’s Zenara business. Adjusted effective tax rate excludes certain effects of share-based payments that were possibly deferred under the previous guidance. Adjusted income from continuing operations is calculated in a manner consistent with that shown in the table at the end of this press release. Other companies may have different definitions of Adjusted net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted effective tax rate and Adjusted income from continuing operations. Therefore, these measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies. Adjusted net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted effective tax rate and Adjusted income from continuing operations should not be considered alternatives to measurements required by U.S. GAAP, such as net income or operating profit, and should not be considered a measure of Cambrex’s liquidity. Cambrex uses Adjusted net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted effective tax rate and Adjusted income from continuing operations among several other metrics to assess and analyze its operational results and trends. Cambrex also believes Adjusted net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted effective tax rate and Adjusted income from continuing operations are useful to investors because they are common operating performance metrics as well as metrics routinely used to assess potential enterprise value. Cambrex has provided a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts at the end of this press release.\nCAMBREX CORPORATION Statements of Profit and Loss For the Quarters Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share data) 2017 2016 % of % of Amount Net Revenue Amount Net Revenue Gross Sales $ 175,505 $ 178,682 Commissions, Allowances and Rebates 527 468 Net Sales 174,978 178,214 Other Revenues/(Expense), Net 7,299 (348 ) Net Revenue 182,277 177,866 Cost of Goods Sold 103,406 56.7 % 98,699 55.5 % Gross Profit 78,871 43.3 % 79,167 44.5 % Operating Expenses: Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 18,683 10.2 % 18,217 10.2 % Research and Development Expenses 4,311 2.4 % 3,496 2.0 % Restructuring Expenses -
