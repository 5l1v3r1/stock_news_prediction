The dividend topped analysts' estimates of 1.20 euros.\nAXA's results came out better than those earlier this month from Allianz, with the German group reporting a worse than expected fourth-quarter net profit.\nU.S. FLOTATION\nAXA shares were flat in early session trading, but the stock nevertheless outperformed a weaker European insurance sector , as analysts welcomed AXA's results.\n\"Overall these are good results with the dividend beat as the key positive,\" wrote analysts at brokerage Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which kept a \"market perform\" rating on AXA.\nFaced with tighter regulations and declining investment returns, AXA is seeking growth in areas such as property and casualty insurance for businesses, savings products that do not tie up too much capital, health insurance and Asian operations.\n\"Health was our fastest growing business in 2017,\" AXA said in a statement, adding it had for the first time crossed a 6 billion euros mark in terms of overall underlying earnings.\nIt plans to float its American life insurance and asset management businesses in order to free up capital and pursue takeover targets elsewhere.\n\"We would reinvest funds in our privileged segments, such as health and protection, commercial business lines,\" chief financial officer Gerald Harlin told journalists on a call.\n\"If we don't have any opportunities, we could eventually proceed to share buy-backs,\" he added.
