Nash, who took the place of the injured Patrice Bergeron on the top line, assisted on the winner. Bergeron is on the shelf after sustaining a broken foot on the weekend.\nBoston goalie Tuukka Rask regrouped from a spotty opening period and made 29 saves in the win that snapped the Bruins’ two-game losing skid.\nCarolina’s Brock McGinn opened the scoring with a power-play marker at 10:01 of the first period. McGinn batted out of the air a rebound attempt.\nHowever, Boston’s Rick Nash evened the game at the 11:41 mark. Nash was alone at the front of the net when he received a pass from David Krejci and buried the chance on Carolina goalie Scott Darling for his 800th career point.\nTeuvo Teravainen netted Carolina’s second power-play goal of the game at 13:09 of the wild opening frame, burying a glove-side shot from the right circle to restore the Hurricanes’ lead.\nSebastian Aho made it a 3-1 lead for the visitors with 55 seconds remaining in the first period. Aho was unchecked as he went to the net, and he completed a perfect deke after taking a pass from Teravainen.\nWith 2.9 seconds remaining in the period, though, Riley Nash made it a one-goal game. Wingels, making his Bruins debut after being acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks, set up Nash in the slot.\nWingels took his turn lighting the lamp at the 5:34 mark of the second period to even the game at 3-3. After taking a cross-ice pass from Jake DeBrusk (two assists) during a rush, Wingels ripped a blocker-side shot.\nDarling stopped 28 shots for the Hurricanes, who have lost six straight (0-4-2). Carolina’s Justin Faulk logged two assists.\nThe Hurricanes were without Jordan Staal, who missed a third straight game due to the death of his infant daughter, Hannah.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:17:05.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
