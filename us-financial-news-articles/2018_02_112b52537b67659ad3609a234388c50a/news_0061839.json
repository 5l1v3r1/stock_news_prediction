Swansea, who lost away for the first time under manager Carlos Carvalhal, dropped into the relegation zone as a double from striker Glenn Murray and other goals from winger Anthony Knockaert and striker Juergen Locadia sealed the win for Brighton. “We are disappointed. To lose 4-1 is frustrating and we cannot come out and say we did well. But it was our first loss in six games in the league so we don’t need to let our heads go down,” Ki told the club’s website.

Action Images via Reuters/Peter Cziborra South Korea’s Ki was keen to stress the need to respond positively against West Ham next weekend. ”The next game is crucial for us. We have to keep our heads up, analyse what we did wrong at Brighton and look forward. “In every single game now until the last game of the season, we have to keep fighting and get as many points as we can so we stay in the league.” Swansea are 18th in the table and have 27 points after seven wins, six draws and 15 defeats with 10 games remaining in the season. West Ham are in 13th place but only three points ahead of Swansea in a congested bottom half of the table.
