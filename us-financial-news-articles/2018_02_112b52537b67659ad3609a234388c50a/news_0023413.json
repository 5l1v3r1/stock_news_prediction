The company has offered a March cargo as well. \n“People were waiting for prices to come down, so inventory has been drawn down, but due to the cold weather they have no choice but to enter the spot market at these prices,” a Singapore-based LNG trader said. \nJapanese utilities, Chinese and South Korean companies are either buying or enquiring for March cargoes, he added. \nHe expected some of the demand to roll over to April, narrowing the backwardation between March and April. Backwardation is a price structure where prices for cargoes loading in the prompt are higher than those loading later. \nChina’s imports of LNG in January rose to another record high of 5.14 million tonnes, Thomson Reuters Eikon shiptracking data showed ahead of official customs data due later this month. \nThe strong appetite is expected to continue this year as China has announced a more ambitious plan of switching heating systems in 4 million households and industrial plants from coal to gas or electricity this year, traders said. \nIndia’s Reliance may have bought a cargo for March delivery into Hazira terminal while Gail India is seeking its second cargo for March. \nSupply issues continue to plague the market with lower volumes of spot cargoes expected from Indonesia, traders said. \nGas deliveries from Indonesia’s offshore Mahakam oil and gas block to Bontang LNG plant only met 87 percent of its target as of Jan. 31, the country’s regulator said this week. \nWhile Pertamina, the parent company of the operator of the LNG plant, has said LNG deliveries to its customers will not be disrupted, spot cargoes will likely not be available, traders said. \nThe plant exports about 1-2 cargoes every two months, one of them said. \nFurther possible delays to Australia’s giant Ichthys LNG project could also see supply being tight, traders added.
