(NYSE: IDA) recorded fourth quarter 2017 net income attributable to IDACORP of $38.9 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared with $33.2 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. IDACORP reported 2017 net income attributable to IDACORP of $212.4 million, or $4.21 per diluted share, compared with $198.3 million, or $3.94 per diluted share, in 2016.\nIdaho Power Company, IDACORP's principal operating subsidiary, reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $37.2 million, compared with $28.9 million for the same period in 2016, and 2017 net income of $206.3 million, compared with $189.2 million in 2016.\n\"Many factors contributed to IDACORP's tenth consecutive year of earnings growth,\" said IDACORP President and CEO Darrel Anderson. \"Strong economic activity in our region, productive regulatory outcomes, and continued prudent oversight of our operating expenses helped lift our operating income.\"\nIDACORP is initiating its full year 2018 earnings guidance in the range of $4.10 to $4.25 per diluted share, with Idaho Power projecting to use less than $5 million of additional accumulated deferred investment tax credits under the Idaho regulatory stipulation. The full $45 million of tax credits remain available for future use, as Idaho Power did not record any additional tax credit amortization in 2017. This earnings guidance assumes normal weather conditions and further productive regulatory outcomes in 2018.\n\"For 2018, IDACORP's strategy remains focused on growth, operational efficiency, and enhanced customer experience—actions that benefit both our customers and shareholders,\" said Anderson. \"We also continue to work with our state regulatory commissions to deliver benefits from income tax reform to our customers.\"\nPerformance Summary\nA summary of financial highlights for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands except per share amounts):\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income attributable to IDACORP, Inc.\n$\n38,852\n$\n33,213\n$\n212,419\n$\n198,288\nAverage outstanding shares – diluted (000's)\n50,474\n50,407\n50,424\n50,373\nIDACORP, Inc. earnings per diluted share\n$\n0.77\n$\n0.66\n$\n4.21\n$\n3.94\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to IDACORP for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 (items are in millions and are before related tax impact unless otherwise noted).\nThree months\nended\nYear ended\nNet income attributable to IDACORP, Inc. - December 31, 2016\n$\n33.2\n$\n198.3\nIncrease (decrease) in Idaho Power net income:\nCustomer growth, net of associated power supply costs and power cost adjustment mechanisms\n$\n2.2\n$\n9.2\nUsage per customer, net of associated power supply costs and power cost adjustment mechanisms\n(2.3)\n9.9\nFixed cost adjustment (FCA) revenues\n1.6\n(12.1)\nRevenues per MWh, net of associated power supply costs and power cost adjustment mechanisms\n3.7\n34.1\nTransmission wheeling and other revenue\n2.8\n11.9\nOther operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses\n1.8\n2.2\nDepreciation expense\n(3.6)\n(18.4)\nOther changes in operating revenues and expenses, net\n(0.2)\n(1.2)\nIncrease in Idaho Power operating income\n6.0\n35.6\nEarnings of unconsolidated equity-method investments\n4.9\n(1.6)\nNon-operating income and expenses\n(3.8)\n(2.8)\nReversal of additional Accumulated Deferred Investment Tax Credits (ADITC)\n1.5\n—\nIncome tax expense (excluding additional ADITC amortization)\n(0.3)\n(14.1)\nTotal increase in Idaho Power net income\n8.3\n17.1\nIDACORP income in 2016 from legal settlement (net of tax)\n(3.7)\n(3.7)\nOther IDACORP changes (net of tax)\n1.1\n0.7\nNet income attributable to IDACORP, Inc. - December 31, 2017\n$\n38.9\n$\n212.4\nNet Income - Fourth Quarter 2017\nIDACORP's net income increased $5.7 million for the fourth quarter 2017 compared with the same period in 2016. For the quarter, Idaho Power's net income increased $8.3 million compared with last year.\nContinued customer growth at Idaho Power increased operating income by $2.2 million, which was more than offset by a $2.3 million decrease from lower usage per customer in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the same period in 2016. FCA revenues added $1.6 million to operating income when compared with the prior year. Temperatures were more moderate in December 2017, when the winter peak generally begins, than in December 2016.\nThe settlement stipulations related to the North Valmy power plant (Valmy Plant) discussed in more detail below resulted in increased general business revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared with 2016, increased net depreciation expense, and increased associated income tax expenses for the quarter, including plant-related flow-through tax adjustments. Most of the $3.7 million increase in \"Revenues per MWh, net of associated power supply costs and power cost adjustment mechanisms\" in the table above reflects the increase in general business revenues from the Valmy Plant settlement stipulations, and most of the $3.6 million increase in \"Depreciation expense\" in the table above reflects the increase in depreciation expense.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Idaho Power benefited from a $2.8 million increase in transmission wheeling and other revenue. This change was primarily due to an increase in wheeling volumes and an increase in Idaho Power's Open Access Transmission Tariff, or OATT, rates over the same period in 2016.\nOver the same comparative period, O&M expenses decreased $1.8 million, primarily due to a $2.4 million benefit related to previously expensed energy efficiency rider-funded costs deemed to be prudently incurred and a $1.2 million reduction in thermal O&M expenses due to lower generation at thermal plants. These decreases in O&M were partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in O&M related to a pending settlement stipulation in Idaho that established the reasonableness of Hells Canyon Complex (HCC) relicensing costs incurred through December 2015.\nChanges in non-operating income and expenses, net, reduced operating income by $3.8 million when compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily related to a decrease in allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC. In 2017, Idaho Power reduced AFUDC by $2.5 million related to the pending HCC settlement stipulation noted above.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, Idaho Power reversed the $1.5 million of additional ADITC previously accrued through September 2016. No additional ADITC was recorded in either 2017 or 2016; as such, at December 31, 2017, the full $45 million of additional ADITC remained available for future use. Other income tax expense increased by $0.3 million primarily related to higher pre-tax income. These increases were partially offset by the net effects of regulatory flow-through income tax adjustments at Idaho Power.\nIDACORP's net income for the fourth quarter 2016 also included $3.7 million of income, net of tax, which was the result of a December 2016 settlement relating to the California energy market proceedings.\nNet Income - Full Year 2017\nIDACORP's 2017 net income increased $14.1 million compared with 2016, primarily from higher net income at Idaho Power. Customer growth in 2017 contributed to an increase in Idaho Power's operating income of $9.2 million compared with 2016, as the number of Idaho Power customers grew by 2.0 percent over 2016. Warmer summer temperatures and colder winter temperatures during 2017 compared with 2016 led to increased sales volumes on a per-customer basis, primarily for residential customers using energy for heating and cooling. The increased residential sales volumes resulted in residential sales making up a larger portion of the sales mix and contributed to a greater proportion of residential sales in higher rate categories under Idaho Power's tiered rate structure. Higher levels of commercial and industrial activity in Idaho Power's service area also led to an increase in sales volumes on a per customer basis for commercial and industrial customers. Higher usage per customer in 2017 compared with 2016 increased Idaho Power's operating income by $9.9 million during that period. The FCA mechanism reduced operating income by $12.1 million during 2017 compared with 2016, as the increased usage per customer led to less FCA revenue needed to recover fixed costs. The Valmy Plant settlement stipulation described below, along with the residential sales changes noted above, led to a $34.1 million increase in operating income due to the resulting increase in revenues per MWh.\nDuring 2017, Idaho Power benefited from an $11.9 million increase in transmission wheeling and other revenue compared with 2016. This change was primarily due to an increase in wheeling volumes, an increase in Idaho Power's OATT rates, and a new long-term wheeling agreement that became effective in July 2016.\nIn 2017, the IPUC and OPUC each approved settlement stipulations related to Idaho Power's plan to end its participation in coal-fired operations at the Valmy Plant by the end of 2025. The settlement stipulations resulted in increased general business revenues in 2017, increased net depreciation expense, and increased associated income tax expense, including plant-related flow-through tax adjustments. Most of the $34.1 million increase in \"Revenues per MWh, net of associated power supply costs and power cost adjustment mechanisms\" in the table above reflects the increase in general business revenues from the Valmy Plant settlement stipulations, and most of the $18.4 million increase in \"Depreciation expense\" in the table above reflects the increase in depreciation expense. Compared with Idaho Power's estimate of what ongoing net income would have been without the settlement stipulations, the settlement stipulations are expected to increase after-tax net income by approximately $5 million on an annual basis. Idaho Power expects the ongoing annual benefit to net income from the Valmy Plant settlement stipulations to decline slightly each year through 2028, primarily due to the annual decline in Valmy Plant-related rate base, which is expected to be fully depreciated by December 31, 2028.\nO&M expenses decreased $2.2 million in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to a $2.4 million benefit related to previously expensed energy efficiency rider-funded costs deemed to be prudently incurred and a $2.7 million decrease in thermal O&M expenses due to lower generation at thermal plants. These decreases in O&M were partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in O&M related to a pending settlement stipulation in Idaho that established the reasonableness of HCC relicensing costs incurred through December 2015.\nChanges in non-operating income and expenses, net, reduced operating income by $2.8 million when compared with 2016 primarily related to a decrease in AFUDC. In 2017, Idaho Power reduced AFUDC by $2.5 million related to the pending HCC settlement stipulation noted above.\nIdaho Power's income tax expense was higher in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher pre-tax income and the $5.6 million flow-through benefit of tax deductible make-whole premiums that Idaho Power paid in connection with the early redemption of long-term debt in 2016. There were no early redemptions of long-term debt in 2017. These increases in income tax expense were partially offset by greater net flow-through income tax items at Idaho Power.\nIDACORP's 2016 net income also included $3.7 million of income, net of tax, which was the result of a December 2016 settlement relating to the California energy market proceedings.\n2018 Annual Earnings Guidance and Estimated Key Operating and Financial Metrics\nIDACORP is initiating its earnings guidance estimate for 2018. The 2018 guidance incorporates all of the key operating and financial assumptions listed in the table that follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\n2018 Estimate (1)\n2017 Actual\nIDACORP Earnings Guidance (per diluted share)\n$4.10-$4.25\n$4.21\nIdaho Power Operating & Maintenance Expense\n$345-$355\n$350\nIdaho Power Additional Amortization of ADITC\nLess than $5\nNone\nIdaho Power Capital Expenditures (excluding AFUDC)\n$280-$290\n$277\nIdaho Power Hydroelectric Generation (MWh)\n7.5-9.5\n8.9\n(1) As of February 22, 2018.\nMore detailed financial information is provided in IDACORP's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and posted to the IDACORP Web site at www.idacorpinc.com .\nWeb Cast / Conference Call\nIDACORP will hold an analyst conference call today at 2:30 p.m. Mountain Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time).
