and A $2.1 million increase due to higher transportation volumes from customers in Kansas and Oklahoma.\nFourth-quarter 2017 operating costs were $124.3 million, compared with $127.6 2016, which primarily reflects:\nA $5.9 million decrease in expenses from recording a regulatory asset as a result of the manufactured gas plant accounting order in Kansas;

and A $3.4 million increase attributed to net residential customer growth in Oklahoma and Texas.\n2017 operating costs were $473.7 million, compared with $472.5 million in 2016, which primarily reflects:\nAn $8.4 million increase in employee-related expenses resulting from higher labor and compensation costs; A $2.9 million increase from the deferral of certain information technology services incurred with the separation from ONEOK, which was approved in 2016 as a regulatory asset in Oklahoma, and a deferral of regulatory expenses incurred previously in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was approved in the West Texas rate case as a regulatory asset;

The filing was based on a calendar test year of 2016. The PBRC filing demonstrated that Oklahoma Natural Gas was earning within the allowed return on equity range of 9.0 to 10.0 percent. Therefore, Oklahoma Natural Gas did not seek a modification to base rates. The filing also requested an energy-efficiency program true-up and a utility incentive adjustment of approximately $1.9 million.\nA joint stipulation and settlement agreement was approved by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) in August 2017. As required, PBRC filings are made annually in March, until the next general rate case, which is currently required to be filed on or before June 30, 2021, based on a calendar test year of 2020.\nTax Reform:\nIn December 2017, the Oklahoma Attorney General filed a motion on behalf of customers in Oklahoma requesting that the OCC take action for an immediate reduction in rates and protection of ratepayers' interests. On January 9, 2018, the OCC approved an order directing Oklahoma Natural Gas to record a deferred liability beginning on the effective date of the order to reflect the reduced federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent and the associated savings in excess accumulated deferred income tax (ADIT) and any other tax implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on an interim basis subject to refund until utility rates are adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings and a final order is issued in Oklahoma Natural Gas' next scheduled PBRC proceeding. The order also directs Oklahoma Natural Gas, to the extent not already accrued for in its current PBRC tariff, to accrue interest at a rate equivalent to its cost of capital as recognized in the most recent PBRC filing on the amounts of any refunds determined to be owed to customers until issuance of a final order in the upcoming PBRC proceeding.\nKansas\nIn August 2017, Kansas Gas Service filed a request for interim rate relief under the Gas System Reliability Surcharge (GSRS) for an increase of approximately $2.9 million. In November 2017, the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) approved the increase, and new rates became effective December 2017.\nIn April 2017, Kansas Gas Service filed an application with the KCC seeking approval of an Accounting Authority Order (AAO) associated with the costs incurred at and nearby 12 former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites. Kansas Gas Service either owns or retains responsibility for certain environmental conditions at the MGP sites. In October 2017, Kansas Gas Service, the KCC staff and the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board (CURB) filed a unanimous settlement agreement with the KCC allowing Kansas Gas Service to defer and seek recovery of former MGP costs (costs that are necessary for investigation and remediation at the 12 former MGP sites) incurred after January 1, 2017, up to a cap of $15.0 million, net of any related insurance recoveries. Costs approved in a future rate proceeding would then be amortized over a 15-year period. The unamortized amounts will not be included in rate base or accumulate carrying charges. At the time future investigation and remediation work, net of any related insurance recoveries, is expected to exceed $15.0 million, Kansas Gas Service will be required to file an application with the KCC for approval to increase the $15.0 million cap. The KCC issued an order approving the settlement agreement in November 2017. A regulatory asset of approximately $5.9 million was recorded for estimated costs that were accrued at January 1, 2017.\nTax Reform:\nOn January 18, 2018, the KCC opened a general investigation for the purposes of examining the financial impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on regulated public utilities operating in Kansas. The KCC also granted a KCC Staff recommendation: (1) to issue an AAO requiring utilities to track and accumulate, in a deferred revenue account, the portion of their revenue that results from the use of a 35 percent federal corporate tax rate for their last KCC- approved revenue determination instead of the new lower federal corporate tax rate; (2) that the deferrals commence on the effective date of the new federal corporate tax rate; (3) that the KCC express its intent to capture excess ADIT in a manner consistent with the tax normalization rules; and (4) that the portion of current rates affected by federal tax reform should be considered interim and subject to refund with interest compounded monthly at the rate for customer deposits, until the KCC has an opportunity to evaluate the reasonableness of those rates with new lower federal tax rates.\nTexas\nRio Grande Valley Service Area:\nIn January 2018, Texas Gas Service reached a settlement with the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) staff in the unincorporated areas of the Rio Grande Valley service area. This settlement, if approved by the RRC, will result in an increase in revenues of $0.5 million with new rates expected to be effective by April 2018. The underlying revenue requirement reflects a corporate income tax rate of 21 percent and requires Texas Gas Service to calculate, defer and begin refunding to customers the rate reductions resulting from federal tax reform that would have occurred between January 1, 2018, and the effective date of the new rates.\nIn June 2017, Texas Gas Service filed a rate case for customers in the incorporated areas of its Rio Grande Valley service area. Texas Gas Service and the cities in the Rio Grande Valley service area agreed to an increase of $3.6 million, and new rates became effective in October 2017.\nWest Texas Service Area:\nIn March 2017, Texas Gas Service made filings under the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP) for all customers in the West Texas service area. The RRC and the cities approved an increase of $4.3 million, and new rates went into effect in July 2017.\nCentral Texas Service Area:\nIn March 2017, Texas Gas Service made filings under the GRIP for all customers in the consolidated Central Texas service area. The RRC and cities approved an increase of $4.9 million, and new rates became effective in June 2017.\nOther Service Areas:\nIn the normal course of business, Texas Gas Service has received approval for increases totaling $1.4 million in 2017 for rate relief under the GRIP and cost-of-service adjustments in other Texas jurisdictions to address investments in rate base and changes in expenses.\nTax Reform:\nOn January 23, 2018, the RRC directed Commission staff to analyze the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on current gas utility rates and to develop recommendations to ensure that, beginning January 1, 2018, all gas utility customers in Texas receive the full benefit of federal tax reform.\n2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nOn Jan. 16, 2018, ONE Gas announced that its 2018 net income is expected to be in the range of $156 million to $168 million, or $2.96 to $3.20 per diluted share.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be $375 million in 2018, with 70 percent of these expenditures targeted for system integrity and replacement projects.\nRate base in 2018 is expected to average $3.4 billion, with 42 percent in Oklahoma, 30 percent in Kansas and 28 percent in Texas. ONE Gas expects to achieve a 7.3 percent return on equity in 2018, which is calculated consistent with utility ratemaking in each jurisdiction.\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nThe ONE Gas executive management team will conduct a conference call on Thurs., Feb. 22, 2018, at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (10 a.m. Central Standard Time).
