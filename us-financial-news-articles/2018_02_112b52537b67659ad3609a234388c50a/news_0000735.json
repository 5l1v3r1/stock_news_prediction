The Trump administration had asked the spending to be cut to $636 million, a request that Congress did not approve.\nReporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T02:39:25.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
