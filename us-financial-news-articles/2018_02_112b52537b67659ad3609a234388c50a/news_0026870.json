None of the new acquisitions were in uniform against the Hawks, but James and Korver were more than enough.\nCleveland led 83-80 with just under three minutes left in the third quarter before Korver went off. He hit four of his 3-pointers in the final 2:21 of the third quarter, helping Cleveland break open a close game and take a 97-82 lead into the fourth.\nKorver spent five seasons with Atlanta, helping the Hawks reach the Eastern Conference Finals in 2015. He’s in his second season with the Cavaliers and is one of the holdovers in Cleveland after Thursday’s barrage of activity.\nDennis Schroder led the Hawks with 25 points, and Taurean Prince added 15 points in a losing effort.\nJeff Green scored 24 points off the bench for the Cavs, who won their second straight game.\nKent Bazemore had 13 points, and Tyler Dorsey and Isaiah Taylor had 14 and 11 points, respectively, off the bench for the Hawks.\nAtlanta wasn’t nearly as active as the Cavs -- no team was -- but the Hawks did cut salary by sending Luke Babbitt to Miami on Thursday and releasing Marco Belinelli on Friday.\nFriday’s game in Atlanta was the first of three straight road tests for the Cavs. They travel to Boston on Sunday and Oklahoma City on Tuesday.\nThe Hawks host Detroit on Sunday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:28:57.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
