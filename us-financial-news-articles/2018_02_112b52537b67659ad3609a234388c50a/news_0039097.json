Poppe’s “U-July 22”, premiering at the Berlin film festival, is a retelling of the shootings by a far-right gunman on July 22, 2011. Filmed on another island close to Utoya in one take, it follows “Kaja” - a fictional teenager - as she runs for her life through woods, along beaches and in the sea. The audience sees her desperately searching for her younger sister, comforting a dying teenager and singing to herself as she cowers in fear against a cliff. Shots ring out, but the gunman is only fleetingly visible, from a distance. Poppe said some had criticised his movie as coming too soon, but young survivors of the attack had told him he should not wait. “I would say that if it doesn’t hurt to watch this movie then it’s too late, so I would say for sure it’s hard but it’s also a part of the healing process,” Poppe said at a news conference. “We decided to make fiction for ethical reasons so the parents, sisters and brothers don’t need to see and think: Is that my sister or my brother? Is that my daughter?” he said, adding that psychologists had been on location to help actors and residents of the island where it was filmed.

When she heard about the making of the film she initially felt it was too soon, but later changed her mind. “Reading the script and learning that the focus would be on the youth, the teens on the island, rather the man who has been behind all of this was really important to me,” she said. “U-July 22” is one of 19 films competing for the Golden and Silver Bears, which will be awarded on Saturday.
