He declined to name any other potential customers, saying he wasn’t allowed to give details of talks.\nLufthansa’s Eurowings started offering internet on short-haul routes this month, using an Inmarsat satellite-based system, while Norwegian Air Shuttle also offers Wi-Fi.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T20:45:08.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
