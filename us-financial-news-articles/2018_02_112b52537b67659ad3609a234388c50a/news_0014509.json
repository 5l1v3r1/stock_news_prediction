The country granted asylum to 15,618 people in the year ending in September 2017, government figures show.\nBut tough asylum procedures, limited job opportunities and a shortage of homes have pushed thousands into homelessness, which can spiral into labor abuses and sexual exploitation, aid groups say.\n“Asylum-seekers and refugees can face real challenges finding suitable housing. And that can add to their sense of isolation and negatively affect their chances of integrating,” UNHCR spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh said in an email.\nThe photographs styled as family portraits show refugees, sharing a sofa with their hosts or sitting in their living-room to push viewers see them as family, not strangers, Wade said.\nRefugees At Home said it has provided accommodation for 540 people since it started in 2015.\nJames Parle and his wife Hilary, who have been sharing their Birmingham house with a 72-year-old Eritrean man for more than one year, said hosting a refugee was no big deal.\n“It’s like having an older brother in the house,” said Parle. “You bicker about things - you want the kettle put down like this or the spoons put away in that draw ... we have little things like that but they are not important... it’s normal.”\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
