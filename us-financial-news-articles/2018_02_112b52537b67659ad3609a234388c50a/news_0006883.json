Let the criminal invaders know that our skies are not a picnic and they will not pass through without paying a price God willing,” senior commander Mahmoud Turkomani said in a statement released by the group. \nRussia’s Defence Ministry also said that the aircraft was downed by a portable surface-to-air missile. The pilot reported that he had ejected by parachute, and he was later killed on the ground. \n“The pilot died in a fight with terrorists,” it said. \nTass news agency quoted the Russian Defence Ministry as saying Moscow retaliated with a strike from an undisclosed high-precision weapon that killed more than 30 militants in an area of Idlib province where the plane was downed. \nThe Syrian opposition released footage on social media that purported to show the wreckage of the plane and the body of the pilot surrounded by fighters. \nRebels said the downed warplane had taken part in strikes that targeted civilian convoys fleeing along a major Syrian highway from villages that the army and foreign militias had overrun. \nSyria’s civil war, which is now entering its eighth year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. \nA Russian plane was blamed for the death of seven civilians and scores of injuries after cars were targeted on the highway, according to a witness and two rebels sources. \nSyrian soldiers and Iranian-backed militiamen were now around twelve kilometers from Saraqeb, advancing towards the Damascus-Aleppo highway under cover of heavy Russian air strikes, two opposition sources said. Related Coverage Group linked to Syrian former al Qaeda branch says it shot down Russian jet \nAt least five civilians were killed in Saraqeb city on Saturday, which residents blamed on Russian planes. \nSyrians in rebel-held areas say they can distinguish between Russian warplanes and those of the Syrian air force, because the Russian planes fly at higher altitude. \nResidents say thousands of people have been forced by air strikes to flee the area, moving further north to the safety of makeshift camps on the Syrian side of the Turkish border. \nRussia’s Defence Ministry regularly says it targets only hardline Islamist militants in Syria.
