Both companies share Criteria - the holding company that controls Caixabank - as a common shareholder.\nAbertis trades at 20.3 times estimated 2018 earnings, compared to 17.5 times for French infrastructure giant Vinci and 18.5 times for would-be suitor, Italy’s Atlantia.\nAbertis builds and maintains highways in Spain, France, Latin America and the United States. It also has a telecommunications division that manages and operates satellite infrastructure.
