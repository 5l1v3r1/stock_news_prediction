(\" Acreage Pharms \") is pleased to announce it has acquired 23 new cannabis strains. This marks an important step in Acreage Pharms' march towards full-capacity cannabis production and sale this year.\n\"The acquisition of these strains broadens Acreage Pharms strain variety in preparation for the recreational market,\" said Dan Kriznic, Chairman and CEO of Invictus. \"The timing is ideal, as our Phase 2 expansion includes 11 new flowering rooms, all of which will be needed to accommodate this welcome and dramatic expansion of strains.\"\nThe collaboration allows Acreage Pharms to import genetics, including seed and starting material. As a result, Acreage Pharms' already innovative and ambitious genetics breeding program is better able to offer a variety of strains that fully reflect the genetic diversity of cannabis, including its many health-enhancing properties. Once the new strains arrive at Acreage Pharms, in approximately 10 days, Acreage Pharms will begin creating and selecting specific genomes for production for medical and recreational use.\nProduction in the Phase 2 facility will reach 5,000 kg cannabis production per year. Phases 1 and 2 represent 40,000 square feet of growing space, and Phase 3 — which due to excellent progress on Phase 2 construction is on track for 2018 completion — will add another 80,000 square feet to Acreage Pharms canopy. The combined projects are projected to allow Acreage Pharms to produce 19,000 kg in 2018.\n\"Our team of plant scientists and horticultural engineers have been eagerly anticipating this exciting enlargement of our reservoir of strains,\" said Kriznic. \"We all remain extremely keen on offering patients and consumers a diverse suite of cannabis profiles this year.\"\nAbout Invictus MD Strategies Corp.\nInvictus MD Strategies Corp. is focused on two main verticals within the Canadian cannabis sector, namely the Licensed Producers under the ACMPR, being its 100% investment in Acreage Pharms Ltd., located in West-Central Alberta, and 50% investment in AB Laboratories Inc., located near Hamilton, Ontario which has both its cultivation and sales license under ACMPR. Combined the two licenses and an expected third license under AB Ventures Inc. are expected to have an approximate annual run-rate production capacity of 76,400 kg by 2019. In addition to ACMPR licenses the Company has an 82.5% investment in Future Harvest Development Ltd. a Fertilizer and Nutrients manufacturer based in Kelowna, British Columbia.\nFor more information, please visit www.invictus-md.com .\nOn Behalf of the Board,\nDan Kriznic\nChairman & CEO\nLarry Heinzlmeir\nVice President, Marketing & Communications\n604-537-8676\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: This release includes certain statements and information that may constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws or forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
