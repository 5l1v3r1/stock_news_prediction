I‘m proud to race as a member of the Honda family, and I appreciate how Honda and the team always do their best to provide me with everything I need,” Marquez said in a statement.\nThe highly-rated Spaniard previously won the 125cc championship in 2010 and the Moto2 title in 2012.\n“Marquez has consistently pushed himself to the limit and matured as a rider, and given Honda many titles. We were able to announce the contract renewal at such an early stage due to our mutual trust, and our common passion for racing,” HRC President Yoshishige Nomura said.\nMarquez’s compatriot Maverick Vinales, who finished third overall last season, signed a contract extension with Yamaha for two more seasons last month, while veteran Valentino Rossi is also expected to remain with the Japanese manufacturer.\nThe MotoGP season starts in Qatar on March 18.\nReporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T12:41:37.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
