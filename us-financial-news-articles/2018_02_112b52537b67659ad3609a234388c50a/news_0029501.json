It’s centered in the U.S., but it’s a global phenomenon,” said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group.\n“This data coming in at a slightly faster tick than we were expecting just supports that narrative that actually global inflation is on the rise and that interest rates are probably going to have to follow suit,” Lawler added.\nTrading was apprehensive as the data reignited concerns around higher inflation and rising bond yields, key drivers of the recent sell-off across global equity markets.\nLast week the FTSE suffered its biggest weekly loss since the beginning of 2016, ending the week at a 13-month low.\nThe firmer pound hurt heavyweight international earners such as Unilever, Imperial Brands and AstraZeneca , which all fell.\nGains for mining firms helped limit losses, however, with firmer metals prices driving Glencore, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton up 1.6 to 2.6 percent.\nShares in advertising group WPP rose 3.6 percent, in line with Publicis after the French rival agency won a multi-year contract with Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz.\nFood delivery company Just Eat was a top gainer, rising 3.8 percent to a fresh record high. German rival Delivery Hero was also among top European gainers, a day after JP Morgan issued a note calling the stock a ‘top pick’ in the Internet space.\nShares in TUI ended the day up 1.2 percent, having hit a record high earlier after the travel group said summer trading was very good.\n“What’s really driving the shares to fresh record highs ... is likely lower debt and improved underlying profitability,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.\nUtilities were the biggest fallers as fears of rising bond yields took their toll on the high-yielding parts of the market. Severn Trent and United Utilities fell 3.4 and 3.1 percent, with National Grid shares also down 1.6 percent.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch’s fund manager survey found a net 44 percent of European investors were underweight on utilities.\n“Usually you would see people have a look at this sector, but people are just transfixed on higher bond yields so they hate the utilities, they just grind lower every day,” said a trader.\nReporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:23:55.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
