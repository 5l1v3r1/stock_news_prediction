The region achieved average annual growth of just 1.2 percent in the post-crisis 2009-2016 years compared with 5.3 percent in the pre-crisis period of 2001-2008.\nSo under a more pessimistic scenario using post-crisis growth rates it could take the Western Balkans over 200 years to converge, the bank said, with parity achieved only in 2220.\nAn optimistic scenario using pre-crisis growth rates would allow the Western Balkans to catch up in under 40 years, by 2053.\n“The speed of catch up would depend on the pace of addressing the challenges that hamper the region from developing its full potential,” the report said.\n“Full EU convergence will require states to implement a determined and comprehensive reform agenda towards boosting productivity and investment,” the EBRD added.\nAll six countries are seeking membership of the European Union, which recently launched a new integration campaign.\nThe EBRD, a development bank set up in 1991, is one of the biggest investors in the Balkans region, having invested a total of 10 billion euros so far. On Monday, it announced 700 million euros for road infrastructure in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
