That compared with 3.28 billion crowns a year ago and an average forecast of 3.72 billion crowns in a Reuters poll of analysts.\nThe operating profit beat market forecasts in all Sandvik’s business areas, including the speciality steels unit Materials Technology.\n“I am very pleased with our diligent focus on cost efficiency in this period of high business activity,” Chief Executive Bjorn Rosengren said in a statement.\n”I am particularly pleased with the performance of Sandvik Machining Solutions and Sandvik Mining and Rock Technology.\nOrder intake at the group rose 15 percent to 24.1 billion crowns, compared with analyst expectations of 23.2 billion crowns.\nSandvik shares are up by about 25 percent in the past year, roughly in line with Atlas Copco and double the gain made by the European industrial sector index ($1 = 7.9041 Swedish crowns) (Reporting by Johannes Hellstrom; Editing by David Goodman)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T10:31:26.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
