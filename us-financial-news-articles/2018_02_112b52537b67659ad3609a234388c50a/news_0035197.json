His lawyer told local radio an appeal to the supreme court was being analyzed.\nKuczynski’s approval rating dipped to 19 percent in February, according to pollster Ipsos, and many Peruvians believe the pardon was politically motivated. Kuczynski says it was strictly humanitarian.\nReporting by Marco Aquino and Caroline Stauffer; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T01:37:03.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
