It was a market that was poised to pullback at some point. It was overbought. This was a widely anticipated pullback, and nothing to be surprised by. The question is how much more does it have to pull back?” she said.\nOn Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 665.75 points, or 2.54 percent, to 25,520.96, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 59.85 points, or 2.12 percent, to 2,762.13 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 144.92 points, or 1.96 percent, to 7,240.95.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury US10YT=RR reached a four-year peak at 2.852 percent on Friday after a strong U.S. jobs report raised concerns the U.S. Federal Reserve might hasten to increase interest rates to stem inflation.\nThe U.S. dollar traded mixed in narrow ranges, with modest losses against the euro but slight gains against the yen in early Asian trade for the new week. [FRX/][.N]\n“I think fundamentally, there seems to be some uncertainty emerging with regard to the change in the Fed and until investors get a better handle on what (Jerome) Powell is like... that may keep investors on the sidelines,” Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said, referring to the incoming Fed Chair.\nReporting by Renita D.
