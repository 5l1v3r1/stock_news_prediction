The prosecution has made no reference to a meeting with police prior to their detention. \n“We kept arguing about it and during the examination today the witness Win Lwin Oo said it is not No.3 road but Sin Gyi restaurant, which is beside Saung Yeik Mon,” defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told reporters after the hearing. \nProsecutor Kyaw Min Aung declined to answer questions from reporters. Government spokespeople have routinely declined to comment on the details of the case, citing the ongoing court proceedings. \nEarlier on Wednesday, police corporal Kyaw Lwin gave evidence about a discrepancy in police paperwork. He said Kyaw Soe Oo’s arrest was recorded as taking place in front of Saung Yeik Mon because the journalist had otherwise refused to sign the form, but like the other police insisted they were arrested at the checkpoint. \n\nDetained Reuters journalist Wa Lone is escorted by police while arriving for a court hearing after a lunch break in Yangon, Myanmar February 21, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED At previous hearings, the court has been told that one police officer had burned his notes from the time of the arrest. Another police witness said he was not familiar with police procedures for recording arrests. \nAnother police witness, Major Min Thant, agreed that the information in the documents Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were holding in their hands at the time of their arrest had already been published in newspaper reports. \nOn Wednesday, as the reporters left court during the lunch break, Wa Lone, speaking in English, told reporters: “I should be in the newsroom. I am a journalist. I never did anything wrong. So, I am trying to be strong.” \n\nSlideshow (4 Images) The two reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men who were buried in a mass grave in northern Rakhine state after being hacked to death or shot by ethnic Rakhine Buddhist neighbours and soldiers. \nAfter Reuters published its report on the killings on Feb. 8, calls have mounted for the release of the two reporters. \nThe United States told a recent meeting of the United Nations Security Council that Myanmar had “the gall to blame the media” for the situation in Rakhine and demanded that the reporters be freed. \nMyanmar’s U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan said the country recognises freedom of the press and the journalists were not arrested for reporting a story, but were accused of “illegally possessing confidential government documents”. \nNearly 690,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine and taken refuge in neighboring Bangladesh since the Myanmar military launched a crackdown on insurgents at the end of August, according to the U.N. \nThe U.N. has said the military campaign against the Rohingya may amount to genocide. Myanmar says its security forces mounted legitimate counter-insurgency clearance operations. \nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged the international community “to do whatever it can” to secure the release of two Reuters journalists. \nThe date of the next hearing was set for Feb. 28. \nReporting by Shoon Naing and Simon Lewis; Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski and Thu Thu Aung; Writing by Bill Tarrant; Editing by Alex Richardson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T16:40:42.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
