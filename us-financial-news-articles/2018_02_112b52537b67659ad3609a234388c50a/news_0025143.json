They fell 79-75 to the Red Storm on Wednesday. Villanova hasn’t lost back-to-back games in five years.\nVillanova played for the second straight game without starting forward Eric Paschall (concussion) and guard Phil Booth, who’s out indefinitely with a fractured bone in his right hand.\nKelan Martin hit eight 3-pointers and led Butler with 30 points while Kamar Baldwin added 25.\nThe Bulldogs dropped to 17-9 overall and 7-6 in the league. They had won the previous three meetings against Villanova.\nThe Wildcats began the second half on an 11-2 run to go ahead 46-40. Brunson and DiVincenzo recorded consecutive drives to the basket to put Villanova ahead by six.\nVillanova continued with its relentless defensive pressure and DiVincenzo kept producing with a 3-pointer to give it a 58-49 lead midway through the second.\nDhamir Cosby-Roundtree scored off an offensive rebound and the Wildcats built their largest lead at 66-55 with 7:25 remaining.\nBaldwin hit a pair of free throws and Butler eventually got within 68-64 with 5:20 left.\nThe Wildcats responded as Bridges made a big play with a steal and a drive for a one-handed dunk and a 73-64 advantage with 4:03 remaining.\nButler closed within four points late but DiVincenzo knocked down a clutch jumper to help secure the win.\nButler bolted to a 21-8 lead and maintained a 38-35 advantage at halftime.\nJust like the Bulldogs accomplished in their 101-93 win over Villanova on Dec. 30, they shot a high percentage from beyond the arc once again. In that eight-point victory, Butler was 15 of 22 from 3-point territory.\nMartin led the way with a 5-for-6 performance and Butler was 7 of 13 overall in the first half. Martin led all scorers with 17 points in the first half.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:13:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
