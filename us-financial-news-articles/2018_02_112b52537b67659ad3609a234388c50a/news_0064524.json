Insurers may cover some of the payout.\nLawyers for the shareholders called the settlement \"fair, reasonable, and adequate,\" citing the risk of a loss at trial, according to court papers.\nIn Monday afternoon trading, Facebook shares were up 93 cents at $184.22 on the Nasdaq.\nThe case is In re: Facebook Inc IPO Securities and Derivative Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-md-02389.
