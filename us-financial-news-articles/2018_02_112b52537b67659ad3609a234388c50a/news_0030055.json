It puts homeless people into secure accommodation before addressing health or employment issues.\nHomeless people currently progress through temporary accommodation in hostels or night shelters.\nIn Finland a similar policy cut homelessness 40 percent between 2008 and 2012. The 170 million euros ($210 million) cost funded affordable rented housing and support services.\nHousing minister Kevin Stewart welcomed the committee’s report, and told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email that the government had committed 50 million pounds ($69 million) to fund homelessness prevention schemes over five years.\nSocial Bite, some of whose staff were once homeless, offers free food to the homeless, and uses profits to fund secure tenancies in the Housing First model and to build houses.\nSocial Bite used the royal visit to launch its own Housing First campaign. It will use some of the 4 million pounds ($5.6 million) raised by 9,000 people who slept out in an Edinburgh park in December to help 500 people into housing over 18 months.\nEntrepreneurs using businesses to help tackle social problems are emerging across the globe - improving communities, breaking the cycle of re-offending, solving education issues and reducing isolation amongst elderly.\nQueen Elizabeth’s grandson, fifth-in-line to the throne, and Markle, who starred in U.S. TV legal drama “Suits”, announced their engagement last year. Their marriage is scheduled to take place on May 19 in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\nReporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion.
