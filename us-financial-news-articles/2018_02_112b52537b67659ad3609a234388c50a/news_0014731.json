The group is due to present its next strategy plan and investments to 2022 on June 1.\n“Not only the promise of full employment by 2018 for the Italian plants has turned out to be ... illusory or even a bit mocking, but any new investment is unlikely to start by September, and maybe not even by the end of the year,” said Federico Bellono, the FIOM union’s regional secretary general in Turin.\nReporting by Stefano Rebaudo, writing by Agnieszka Flak, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:06:20.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
