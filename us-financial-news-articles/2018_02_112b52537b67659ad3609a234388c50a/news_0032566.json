The washing machine, Quaker Quick Oats, Sony’s Walkman, Facebook networking—all these supposedly time-saving technologies have, to varying degrees, sapped people’s ability to exercise choice. Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor and book author, writes in an op-ed for the New York Times that we have less free will than we think we do. Humans are slaves to the path of least resistance, a fact that tech companies have mastered…to become our masters. In his essay, Wu bashes the “cult of convenience” and recommends that we “resist its stupefying power.” From the piece: \nIn the developed nations of the 21st century, convenience — that is, more efficient and easier ways of doing personal tasks — has emerged as perhaps the most powerful force shaping our individual lives and our economies. This is particularly true in America, where, despite all the paeans to freedom and individuality, one sometimes wonders whether convenience is in fact the supreme value. \nAs Evan Williams, a co-founder of Twitter, recently put it, “Convenience decides everything.” Convenience seems to make our decisions for us, trumping what we like to imagine are our true preferences. Advertisement FOR YOUR WEEKEND READING PLEASURE \nA few interesting longer reads I came across that are suitable for your weekend reading pleasure. \nWhy Silicon Valley Billionaires Are Prepping for the Apocalypse in New Zealand ( The Guardian ) \nEarly last summer, just as my interests in the topics of civilisational collapse and Peter Thiel were beginning to converge into a single obsession, I received out of the blue an email from a New Zealand art critic named Anthony Byrt. If I wanted to understand the extreme ideology that underpinned Thiel’s attraction to New Zealand, he insisted, I needed to understand an obscure libertarian manifesto called The Sovereign Individual: How to Survive and Thrive During the Collapse of the Welfare State. It was published in 1997, and in recent years something of a minor cult has grown up around it in the tech world, largely as a result of Thiel’s citing it as the book he is most influenced by. (Other prominent boosters include Netscape founder and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, and Balaji Srinivasan, the entrepreneur best known for advocating Silicon Valley’s complete secession from the US to form its own corporate city-state.) \nThe Final, Terrible Voyage of the ‘Nautilus’ ( Wired ) \nBy most public accounts, Madsen was a charismatic rebel. He had a weathered face with the prominent features of a toy troll. His habitual uniform was coveralls and hiking boots. Fox, the filmmaker, calls him a “modern-day Clumsy Hans,” for the seemingly dimwitted suitor in the Hans Christian Andersen fairy-tale who wins the princess’s favor over his more intelligent brothers. Wall was in the early stages of her reporting, and she would not have known much more about Madsen than what had already been published. It was only later, after everything that happened, that the details of his private life would become important. \nThe Evolution of Marvel’s ‘Black Panther’ ( The Ringer ) \nA little more than three months after the debut of the Black Panther character, the Black Panther Party was officially founded in Oakland, in 1966. Which came first is kind of a chicken-or-the-egg thing . In 1972, with Fantastic Four no. 119 , Marvel unveiled a new name for the character. I reached out to writer Roy Thomas, who penned the comic in which T’Challa pulled on his costume and explained why he’d suddenly started calling himself “the Black Leopard.” \nBlockchain Just Isn’t As Radical As You Want It to Be ( Longreads ) \nThe last decade has shown us that there is no linear-causal relationship between decentralization in technical systems and egalitarian or equitable practices socially, politically, or economically. This is not only because it is technologically determinist to assume so, or because networks involve layers that exhibit contradictory affordances, but also because there’s zero evidence that features such as decentralization or structurelessness continue to pose any kind of threat to capitalism. In fact, horizontality and decentralization—the very characteristics that peer production prizes so highly—have emerged as an ideal solution to many of the impasses of liberal economics.

This fearless Gizmodo reporter took it upon himself to test the fancy food preparations employed by The Modernist Cuisine , a book on the science of cooking that has developed a cult following. In case you’re looking for some new spins on your favorite meals try: blow-torching your steak, mixing sodium citrate into your cheese (to make it melt smoothly), or thickening creamy dishes with Xantham Gum. Mmm…yum. \nThis edition of Data Sheet was curated by Robert Hackett . Find past issues, and sign up for other Fortune newsletters .
