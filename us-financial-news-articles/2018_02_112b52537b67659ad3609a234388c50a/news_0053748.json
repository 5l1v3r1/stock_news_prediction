Instead, it will seek to forge an alliance with Daimler, which is developing electric and self-driving vehicles, to respond to the challenge from new competitors such as Tesla , Google and Uber, which are all working on their own new technology cars.\n\"No current car industry player is likely to win this battle against the invaders from outside without friends. To achieve and assert technological leadership, one has to adapt a new way of thinking in terms of sharing and combining strength. My investment in Daimler reflects this vision,\" Li said.\nOnly two or three manufactures will likely survive in the auto industry going forward, a source familiar with Li's thinking told Reuters, prompting Geely to seek access to carmakers with a technological edge.\nZhejiang Geely Holding has been on an expansion drive. It owns Volvo Cars, LEVC, the maker of London's black cabs, and last year took a majority stake in sports car maker Lotus, a 49.9 percent stake in Malaysian automaker Proton, a $3.3 billion stake in Volvo Trucks and control of flying car start-up Terrafugia.\nIts move on Daimler poses a challenge to the German carmaker, since Mercedes-Benz already has an industrial alliance to develop cars and trucks with Renault-Nissan, which owns a 3.1 percent stake in Daimler, and has announced plans to build electric cars with existing Chinese joint-venture partner BAIC Motor Corporation.\n\"It's not clear what Geely wants and how it's going to work, but we view this move as part of a broader Chinese move to gain involvement in the European automotive industry,\" Bernstein Research analyst Max Warburton said in a note late on Friday, shortly after the stake was disclosed in a regulatory filing.\n\"China wants a payback after spending a decade gifting the European auto industry super-normal growth and profits. Now it wants more direct access to technology, brands and profits.\"\nIf at first... The stake purchase follows an initial approach last November, when Li sought to buy a Daimler stake as a way to access Mercedes-Benz technology for electric cars and trucks, including battery technology, to help Geely comply with a Chinese crackdown on pollution.\nAndreas Rentz | Getty Images News | Getty Images Geely sees potential in Daimler because it is developing high-speed internet connections for autonomous cars at a time when Li believes satellite-based internet connections could become more important for the auto industry, the source familiar with his thinking said.\nIn November, Geely asked Daimler to issue new shares so it could buy a stake, but the German company turned down the offer saying it did not want to dilute existing shareholders, sources at the time told Reuters.\nLi changed tactics, and quietly amassed a stake of 9.69 percent worth $9 billion at Daimler's current share price.\n\"Daimler is pleased to announce that with Li Shufu it could win another long-term orientated shareholder, which is convinced by Daimler's innovation strength, strategy and future potential,\" the German company said in a statement.\n\"Daimler knows and appreciates Li Shufu as an especially knowledgeable Chinese entrepreneur with clear vision for the future, with whom one can constructively discuss the change in the industry.\"\nChinese investors in German technology companies have tended to take a consensual approach, buying incremental stakes in companies such as robotics firms Kuka and Kion, typically after long consultation with management and other stakeholders.\nThe source said Daimler and Geely had not held concrete talks about how to structure a potential joint venture, adding: \"You know we have to become a stakeholder in order to engage.\"\nSwedish truck maker AB Volvo, one of Geely's other investments, has objected to the Chinese firm's stake-building in Daimler, citing anti-trust concerns, the source added.\n\"We will protect interests of both companies by abiding laws in the country and the company's governance structure. We are not seeking to have a controlling power in Daimler. We are just one of the investors in that given company,\" the source added.\nCharm offensive In early February, Geely began courting Germany's automotive establishment in a carefully timed public relations campaign. Li gave a video statement to Germany's Car Symposium, an annual automotive congress attended by senior industry leaders.\nLi underlined that Geely's stewardship of Sweden's Volvo Cars had contributed towards \"growth and prosperity\" in Europe.\nHis statement was followed by a keynote speech by Geely board member Carl-Peter Forster, a former BMW board member and the former head of German carmaker Opel.\nForster explained that in the areas of electromobility and autonomous driving there should be more cooperation.\n\"We are in competition with one another, but should cooperate in areas where it makes sense,\" Forster told the audience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:38:52.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
