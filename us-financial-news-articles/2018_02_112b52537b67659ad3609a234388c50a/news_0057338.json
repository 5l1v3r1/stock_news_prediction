He ruled the Maldives for 30 years until 2008.\nUnder the emergency, Yameen’s administration arrested Gayoom, the chief justice and another Supreme Court judge on allegations of attempting to overthrow the government.\nINTERNATIONAL PRESSURE The United Nations, the United States, the European Union, India and others have all urged Yameen’s government to lift the state of emergency, first declared on Feb. 5 for 15 days, and to release opposition leaders from jail, but it has so far refused.\nThe Maldives foreign ministry said there was no legal mandate to implement the Supreme Court order, which also included reinstating 12 lawmakers stripped of their parliamentary seats by Yameen’s party for defecting last year.\n“The government will ensure that the state of emergency is lifted as soon as the threats posed to national security are addressed satisfactorily,” the ministry said in a statement.\nRights group Amnesty International said in a statement the Maldivian government was using the emergency “as a licence for repression, targeting members of civil society, judges and political opponents”.\nTour operators say hundreds of hotel bookings have been cancelled daily since the emergency was imposed, despite government assurances that all was normal in Indian Ocean resort islands far from the capital.\nThe EU threatened the Maldives on Monday with “targeted measures” if the crisis did not improve.\n“The Council (representing the member states) condemns politically motivated arrests and calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners,” the EU said in a statement.\n“The Council also condemns any interference with the work of the Supreme Court of the Maldives and actions taken against the judiciary and the judges,” it said.\nThe country’s prosecutor general has said the extension of the state of emergency is unconstitutional because parliament lacked the required quorum when it voted last week.\nHowever, the three-judge Supreme Court, which is functioning without a chief justice, said late on Monday the parliamentary vote on the extension was valid.\nYameen has also fired two police chiefs who said they would uphold the court’s rulings. His government retains a majority in parliament in the absence of the 12 MPs stripped of their seats.\nAdditional reporting and writing by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Paul Tait and Gareth Jones\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T05:19:17.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
