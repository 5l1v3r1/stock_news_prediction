We were of course obligated to report it, but it is not a cause for worry. When such a virus affects domesticated fowls, that’s a different matter,” the ministry spokeswoman said.\nAsked whether there was any indication that the bird flu had spread beyond the owl, she said: “Absolutely not.”\nReporting by Gus Trompiz and Dan Williams; Editing by Dale Hudson and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T20:19:44.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
