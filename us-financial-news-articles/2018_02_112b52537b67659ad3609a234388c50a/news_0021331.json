Prior to this appointment, Mr. Cunningham was Senior Vice President, Global Head of Real Estate and Natural Resources at PSP Investments. The outgoing President and CEO, André Bourbonnais, advised the Board of his decision to depart PSP Investments. André will be joining BlackRock later this year to lead a new initiative within BlackRock Alternative Investors.\n\"Neil Cunningham has been a key player in PSP Investments' evolution, both as an investor and as a senior executive. He has played a key role in developing and implementing the organization's current strategic plan, and possesses a deep understanding of the business, mandate and stakeholders of PSP Investments. This extensive experience, along with Neil's consistent demonstration of the core values of the enterprise, makes him the natural and ideal next leader of PSP Investments,\" said Martin Glynn, Chair Designate of the Board.\nMr. Cunningham joined PSP Investments in June 2004 as Vice President, Real Estate Investments, and was named Senior Vice President, Global Head of Real Estate in 2015.

I am looking forward to this exciting challenge of taking PSP Investments to the next level. Together with the senior management team and the many skilled, dedicated professionals across the organization, I am confident that we will continue to achieve our ambitious goals and satisfy our mandate.\"\nThe appointment of Mr. Cunningham comes with the departure of Mr. Bourbonnais after three years of service as President and CEO. Under his guidance, PSP Investments underwent an accelerated evolution which included the restructuring of the Private Equity group, the creation of a Private Debt asset class, the opening of offices in New York and London and a net return of 12.8% for the fiscal year closing at March 31, 2017. During Mr. Bourbonnais' tenure, PSP Investments also developed a five-year strategic plan titled Vision 2021.\n\"André had a very positive impact on PSP Investments during his time as President and CEO.
