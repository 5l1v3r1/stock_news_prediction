The share price dipped after the open and was trading down 2.9 percent at $16.50 at 12:15 p.m. EST (1715 GMT), a session low.\nCorporacion America is part of a wave of Argentine companies aiming to list on overseas markets before an expected hike in U.S. interest rates by the Federal Reserve. But U.S. 10-year Treasury yields surged to near four-year highs above 2.75 percent on Thursday, limiting bullishness for equities.\nArgentina's country risk, a measure of the average spread of sovereign bond yields compared to a low-risk benchmark, surged nearly 7 percent in January and hit its highest level since mid-December on Wednesday.\n\"It was not the best timing,\" said Alejandro Bianchi, investment manager at invertirOnline in Buenos Aires. \"In the past few days, rates rose and the market became more volatile.\"\nThe company, which reported $1.2 billion in revenue for the first nine months of 2017, operates 37 of Argentina's 56 airports and has other airports elsewhere in Latin America as well as in Armenia and Italy.\nEduardo Eurnekian, the billionaire owner of the Corporacion America holding company, initially told Reuters in 2016 that he was eyeing a New York listing for the airport unit.\nOppenheimer & Co, BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs acted as joint bookrunners on the deal, while Santander was co-manager.
