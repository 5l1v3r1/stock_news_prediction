The closing sales will be operated by a consortium consisting of Gordon Brothers, Hilco Merchant Resources, Tiger Capital Group and Great American Group. Store furniture and fixtures will also be available for sale.\nSince 1948, Toys\"R\"Us has served kids and families around the world by offering great service and a broad assortment of toy and baby products. The Company recently announced the closure of a number of stores as part of a restructuring strategy to make Toys\"R\"Us a more viable and competitive business. Toys\"R\"Us filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last September to ensure the Toys\"R\"Us and Babies\"R\"Us brands live on for generations to come. The discounts and promotions that will be offered at closing locations starting today will be unique to these stores. Closing locations will continue to honor customer programs including gift cards, Endless Earnings and credit card specials.\nA consortium spokesperson said, \"not only will the sale provide loyal customers from coast to coast the opportunity to purchase their favorite products at significantly lower prices, it will also include new merchandise at even deeper discounts. Due to these substantial reductions, we encourage consumers to shop early to take advantage of the best selection of products available while supplies last.\"\nFor a complete list of closing stores, click here .\nhttps://www.toysrusinc.com/uploads/tinymce/uploaded/Restructuring%20Info%202017/Store%20Closing%20List%201.30.pdf\nAbout Gordon Brothers :\nSince 1903, Gordon Brothers ( www.gordonbrothers.com ) has helped lenders, operating executives, advisors, and investors move forward through change.
