The Petit Verdot grapes give the vodka its color and tannins, while the White Meritage gives the vodka a silky mouthfeel and sweet flavor. On the nose, you get floral notes with apple, sweet pea blossoms, and a hint of citrus and peach, and the vodka finishes with a long, crisp acidity. \nThe end result is a really drinkable 30% ABV rosé vodka that you might be inspired to sip on like a whiskey rather than mix it in cocktails. \nHanger 1 has previously experimented with creating a vodka using San Francisco fog, \nOver the past year, we’ve seen everyone from gin to whiskey makers put out pink liquids, most of which get their hue from either being aged with fruit such as strawberries or raspberries or in previously-used wine barrels. But neither method is anywhere close to how actual rosé wine is made (by blending white and red wine or grapes). \nHanger 1’s rosé vodka is available for $29.99.
