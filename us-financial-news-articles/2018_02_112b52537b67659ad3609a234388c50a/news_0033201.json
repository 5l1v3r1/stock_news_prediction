The Fed had previously estimated a small increase in output for December but revised the data to show no gain in that month.\nOverall industrial production fell 0.1 percent in January, dragged down by a 1.0 percent decline in mining output. Utilities output rose 0.6 percent last month.\nThe industrial sector has received support over the last year from a strengthening global economy.\nManufacturing output last month was held back by output declines of 0.2 percent at aerospace factories, 0.5 percent for those producing plastics and 0.4 percent in food industries. Output rose modestly overall for goods made to last at least six months, with gains in production of primary metals, computers and motor vehicles.\nCapacity utilization, a measure of how fully industries are deploying their resources, fell to 77.5 percent.\nReporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T17:49:50.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
