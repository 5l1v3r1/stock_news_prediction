What’s absolutely clear is that both the UK and the EU agree than an implementation period is beneficial and we’re working to reach agreement in March,” the spokesman said.\nBarnier warned London again on Tuesday that Brexit negotiations were not going well enough to guarantee that the two sides would reach a divorce deal and an agreement on post-Brexit transition in time.\nReporting by William James.
