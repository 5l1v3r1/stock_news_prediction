In November last year, he was given a grant for the project by the British government’s Department for International Trade.\nWriting by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:46:38.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
