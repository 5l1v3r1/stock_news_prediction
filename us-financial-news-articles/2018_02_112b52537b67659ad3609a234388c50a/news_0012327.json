Indian demand has averaged 840 tonnes over the last 10 years. \nGold demand will lag because of a higher goods and services tax (GST) on bullion purchases imposed in 2017 and measures to track gold purchases, he said. \nIn July, the GST on gold was raised to 3 percent from 1.2 percent. India has also made it mandatory for customers to disclose their tax code, or Permanent Account Number (PAN), for high-value gold purchases. \nThe government moves have disrupted the business of the small jewellers that account for nearly two-thirds of India’s total sales, Somasundaram said.

It will take two years for India to reach normal demand level,” he said. \nGold is a mainstay of Indian culture, serving as the primary vehicle for household savings for hundreds of millions of people in Asia’s third-largest economy. \nGold demand in the country rose 9 percent in 2017 from 2016 to 726.9 tonnes as jewellery demand increased 12 percent from a year ago, the WGC said in a report published on Tuesday. \nIndia’s imports of gold dore jumped 73 percent in 2017 from the year before to a record 245.7 tonnes as the import tax on the semi-pure alloy made by miners is 0.65-percent lower than on refined gold, Somasundaram said. \nDore imports will remain robust even in 2018 due to the duty difference and huge installed refining capacity of 1,450 tonnes, he said. \nGold smuggling in India has surged since India raised its import duty to 10 percent in August, 2013 in an effort to narrow a gaping current account deficit. \nSmugglers brought around 120 tonnes of gold into the country in 2017, with nearly the same amount expected in 2018 unless the government reduces the import tax, Somasundaram said.
