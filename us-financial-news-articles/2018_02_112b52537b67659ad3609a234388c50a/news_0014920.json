Piedrahita remains at large. \nBrothers Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, both now serving prison terms in the United States, founded the Cali cartel in the Colombian city of that name and admitted shipping hundreds of tons of cocaine to the United States from 1990 through 2002. \nU.S. authorities have said their underground empire once controlled 80 percent of the world’s cocaine supply.
