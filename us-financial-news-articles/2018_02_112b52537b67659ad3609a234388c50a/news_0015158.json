Some schools were closed on Thursday or kept children indoors. \nAir Quality Index (AQI) formulas usually include up to six main pollutants including PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ground level ozone. \nThe Pollution Control Department reported PM2.5 dust in the Bangkok Metropolitan at midday on Thursday and at midday it was measured at 72-95 micrograms per m3, with the likelihood that it would increase. \nThat compares with a World Health Organization (WHO)guideline of an annual average of no more than 10 micrograms. PM 2.5 is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles that can include dust, dirt, soot and smoke. \n“We’ve warned at-risk groups including sick people ... the elderly and children. We’ve warned that they must not conduct activities outdoors,” Suwanna Tiansuwan, deputy director general of the Pollution Control Department, said.
