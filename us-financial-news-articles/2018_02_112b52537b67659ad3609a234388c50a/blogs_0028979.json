REUTERS/Benoit Tessier “But these technologies that are being put in place are much more costly,” he added. “For telecom players, this is all about generating new revenue.”\nThe first standards for 5G, the next generation of broadband mobile internet, were recently approved with first commercial offers expected in 2019 or 2020.\nSlideshow (3 Images) The roll-out for 5G will cost billions of euros for each national market, compared with a few million for Sigfox’s IoT networks, Le Moan said.\nObjects connected through Sigfox’s networks range from house alarms to public waste containers and water metres.\nSet up in 2009, the Toulouse-based company generated revenues of 50 million euros in 2017, up from 32 million in 2016 but 10 million short of its initial target, Le Moan said.\nHigher volume usage of IoT chips, such as those made by STMicroelectronics or Texas Instruments, will help drive down the cost of IoT chips to a few cents per unit, making the technology more attractive, he said.\nSigfox, which has raised more 270 million euros over the last seven years and has 380 staff, currently has 2.5 million connected objects on its networks, Le Moan said.\nReporting by Mathieu Rosemain; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T03:39:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
