In 2012, they were the subject of a U.S. investigation into whether their equipment provided an opportunity for foreign espionage and threatened critical U.S. infrastructure - something they have consistently denied.\nThe bill, which Cotton introduced together with Florida Senator Marco Rubio, is similar to one introduced in January by two Republican lawmakers in the House, Representatives Michael Conaway and Liz Cheney.\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a harder line on policies initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama on issues ranging from Beijing's role in restraining North Korea to Chinese efforts to acquire U.S. strategic industries.\nEarlier this year, AT&T Inc was forced to scrap a plan to offer its customers Huawei handsets after some members of Congress lobbied against the idea with federal regulators, sources told Reuters.\nThe U.S. government has also blocked a string of Chinese acquisitions over national security concerns, including Ant Financial's proposed purchase of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International.\nThe lawmakers are also advising U.S. companies that if they have ties to Huawei or telecom operator China Mobile, it could hamper their ability to do business with the U.S. government, one aide said.\nThe aide requested anonymity to discuss the matter without being authorized to speak publicly.\nTrump and his advisers have called for U.S. trade relations to be based on reciprocity, a principle supported by many U.S. business advocates in China, who maintain that the Chinese market is among the most closed of any major economy.\nChina's official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Thursday that the efforts to block Huawei and other Chinese companies showed the United States was worried about China's rapid development, and it called into question the U.S. commitment to market economics.\n\"U.S. President Trump always emphasizes 'fair trade'. From these cases it is clear that U.S.-style 'fair trade' sacrifices fairness to other countries,\" Xinhua said.\n(Reporting by Chris Sanders; Additional reporting by Michael Martina in Beijing; Editing by Tom Brown)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T09:59:19.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
