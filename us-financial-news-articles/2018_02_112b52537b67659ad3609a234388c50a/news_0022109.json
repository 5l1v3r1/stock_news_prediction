There is no doubt about it. Not just because it meets Eskom’s requirements, but also because it’s the right thing to do,” Fraser said.\nIn January, Anglo American sold the last of its South African domestic coal assets to majority black-owned firm Seriti Resources.\nSouth32 remained committed to its existing operations in South Africa which include aluminium and manganese, Fraser said.\n“Our priorities are swinging very much towards base metals”.
