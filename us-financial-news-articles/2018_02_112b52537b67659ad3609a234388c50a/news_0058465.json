Conference on Disarmament on Tuesday.\nBut North Korea’s envoy, addressing the same gathering, dismissed sanctions as ineffective and said plans by Seoul and Washington to resume joint military exercises would harm “the current positive process of improved inter-Korean relations”.\nRelated Coverage Japan suspects yet another North Korea sanctions breach at sea “Sanctions are not an end in themselves and not meant to bring down North Korea but to make it understand that its future lies not in nuclear weapons but in working with the global community towards denuclearisation,” Kang said.\n“Our consistent message should be that it (North Korea) must make the right decision. And if it does, we are ready to work together towards a brighter and prosperous future for North Korea,” Kang told the Geneva forum.\nNorth Korean ambassador Han Tae Song accused the United States of engaging in “dangerous moves” that threatened inter-Korean relations that had improved since the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\nNorth Korea's ambassador to the United Nations Han Tae Song attends the Conference of Disarmament at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, February 27, 2018.

It will not happen.”\nInstead, North Korea must respond to the demands of the international community for it to halt its banned weapons programs, Wood said.\nManabu Horii, Japan’s Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, also struck a tough note, saying North Korea’s nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches were unacceptable.\n“We should not be blinded by North Korea’s charm offensive,” he said, referring to its participation in the Winter Olympics.\nReporting by Tom Miles and Stephanie Nebehay; additional reporting by Cecile Mantovani; Editing by Robin Pomeroy and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T12:43:45.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
