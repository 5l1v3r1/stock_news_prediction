Kerr says Naked is differentiating itself by focusing on fruits and vegetables and through its inclusion in the “chilled subcategory,” which she notes has experienced strong growth. The bars will live in the refrigerated section of the supermarket. While they can be out of the fridge for a day, they are “optimal” if chilled, says Kerr. \nThis “packaged fresh” category— a term coined by Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison —has become critical to consumer packaged goods companies as they seek out growth. \n“If you look at the supermarket, the perimeter”—where refrigerated goods like produce primarily sit—”is where growth is coming from,” says Kerr. In the eyes of the consumer, “refrigerated equals freshness.” \nThe bars come in three flavors: almond, cranberry, and spinach; apples, kales, and pistachios; and berries, carrots, and quinoa.
