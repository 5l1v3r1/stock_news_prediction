Hardaker was provisionally suspended from all competition having failed the test after a Super 8s game between Castleford and Leeds Rhinos on Sept. 8. He missed the chance to represent England in the rugby league World Cup as a result. “Castleford Tigers can confirm that Zak Hardaker has been dismissed from his contract with the club,” Castleford said in a statement on their website (www.castlefordtigers.com). The statement added that Hardaker awaits the outcome of his case from the UK Anti-Doping organisation and that they would not comment on the matter until the conclusion of the case. The RFL did not name the banned substance when they ruled the 26-year-old out of the World Cup squad. Media reports said it was cocaine and Hardaker faces a possible two-year ban.
