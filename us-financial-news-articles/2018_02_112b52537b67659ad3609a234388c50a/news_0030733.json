They have denied any wrongdoing.\nBonds were stronger with the yield on the benchmark 2026 government issue down 5.5 basis points to 8.400 percent.\nStocks were firmer, with the Johannesburg bourse’s index of 40 blue-chip stocks up 0.3 percent to 50,540 points, while the All-Share index lifted 0.21 percent to 57,330 points (Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Edmund Blair)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T21:00:55.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
