What people should expect is some repairing type of interventions taken to restore the books of National Treasury,” the spokesman, Mayihlome Tshwete, said when asked what was expected of Wednesday’s budget.\nHe added: “That means tough decisions have to be taken by government ... there is no question we need to address the 50 billion (rand) elephant in the room.”\nIn his maiden state of the nation address on Friday, a day after his election as president by parliament, Ramaphosa also warned of tough decisions to reduce the fiscal deficit and stabilize debt after years of weak growth.\nRamaphosa took over after Zuma stepped down on orders of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) ending nine years of office plagued by corruption allegations and economic mismanagement.\n“VAT HIKE POLITICALLY UNPALATABLE”\nFILE PHOTO: Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba speaks to members of the media at Parliament before the State of the Nation Address by South African president Cyril Ramaphosa in Cape Town, February 16, 2018. REUTERS/Sumaya Hisham/File Photo A Reuters poll last week found that economists were split on how new revenues should be raised - the most popular being an increase in income tax, followed by higher value added tax (VAT), the sale of non-core assets and taxes on specific goods.\nEconomists said a 2 percent VAT hike could be effective in wiping out the 50.8 billion rand revenue shortfall. The VAT rate, currently at 14 percent, has not been adjusted since 1993.\nBut a VAT hike runs the risk of adding a heavy financial burden to the daily lives of the poor.\n“In a low-savings economy, consumption should rather be taxed, but I think a VAT hike is likely to be politically unpalatable ahead of the 2019 national elections in particular,” said Standard Bank economist Elna Moolman.\nThe ANC had been under strong pressure to address high unemployment and inequality after the party lost its grip on cities including Pretoria and Johannesburg during municipal elections in 2016.\nSouth Africa remains polarized by inequality more than two decades after the end of white-minority rule in 1994, with the lion’s share of the economy still in the hands of the white minority population.\nRating agencies will also closely monitor the budget after S&P Global Ratings and Fitch downgraded South African debt to “junk” status last year, citing the dismal economic outlook.\nMoody‘s, which rates South African debt on its lowest investment grade rung, placed the country on review for a downgrade. It said it would make a decision after the budget.\n“Moody’s will need concrete reasons not to deliver a downgrade. The budget will have to deliver enough consolidation to avert such a move,” Standard Chartered Bank’s Chief Africa Economist Razia Khan said.\nA downgrade to “junk” by Moody’s could see South African debt lose its place in Citi’s World Government Bond Index (WGBI), the biggest of the global benchmarks and tracked by about $2-3 trillion of funds.\n($1 = 11.6490 rand)\nEditing by James Macharia and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:31:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
