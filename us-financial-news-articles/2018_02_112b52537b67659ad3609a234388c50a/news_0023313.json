Agent Stephen Garland, found in a culvert with Martinez, has trouble remembering the incident, according to local media reports.\nThe agent who survived told a dispatcher at the time that he and Martinez were hurt and was Quote: d as saying “We ran into a culvert,” and “I ran into a culvert,” the FBI said.\nThe FBI said it has made no arrests. It had identified two people of interest but they were cleared after a forensic analysis showed they were not linked to the death.\nThe El Paso County medical examiner said Martinez had fractures to his skull, jaw, clavicle and ribs, and bleeding in his brain.\nBefore the FBI statement, Martinez’s fiancée, Angelica Ochoa, said she did not believe that cross-border criminals were involved.\n”(He) was at the wrong place at the wrong time,” Ochoa said in an interview on Wednesday from a family home in El Paso.\nThe Culberson County Sheriff, one of the first agencies on the scene, told the Dallas Morning News in November the agents may have been side-swiped by a truck. The office has not spoken publicly on the incident since then.\nShortly after the agent’s death, Trump tweeted: “Border Patrol Officer killed at Southern Border, another badly hurt. We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will, and must, build the Wall!”\nReporting by Julio-Cesar Chavez; Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T02:51:36.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
