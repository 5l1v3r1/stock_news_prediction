Buoyed by the country's growing economy, Malaysian business heads are set to boost salaries most at the top end this year, with 13 percent pledging raises of more than 10 percent.\nAt the other end, employers in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore said they are more likely to opt for salary increases of 6 percent and below. Japanese bosses are the most likely to avoid giving out pay rises entirely this year.\nSalary is typically cited as one of the most common reasons for leaving an employer. According to Hays' 2018 Asia Salary Guide, which also surveyed employees across 3,000 companies in Asia, 38 percent of staff said they are currently looking for a new job and 42 percent said they are open to new opportunities. Of those currently looking, 61 percent cited salary and benefits as their key motivators.\nAmong the most common reasons for staying with an employer were work-life balance, salary, and job security.\nLike this story?
