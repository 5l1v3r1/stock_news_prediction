However, it offered to meet Broadcom to see if it can address what it called \"serious deficiencies in value and certainty in its proposal.\"\nAs part of its bid to take over Qualcomm, Broadcom has also launched a campaign with Qualcomm shareholders to replace Qualcomm's board. Both companies are due to meet proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis before their Feb. 14 meeting to argue why Qualcomm shareholders should back them in a vote scheduled for March 6.\nBroadcom had requested last week to meet over the weekend, but has now agreed to meet on Wednesday instead, the sources said on Sunday, asking not to be identified because the meeting's details are not public.\nQualcomm and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.\nSingapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.\nBroadcom's antitrust counsel, Daniel Wall of Latham & Watkins, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week that Broadcom was willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones.\nQualcomm responded on Thursday that unless Broadcom will agree to do whatever is necessary to ensure the deal closes, a commitment to divestitures without restrictions often referred to as \"hell or high water,\" it would have to be extremely clear and specific about what actions it would refuse to take.\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan told Reuters in an interview last week that Broadcom decided not to offer hell-or-high-water provisions to Qualcomm because it does not view them as a very well defined legal standard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T13:29:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
