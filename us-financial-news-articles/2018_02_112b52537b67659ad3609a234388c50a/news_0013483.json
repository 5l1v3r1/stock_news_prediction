She is believed to be one of Kim Jong Un's closest confidants. They were born to the same mother, Ko Yong Hui.\nThe war-separated rivals are cooperating for a series of conciliatory measures during the Olympics, which Seoul sees as an opportunity to ease tensions with Pyongyang following an extended period of animosity over its nuclear weapons and missiles program. Skeptics think the North is trying to use the Olympics to weakened U.S.-led sanctions and pressure against the country and buy more time to advance its nuclear weapons and missiles program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T09:52:16.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
