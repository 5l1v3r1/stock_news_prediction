Raising interest rates could slow that process by making it more expensive for companies to operate and expand.\n“We need to let the market work and allow people to find jobs and allow wages to grow,” he urged. “I think we should let the process continue.”\nReporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T23:34:20.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
