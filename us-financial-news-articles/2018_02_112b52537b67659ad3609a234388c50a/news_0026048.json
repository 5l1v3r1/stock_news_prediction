The judging is out of your hands and so you just have to try your best and that is what I did and I was rewarded.”\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T08:13:39.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
