A lack of metal element this year may see auto and machinery stocks underperform. \"Sorcerer's apprentice\" Sally Chan poses with the Feng Shui Index report for Chinese Year of the Dog, in Hong Kong, China February 5, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip \nCLSA advises against taking bets on casino or transport stocks in March, when the market is likely to take a tumble, although these sectors should get a leg up in October. \nConstruction and resources stocks are expected to bloom from spring to mid-summer, but investors are told to be wary of banking and financials. \nThe Hang Seng Index .HSI is expected to close on a high at the end of the year, it says. \nHong Kong got off to a strong start the calendar year, scaling a series of record highs, although the past few trading sessions have been volatile, tracking moves in global equities. \nThe financial hub's benchmark index .HSI has risen around 7 percent so far this year after surging 36 percent in 2017. \nThe CLSA Feng Shui Index began in 1992, the Year of the Monkey, as a Lunar New Year card for clients.
