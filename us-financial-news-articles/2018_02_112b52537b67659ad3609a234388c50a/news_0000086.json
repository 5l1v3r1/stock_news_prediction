But the decline of 1.4 percent was significantly smaller than in the previous quarter, as KPN reported strong growth in the sale of IT services to companies.\n“We are on track to stabilise Business revenues”, outgoing chief executive Eelco Blok said in a statement.\nBlok is to step down in April, to be replaced by Maximo Ibarra, former head of Italian mobile network operator Wind Tre.\n$1 = 0.8034 euros Reporting by Bart Meijer; editing by Sunil Nair and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T15:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:55:08.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
