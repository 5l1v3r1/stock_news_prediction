The president can bring the vote forward if two-thirds of parliament endorses it.\nUNP housing minister Sajith Premadasa said both coalition government partners had decided to set up a committee to explore the possibilities to continue the unity government.\nHowever, legislators in the president’s SLFP demanded he appoint a new prime minister.\n“We need a new prime minister to carry forward a new parliament. We hope the president will decide on this in the next two days,” Nishantha Muthuhettigama, deputy ports minister, told reporters after a party meeting.\nThe party backed by Rajapaksa, who as president from 2005 to 2015 crushed the Tamil Tiger rebels, ending a 26-year civil war, won control of 231 local councils out of a total 340 while Wickremasinghe’s UNP took 34 councils and SLFP nine. The rest were split among other parties.\nReporting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:45:25.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
