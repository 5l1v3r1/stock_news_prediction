But it also collects fees based on the performance of its global funds, which have proven to be a less volatile source of income.\nAbout 60 percent of the Sydney-based bank’s income comes from outside Australia.\n”Trading conditions across the group were satisfactory in the December 2017 quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Moore said in a statement, adding the bank was “positioned to deliver superior performance in the medium-term,”\nGroup tax rate would be cut by 3-4 percent in the medium term as a result of tax reform in the United States, although no change was expected in the current financial year, the bank said.\nIts effective tax rate in the United States would fall by about 25 percent from the start of fiscal 2019.\nThe bank’s asset management business, its biggest-earning unit, saw a 2 percent increase in assets under management as at Dec. 31 compared with three months ago.\nThe company, dubbed the “millionaire’s factory” due to the salaries of its most successful executives, said its A$1 billion share buyback programme remained in place but it declined to provide a specific timing for it.\nMacquarie’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio as at Dec. 31 was 10.7 percent, from 11 percent at Sept. 30.
