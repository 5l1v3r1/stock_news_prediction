I eat quinoa. My son introduced me to it,” Najib is heard saying in a video taken at a question and answer session.\nNajib goes on to explain quinoa has less carbohydrates and sugar.\n“It is better than rice,” he said.\nRice is a staple grain consumed across Malaysia. It was subsidized by the government until 2015.\nThe comment on quinoa, originally from South America, was derided on social media.\nFormer premier Mahathir Mohamad, the opposition’s candidate for prime minister if it were to win the election, voiced his support for Malaysia’s traditional grain.\n“I only eat local rice,” Mahathir said on Twitter.\nAnother opposition leader, Lim Kit Siang, said he had never even heard of quinoa.\n“The 14th general election will be quinoa vs rice; clean government vs kleptocracy; and Najib vs people of Malaysia,” Lim said in a statement.\nNajib’s office responded by saying “certain quarters” had manipulated his comments.\nQuinoa was part of Najib’s healthy diet and had been recommended by a doctor, his office said in a statement late on Friday.\nNajib is widely expected to win the election, thanks to a divided opposition, an upbeat economy, rural support and the redrawing of electoral boundaries that critics say favours the government.\nReporting by Emily Chow; Editing by A.
