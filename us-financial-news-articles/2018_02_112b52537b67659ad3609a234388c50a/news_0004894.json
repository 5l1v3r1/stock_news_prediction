Anyone who comes after that period will have the same rights as now during the implementation period,” the spokesman said.\n“During the implementation period, we’ll introduce a registration scheme for new arrivals,” he added.\n“The ongoing rights of those people who arrived during the implementation period following the end of that period are a matter for negotiation. The PM was clear that those rights would be different from those who came before.”\nRelated Coverage Factbox: Parlez-vous Brexit?
