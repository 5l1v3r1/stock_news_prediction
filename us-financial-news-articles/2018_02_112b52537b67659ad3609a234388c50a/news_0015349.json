(the \"Company\" or \"Yum China\") (NYSE: YUMC) today reported unaudited results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. Reported GAAP results include Special Items, which are excluded from adjusted measures. Special Items are not allocated to any segment and therefore only impact reported GAAP results of Yum China. See \"Reconciliation of Reported GAAP Results to Adjusted Measures\" within this release.\nFourth-Quarter Highlights\nSame-store sales grew 5%, with an increase of 7% at KFC and 1% at Pizza Hut. Total system sales grew 9%, including growth of 11% at KFC and 6% at Pizza Hut, excluding foreign currency translation (\"F/X\"). Total revenues were $2.2 billion, an increase of 13% (9%, excluding F/X). Opened 339 new restaurants during the quarter. Operating Profit was $71 million, an increase of 23%. Excluding Special Items recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 and F/X, Adjusted Operating Profit decreased 9% due to investment in product upgrades at Pizza Hut during the quarter, partially offset by strong sales leverage at KFC. Recorded an estimated one-time tax charge (\"Tax Charge\") of $164 million, or $0.42 per share, related to recent US tax reform. Net Loss was $90 million including the above estimated Tax Charge. Excluding this impact, Adjusted Net Income was $74 million, an increase of 12% (18%, excluding F/X). Diluted EPS was negative $0.23 including the above estimated Tax Charge of $0.42. Excluding this impact, Adjusted Diluted EPS was positive $0.19, an increase of 12% (18%, excluding F/X). Growth of digital initiatives continued with over 110 million members of KFC and over 35 million members of Pizza Hut loyalty programs, and mobile payment accounted for about 53% of Company sales in the quarter.\nFull-Year Highlights\nSame-store sales grew 4%, with an increase of 5% at KFC and 1% at Pizza Hut. Total system sales grew 8%, including growth of 9% at KFC and 7% at Pizza Hut, excluding F/X. Total revenues were $7.1 billion, an increase of 6% (8%, excluding F/X). Opened 691 new restaurants during the full year, bringing total store count to 7,983 across more than 1,200 cities. Restaurant margin improved 1.5 percentage points to 16.8%, primarily driven by same-store sales leverage and aided by the impact of retail tax structure reform. Operating Profit was $785 million, an increase of 23%. Excluding Special Items, Adjusted Operating Profit was $782 million, an increase of 20% (23%, excluding F/X) driven by strong sales and margin expansion. Net Income was $403 million, a decrease of 20%. Excluding Special Items, Adjusted Net Income was $564 million, an increase of 20% (24%, excluding F/X). Effective tax rate was 47.0%, or 26.9% excluding Special Items. Diluted EPS was $1.01, a decrease of 26%.

Our development team has again exceeded expectations in opening 691 new restaurants in 2017. I am very pleased to hand over the reins to Joey Wat as our new CEO from March 1 st ; she has demonstrated an excellent track record and is the right person leading Yum China as we head into 2018, with challenging sales and profit laps particularly in the first half of the year\" said Micky Pant, CEO of Yum China.\n\"All of us at Yum China are committed to building leading brands for the long term through innovation. We will focus on our strategic priorities on digital and delivery, while continuing to improve our food and in-store experience. While we finished 2017 with a solid sales momentum, we continue to face challenges of the revitalization of Pizza Hut and lapping of two very successful Chinese New Year promotions. However I remain confident in the growth opportunities and long term prospects of Yum China.\" remarked Joey Wat, President and COO of Yum China.\nUS Tax Reform Impact\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), the Company incurred an estimated Tax Charge of $164 million, or $0.42 per share, during the fourth quarter, primarily related to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets.\nDividend and Share Repurchase\nThe Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share on Yum China's common stock, payable as of the close of business on March 21, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 28, 2018. In 2017, Yum China repurchased 3.4 million shares totaling $128 million at an average price of $38.18 per share.\nNew-Unit Development and Asset Upgrade\nOpened 339 new restaurants in the fourth quarter and 691 new restaurants for the year, driven by development of the KFC brand. Remodeled 359 restaurants in the fourth quarter and 788 restaurants for the full year, focusing on KFC. Over 75% of Yum China's current store portfolio has been remodeled or built in the past five years.\nNew Units\nRestaurant Count\nFourth\nAs of Fourth Quarter End\nQuarter\nFull Year\n2017\n2016\nYum China\n339\n691\n7,983\n7,562\nKFC\n193\n408\n5,488\n5,224\nPizza Hut\n78\n180\n2,195\n2,081\nLittle Sheep, East Dawning, Taco Bell\n68\n103\n300\n257\nRestaurant Margin\nFor the quarter, Yum China restaurant margin improved 0.3 percentage points to 11.3%, primarily attributable to the same-store sales leverage and margin expansion at KFC, partially offset by investment in product upgrades at Pizza Hut.

release:\nThe Company provides certain percentage changes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation (\"F/X\"). These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company-owned, franchise and unconsolidated affiliate restaurants that operate our concepts, except for non-Company-owned restaurants for which we do not receive a sales-based royalty. Sales of franchise and unconsolidated affiliate restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise fees for the Company at a rate of approximately 6% of system sales. Franchise and unconsolidated affiliate restaurant sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income; however, the franchise fees are included in the Company's revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth. Same-store sales growth is the estimated percentage change in sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the Company system one year or more. Company Restaurant profit (\"Restaurant profit\") is defined as Company sales less expenses incurred directly by our Company-owned restaurants in generating Company sales. Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as Restaurant profit divided by Company sales.\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") in this press release, the Company provides measures adjusted for Special Items which present Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted EBITDA. Included in Special Items are reversal of losses associated with sales of aircraft, incremental restaurant-level impairment upon separation, income from the reversal of contingent consideration previously recorded for a business combination, changes in fair value of financial instruments, an estimated one-time tax charge as a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") and impact of the redemption of the Little Sheep noncontrolling interest. These amounts are described in (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) in the accompanying notes. The Company excludes impact from Special Items for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. Special Items are not included in any of our segment results. These adjusted measures are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of these adjusted measures provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present results, excluding those items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their nature. These adjusted measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial results, but should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated and Combined Summary of Results and other information presented herein. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures to adjusted measures follows.\nQuarter ended\nYear ended\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nDetail of Special Items\nReversal of loss associated with sale of aircraft (b)\n-\n-\n-\n2\nIncremental restaurant-level impairment upon separation (c)\n-\n(17)\n-\n(17)\nIncome from the reversal of contingent consideration (d)\n-\n-\n3\n-\nSpecial Items Income (Expense) - Operating Profit\n-\n(17)\n3\n(15)\nChanges in fair value of financial instruments (e)\n-\n21\n-\n21\nTax benefit on Special Items (f)\n-\n17\n-\n16\nImpact from the Tax Act (g)\n(164)\n-\n(164)\n-\nSpecial items income (expense), net of tax - including\nnoncontrolling interests\n(164)\n21\n(161)\n22\nSpecial items income, net of tax -\nnoncontrolling interests (h)\n-\n-\n-\n(8)\nSpecial Items Income (Expense), net of tax -\nYum China Holdings, Inc.\n(164)\n21\n(161)\n30\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding\n399,229,895\n379,915,075\n398,089,606\n369,143,838\nSpecial Items Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share\n(0.42)\n0.06\n(0.41)\n0.08\nReconciliation of Operating Profit to Adjusted Operating Profit\nOperating Profit\n71\n58\n785\n640\nSpecial Items Income (Expense) - Operating Profit\n-\n(17)\n3\n(15)\nAdjusted Operating Profit\n71\n75\n782\n655\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nNet Income (Loss)\n(90)\n88\n403\n502\nSpecial Items Income (Expense) - Net Income (Loss)\n(164)\n21\n(161)\n30\nAdjusted Net Income\n74\n67\n564\n472\nReconciliation of EPS to Adjusted EPS\nDiluted (Loss) Earnings Per Common Share\n(0.23)\n0.23\n1.01\n1.36\nSpecial Items Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per Common Share\n(0.42)\n0.06\n(0.41)\n0.08\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share\n0.19\n0.17\n1.42\n1.28\nReconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Adjusted Effective Tax Rate\nEffective Tax Rate\n203.0\n%\n(8.4)%\n47.0\n%\n23.5\n%\nImpact on Effective Tax Rate as a result of Special Items\n198.6\n%\n(20.6)%\n20.1\n%\n(2.7)\n%\nAdjusted Effective Tax Rate\n4.4\n%\n12.2\n%\n26.9\n%\n26.2\n%\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA\n(amounts in US$ million, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nNet income (loss), along with the reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA, is presented below.\nQuarter ended\nYear ended\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income - noncontrolling interests\n$\n5\n$\n2\n$\n26\n$\n12\nNet Income (Loss) - Yum China Holdings, Inc.\n(90)\n88\n403\n502\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n168\n(7)\n381\n158\nInterest income, net\n(12)\n(4)\n(25)\n(11)\nChanges in fair value of financial instruments\n-\n(21)\n-\n(21)\nOperating Profit\n71\n58\n785\n640\nDepreciation and amortization\n144\n130\n409\n402\nStore impairment charges\n30\n27\n58\n70\nSpecial Items Income (Expense) - Operating Profit\n-\n17\n(3)\n15\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n245\n$\n232\n$\n1,249\n$\n1,127\nUnit Count by Brand\nKFC\n2016\nNew Builds\nClosures\nRefranchised\n2017\nCompany-owned\n3,913\n320\n(111)\n(10)\n4,112\nUnconsolidated affiliates\n836\n73\n(16)\n(2)\n891\nFranchise\n475\n15\n(17)\n12\n485\nTotal\n5,224\n408\n(144)\n-\n5,488\nPizza Hut\n2016\nNew Builds\nClosures\nRefranchised\n2017\nCompany-owned\n2,057\n180\n(66)\n(5)\n2,166\nFranchise\n24\n-\n-\n5\n29\nTotal\n2,081\n180\n(66)\n-\n2,195\nAll Other Segments\n2016\nNew Builds\nClosures\nRefranchised\n2017\nCompany-owned\n38\n3\n(7)\n(5)\n29\nFranchise\n219\n100\n(53)\n5\n271\nTotal\n257\n103\n(60)\n-\n300\nYum China Holdings, Inc.\nSegment Results\n(amounts in US$ million)\n(unaudited)\nQuarter Ended 12/31/17\nKFC\nPizza Hut\nAll Other\nSegments\nCorporate\nand\nUnallocated\nTotal\nTotal revenues\n$\n1,563\n$\n641\n$\n24\n$\n-\n$\n2,228\nCompany restaurant expenses\n1,313\n605\n19\n-\n1,937\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n70\n38\n8\n77\n193\nFranchise expenses\n21\n-\n-\n-\n21\nClosures and impairment expenses, net\n10\n18\n(1)\n-\n27\nRefranchising gain, net\n-\n-\n-\n(3)\n(3)\nOther income, net\n(11)\n-\n(5)\n(2)\n(18)\n1,403\n661\n21\n72\n2,157\nOperating Profit (Loss)\n$\n160\n$\n(20)\n$\n3\n$\n(72)\n$\n71\nQuarter Ended 12/31/16\nKFC\nPizza Hut\nAll Other\nSegments\nCorporate\nand\nUnallocated\nTotal\nTotal revenues\n$\n1,371\n$\n588\n$\n19\n$\n-\n$\n1,978\nCompany restaurant expenses\n1,178\n531\n15\n-\n1,724\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n60\n32\n4\n57\n153\nFranchise expenses\n18\n2\n-\n-\n20\nClosures and impairment expenses, net\n16\n6\n3\n17\n42\nRefranchising gain, net\n-\n-\n-\n(7)\n(7)\nOther income, net\n(7)\n-\n(5)\n0\n(12)\n1,265\n571\n17\n67\n1,920\nOperating Profit (Loss)\n$\n106\n$\n17\n$\n2\n$\n(67)\n$\n58\nThe above tables reconcile segment information, which is based on management responsibility, with our Consolidated and Combined Summary of Results.

Corporate and unallocated expenses comprise items that are not allocated to segments for performance reporting purposes.\nThe Corporate and Unallocated column in the above tables includes, among other amounts, all amounts that we have deemed Special Items. See \"Reconciliation of Reported GAAP Results to Adjusted Measures\".\nNotes to the Consolidated and Combined Summary of Results, Consolidated Balance Sheets\nand Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows\n(amounts in US$ million)\n(unaudited)\n(a) Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 are unaudited, and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 may contain updates to the information disclosed in this press release.\n(b) During 2015, we made the decision to dispose of a corporate aircraft in China and recognized a loss of $15 million associated with the planned sale of the aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2015. We completed the sale during 2016. The sale proceeds of $19 million was greater than the net book value of $17 million of the aircraft at the time of disposal, which resulted in the reversal of $2 million of the previously recognized loss.\n(c) Incremental restaurant-level impairment represents additional impairment as a result of including the impact from the license fee paid to Yum! Brands on the individual restaurants future cash flow, which is equal to 3% of net system sales. Such license fee did not impact the impairment assessment prior to the separation as it was considered an intercompany charge at the time, whereas it became a charge from a third party after the spin-off and therefore should be considered in the impairment assessment.\n(d) During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized income from the reversal of contingent consideration previously recorded for a business combination as the likelihood of making payment becomes remote.\n(e) In connection with the investment agreement with strategic investors entered into on September 1, 2016, the Company issued 19,145,169 shares of common stock on November 1, 2016, subject to post-closing adjustment by December 30, 2016, and warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock. The post-closing adjustment and the warrants were accounted for as derivative instruments and liability-classified equity contracts, respectively. These financial instruments were initially measured at fair value on the date of issuance, with subsequent changes in fair value of $21 million recognized in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2016. No subsequent fair value measurements were recognized after December 30, 2016.\n(f) The tax benefit was determined based upon the impact of the nature of each Special Item tax effected at the 25% China tax rate or the 35% US tax rate, except for the $21 million changes in fair value of financial instruments associated with the strategic investment which resulted in no income tax expense. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a tax benefit of $26 million related to the legal entity restructuring of our Little Sheep business. $12 million of this benefit was attributed to previous Little Sheep impairment losses recognized within Special Items in 2013 and 2014 and as such was classified as a Special Item consistent with the classification of those historical impairments.\n(g) The Company incurred an estimated one-time income tax charge of $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the Tax Act, primarily due to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets.\n(h) During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Little Sheep founding shareholders sold their remaining 7% Little Sheep ownership interest to the Company pursuant to their redemption rights. The difference between the purchase price of less than $1 million, which was determined using a non-fair value based formula pursuant to the agreement governing the redemption rights, and the carrying value of their redeemable noncontrolling interests was recorded as an $8 million loss attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yum-china-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300594944.html\nSOURCE Yum China Holdings, Inc", "external_links": ["http://ir.yumchina.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yum-china-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300594944.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T01:22:26.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
