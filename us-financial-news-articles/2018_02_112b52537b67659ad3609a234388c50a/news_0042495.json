It raised a $2.8 billion loan in 2014 with a consortium of banks to fund various projects, including the expansion of its refinery in Sohar.\nIn early 2016 it secured $3.8 billion in project financing for its Liwa Plastics Industries Complex, a project with a total value of $6.5 billion.\nORPIC has been in talks with a number of banks over the past few months to discuss its funding options, which one source said could also include new loans.\nIn addition to two crude oil refineries, ORPIC operates aromatics and polypropylene production plants. According to its website, it employs over 2,600 people and plans to have 3,000 employees by 2020.
