While both pharmacological and psychological treatments are available, only one in six people with depression in rich countries gets effective treatment. That drops to one in 27 patients in poor and middle-income countries.\nEFFECTIVENESS VARIES The study, published in The Lancet medical journal, found some differences in the effectiveness of the 21 drugs.\nIn general, newer antidepressants tended to be better tolerated due to fewer side effects, while the most effective drug in terms of reducing depressive symptoms was amitriptyline - a drug first discovered in the 1950s.\nSome well-known medicines - such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine, sold under the Prozac brand - were slightly less effective but better tolerated.\nThe scientists noted that their study could only look at average effects, so should not be interpreted as showing that antidepressants work in every patient. Only around 60 percent of people prescribed depression medication improve, Cipriani said.\n“Unfortunately, we know that about one third of patients with depression will not respond to them,” he said. “It’s clear there is still a need to improve treatments further.”\nSeveral experts not directly involved in the study said its results gave a clear message.\n“This meta-analysis finally puts to bed the controversy on antidepressants,” said Carmine Pariante, a professor at Britain’s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience.\nJames Warner, a psychiatrist at Imperial College London, added: “Depression causes misery to countless thousands every year and this study adds to the existing evidence that effective treatments are available.”\nReporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T01:47:00.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
