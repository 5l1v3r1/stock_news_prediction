It will be in a way positive, especially in the short term,” Lagarde told France 2 television on Thursday.\n“It will also probably have a negative aspect, especially in the medium term, because it will contribute to two things,” she said.\n“On one side it will revive the deficit and therefore increase the debt. And on the other side, since it will boost an economy already at full capacity, we will probably get wage rises, we will probably get inflation increases and as a consequence a rise in interest rates decided by the Fed... If that is the case, that would mean the end of easy money is probably in sight in the United States.”\nReporting by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:40:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
