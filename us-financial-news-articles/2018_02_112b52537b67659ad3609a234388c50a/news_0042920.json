Mandatory Credit: Jerry Lai-USA TODAY Sports Workers at the Gunsan GM plant have called the shutdown a “death sentence” and threatened a strike.\nThe factory had been running at about 20 percent of capacity over the past three years even before the U.S. car maker announced the shutdown, the latest of steps taken by GM to put profitability and innovation ahead of sales and volume.\nA GM Korea spokesman said on Monday the company was committed to supporting the affected workers. The U.S. automaker launched a voluntary redundancy program last week for all its workers in the nation.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who has recently approved import tariffs on washing machines, took the shutdown announcement last week as an opportunity to launch fresh criticism of the free trade agreement between the United States and South Korea.\nTrump has been critical of the deal ever since his bid for presidential office and the two countries are in renegotiation.\nMoon on Monday also asked his government to act sternly in trade talks with the United States, expressing worry over curbs on imports from other countries recently imposed by Washington.\n“Due to the expansion of U.S. import curbs on our export products like steel, electronics, solar panels and washing machines, I worry about our exports as a whole despite our international competitiveness,” said Moon in the same meeting.\n“I ask the government to act firmly and sternly to unreasonable protectionist measures, such as by lodging complaints to the World Trade Organisation and checking for violations of the U.S.-South Korea free-trade agreement.”\nReporting by Christine Kim; Additional reporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Christopher Cushingand Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T08:42:43.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
