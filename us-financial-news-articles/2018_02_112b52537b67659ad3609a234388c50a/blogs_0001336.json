The foundation of the effort is a plan to create a huge sovereign wealth fund, underwritten by selling shares in the state-owned Aramco.\nThe initial public offering, which could happen this year, is expected to be the world's biggest-ever share sale. Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser recently told CNBC his company is ready for the IPO this year, but is waiting on the government to choose an international list venue.\nAlphabet and Aramco have discussed forming a joint venture that would build data centers around the kingdom, sources familiar with the matter tell the Journal. It remains to be seen which customers the data centers would serve and how large the joint venture would be, but it could be listed in the Saudi stock exchange, the sources said.\nThe talks have been ongoing for months and have involved Alphabet CEO Larry Page, the Journal reports.\nAmazon , one of the leaders in the cloud computing industry, is also reportedly in the mix. Sources tell the Journal it could soon sign a $1 billion deal to build three data centers in Saudi Arabia, with the deal expected to be announced during Salman's anticipated visit to the United States this year.\nSalman is the driving force behind Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, a plan to overhaul the economy that includes a greater focus on the technology sector. A network of data centers could provide the backbone for a burgeoning tech industry in the kingdom.\nThe Journal notes that data centers in Europe currently service Saudi Arabia via undersea cables, an arrangement that slows down traffic.\nSaudi Aramco is primarily focused on pumping oil and refining it into products like gasoline. It has plans to grow its business producing chemicals and plastics, but those are byproducts of fossil fuels.\nAn expansion into operating data centers would mark a significant step toward diversification.\nRead the full story here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:08:20.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
