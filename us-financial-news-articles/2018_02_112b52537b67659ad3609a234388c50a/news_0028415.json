The President is weighing his options and will respond soon,” the White House statement said.\nThe memo rebuts a Republican document claiming FBI and Justice Department bias against Trump in the federal probe of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election.\nReporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Mohammad Zargham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T02:35:26.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
