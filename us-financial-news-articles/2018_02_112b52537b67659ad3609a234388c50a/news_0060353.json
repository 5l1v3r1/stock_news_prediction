Legislation proposed Wednesday would amend the city’s current investment policy to allow for the so-called ESG changes.\n“You have to know that these risks exist especially as an investor of public dollars,” Mr. Summers said in an interview. “Frankly, I see this as enhancing our ability to fulfill our fiduciary responsibility.”\nLocal governments in the U.S. are in the early stages of determining how much weight to give to such “ESG” factors, which can be broadly defined and hard to measure. Many public officials are also struggling to determine which social issues—from diversity to gun control—their municipalities should embrace and how to express those stances through investments of taxpayer dollars.\nPublic pension funds from California to New York currently allocate portions of their portfolios to companies with low carbon emissions or those with strong environmental, social and governance practices.\nChicago’s move would be significant both because it would apply ESG investing across the entire portfolio and because the city invests its operating budget primarily in fixed income. Bond investors are unable to use tools such as proxy votes that are available to stockholders who wish to express frustration with company management.\nThe investment-policy change that Mr. Summers proposed in Chicago could allow the city to invest in new types of fixed income such as green bonds, which typically finance environmentally friendly infrastructure, energy and real-estate projects, as well as bonds issued by foreign governments that are aimed at reducing poverty. The city would consider water and energy use, human and labor rights and executive compensation and shareholder rights when evaluating the new investments.\nChicago’s operating budget is currently invested primarily in highly rated government and corporate bonds.\nCity officials have studied the move to use ESG ratings and data for the past four to six months, opting against changes that would screen out certain bond issuers or require the city to sell current holdings, known as divestment. Alderman John Arena studied potential divestment from fossil-fuel companies about a year ago, before working with Mr. Summers on the current ESG proposal.\nAs interest in ESG issues grows, funds and ratings based on such factors are becoming a growing source of revenue for money managers and data providers. Asset managers launched 40 new “sustainable funds” in 2017, according to fund-research firm Morningstar Inc., up from 10 three years earlier.\nAssets invested in that group of funds—which doesn’t include funds that simply refrain from investing in companies that an investor might find objectionable—grew to $95 billion in 2017, according to Morningstar, up nearly 60% from the prior year.\nMorningstar itself assigns funds a “sustainability rating” based on how well the companies in which they invest manage ESG risks relative to other funds with similar mandates.\nIndex provider MSCI earlier this year highlighted new revenue from ESG ratings as a driver of revenue growth. Revenue from ESG products at MSCI grew about 24% from a year earlier to $14.7 million in the fourth quarter.\nWrite to Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:27:23.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
