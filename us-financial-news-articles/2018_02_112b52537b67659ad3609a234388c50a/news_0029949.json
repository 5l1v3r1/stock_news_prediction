REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach \n“During the first skating lap I knew it felt very good, so my plan was to try to do something quite early on the last skating lap,” she explained. \n“I didn’t know exactly where Marit was, I knew that she was in the group somewhere, so I just tried to focus on my performance and not evaluate what the others did.” \nKalla barely looked over her shoulder during the final three kilometres as she dug deep for victory. \n“There were thoughts about maybe what are the others doing, but I just tried to focus on my performance all the time and just look forward,” she said, acknowledging that she had found it tough.

I don’t feel like I have a chance of a medal, so that’s why I made this choice,” she told broadcaster Eurosport.
