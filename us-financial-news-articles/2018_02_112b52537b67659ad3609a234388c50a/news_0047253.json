We also achieved record margins and new highs in earnings per share – in line with our commitment to deliver sustainable profitable growth,” said Henkel CEO Hans Van Bylen.\n“We focused on the implementation of our strategic priorities and achieved substantial progress with many key initiatives and projects. In the course of the year, we also made several attractive acquisitions which will complement and further strengthen our portfolio.”\nOutlook for 2018\nBased on the strong performance in 2017 and substantial progress made in the implementation of the strategic priorities, Henkel reconfirmed the financial ambition for 2020 – organic sales growth of 2 to 4 percent, continued increase in adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted EPS growth of 7 to 9 percent – and provided its outlook for 2018.\nFor 2018, Henkel expects to generate organic sales growth of 2 to 4 percent with each business unit in this range.
