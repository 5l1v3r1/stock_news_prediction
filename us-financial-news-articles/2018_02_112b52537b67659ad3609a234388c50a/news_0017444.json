And with traditional automakers slow to cannibalize their combustion engine vehicles, he thinks it's going to be hard for them catch up to on electric, despite the production problems plaguing Tesla's new Model 3 sedan, its first vehicle aimed at the mass car-buying market. \n\"If they solve the problem of getting a Roadster to â€¦ [space], they can probably do the same with providing guidance to us on timing. But they're not,\" Rusch said, referring to Musk's other company SpaceX, which earlier this week launched a rocket carrying a Tesla Roadster sports car to demonstrate payload capacity.

(Tesla's loss excluding one-time items was smaller than expected and revenue was slightly better than estimates.) \n\"What I heard last night is they're hedging their production times. We're not totally buying that,\" Rusch said. Tesla doesn't really know how to solve the issues and \"we expect them to have ongoing problems.\" \nTesla said Wednesday evening it's on track to produce 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of its second quarter, a twice-delayed goal that the electric car company had originally projected for the end of 2017. The Model 3, with a starting price at $35,000, is Tesla's first vehicle aimed at the mass market. Robert Ferris | CNBC A Tesla Model 3 on display at a showroom in New York on Jan. 18th, 2018. \nMusk continues to expect to make 1 million vehicles annually by 2020. \nRusch said Tesla needs to own up \"to the fact that they're facing very serious problems.\" But he added Tesla remains well ahead on electric vehicle innovation, which makes the stock interesting. \nRusch has a perform rating on the stock but doesn't have a price target. The highest price target among the Wall Street analysts who cover Tesla is $500 per share. \nTesla closed 3.3 percent higher at $345 per share Wednesday. It was down nearly 2 percent in early trading Thursday. \nOn Wednesday morning, a big believer in Tesla told CNBC she believes the stock will one day trade at $4,000 per share.
