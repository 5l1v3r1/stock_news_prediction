REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo Investments are paying off, Pichai said, noting that cloud computing is generating $1 billion in quarterly sales.\nGoogle sells ad space on its search engine, its fast-growing YouTube video streaming service and a network of third-party websites and apps.\nLed by such ads, Alphabet generated $110.9 billion in full-year revenue, up 23 percent from 2016 and topping $100 billion for the first time.\nBut threats from Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc loom.\n“Amazon has grown its position as the first destination for consumer product searches. This has the potential to cannibalize Google’s revenue from retail advertisers,” wrote Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel who cut his rating to “hold” from “buy”.\nAt least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on Alphabet, while two cut their price on the stock. Susquehanna was the most bullish, raising its price target to $1,475.Jefferies analysts said Alphabet is placing the right bets on some very big opportunities such as YouTube/TV, hardware, GCP, Waymo, which will help fuel sustained growth and meaningful share appreciation over time.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:17:08.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
