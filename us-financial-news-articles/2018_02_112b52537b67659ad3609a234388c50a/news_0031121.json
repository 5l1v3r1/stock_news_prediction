It is set to sign off on its third investment by the end of March, Grimaldi said.\nArmonia’s fundraising is expected to grow to 300 million euros by the middle of July, he added, falling short of its initial goal of raising 700 million euros by the end of 2016.\nGrimaldi said Italy’s banking crisis and the tendency to invest in government bonds rather than the real economy has forced the fund to downsize its ambitions.\nReporting by Massimo Gaia, writing by Agnieszka Flak\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:38:19.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
