The suspects claim self-defense. \nGovernment teams have fanned out across Kalimantan, the habitat of orangutans, to train villagers how to deal with wildlife. \nThe World Wide Fund for Nature estimates there are 104,700 Bornean orangutans, known for their broad faces and dark brown fur, left in the world.
