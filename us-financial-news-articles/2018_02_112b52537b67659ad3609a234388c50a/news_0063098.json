Excluding one-off proceeds from the sale of securities in 2016 the profit rose by 22.4 percent, a statement released by the bank showed. Net attributable profit for October-December was 2.13 billion ringgit ($542.95 million), compared to 2.4 billion ringgit in the corresponding period a year earlier. The result compared with the 2.3 billion ringgit average of estimates from two analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.
