Nine days of declines, since the stock resumed trading in January after a nine-month suspension, have knocked 37.5 billion yuan off the company’s market capitalisation, that is currently at 23.7 billion yuan. \nAt its peak in 2015, Leshi was valued at 153 billion yuan. \nJust last week, Leshi flagged that it expected a loss of 11.6 billion yuan for 2017, more than five times its combined profits since listing on the Shenzhen stock exchange in 2010, due to the ongoing crisis at LeEco. \nLeEco was once China’s Netflix-to-Tesla contender but ran into a cash crunch since late 2016 after expanding too fast. Leshi used to be the main listed unit of the conglomerate. \nBut under the control of property developer Sunac China ( 1918.HK ) - its second-largest shareholder, Leshi is now trying to distance itself from the LeEco brand. \nLeshi says its largest shareholder Jia and related LeEco units owe it 7.5 billion yuan. LeEco disputes the figure. \nShares of Sunac plunged as much as 6 percent, lagging a nearly 2 percent fall for the benchmark index .HSI .
