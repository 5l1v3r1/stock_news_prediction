Allen.\nHowever, it cut the net income estimate to $2.1 billion for the year, from $2.6 billion earlier, on U.S. tax reform-related adjustments of $750 million. Adjusted net earnings for the year are projected to be $2.85 billion.\nEquipment sales rose 27 percent year-on-year to $5.97 billion in the first quarter. The company said sales in the quarter were weighed down by supply chain and logistical delays in shipping products to their dealers.\nThe company expects U.S. net farm cash income to drop by 5 percent this year from 2017. The decrease, however, is estimated to be smaller than expected earlier.\nYet, it expects higher demand for large agricultural equipment to lift industry sales in the United States and Canada , Deere's biggest market, by 10 percent this year.\nIn South America , sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat to up 5 percent in 2018.\nWirtgen's acquisition is expected to lift full-year sales at its construction and forestry division by 80 percent. The segment, which is primarily focused on the North American market, saw a 57 percent jump in net sales in the latest quarter.\nDeere posted a net loss of $535.1 million, or $1.66 per share, including a $965 million charged related to U.S. tax reform. A year earlier, it recorded net income of $199.0 million, or 62 cents per share.\nAdjusted net income was $430.0 million, or $1.31 per share.\nOverall revenues rose 23 percent to $6.91 billion in the quarter ending Jan. 28.\nThe company's shares, which have outperformed S&P 500 this year, were down 1 percent at $164.75 in premarket trading on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has gained over 50 percent in the past one year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T21:36:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
