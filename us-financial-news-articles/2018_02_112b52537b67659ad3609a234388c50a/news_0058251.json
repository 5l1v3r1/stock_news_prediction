It listed its distribution unit in December and has raised billions of dollars in debt including a $3 billion loan with a Japanese export credit agency last month.\nADGM, which opened in October 2015, and the older and larger Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are the United Arab Emirates’ two international hubs for banking and fund management.\nThe launch of ADGM was part of Abu Dhabi’s drive to widen its footprint in the Gulf’s competitive financial services industry.\nADGM contains about 60 regulated financial institutions, among 700 or more companies registered there, according to an ADGM official. DIFC, established in 2004, had 1,750 incorporated companies as of June 2017.\n“Many banks will set up a presence, even a small one to ensure they get a slice of the business in Abu Dhabi,” the banker said. “No one would like to miss out on the business in Abu Dhabi, which has deep pockets and huge ambitions.”\nAbu Dhabi is looking to raise billions of dollars by listing some of its state-backed companies such as Emirates Global Aluminium, Abu Dhabi Ports and industrial conglomerate Senaat.\n“ADGM is the creation of the government so Abu Dhabi Inc should use ADGM as much as possible, that’s logical,” said Philippe Richard, director of international affairs at Abu Dhabi Global Market.
