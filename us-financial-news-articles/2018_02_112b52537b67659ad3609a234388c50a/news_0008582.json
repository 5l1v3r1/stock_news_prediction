It is also a fresh sign of a thaw in inter-Korean relations after months of tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes.\nSeoul banned all North Korean ships entering its ports and cut off most inter-Korean exchanges, including tourism, trade and aid, in 2010 in the wake of a torpedo attack by the North on a South Korean navy warship that killed 46 sailors.\nThe art troupe from the North is led by star singer Hyun Song Wol and is scheduled to perform at Gangneung, near the Games venue of Pyeongchang, on Thursday and in Seoul on Sunday.\nIt will use the vessel for transportation and lodging, the Unification Ministry said.\nThe ship last crossed into South Korean waters when it carried a North Korean cheer squad for the 2002 Asian Games in the port city of Busan.\nKARAOKE, ICE CREAM Named after a mountain peak, the Mangyongbong 92 was given by a group of pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan in 1992 to Kim Il Sung, the North’s national founder and grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un, to celebrate his 80th birthday, according to the Unification Ministry. It features dozens of cabins of different classes, including special rooms where Kim Jong Un’s father and grandfather stayed, as well as a restaurant, a bar equipped with a karaoke machine, and a shop where guests can buy souvenirs and snacks, such as ice cream, video footage and images from the 2002 show.\nIt can carry 350 passengers, Seoul officials said.\nThe ethnic Koreans who donated the ferry had used it to travel between Japan and North Korea, sending money and other resources back to North.\nHowever, Japan barred the ship from its waters in 2006 in response to a long-range missile test by the North, resulting in a sharp fall in trade, remittances and other exchanges.\nThe ferry had also been suspected by Japan and others of being used to smuggle parts for Pyongyang’s illicit nuclear and missile programmes.\nNorth Korea’s state media has rejected the smuggling accusations as a plot to “justify the hostile policy” of the United States and its allies.\n“The conservative media and persons claimed that the use of ‘Mangyongbong-92’ ... during the Olympic period falls foul of the ‘independent sanctions’ by the U.S. and South Korea,” the official KCNA news agency said last month, when the two Koreas were holding talks on the North’s participation in the Games.\n“This represents the unpleasant and uneasy mind of the U.S. and the South Korean conservative forces displeased with the trend for the improvement of the north-south relations created after entering the new year,” it said.\nReporting by Hyonhee Shin in SEOUL; Additional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in GANGNEUNG, South Korea; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:00:02.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
