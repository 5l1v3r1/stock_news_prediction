The bank denies these allegations. Fearing U.S. sanctions, depositors have withdraw around 600 million euros ($737.6 million) from the bank, forcing the European Central Bank to halt all payments to prevent a collapse of the lender. “ABLV is not regarded as a systemic bank, which means the government would not rescue it because its exposure to the Latvian economy is low,” the minister said.
