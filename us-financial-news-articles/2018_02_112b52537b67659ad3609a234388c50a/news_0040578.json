The company estimates that about 1,900 people work directly on its data center campuses. \nThese investments will bring Google's footprint to 21 states, with data centers in six. \nEarlier this year, fellow tech giant Apple also announced plans to increase its investment in the US economy, saying that it would create 20,000 new jobs and open a new campus . In his State of the Union speech, President Trump credited last year's tax reform with spurring Apple's plans, though it isn't clear how much of the new investment can actually be attributed to tax changes .
