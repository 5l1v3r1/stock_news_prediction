Cutting them would free up more capital to fund productive sectors of the economy, which is slowly recovering.\n“If such an improvement is achieved by 2019, then banks will be better able to dedicate their resources ... to their traditional business,” Nouy said.\nGreece has passed new laws to facilitate the workout of NPLs but needs to speed up electronic auctions of foreclosed properties, a key term of its 86-billion euro bailout, she said.\n“Passing laws is just the first step; they also need to be implemented and applied. And here, it seems that things could move faster. For example, an effective and efficient implementation of e-auctions is essential,” she said.\nThe ECB is due to publish the results of a stress test of Greece’s four largest banks in May.\nNouy said that the outcome will be known before the end of the bailout program “so that any follow-up action, if needed, can be taken in good time.”\n“This EBA stress test is not a pass or fail exercise,” she said, adding that the need for a recapitalization will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the ECB’s Supervisory Board.\nReporting by George Georgiopoulos; Writing by Renee Maltezou; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T18:27:22.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
