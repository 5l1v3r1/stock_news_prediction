The central and northern Rockies also will see heavy snow, the National Weather Service said. \nCity officials announced school closures in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee because of the weather. \nNational Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley said on Friday that the system was likely to drop another four or five inches (10 or 12.5 cm) of snow on the Midwest by the evening as it headed east toward New England. \nThe storm could dump up to a foot (30 cm) of snow in New York state as it picks up moisture off the Great Lakes, he added. \nAbout 1,500 U.S. flights were canceled, with about a third of flights into or out of Chicago and Detroit airports called off, according to FlightAware.com, which tracks airline traffic. \nWinter weather this week killed people in accidents in the Midwest, including six in Iowa, two in Missouri and one in Montana, local media in those states reported.
