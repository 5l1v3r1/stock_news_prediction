For their successors, being Europe’s economic locomotive and fiercest defender of human rights was identity enough.\nBut, announcing the coalition on Wednesday, Merkel suggested she thought there should be something more.\n“Germany, or our country: these aren’t impersonal terms for us,” she said. “Those are men and women, old and young, entrepreneurs and employees, people with and without immigrant backgrounds, researchers and company founders, people in hospitals and care homes, our soldiers and police. They are the people we do politics for.”\nThe job is earmarked for Horst Seehofer, leader of the arch-conservative Bavarian sister party (CSU) to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU).\nHis home state Bavaria, where he is premier, already has a minister with responsibility for the Heimat. Among its major tasks is the building out of fast internet infrastructure.\nSeehofer told journalists his focus as Heimat minister would be sharply practical. It was not about “dirndls and lederhosen”, he said in Munich on Thursday, but about developing villages and towns and building houses.\nThe coalition agreement contained little to shed light on his new role and it was unclear what kind of a budget the Heimat component of the ministry would have. The coalition could still be rejected by the SPD’s members, who have veto rights.\nBut that was not enough to stop the mockery. A fake Twitter account purporting to be the new ministry’s urged Germans to “take a walk in the German forest, listen to the birds, reflect and feel your bond with the Heimat”.
