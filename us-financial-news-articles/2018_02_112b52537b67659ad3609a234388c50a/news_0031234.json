The rand had strengthened on signs that Zuma could be ousted even before his second term as president ends.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:40:24.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
