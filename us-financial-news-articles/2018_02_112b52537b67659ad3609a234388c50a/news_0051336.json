Their struggles have weighed on their landlords, the healthcare real estate investment trusts that own their facilities, such as Welltower Inc and Sabra Health Care REIT Inc\nShares of Brookdale fell 19 percent to $7.18, a nine-year low, after the company rejected a $9 per share buyout offer and said it believed it could create more value under a new chief executive after ending a year-long strategic review.\nReporting by Tracy Rucinski; Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:56:25.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
