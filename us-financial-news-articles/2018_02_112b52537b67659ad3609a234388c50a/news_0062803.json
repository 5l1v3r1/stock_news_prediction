The U.N. refugee agency has been excluded from the repatriation process.\n“The Rohingya community desperately needs immediate, life-saving assistance, long-term solutions and justice,” Guterres said on Monday.\nAdditional reporting by Stephanie Nebehay in GENEVA; Writing by Simon Lewis; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T11:40:37.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
