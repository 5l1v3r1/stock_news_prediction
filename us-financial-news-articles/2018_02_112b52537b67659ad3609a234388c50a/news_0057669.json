As a guide, the global average for expat income is $99,903. Here are the top 5 cities for expat job opportunities: 5. Birmingham The canals of Birmingham, U.K. \nAverage expat earnings: $61,950 \nSecuring fifth place in the ranking is Birmingham in the U.K. The city has enjoyed a period of regeneration in recent years, with the British government's efforts to encourage business outside of the country's capital. \nThough expats working in Birmingham earn well below the global average, more than half (51 percent) praised the city's affordable cost of living, saying they enjoy a higher level of disposable income now than they did in their home city. 4. Dublin View of Ha'penny bridge on bright sunny day in Dublin, Ireland. \nAverage expat earnings: $91,419 \nIreland's capital Dublin was in fourth place. Home to the European headquarters of major companies such as Google and Facebook , Dublin has become something of a tech hub, accounting for the highest proportion of expats working in technology globally (39 percent). \nWhile Dublin is known for its high cost of living, expats rated the city's social scene. Two-thirds of expats living in the capital said their work-life balance had improved since moving there. 3. New York Roberto Machado Noa | LightRocket | Getty Images One57 building in the skyline of New York City as seen from the Rockefeller Center Observation Deck. \nAverage expat earnings: $182,240 \nA regular in the rankings for top expat cities, New York took third place this year. The home of Wall Street, New York's thriving financial center makes it a huge draw for bankers and other finance professionals. \nThough expat earnings in New York are among the highest in the world, respondents noted that came at the expense of their physical health. Just 40 percent of expats said they had become more active in New York than they were in their home city. 2. London vladimir zakharov | Moment Open | Getty Images \nAverage expat earnings: $107,836 \nDespite concerns about the impact of Brexit on the U.K. economy, London was ranked second place for expat job opportunities. Nearly half (49 percent) cited excellent job opportunities in the British capital. \nThe average expat salary is almost 10 percent above the global average, which is especially impressive given that the city has the second highest proportion of millennial expats (52 percent). However, the city is still criticized for its high cost of living. 1. San Francisco The Painted Ladies, Victorian-style houses with downtown at dusk in the background, \nAverage expat earnings: $207,227 \nWith a booming economy and leading position in the tech world, San Francisco secured prime position this year. The majority of expats in San Francisco (57 percent) rated the city as having fantastic job opportunities â€” well above the global average of 25 percent. \nThough the city has a high cost of living, it is also home to the second highest average expat salary globally, and many respondents said they enjoyed a better home and car in San Francisco than in their home city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T02:01:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
