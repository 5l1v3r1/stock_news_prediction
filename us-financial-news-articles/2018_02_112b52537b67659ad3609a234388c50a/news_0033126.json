Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities were Broadcom's financial advisors.\nQualcomm's shares were up marginally premarket at $65.69, while Broadcom's stock dipped 0.5 percent to $243.18.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T19:13:31.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
