The work requirement applies to able-bodied working age Medicaid enrollees, according to HHS. \nPregnant women, medically frail enrollees, students, some caregivers and people in substance use treatment are among those that are exempted from the requirements. \nKentucky became the first state to impose work requirements on its Medicaid recipients last month. \nAt least eight additional states, mostly Republican-led, have proposed similar changes to Medicaid: Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
