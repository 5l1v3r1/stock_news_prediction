There was importer demand and we saw some foreign banks buying dollars, may be for a profit repatriation,” said a currency dealer. \n“A state bank sold some dollars in the morning, but that was not enough to prevent the fall.” \nDealers expect a 2-3 percent depreciation in the rupee and higher volatility this year on account of debt repayment by the government. \nPresident Maithripala Sirisena’s administration must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.85 billion) in 2018 - a record high - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans and a total of $5.36 billion in interest. \nForeign investors bought 5.9 billion rupees worth of government securities this year up to Jan. 30, central bank data showed. \nThe rupee fell 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016.
