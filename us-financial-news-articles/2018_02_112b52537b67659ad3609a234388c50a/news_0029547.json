[L8N1Q411O]\n“It worked well for a long time until it didn‘t. Which is generally what happens in markets,” Thiam said, noting the prospectus made clear the product was not for amateurs and warned about the risk of substantial losses.\nHe conceded, however, that he could not predict whether law suits would result.\n“It is not in my gift to predict whether there’ll be a litigation against us or not ... the prospectus is extremely clear, I have had to read it myself,” he told analysts on a conference call.\n“We believe that the disclosures made and the kind of role we played, which is really to be manufacturers, we mostly interacted with market makers and were not involved in the distribution (of the product), leaves us in a reasonable position,” he said.\nThe events of the past week, combined with activist investor pressure, have put the bank’s image in focus.\n“This is the year when they have to prove that it is working,” said Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Vontonbel, commenting on Thiam’s efforts to make the bank profitable.\nCredit Suisse did not identify which country or countries the Asia hiring probe is focused on. Asia became a focal point for Thiam shortly after he joined in the middle of 2015.\nSeveral of Credit Suisse’s rivals have in recent years faced scrutiny over their hiring, in particular of the children of important Chinese officials, known as “princelings”.\nIt was a practice that became common over the past two decades as banks scrambled to build “guanxi” – connections, or mutual obligations - with important Chinese officials.\nHelman Sitohang, Credit Suisse’s CEO for Asia Pacific, said: “We have decided to put up the disclosure, but ... the only thing I can say (is) ... that we are cooperating with the authorities on that.”\nIn 2016, JPMorgan paid $264 million to U.S. authorities to resolve allegations it hired the relatives of Chinese officials to win banking deals.\nWhile personal connections have long been a way of doing business in much of Asia, the scrutiny from U.S. regulators ensured the issue became increasingly sensitive in recent years.\nAdditional reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi in Zurich.
