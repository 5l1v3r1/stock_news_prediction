The expanded resources and market awareness from our initial public offering put us in a stronger position to execute on our long-term goals as we continue delivering innovation across our identity platform to address the evolving security and compliance needs of global enterprises.\"\nFinancial Highlights for Fourth Quarter 2017:\nRevenue: Total revenue was $67.8 million, a 53% increase over Q4 2016.

An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nFinancial Outlook:\nFor the first quarter of 2018, SailPoint expects:\nRevenue in the range of $44 million to $45 million Non-GAAP loss from operations in the range of $(0.5) million to $(1.5) million Non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted common share in the range of $(0.03) to $(0.04), based on estimated cash income tax payments of $0.4 million and 86.5 million basic and diluted common shares outstanding. Expectations of non-GAAP loss from operations and non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted common share exclude stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nFor the full year 2018, SailPoint expects:\nRevenue in the range of $220 million to $224 million Non-GAAP income from operations in the range of $12 million to $14 million Non-GAAP net income per diluted common share in the range of $0.04 to $0.06, based on estimated cash income tax payments of $1.8 million and 93 million diluted common shares outstanding. Expectations of non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per diluted common share exclude stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nThese statements regarding SailPoint’s expectations of its financial outlook are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to “Forward-Looking Statements” below for information on the factors that could cause its actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nAll of SailPoint’s forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures exclude estimates for stock-based compensation expense. SailPoint has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted common shares to their most directly comparable GAAP measure due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections, particularly with respect to stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense is affected by future hiring, turnover, and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of our common stock, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to change. The actual amount of the excluded stock-based compensation expense will have a significant impact on SailPoint’s GAAP income (loss) from operations and GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted common share. Accordingly, reconciliations of our forward-looking non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted common shares are not available without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call and Webcast:\nSailPoint will host a conference call today, February 21, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results. The dial-in number will be 877-407-0792 or 201-689-8263. A live webcast of the conference call will be available on SailPoint’s website at https://investors.sailpoint.com .\nFollowing the conference call, a replay will be available until midnight on March 7, 2018. The replay dial-in number will be 844-512-2921 or 412-317-6671, using the replay pin number: 13675283.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn addition to SailPoint’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), SailPoint uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance SailPoint’s understanding of past performance and future prospects. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flow that includes or excludes amounts that are included or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. SailPoint monitors the non-GAAP financial measures described below, and SailPoint’s management believes they are helpful to investors because they provide an additional tool to use in evaluating SailPoint’s financial and business trends and operating results. In addition, SailPoint’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare SailPoint’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis and for budgeting and planning purposes. In particular, SailPoint believes that non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA, are important measures for evaluating SailPoint’s performance because it facilitates comparisons of SailPoint’s core operating results from period to period by removing, where applicable, the impact of SailPoint’s capital structure (net interest income or expense from SailPoint’s outstanding debt, as well as amortization of debt issuance costs and expenses related to call protection on early payment of debt), asset base (depreciation and amortization), income taxes, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation.\nSailPoint’s non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry because they may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently than we do. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. SailPoint urges you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\nNon-GAAP income (loss) from operations . SailPoint believes that the use of non-GAAP income (loss) from operations is helpful to our investors to clarify and enhance their understanding of past performance and future prospects. Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations is calculated as income (loss) from operations on a GAAP basis excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense and (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) available to common shareholders per basic and diluted share . SailPoint believes that the use of non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) available to common shareholders per basic and diluted share is helpful to our investors to clarify and enhance their understanding of past performance and future prospects. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is calculated as net income (loss) excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles and (iii) amortization of debt issuance costs, including loss on modification and partial extinguishment of debt (iv) expense related to call protection on early payment of debt and (v) income tax expense (benefit) and including (i) cash income taxes paid. SailPoint defines non-GAAP net income (loss) available to common shareholders per basic and diluted share as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the non-GAAP weighted average outstanding common shares, which is calculated as if the conversion of our preferred stock, and related accumulated and unpaid dividend occurred at the beginning of each respective period.\nAdjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that SailPoint calculates as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation expense.\nThe accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis press release and statements made during the above referenced conference call may contain \"forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including regarding the Company's growth rate and its expectations regarding future revenue, operating income or loss or earnings or loss per share.

These statements are not guarantees of future performance, but are based on management's current expectations, assumptions and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our expectations expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements may not turn out to be correct. Our results could be materially different from our expectations because of various risks.\nImportant factors, some of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results or those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include the following: our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to deepen our relationships with existing customers; our expectations regarding our customer growth rate; our ability to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and further develop strategic relationships; our ability to develop or acquire new solutions, improve our platform and solutions and increase the value of and benefits associated with our platform and solutions; our ability to compete successfully against current and future competitors; our plans to further invest in and grow our business, and our ability to effectively manage our growth and associated investments; our ability to adapt and respond to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing regulations and changing customer needs; our ability to maintain and enhance our brand or reputation as an industry leader and innovator; our ability to hire, retain, train and motivate our senior management team and key employees; our ability to successfully enter new markets and manage our international expansion; adverse economic conditions in the United States, Europe or the global economy; significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the public sector; actual or perceived failures by us to comply with privacy policy or legal or regulatory requirements; our ability to maintain third-party licensed software in or with our solutions; and our ability to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies. These and other important risk factors are described more fully in our reports and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the detailed factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in the final prospectus for our initial public offering, dated November 16, 2017, and could cause actual results to vary from expectations.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date as of which such statement is made, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nAbout SailPoint\nSailPoint, the leader in enterprise identity governance, brings the Power of Identity to customers around the world.
