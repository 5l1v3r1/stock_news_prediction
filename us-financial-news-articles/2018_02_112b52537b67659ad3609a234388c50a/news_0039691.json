Only adults able to lawfully own and possess a firearm are eligible to win the prize.\nSeveral people on social media criticized Tannahill for not canceling his contest after the Florida shooting, calling him out of touch.\n“Winner of the tone deaf awards: Tyler Tannahill for Congress. Maybe don’t give away an AR-15 on your page THE DAY ONE IS USED TO KILL CHILDREN. #Shame,” Matthew Herbert said on Twitter on Thursday.\nTwitter user Stacy Myers called Tannahill a “horrible, horrible creature” and said the giveaway made her ill.\nTannahill is a candidate for an open seat in Kansas’ second congressional district. The primary is scheduled for Aug. 7, and the general election is on Nov. 6. The district includes Kansas’ capital city Topeka.\nReporting by Karen Pierog in ChicagoEditing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:40:34.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
