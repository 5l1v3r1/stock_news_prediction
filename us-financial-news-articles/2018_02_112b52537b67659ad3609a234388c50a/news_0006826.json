(OTC PINK:ETST) (“ETST\" or the “Company\"), an innovative biotech company focused on the cannabinoid (CBD), nutraceutical and pharmaceutical fields, as well as on R&D for certain medical devices, today announces the appointments of a new chief sales officer (CSO), chief financial officer (CFO), and chief learning officer (CLO).\nAs part of ETST’s previously announced goals for the first quarter of 2018, the Company has expanded its core executive team to now include Jill Buzan as CSO, Wendell Hecker as CFO, and prior CSO Gabriel Aviles to the role of CLO to maximally leverage strengths and lead to bottom-line growth in 2018.\nCSO Buzan, an established veteran of the natural product sales industry, began her successful career as a sales rep and broker in Florida in 1995. She has pioneered many brands and helped them grow and become leaders in the industry including Gaia Herbs , Natural-Immunogenics and Sunwarrior . She loves taking outstanding products to market! Her passion since 1979 has been natural health and healing through food, supplements, exercise, lifestyle and helping others achieve their full potential on all levels, physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. Her sales strength, and financial success comes from this passion and using an education based and consultative sales approach with her customers. Her intention with ETST is to create a dynamic group of sales people who, together, can make ETST the top-selling CDB company in the industry. Jill already has multiple chain store accounts lined up for the Company’s revamped line , which is launching within the first week of February.\nBuzan states, “Having worked with so many budding natural products brands, I know what it takes for a company to find success in this market, and ETST has it. The executive team is motivated, hard-working, and talented. I will be building a strong sales team this year, and we envision opening a record number of new accounts in 2018.”\nCFO Hecker achieved a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from New York University. Having spent more than 30 years at large corporations in New York and Florida, he brings to ETST extensive accounting experience. Hecker will ensure that the Company’s accounting follows best practices, keeps up-to-date, and increases transparency with investors as sales continue to increase. He will help also the Company maintain compliance when up-listed to the OTCQB exchange .\nHecker comments, “This company is on the cusp of increasing sales dramatically. It’s the right time to get the books in order and ensure compliance as the company grows and joins the QB Tier of the OTC Markets.”\nAviles, the Company’s current CSO, will transition to the role of CLO to help further educate store owners and clients, assist in the new foundation , and help build brand integrity. Aviles plans to publish articles, record informative videos, conduct webinars, attend conferences, and help educate the Company’s growing sales team to provide the informative service to accounts.\nAviles shares, “Education puts me in my element. While I enjoyed my time as the CSO, I feel I will have much more impact on helping the company grow as the CLO, and Ms. Buzan definitely has what it takes to lead our organization’s sales efforts to the next level.”\nNickolas S. Tabraue, ETST’s president, director and COO concludes, “I have been extremely fortunate to have found hard working like-minded individuals to work together and achieve our company’s overarching vision. The year has only just begun, and we are already looking very strong. I expect to have a lot of exciting updates to share with our stakeholders very soon.”\nAbout Earth Science Tech, Inc.
