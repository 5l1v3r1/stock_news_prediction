Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, on Tuesday fell to a three-month low under $6,000 before rebounding to $8,119 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. \nSuch financial products offer ways for investors to hedge risk, he said. “But you have to make sure they’re appropriate and well designed.” \n“With the stock market having a bit of a bumpy ride over the last days, there’s a question as volatility goes up, will that cause people to sell stocks,” Dudley said. “If that were the case, that could cause the stock market to be bumpy in the future.” \nWith the rebound in financial markets since Monday, Dudley said he has not changed his view about steady U.S. economic growth. \n“My outlook hasn’t changed because the stock market is a bit lower than where it was a few days ago. It’s still up sharply than a year (ago),” he said. \nDudley had been chief economist at Goldman Sachs for a decade before being appointed to head the New York Fed in 2007. He announced in November he would step down from his Fed position in mid-2018. \nThe VIX index ended down over 7 percent at 27.73, almost 50 percent lower than its highest level since August 2015 reached on Tuesday. \n(Graphic: Volatility uncorked - reut.rs/2BG8RlH ) \n(Graphic: Stocks and volatility - reut.rs/2BIKcx6 ) \nWELL FARGO‘S CULTURE \nWhile Dudley gave his thoughts about this week’s market volatility, he spoke mainly about banking culture on a panel where he and others said progress has been made since the global credit crisis but more could be done to bolster investor and consumer confidence and bank employee morale. \nBad incentive structures for employees and a lack of communication to management contributed to Wells Fargo & Co’s sales practices scandal, Dudley said. \nDudley said that Wells Fargo employees were given “really bad” incentives. He added that when employees complained, it went up the chain of command but concerns either were not heard or ignored. \nThe bank reached a $190 million settlement with U.S. authorities in 2016 over its employees opening accounts in customers’ names without their permission to hit sales targets. \nOn Friday, Wells Fargo detailed new regulatory restrictions imposed by the Fed, including a cap on its assets until it improves its governance and controls. \nDudley said he is generally pleased with the “substantial progress” among banks to improve company culture and conduct, but that there is more room to grow.
