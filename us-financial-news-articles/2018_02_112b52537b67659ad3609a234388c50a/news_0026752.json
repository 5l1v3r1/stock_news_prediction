He was drawn to luge over bobsledding because the line was shorter and you could get more runs in. \"It was just the most fun I could have in the winter,\" Mazdzer said.\nAt 13 years old, he travelled to Europe on his own as part of the junior national team.\n\"I wasn't the strongest athlete. I wasn't the best luge athlete,\" Mazdzer said. \"But if you told me to chop off my hand because I would go faster, I would do it.

Consequently, many of them face financial challenges.\n\"I have tons of stories of athletes trying to struggle and make the Olympic team, because that's the environment that I'm in,\" Mazdzer said.\nSeeing those experiences has motivated Mazdzer to help.\nMazdzer, who has a bachelor's degree in business administration with a concentration in finance from DeVry University, is now studying to become a certified financial planner.
