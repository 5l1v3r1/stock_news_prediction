Though we believe this situation will be manageable, it will clearly keep WFC in the penalty box for a bit longer,” he added. \nRegional banks also fell, tracking large-cap banks’ shares. The KBW Regional Banking index slipped 0.7 percent. SunTrust Banks Inc and M&T Bank Corp fell around one percent each, while Comerica Inc and State Street Corp dipped 0.6 percent each. \n“I think some concerns might be creeping into the group given this enforcement from the regulators. The Fed is definitely messaging that the industry shouldn’t take regulators lightly and that enforcement is going to be harsh if you cross the line,” KBW’s Grant said.
