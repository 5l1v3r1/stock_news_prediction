The fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 contains 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in fiscal year ended January 28, 2017 and January 2018 contains five weeks versus four weeks in January 2017.

We now expect the fourth quarter earnings to be a loss of between $.55 and $.65 versus a loss of $.48 last year. This includes our revised estimate of a one-time tax expense of between $.40 and $.50 as a result of the implementation of the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\". This non cash expense is comprised of two items. The first is the deemed repatriation charge due to our foreign operations. The second is the recalculation of deferred tax assets, which was understated in the December sales release but is now updated due to further clarification. The Company's estimate for full year earnings per diluted share is in the range of $.30 to $.40 versus $1.72 last year.\"\nThe Company will release fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 earnings on Thursday, March 22, 2018.\nDuring January, the Company closed four stores.
