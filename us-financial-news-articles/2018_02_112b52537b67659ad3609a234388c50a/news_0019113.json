It will mean changes in how Canada regulates selling weapons ... I want us to hold ourselves to a higher standard,” said Freeland.\nA Canadian government source estimated that the clamp down could shave three percent off annual sales. Foreign ministry figures for 2016 show Canada exported military goods and technology worth C$718 million ($570.20 million).\nAccording to data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Canada placed 15th on the list of arms exporters in the period from 2012-2016, accounting for 0.9 percent of global sales. The United States was first with 33 percent and Russia second with 23 percent.\nIn 2016, Canada’s Liberal government was criticized for deciding to honor a contract to sell light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia, despite concerns about human rights.\nFreeland told legislators that a probe by foreign ministry officials had found no conclusive evidence that Canadian-made vehicles were used in human rights violations.\nReporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T00:53:50.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
