We gave it all away. Don’t tell the label,” says the message at the start of the video\nBefore its release, Drake, 31, called the video “the most important thing I have ever done in my career.”\nEmotional fans took to Twitter with effusive praise.\n“If you’ve seen Drake’s God’s Plan video and it didn’t hit your heart then I just don’t know. That man’s doing it right,” tweeted one man, Michael McGraw.\n“Cried reaaaal tears looking at God’s plan music video. it’s a good life,” a user called Janae wrote on Twitter.\nHours later the Grammy-winning singer issued a challenge on his Instagram saying “let’s all watch the world be nice to each other even if it’s for 24 hours.”\n“God’s Plan” has held the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for the past three weeks.\nReporting by Jill Serjeant\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:28:28.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
