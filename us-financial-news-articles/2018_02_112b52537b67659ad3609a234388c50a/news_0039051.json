After a rally last week before a five-year domestic bond sale, the cedi has fallen as corporate demand for dollars resumed. It was trading at 4.4850 to the dollar at 1035 GMT on Thursday compared with 4.4650 a week ago.\n“The pair is expected to be repriced at 4.48-4.50 levels, consistent with regular demand and supply from fundamental economic activities, away from the ‘bond-inflow’ induced levels seen last week,” said Biggles Amponsah of Accra--based Northstar Home Finance.\nTANZANIA The Tanzanian shilling is expected to trade little changed against the dollar in the coming days, helped by subdued demand for dollars from major importers.\nCommercial banks Quote: d the shilling at 2,253/2,258 to the dollar on Thursday, stronger than 2,255/2,260 a week ago.\n“The shilling is expected to remain stable at same levels next week or could strengthen slightly due to month-end inflows of dollars,” said a trader at CRDB Bank.
