One factor that could unnerve them is the speculation that Amazon could bid for rights to boost its Prime subscription service. \nAmazon, the world’s biggest retailer, has already bought rights for tennis and America’s National Football League to bolster its Amazon Prime membership service which offers free delivery and content for a flat monthly fee. \nAll the groups have declined to comment on their approach to the auction. \nThe Premier League auction will make 200 live games available out of the 380 played each season, divided into seven lots, with five big packages and two smaller ones. \nThe auction will include occasions when a whole round of matches will be shown at the same time, a proposal that may be more attractive for a digital player than one of the pay TV groups. \nAnalysts believe Sky and BT would be happy to retain a similar line-up of games to the one they have now, with Sky showing Sunday afternoon matches that pit the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur against each other, while BT could retain Saturday games. \nIn 2015 Sky paid 4.2 billion pounds for its three-year package, equivalent to 11.1 million pounds per game, while BT paid 960 million pounds for its games, equivalent to 7.6 million pounds a match. \nBoth will be reluctant to overbid. Sky had to cut costs, hike prices and drop other sports to afford the previous auction while BT is yet to recover from an accounting scandal in Italy that forced it to issue a major profit warning. \n“In the last auction Sky went into panic mode and clearly overspent,” said industry analyst Paolo Pescatore from CCS Insight. \n“I think for this auction Sky will take a far more sensible approach in the way they will bid for the packages they want.” ($1 = 0.7206 pounds) (Reporting by Kate Holton and Paul Sandle; Editing by Adrian Croft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:33:21.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
