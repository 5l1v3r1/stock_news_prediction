REUTERS/Alvin Baez It also wants more details on key structural reforms, notably labor. The board suggested that Rossello make Puerto Rico an at-will employer and make severance and Christmas bonuses optional, both of which are norms among U.S. states.\nThe board criticized Rossello’s proposed reduction of capital expenditures to $400 million a year, saying there had “been no project or agency-specific analysis” to support that figure and that the plan should provide for expenditures “necessary to maintain assets of the commonwealth.”\nSlideshow (7 Images) The board also sought more detail on Rossello’s vision for Puerto Rico’s energy grid, which was decimated by Maria.\nRossello has announced plans to privatize Puerto Rico’s bankrupt, quasi-public power utility, PREPA.\nBut the governor’s plan must “support a transaction by providing a set of targets for a potential bidder to meet or exceed during the bidding process,” the board said.\nIt said the plan should provide a five-year outlook for financial stability at the utility, and for the creation of an independent energy regulator with commissioners appointed by the governor, from a candidate list developed by an independent expert panel.\nReporting by Nick Brown; editing by G Crosse and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T01:55:48.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
