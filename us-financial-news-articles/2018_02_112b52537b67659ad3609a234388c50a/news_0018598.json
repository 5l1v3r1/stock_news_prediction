( reut.rs/2BjRneb ) \n“Barring any significant back up in interest rates or financial crisis that slows the economy, it is quite possible that 2018 retail sales hit the high end and top 2014’s 4.3 percent growth,” said Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics. \nThe retail sales numbers exclude automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants, NRF said. \nWhile demand will be elevated across the whole of 2018, GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders warned that spending will soften towards the end of the year due to tougher comparatives and waning benefit of bonuses.
