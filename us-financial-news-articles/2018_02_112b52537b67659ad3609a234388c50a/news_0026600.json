It is similar to an existing project of Telefónica’s in Chile, which has struggled with a multi-year drought.\nThe project in Chile covers 17,000 hectares and ten crops in four regions, and uses specialized equipment whose sensors measure humidity and solar activity, among others, and send data via a low-cost wireless network.\nFAO said the project would be replicated in areas of Central America’s “Dry Corridor” which runs through Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.\nHome to about 10.5 million people, experts say it is vulnerable to extreme weather exacerbated by climate change.\nOnce the data is processed, farmers get recommendations specific to their crops on their smartphones, leading to a 20 percent reduction in water usage, said Vicente Muñoz, Telefónica’s chief officer on the Internet of Things (IoT).\n“So we have the experience, the knowledge, and the distribution for this collaboration with FAO,” Muñoz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nIoT refers to devices such as mobile phones, computers, cars and refrigerators that are connected to the internet.\nMany of the world’s 460-500 million smallholder farmers have limited resources in terms of labor, education, training and finance, experts say. In areas such as Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, they produce up to 80 percent of the food consumed.\nReporting by Thin Lei Win @thinink.
