In a Feb. 7-17 survey by pollster Ifop for the weekly Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper, 44 percent of respondents said they were satisfied with Macron, down 6 points from Ifop’s previous poll in January. It was the lowest approval rating for Macron since October, when it stood at 42 percent. The government announced plans in early February to modernise the public administration in a country with one of the highest public spending ratios in the world. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the government would have no qualms about making changes in the public sector, even if it encounters resistance. His budget minister Gerald Darmanin also said a voluntary redundancy plan for government employees could be a possible move.
