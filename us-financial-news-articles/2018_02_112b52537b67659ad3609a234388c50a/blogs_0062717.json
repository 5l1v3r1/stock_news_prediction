It added the regulatory process in Europe was further advanced than in the United States where the deal also requires clearance.\nFrench seeds producer Vilmorin said it would consider taking over some vegetable seed activities put up for sale by Bayer.\n“It will depend on the breakdown that will be made. If there are clever and targeted things to do, why not, but if it’s all-encompassing then clearly we don’t have the profile for it to be accepted by the authorities,” Vilmorin Chief Executive Daniel Jacquemond told reporters after unveiling first-half results.\nThe Bayer-Monsanto tie-up has sparked criticism from environmentalists and some farming groups concerned about its market power and first mover advantage in digital farming data.\nSome who met on Tuesday with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has received more than 50,000 petition emails and more than 5,000 letters opposed to the deal, were not reassured.\n“Approving this merger would create the world’s biggest agribusiness company, potentially crushing competitors and establishing an unprecedented monopoly on lucrative farming data,” said Adrian Bebb at environmental lobbying group Friends of the Earth Europe.\n“Public opinion is against the merger, and farmers and consumers would have every right to be outraged by the Commission giving it the green light.”\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee; Additional reporting by Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt and Sybille de La Hamaide in Paris; Editing by Alexander Smith and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T13:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T14:04:59.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
