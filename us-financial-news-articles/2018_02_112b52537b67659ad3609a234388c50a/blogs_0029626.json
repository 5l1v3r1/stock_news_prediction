He writes: \"This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! March 5th.\"\nDonald Trump tweet\nTrump was referring to a deadline after which he has said a program protecting young immigrants from deportation would end. In fact, a recent court ruling has rendered that deadline meaningless.\nThe Senate's Republican and Democratic leaders say it's going to be tough to broker a successful deal on immigration policy. In addition to protections for \"Dreamers,\" Trump also wants $25 billion for a border wall with Mexico and other security measures, as well as curbs on legal immigration. Many Democrats consider some of the proposals, including limiting the relatives that legal immigrants can bring to the U.S., to be non-starters.\nTrump also tweeted on his $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan, writing that \"after many years we have taken care of our Military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. Bipartisan, make deal Dems?\"\nDonald Trump tweet 2\nStill, Trump has sent mixed messages on his commitment to the proposal, telling state and local officials at a White House meeting Monday that \"if you don't want it, that's OK with me too.\"\nThe administration's plan is centered on using $200 billion in federal money to leverage more than $1 trillion in local and state tax dollars to fix America's infrastructure, such as roads, highways, ports, and airports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:22:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
