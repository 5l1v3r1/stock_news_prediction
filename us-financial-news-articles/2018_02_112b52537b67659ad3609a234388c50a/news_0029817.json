They include one chief of staff, two press secretaries, two national security advisors, three deputy national security advisers, and five communications directors. \nOf the 12 positions considered most central to the president, only five are still filled by the same people as when the president took office. \nHistory shows that the turnover will likely increase during Trump’s second year. \nReagan’s staff saw 40% turnover in 1982, while the Bush and Clinton administrations each saw 27% turnover in their second years, according Dunn-Tenpas’s research. \nAnd 2018 has already seen a number of high-level departures from the White House, including staff secretary Rob Porter , third-ranking justice department official Rachel Brand , and speech writer David Sorenson . Outside of roles integral to the president’s day-to-day, many more high-level executive branch positions are still open and with the culture of chaos that has existed in the White Hall walls, it’s unclear how long they’ll remain unfilled .
