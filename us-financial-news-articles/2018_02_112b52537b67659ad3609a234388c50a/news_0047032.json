For example, videos known as \"deepfakes\" superimpose a person's face over actors in adult films to create fake pornographic videos. Recently major websites moved to clamp down on the practice.\nTo be sure, the researchers said that the scenarios highlighted in the report were not definitive predictions of how AI could be maliciously used — some of the scenarios might not be technically possible in the next five years, while others were already occurring in limited form.\n\"Other malicious uses will undoubtedly be invented that we do not currently foresee,\" they added.\nWednesday's report did not offer any specific ways that malicious use of AI could be stopped.\nBut it provided certain recommendations that include more collaboration between policymakers and researchers, and called for the involvement of more stakeholders to tackle the misuse of AI.\nThough the technology is still nascent, billions of dollars have been spent on developing artificially intelligent systems. International Data Corporation, last year, predicted that by 2021, global spending on cognitive and artificial intelligence systems could reach $57.6 billion.\nAI is predicted to be so massive that Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently said it could have a more profound impact than possibly electricity or fire — two of the most ubiquitous innovations in history.\nAt the same time, there are plenty of skeptics of AI. High-profile physicist Stephen Hawking said last year that AI could be the \" worst event in the history of our civilization \" unless society finds a way to control its development.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T10:50:37.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
