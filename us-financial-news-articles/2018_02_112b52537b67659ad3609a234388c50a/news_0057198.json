The huge technology show Mobile World Congress kicks off this week in Barcelona, Spain, so expect to read lots about 5G, voice and artificial intelligence over the coming days. Samsung kicked off proceedings Sunday, announcing a new Galaxy smartphone that’s much like the old Galaxy smartphone, and proudly carries the tagline, “The Phone. Reimagined,” leading The Verge’s Casey Newton to tweet , “Lord, grant me the confidence of a Samsung marketing executive.”\nPut Down Your Weapons It’s been almost two weeks since the horrific school shooting in Parkland, Fla., but the groundswell of opinion about America’s gun control laws hasn’t subsided. Now brands are taking a stand, The Wall Street Journal reports. Several companies, including Chubb, MetLife, Symantec, Delta and Enterprise Holdings have ended their partnerships with the National Rifle Association . As the article notes, companies are likely reacting partly to a social-media movement calling on companies to #BoycottNRA. While brands have been more open to commenting and taking action on hot-button political and social topics in recent years, many had been wary of wading into the gun control debate. But the tide appears to be turning. Now there’s pressure on companies that haven’t made statements on their NRA links, including tech giants Amazon and Apple, whose streaming platforms host NRAtv . In a statement on Saturday, the NRA said the decision by some corporations to sever ties with the association was a “shameful display of political and civic cowardice.”\nClosing Ceremony The Winter Olympics wrapped up for another four years on Sunday, magnificently played out by a 13-year-old guitar shredding supremo . But what of broadcaster NBCUniversal’s performance? In an emailed statement sent Sunday, NBC Broadcasting and Sports Chairman Mark Lazarus said the company booked more than $920 million in national ad sales for Pyeongchang 2018, a record for the Winter Games, which was also profitable. NBC, which said last month it was expecting to generate $900 million in Olympics ad sales this year, added $20 million during the event itself as viewership exceeded its advertiser guarantees, Mr. Lazarus added. That’s despite viewership averaging lower than the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which Variety notes didn’t air on the NBCSN cable sports network and had no simultaneous streaming. This year, NBC utilized a number of partnerships--including with Snapchat, BuzzFeed and Apple News--to extend its coverage of the Games beyond linear television. On Snapchat (recall that NBCUniversal invested $500 million as part of the Snap IPO,) NBC says it reached more than 40 million users.\nThe Duopoly and GDPR The received wisdom among the marketing community is that companies like Google and Facebook are in a position of strength ahead of the new General Data Protection Regulation coming into effect in May. That’s because they have a direct relationship with consumers, who log onto their services several times a month. But, as Digiday reports, European consumers can still say “no” to sharing their data with the duopoly for use in advertising services. And marketers, too, might hit pause on using highly-targeted ad products like Google’s Customer Match and Facebook Custom Audiences, for fear over fines, the report suggests. But while their rivals may be hoping GDPR will dent Google and Facebook, the two companies have tremendous resources to concentrate on the new regulation. As Dan Wilson, CEO of tech vendor London Media Exchange says in the piece, “They’ll win with this by throwing lawyers at the consent problem and product people to make their services even stickier.” Still in a flap about GDPR? Adweek has released a guide on what marketers need to know in preparation for May.\nI Read the News Today, Oh Boy Things appear to be going from bad to worse at storied media brand Newsweek and the magazine’s parent company, Newsweek Media Group. An investigation by the Manhattan district attorney’s office into suspected bank fraud has expanded into possible advertising abuses and ties between Newsweek Media Group and a bible college in California. And it all began with a tip from a Minnesota bank , as WSJ reports. A Newsweek spokesman declined to discuss details of the district attorney’s probe or the financial situation of the company. Newsweek Media Group has denied engaging in ad fraud, after a report released by ad-monitoring consultancy Social Puncher earlier this month alleged it bought bot traffic. The outcome of that part of the probe — or even simply the fact that investigators are looking at allegations of online advertising fraud at all — could lead some publishers to take a closer look at the vendors they use to buy website traffic.\nBest of the rest Macy’s and Johnson & Johnson are among the advertisers that have signed up for brand integrations for the forthcoming return of “American Idol.” [ Variety ]\nAd agency Droga5 laid off around 40 people in its New York office.
