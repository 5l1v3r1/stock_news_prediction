The VIX has climbed about four points so far this week to 14.86 late Friday morning. \nOn 59 occasions since January 2008 when the VIX rose five points in five trading days, Procter & Gamble fell an average of 1.7 percent during that time and McDonald's lost about 1.9 percent, the Kensho study showed. In contrast, the S&P 500 on average dropped 4.3 percent. \n\nWalmart , Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson also fell less than the broader market during periods of volatility spikes. The stocks had an average decline of about 2.2 percent or less, according to Kensho. \nThese better-performing Dow stocks are mostly in the category of consumer staples, a group of stocks of companies that sell daily essentials. \nWalmart was one of two Dow components trading higher Friday. McDonald's, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble all traded lower by roughly 1 percent or less midday Friday. \nThe Dow fell 400 points, or 1.5 percent, in midday trading as Treasury yields jumped to multi-year highs. Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Visa dropped sharply after reporting earnings and contributed the most to declines in the Dow.\nWith Friday's declines, the Dow was tracking for a weekly loss of 3 percent. \n\"Strap in, it's going to be a volatile year,\" said Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management. \"I don't think we're going to have [a] grind-up year.\" \n— CNBC's John Melloy contributed to this report. \nDisclosure: CNBC's parent NBCUniversal is a minority investor in Kensho.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T19:44:15.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
