I was 21. Experience is good. I have a lot more knowledge than when I was 21,” he added.\n“I thought when I was young that I knew everything, but life teaches you a lot. I‘m very happy to be here.”\nThe former BMW-Sauber and Renault driver had at one point last year looked favourite for the 2018 race seat, with retired former Williams driver and champion Nico Rosberg lending his assistance, but in the end Sirotkin won out.\nKubica, whose arm is noticeably thin and twisted, has not raced in Formula One since 2010.\n“Of course I would prefer to be here as a race driver but if you look at it from a different perspective, and you see where I was 12 months ago, nobody thought I would be in a position to drive an F1 car,” he said.\n”It has been a long journey, seven years away from the F1 paddock, so the feeling will be a bit different.\n“There will be a lot of emotions going to grands prix ... visiting the places that gave me a lot in my life will be a special moment.”\nThe season starts in Australia on March 25.\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:10:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
