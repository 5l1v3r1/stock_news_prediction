After first being introduced in 1998 to promote the film Mulan , the sauce gained a cult following, stoked by the television series Rick and Morty , which made an episode featuring the sauce. Fans of the show took to the streets in October when a limited release of the sauce quickly ran out.\nFamous acolytes include musician Deadmau5, who reportedly bought a 64-gallon jug of the sauce on eBay for $15,000. He later shared it with fans at a concert.\nThe sauce will only be available while supplies last, so hurry down to your closest restaurant now—or, maybe, stay well clear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T13:03:09.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
