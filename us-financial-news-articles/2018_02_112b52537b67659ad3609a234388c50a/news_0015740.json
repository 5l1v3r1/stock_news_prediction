The $79.1 million net of tax impact includes an estimated net tax expense of $77.3 million comprised of a one-time transition tax of $94.0 million, a tax benefit related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred taxes of $14.7 million, and a tax benefit of $2.0 million related to the reduction of the fiscal 2018 federal tax rate to 31.5%, on account of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”).\nNet earnings attributable to EnerSys stockholders (“Net earnings”) for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $36.2 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $15.8 million or $0.36 per share from cash and non-cash charges and credits from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below.\nExcluding these highlighted items, adjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, were $1.25, which exceeded the guidance of $1.12 to $1.16 per diluted share given by the Company on November 8, 2017. These earnings compare to the prior year third quarter adjusted Net earnings of $1.18 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information which include tables reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the quarters and nine months ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017.\nNet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $658.9 million, an increase of 17% from the prior year third quarter net sales of $563.7 million and a 7% sequential quarterly increase from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 net sales of $617.3 million. The increase in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter was the result of an 8% increase in organic volume, a 5% increase in foreign currency translation impact and a 4% increase in pricing. The 7% sequential quarterly increase was primarily due to organic volume.\nThe Company’s operating results for its business segments for the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\nQuarter ended ($ millions) December 31, 2017 January 1, 2017 Net sales by segment Americas $ 353.2 $ 314.0 EMEA 224.9 186.1 Asia 80.8 63.6 Total net sales $ 658.9 $ 563.7 Operating earnings Americas $ 43.7 $ 44.8 EMEA 24.0 20.5 Asia 3.3 4.0 Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities - EMEA — 0.5 Restructuring charges - Americas (1.0 ) — Restructuring and other exit charges (credits) - EMEA (0.8 ) 1.2 Competition investigations and related legal charges - EMEA — (17.0 ) ERP system implementation - Americas (0.5 ) (0.6 ) Deferred purchase consideration - Americas — 1.9 Acquisition activity expense - Americas (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Acquisition activity expense - EMEA (0.2 ) (0.1 ) Total operating earnings $ 68.4 $ 55.1 EMEA - Europe, Middle East and Africa Net earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2018 were $65.6 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable net of tax impact of $82.4 million or $1.90 per share from cash and non-cash charges from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts. The $82.4 million net of tax impact includes an estimated net tax expense of $77.3 million comprised of a one-time transition tax of $94.0 million, a tax benefit related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred taxes of $14.7 million, and a tax benefit of $2.0 million related to the reduction of the fiscal 2018 federal tax rate to 31.5%, on account of the recently enacted Tax Act.\nNet earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2017 were $126.4 million, or $2.88 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable net of tax impact of $26.1 million or $0.59 per share from cash and non-cash charges and credits from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below.\nAdjusted Net earnings for the nine months of fiscal 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, were $3.41 per diluted share. This compares to the prior year nine months adjusted Net earnings of $3.47 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company's use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information.\nNet sales for the nine months of fiscal 2018 were $1,898.8 million, an increase of 9% from the net sales of $1,740.3 million in the comparable period in fiscal 2017. This increase was the result of a 4% increase in pricing, a 3% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in foreign currency translation impact.\nThe Company's operating results for its business segments for the nine months of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\nNine months ended ($ millions) December 31, 2017 January 1, 2017 Net sales by segment Americas $ 1,049.3 $ 968.5 EMEA 621.9 563.8 Asia 227.6 208.0 Total net sales $ 1,898.8 $ 1,740.3 Operating earnings Americas $ 143.1 $ 145.8 EMEA 55.4 57.3 Asia 10.7 11.8 Restructuring charges - Americas (1.3 ) (0.9 ) Inventory adjustment relating to exit activities - EMEA — (2.1 ) Restructuring and other exit charges (credits) - EMEA (3.1 ) (3.7 ) Restructuring charges - Asia — (0.4 ) Competition investigations and related legal charges - EMEA — (17.0 ) ERP system implementation - Americas (2.1 ) (8.3 ) Deferred purchase consideration - Americas — 1.9 Acquisition activity expense - Americas (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Acquisition activity expense - EMEA (0.5 ) (0.2 ) Total operating earnings $ 202.0 $ 184.0 EMEA - Europe, Middle East and Africa “I am pleased with our third quarter performance and specifically with our EMEA region for exceeding 10% operating earnings this quarter,” stated David M. Shaffer, President and Chief Executive Officer of EnerSys. “Commodities, especially lead, continue to rise steadily with our price recovery efforts offsetting approximately 70% of the costs. We have not yet been able to fully recover commodity costs so far this year. However, we remain confident in our ability to reach this goal once lead stabilizes. We are also continuing to invest heavily into our new product roadmap and Digital Core as detailed at our recent Investor Day. Despite these significant pressures, the team delivered additional volume and costs savings to help drive a marked sequential improvement. Our fourth quarter guidance for non-GAAP adjusted net earnings per diluted share is $1.20 to $1.24, which excludes an expected charge of $0.05 from our ongoing restructuring programs, ERP system implementation and acquisition expenses.”\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (\"GAAP\"). EnerSys' management uses the non-GAAP measure “adjusted Net earnings or Net loss,” as applicable, in their analysis of the Company's performance. This measure, as used by EnerSys in past quarters and years, adjusts Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP to reflect changes in financial results associated with the Company's restructuring initiatives and other highlighted charges and income items. Management believes the presentation of this financial measure reflecting these non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results; in particular, those charges that the Company incurs as a result of restructuring activities, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, such as fees and expenses related to acquisition activities, stock-based compensation of senior executives, significant legal proceedings, ERP system implementation and tax valuation allowance changes including those related to the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because these charges are not incurred as a result of ongoing operations, or are incurred as a result of a potential or previous acquisition, they are not as helpful a measure of the performance of our underlying business, particularly in light of their unpredictable nature and are difficult to forecast.\nIncome tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances. For those items which are non-taxable, the tax expense (benefit) is calculated at 0%.\nThis non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for Net Earnings determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the Company's ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to Net Earnings determined in accordance with GAAP.\nIncluded below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts. Non-GAAP adjusted Net Earnings are calculated excluding restructuring and other highlighted charges and credits.
