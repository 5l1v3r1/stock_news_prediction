Organizers have had to call in military personnel to replace them. \nAs yet, no athletes have been confirmed to have contracted the highly contagious virus. An outbreak at last year’s World Athletics Championship in London forced competitors from several countries to miss events. \nSu Mun-gyo, a KCDC public relations official, told Reuters the International Olympic Committee (IOC) were discussing the issue. \n“The IOC is meeting right now about the Winter Olympics and countermeasures to the norovirus is one of the topic,” Su said. “We will then announce the results of the discussions and update the number of cases again.” \nHealth agencies are undertaking hygiene inspections at accommodation and restaurants, as well as making checks on drinking and tap water.
