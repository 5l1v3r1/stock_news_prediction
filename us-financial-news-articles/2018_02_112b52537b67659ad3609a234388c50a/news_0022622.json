I think it’s part of life, and it’s a part of what makes our sport special.\n“It is a sport of glamor and of mystique. But I think you have to continue to evolve. In today’s world there are obviously different sensitivities to 10 or 12 years ago. I don’t think you can just be stubborn.”\nFormula One has announced a new ‘Grid Kids’ program to replace the models when the new season starts in Australia on March 25.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Gareth Jones\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T13:48:00.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
