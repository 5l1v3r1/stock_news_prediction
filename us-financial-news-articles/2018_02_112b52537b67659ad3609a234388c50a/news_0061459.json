Rising interest rates and uncertainty over tax reform contributed to the worst January for municipal bonds since 1981. A 40-basis-point rise in the 10-year Treasury bond yield since the beginning of the year has been tough on muni bonds, too . Some element of the GOP tax-reform bill could adversely impact longer-term demand for tax-exempt muni bonds. CNBC.com \nJanuary is usually a stellar month for the municipal bond market. Not this year. \nThe combination of rising interest rates and uncertainty over tax reform contributed to the worst January for municipal bonds since 1981, with the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index down 1.18 percent for the month. While turmoil in the stock market has recently led investors to safety in the form of Treasurys and muni bonds, the outlook for the tax-exempt market remains murky. Christopher Gregory | Getty Images Rising interest rates and uncertainty over tax reform contributed to the worst January for municipal bonds since 1981. \n\"The negatives in the market appear to be winning out over the positives,\" said Peter Hayes, head of the Municipal Group at BlackRock. \"We're a bit cautious in the near term and expect the market to be in a discovery mode over the next two months.\" \nThe market needs to discover two things: how far and how fast interest rates will rise, given the strong economy, and what effects tax reform will have on the supply and demand for tax-exempt bonds. \nOn the first front, the 40-basis-point rise in the 10-year Treasury bond yield since the beginning of the year has been tough on muni bonds, as well. \n\"Interest rates have hurt the market,\" said Tom Hession, managing partner of Riverbend Capital Advisors. Hession focuses exclusively on municipal bonds and acts as a subadvisor for separately managed accounts. \n\"People see rates going up and they sell,\" he said. \nSo far, muni bonds virtually have tracked the move in Treasurys. While the rise in rates has begun to taper, more signs of a strong economy — particularly wage inflation — could prompt the Federal Reserve Board to move more quickly than expected in raising short-term rates. That in turn could push longer rates up further. \n\"We're certainly moving in the direction of higher rates,\" said Hayes at BlackRock. \nWhen it comes to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Congress last year, the effect on the muni bond market is even less certain. On the one hand, the bill did not touch the tax exemption for interest income from municipal bonds, as many feared. Nor did it exclude private-activity bonds from favorable tax treatment. States and municipalities use such bonds to finance specific infrastructure projects. Roughly $30 billion in private-activity bond issuance was pulled forward into December due to fears about the tax bill. \"Yields are more attractive than they've been in a long time, so if someone is comfortable with a more volatile environment, this could be a good time to consider municipal bonds.\" -Tom Hession, managing partner of Riverbend Capital Advisors \nHowever, for many people with hefty state and local tax bills, the new federal tax law gives municipal bonds some appeal. The new law caps the state and local tax deduction that can be claimed on federal returns at $10,000. For many households, that cap will outweigh any potential benefits from other changes in the law. \nFor these people, tax-free investment income (like muni bonds) becomes quite valuable. Industry experts warn that despite the appeal of municipal bonds, investors need to be careful because the municipal bond market can be complicated. \nOther elements of the reform bill, however, could adversely impact longer-term demand for tax-exempt muni bonds. The bill disallowed the common practice of advance refunding, which enabled municipalities to lower their costs by refinancing debt at lower rates. \nHession said that advance refunding had accounted for approximately 15 percent of muni bond issuance over the last 10 years. \n\"It's like refinancing a mortgage,\" said Hession of Riverbend Capital Advisors. \"The bill eliminates the ability of [municipalities] to issue new debt to retire older deals and save money.\" With interest rates on the rise, however, these refinancing moves would likely diminish, anyway. \nMore from Advisor Insight:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:06:32.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
