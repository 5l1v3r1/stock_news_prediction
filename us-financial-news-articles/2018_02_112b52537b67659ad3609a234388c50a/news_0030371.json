It is crazy that we did it today,” she said, adding that television scheduling was behind the decision.\nNorendal finished fourth while Gasser was 15th.\nHowever, American Hailey Langland, who fell on the first run but put in a solid second effort to finish sixth, said the conditions were manageable. “It shouldn’t have been cancelled,” the 17-year-old said. “We are snowboarders and should be able to deal with it. The girls on the podium showed that and that is why they are up there.”\nThe International Ski Federation (FIS) said that although the conditions made the competition challenging, “the nature of outdoor sports also requires adapting to the elements”.\n“The first priority for FIS is the safety of the athletes and FIS would never stage a competition if this could not be assured,” it said in a statement.\n“The FIS Jury monitored the weather conditions closely throughout the day, including consulting with the coaches, and considered it was within the boundaries to stage the competition safely.”\nAustralian snowboarder Tess Coady took to Instagram to blame the wind for the injury she suffered in practice on Sunday.\n“(I) got picked up in the wind on the bottom jump in practice and my ACL was not a big fan!” Coady said.\nPOCOG spokesman Sung Baik-you told reporters that windy weather would continue into Wednesday.\n“The temperature in the mountains is minus 15 to minus 25 Celsius,” he said. “The wind speed is five-10 metres per second and it is making competitions very difficult.”\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:58:07.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
