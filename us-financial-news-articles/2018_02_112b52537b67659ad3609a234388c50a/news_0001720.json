Demand for natural gas would grow 0.5 percent per year to about 445 billion cubic feet per day under the scenario, Exxon said. \nThe report came after years of environmental and investor pressure. In May, 62 percent of shares voted at Exxon’s annual meeting supported a non-binding call for the annual climate-impact review.
