Fiji escaped major damage but Tonga suffered widespread destruction and flooding. Earlier, the storm had caused extensive damage in Samoa and American Samoa.\nThe cyclone had since been downgraded to a storm, but forecasters said it was still likely to wreak havoc on Tuesday evening as it traversed the centre of New Zealand.\nParts of the country are still reeling from a huge storm that prompted authorities to declare states of emergency at the beginning of February.\nMore than 40 schools and preschools shut in the upper South Island, while mayors urged people to stay home.\nTransport authorities shut a stretch of highway along the east coast of the South Island and the Department of Conservation was closing seaside hiking tracks and campsites along the West Coast and ushering tourists away from low-lying areas, media said.\nReporting by Charlotte GreenfieldEditing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T05:58:56.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
