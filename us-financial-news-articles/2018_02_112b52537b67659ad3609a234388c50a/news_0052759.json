Support for the party has soared since 2013, coinciding with increasing hostility to the European Union among Italians.\nIn Siena, Borghi presented mock-ups of the “mini-BOTs”, worth 50 euros and 200 euros respectively.\nHe said putting 70 billion euros-worth of the notes into circulation could add between 2.5 and 3 percentage points to economic growth.\nAccording to the last polls published before a blackout period began last week, the center-right has a clear lead but is unlikely to win a working majority.\nMost polls put Forza Italia ahead of the League, but some by a narrow margin. The two parties have agreed that whichever gets the most votes will pick the premier and guide policy-making.\nThe anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which has rowed back from a pledge to hold a referendum on Italy’s membership of the euro, is the most popular single party, polling a shade ahead of a center-left coalition formed around the PD.\nReporting by Isla Binnie in Rome; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:40:46.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
