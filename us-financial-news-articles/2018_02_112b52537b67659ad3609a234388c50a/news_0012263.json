I don’t think esports belong in the Olympics,” he told Reuters.\nLigety acknowledged gaming was popular and here to stay, but drew a distinction between Olympic sports like Alpine skiing, where major injuries are routine and death is a real risk.\n“The mental side of esports can be tough I‘m guessing for those guys, but the Olympics is where you have to do some sort of a physical exertion.”\nMichael Payne, a former IOC marketing chief who now runs his own consultancy, said esports should never replace real sports participation even though it is a “great platform for engaging the youth”.\n“The Olympics has always been about physical action not just mental, and it’s why chess and other intellect games have never been accepted,” he said.\nAthletes compete in the Intel Extreme Masters PyeongChang esports tournament in Gangneung, South Korea, February 7, 2018. Intel/Handout via REUTERS One of this week’s esports competitors, Ilyes Satouri, a French national representing Algeria under the handle“Stephano”, disagrees.\n“If the athletes saw how we actually compete, how we practice, how much effort we put in our daily routines to get better, I think they could only respect the efforts we put into it,” said Satouri who was eliminated in the round of 16.\nCompetitors in the esports tournament played StarCraft II, a war game that tests wits and dexterity. Professional players routinely execute more than 300 actions per minute as they build armies and try to outmanoeuvre rivals on a virtual battlefield.\nSasha \"Scarlett\" Hostyn of Canada competes during the Intel Extreme Masters PyeongChang esports tournament in Gangneung, South Korea, February 7, 2018. Intel/Handout via REUTERS It was broadcast live on Amazon’s online Twitch platform and on the IOC-owned Olympic Channel globally, with commentators following the action. Intel is also preparing esports events on the sidelines of the Olympics in 2020 and 2022.\nThe chipmaker is aware of the sensitivities of staging a tournament on the sidelines of the Games, which officially open on Friday, and is monitoring any negative feedback.\n“There are some people who think it doesn’t have any fit at all,” said John Bonini, Intel’s vice president and general manager for gaming and esports.\n“I would like to hear more from them. Is that ever going to change? Or are they open minded?”\nMost esports competitors will leave the Olympics before the flame is lit. They are training for a major event next month at a stadium in Katowice, Poland where more than 170,000 fans are expected to turn up over two weekends of competition.\nAbout 46 million viewed the same tournament online last year, more than watch many Olympic events.\nSasha Hostyn, who won this week’s tournament for Canada under the handle Scarlett, said esports were not taking away anything from Olympians.\n“I think it’s a good thing to have diversity so that it gets more people to tune into the Olympics in general,” Hostyn said.\nEditing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T12:44:55.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
