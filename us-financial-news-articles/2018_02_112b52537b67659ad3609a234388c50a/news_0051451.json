Brent crude futures were down 11 cents at $66.28 a barrel.\nWTI was still on track to rise about 1.7 percent for the week, and Brent was up 2.2 percent, with both contracts set for a second weekly gain after falling steeply early in the month.\nFriday's dips followed bigger price rises the previous day when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said U.S. crude stockpiles <C-STK-T-EIA> fell by 1.6 million barrels in the week to Feb. 16, to 420.48 million barrels, despite a seasonal slowdown in demand at the end of the northern hemisphere winter season.\n\"A counter-seasonal draw should always be taken bullishly -as it has been - but this week's net crude imports were very low,\" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.\nU.S. crude exports jumped to just above 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, EIA data showed, close to a record high of 2.1 million hit in October. That helped pull down net imports to below 5 million bpd, the lowest level since the EIA started recording the data in 2001.\nU.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> was virtually unchanged last week at 10.27 million bpd, close to levels of top producer Russia and more than OPEC-kingpin Saudi Arabia pumps.\nGlobally, however, oil markets remain well supported due to demand-growth coinciding with production restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T10:19:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
