I’ve heard athletes say that they were staying just because they wanted to walk with the flag and in our uniform.”\nFormer Olympic ice hockey champion Igor Larionov told Reuters it was hard for Russian players to stand on the podium under the Olympic flag when they won a gold medal.\n“Time needs to pass for the right to have the flag back, I think,” the Russian said. “It is difficult for me to understand how any figure skater, hockey player or skier can win gold and stand on the podium without their flag. It’s sad.”\nBogdan Kiselevich, a member of the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) team that beat Germany to win men’s ice hockey gold on Sunday, said singing the Russian anthem at the medal ceremony had not been a spur-of-the moment decision.\n“From the start,” he said, after he was asked when they had decided to sing it. “It has been decided with the flag so we had to do it.”\nKiselevich’s team mate Vyacheslav Voynov said the players had shrugged off the news that they would not be allowed to march with the Russian flag at the closing ceremony.\n“We are not bothered,” he told reporters. “It’s of course sad for us. But if that’s what was decided then it has to be that way.”\n‘DROWNING MAN’\nRussia’s Olympic delegation chief and its figure skating silver medallist, Evgenia Medvedeva, had made a last appeal to the IOC on Saturday for their suspension to be lifted, apologising for the two doping violations during the Games.\nMedal-winning curler Alexander Krushelnitsky and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva failed doping tests, angering a team that had been through extensive testing before and during the first days of Games competition without returning any positive results.\nThe lawyer for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Russian doping laboratory director who turned whistleblower and helped to expose the drugs scandal, said “cooler heads” at the IOC had prevailed and stopped Russia’s immediate Olympic return.\nRodchenkov currently lives in hiding in the United States.\n“Thomas Bach was a drowning man but finally cooler heads within the IOC threw him a life preserver,” Jim Walden said in a statement.\n“Yet, in the decision, the IOC had the gall to claim Russia ‘respected’ its decision on December 5th to institute the suspension. The acrimony caused by Bach’s mismanagement should be his undoing,” Walden said.\nAt the Games, the Russians have been unable to wear national uniforms or have their anthem played at medal presentations.\nRussian delegation chief Stanislav Pozdnyakov has said that the prospect of flying the flag at Sunday’s closing ceremony meant more to his athletes than winning medals.\nIn December, the IOC had held out the prospect of lifting Russia’s suspension for the closing ceremony, on the condition its athletes met a strict code of conduct, including compliance with anti-doping rules and observance of athlete neutrality.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann, Additional reporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber; Editing by Mark Bendeich, Peter Rutherford and Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T03:43:07.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
