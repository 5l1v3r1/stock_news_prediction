(\"FOGO\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: FOGO) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by affiliates of Rhône Capital LLC. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $15.75 for each FOGO share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether FOGO's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, the per-share offer is $1.30 less than the Company's 52-week high of $17.05. Additionally, the Company recently announced its preliminary results for the fourth quarter of 2017. It reported total revenue of $88.8 million, representing growth of $17.5 million, or 25%, sequentially.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether FOGO's Board acted in the best interests of FOGO's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own FOGO shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.
