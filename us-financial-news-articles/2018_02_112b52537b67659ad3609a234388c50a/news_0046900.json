Sneed was reportedly twice accused of domestic assault. Ussery left the team in 2015 and Sneed has reportedly been fired following the publication of the Sports Illustrated story. \nUssery told SI he was “deeply disappointed” in anonymous sources’“outright false and inflammatory accusations,” saying he was never aware of sexual harassment complaints against him in 20-plus years with the Mavericks. \nSneed declined to comment to SI. \nCuban, meanwhile, told Sports Illustrated that the story’s allegations were “all new” to him and said that the team’s human resources representative had been fired because of the report. \nCuban called the actions by Ussery and Sneed “wrong” and “abhorrent” and said that the situation was not condoned by him or his team. \n“I can’t tell you how many times, particularly since all this [#MeToo] stuff has been coming out recently I asked our HR director, ‘Do we have a problem? Do we have any issues I have to be aware of?’ And the answer was no,” Cuban told SI. \nRead: Kate Upton’s Sexual Harassment Allegations Are Costing This Exec Millions of Dollars \nHow could a hands-on NBA owner like Cuban be unaware of such allegations? Cuban contends that he was “not involved in the day to day” of the business, deferring instead to the CEO and to HR. \nCuban told Sports Illustrated that he will not let such an environment persist. He said he plans to “fix it,” though he did not provide specifics. \n“[W]e’re going to take every step. It’s not something we tolerate….I’m embarrassed, to be honest with you, that it happened under my ownership, and it needs to be fixed. Period. End of story,” he said.
