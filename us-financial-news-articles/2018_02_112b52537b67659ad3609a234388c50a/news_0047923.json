It was the worst natural disaster in 90 years and the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, whose district includes the Caribbean island, said Maria wiped out about 4 percent of its jobs, the fifth-worst among U.S. disaster regions in recent decades. Dudley said it will likely take “many more months” to restore electricity and critical infrastructure to Puerto Rico, adding it was unclear how many of the tens of thousands of residents who fled will eventually return.\nGiven the already outdated and inefficient power plants, he said, “now is a perfect opportunity for Puerto Rico to essentially start from scratch and build a resilient power generation and distribution network.”\nHurricane Maria killed dozens and left Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million U.S. citizens without power, along with reducing access to clean water and other essentials. The U.S. agency responsible for disaster response has been criticized for hiring contractors that failed to deliver relief to the island, and last month said it would continue to provide water, meals and other basic needs after earlier reports that it was going to halt aid.\nSome 179,000 net people left Puerto Rico after the hurricane, with likely 20,000 to 30,000 of those tourists, the New York Fed found based on U.S. Census data. While it was hard to predict how many might return, New York Fed research analyst Jason Bram told reporters that relatively higher home ownership and lower mortgage debt “creates a little more links to the island.”\nAssessing overnight satellite images of light on the island, seen as a creative proxy for economic activity, the New York Fed found the island was 76 percent as bright in January as it was before the hurricane hit in August. In October, Puerto Rico appeared to have only a fraction of its normal night light.\nDudley, who is set to leave his post by mid-year, said however that the island’s labor market appears to have stabilized thanks to a return of hospitality jobs and the emergence of construction. “These job gains are expected to continue for some time to come,” he told reporters at the New York Fed.\nReporting by Jonathan SpicerEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:30:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
