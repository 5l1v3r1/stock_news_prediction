Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC index rose 0.12 percent, capping several days of modest gains, while Brazil's Bovespa rose 0.28 percent. In Mexico, bottler and retailer Femsa buoyed the index with shares up more than 2 percent. The week was marked by telecommunications firm America Movil and retail giant Wal-Mart de Mexico reporting results in line with analyst expectations. Four-fifths of major Mexican companies that have reported fourth-quarter earnings showed revenue growth, according to Banco Base. Another 14 companies will report results next week. Riskier assets such as emerging market stocks and currencies were hammered earlier this month by concerns the Federal Reserve may hike interest rates at a faster pace than expected this year. The Mexican peso traded flat on Friday even as the dollar edged higher, helped by cautious optimism for the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The next round of trade talks will begin later this month. Currencies in Brazil, Peru and Argentina weakened between 0.12 percent and 0.46 percent.
