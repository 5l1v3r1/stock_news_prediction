The president’s office last week sought his removal. \nDuterte has sparred repeatedly with Trillanes. Last year, he alleged that the senator had secret overseas bank accounts and read out the account number of one live on television. Duterte later admitted, however, that he had deliberately read out a false account number, but did not say why.
