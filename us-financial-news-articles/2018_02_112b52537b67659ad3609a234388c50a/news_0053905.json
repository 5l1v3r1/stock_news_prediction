It has risen about 10 basis points this week, set for its biggest weekly rise since late December, according to Tradeweb data.\nThat has left the gap between Italian bond yields and those of benchmark euro zone issuer Germany at around 140 bps, its widest since late January.\nStill, this gap, a gauge of how investors view relative country risks, is not far from where it stood in early February at around 126 bps -- which was the tightest in over a year.\n“If I just observe bond yield spreads for now, they have compressed, which suggests there is confidence relative to the outcome of the Italian election,” said J Patrick Bradley, senior vice president, investment research at Brandywine Global.\n“That is surprising given the uncertainty of the outcome.”\nMost euro zone bond yields dipped in early trade, with Germany’s 10-year Bund touching a 2-1/2 week low at 0.68 percent .\nAnalysts said an Italian sale of inflation-linked bonds and short-dated paper on Friday could attract more attention than usual given the election.\nThey also noted comments from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week, who was reported warning about Italian election risks.\n“Some long forgotten patterns return to euro bond markets with Bunds rallying while Italy sells off,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger.\n“Juncker’s election warning seems more like an excuse rather than an explanation, but it underscores that markets should become increasingly jittery in coming days when the election grabs more headlines.”\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:10:01.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
