REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte There are no accurate opinion polls on the election but many political analysts say the UNP is likely to perform best in the polls, in which voters will elect some 8,300 representatives in 340 local authorities across the country.\n“If campaign rhetoric became particularly hostile, it would foment trouble for the coalition at the national level,” Shailesh Kumar, director with political risk consultants Eurasia Group told Reuters.\nAn electoral officials carries a ballot box as he gets into a bus ahead of local government polls in Colombo, Sri Lanka February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte However, the government is unlikely to collapse because the prime minister’s party holds the largest number of seats in parliament and Sirisena’s party cannot afford to break away, Kumar added.\n“Thus instead, Sirisena will likely stay in the coalition but he will see his power erode further,” Kumar said, adding that such an outcome would be “net positive for reforms” as power consolidation with the UNP could reduce future hurdles.\nThe president and his supporters have opposed or neutralised many of the UNP reforms. Under the constitution, Sirisena cannot dissolve the parliament until early 2020.\nPrashan Fernando, CEO at Acuity Stockbrokers, said Sri Lankan financial markets would welcome an outcome that saw the two main parties forming coalitions at the local council level to help ensure political stability.\nReporting by Shihar Aneez\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T01:15:05.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
