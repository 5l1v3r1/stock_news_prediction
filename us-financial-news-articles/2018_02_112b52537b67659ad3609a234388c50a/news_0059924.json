The head of the sugar chamber said the industry was not “overly concerned” about it.\nAsked whether Guajardo would be discussing sugar trade with Ross, Mexico’s chief NAFTA negotiator, Kenneth Smith, said Mexico and the United States had agreements to manage trade in sugar and tomatoes, which were periodically reviewed. He did not confirm whether those two issues were on the agenda.\nMexico has expressed concern about curbs on steel and aluminum imports being considered by U.S. President Donald Trump, including a proposed 24 percent tariff on steel products from all countries. Trump could exclude certain countries from the tariffs.\nMexico’s fraught ties with Trump hit another bump following weekend reports that a testy phone call between him and his Mexican counterpart, Enrique Pena Nieto, led to the cancellation of a planned meeting between the two in Washington.\nTrump is pushing for a border wall, which he promised during his campaign that Mexico would pay for. The Mexican government has said it will not do so. The U.S. president also frequently threatens to abandon NAFTA unless big changes are made to a pact he blames for U.S. manufacturing job losses.\nReporting by Dave Graham and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T02:30:43.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
