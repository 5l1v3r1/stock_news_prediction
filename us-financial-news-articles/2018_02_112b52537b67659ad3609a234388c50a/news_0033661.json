He added that there was no blanket solution to the detainee problem, and each case would have to be looked at carefully.\n“The most important thing is we figure out how we are going to deal with this, that we can deal with it, we don’t paralyze ourselves and just say there is nothing we can do ... That is the one thing I will say: doing nothing is not an option.”\nFrench officials have repeated that French fighters caught by SDF forces should be prosecuted by local forces and that Paris had no intention of bringing them back to their home soil.\n“They are fighters. They are French, but they are our enemies. The conclusion is that they will be judged by those who they fought,” Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Feb. 7.\nThe names of the countries attending the meeting were not disclosed.\nThe foreign fighter issue received renewed attention when U.S. officials said the SDF had captured two of four militants known as the “Beatles” for their English accents.\n“We don’t want them going back on the streets, we don’t want them on the street in Ankara, we don’t want them on the street in Tunis, Paris or Brussels,” Mattis said.\nWhen asked whether the United States would consider moving some of the detainees to Guantanamo Bay, Mattis declined to comment.\nReporting by Idrees Ali; Additional reporting by John Irish in Paris; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T08:58:14.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
