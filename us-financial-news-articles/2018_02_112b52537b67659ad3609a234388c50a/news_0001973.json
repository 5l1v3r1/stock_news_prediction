Anyone who comes after that period will have the same rights as now during the implementation period,” the spokesman said. \n“During the implementation period, we’ll introduce a registration scheme for new arrivals,” he added. \n“The ongoing rights of those people who arrived during the implementation period following the end of that period are a matter for negotiation. The PM was clear that those rights would be different from those who came before.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; editing by Stephen Addison", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:22:35.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
