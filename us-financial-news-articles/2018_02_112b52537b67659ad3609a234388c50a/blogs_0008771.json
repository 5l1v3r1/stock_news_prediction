Trump has repeatedly tried to draw attention away from special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. \nShah also said that more documents, like the incendiary House GOP memo released Friday through an expedited disclosure process, will be handled in the same way. They will allow for a \"legal review, national security review led by the White House Counsel's Office, and then within five days, the president will make a decision about declassifying it.\" \nThat process, which circumvents a lengthier review process involving input from intelligence agencies, was followed on the basis of a rule that had never been used before . \nThe memo, which alleges that political bias in the FBI's sources and methods led to improper surveillance on a former Trump advisor, has fueled speculation among Democrats that Trump is gearing up to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Democrats, along with the FBI and Justice Department, have called the memo \"reckless\" and \"misleading,\" among many other criticisms. \nBut Shah also told reporters that Trump is not considering any moves at the Justice Department right now, appearing to swat away fears of the probe's defenders. Rosenstein appointed Mueller to lead the Russia probe after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from it. \nOn Monday, Trump congratulated the memo's author and leading advocate, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., for his work on the document.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T23:57:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
