Edwards is a twenty-year veteran of feature films and television. She joined DreamWorks Animation in 2002, where she fostered the studio’s success in both production and executive roles by managing films across three intercontinental locations. Her production contributions include: co-producer, Trolls; unit producer, Penguins of Madagascar; associate producer, Mr. Peabody and Sherman, Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted and Megamind. Prior to joining the DreamWorks Animation team, Edwards produced animation and live-action projects for television and the web at Curious Pictures West, Wild Brain and Colossal Pictures.\nAs Head of Talent Acquisition & Development for Skydance, Kim Mackey will be responsible for recruiting and talent development strategy across all divisions of the Company, and will report to President & COO, Jesse Sisgold. This includes helping to attract and retain top talent for the new animation division as well as managing the process across live-action feature film, television, and interactive divisions. Mackey is a twenty-two-year veteran of the animation industry and, most recently, was the Global Head of Recruiting for DreamWorks Animation. Prior to her role in recruiting, she contributed to the studio’s feature success in both production and executive roles for Prince of Egypt, Spirit, Shark Tale, and Flushed Away. As a studio executive, she managed resource needs across the entire studio’s production slate, including the studio’s biggest franchises Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar and How to Train Your Dragon.\nAs Director of Talent Acquisition & Development for Skydance, Jessie Carbonaro will be developing and maintaining relationships with talent throughout the animation, interactive and live-action communities. She will be managing the candidate experience to help attract top talent to the growing company. Before joining Skydance, Carbonaro was part of DreamWorks Animation for nearly 13 years where she started her career in television as a producer and writer. She spent 10 years as a production supervisor working on projects such as Madagascar, Madagascar 2, Shrek the Third, Shrek Forever After, Megamind, The Croods, Puss in Boots and Home.\nAs Director of Finance, Matthew Burke is responsible for all financial activities of the division. Collaborating with senior leadership, he will be focused on building the division into an elite player in animation production. Prior to joining Skydance, Burke spent 14 years as finance lead on multiple animated features at DreamWorks Animation. His adept collaboration with the production teams as well as his strong financial strategies contributed to many successful films. Before DreamWorks, he spent over 10 years at Walt Disney Imagineering’s film division as Senior Production Accountant.\nIn 2017, Skydance formed an animation division to develop and produce a slate of high-end feature films and television series in partnership with Spain’s Ilion Animation Studios. Skydance’s first three animated features are Luck, which comes to theaters on March 19, 2021, Split (working title) and Powerless (working title). Luck, directed by Alessandro Carloni and written by Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger, is a comedy that pulls back the curtain on the millennia-old battle between the organizations of good luck and bad luck that secretly affects our daily lives. Split, directed by Vicky Jenson and written by Linda Woolverton, tells the story of Elian, a teenager who comes of age using her magical powers to defend her family when the opposing forces of light and darkness threaten to divide her kingdom. The recently announced Powerless (working title) will be directed by Nathan Greno.\nAbout Skydance Media\nSkydance is a diversified media company founded by David Ellison in 2010 to create high quality, event-level entertainment for global audiences.
