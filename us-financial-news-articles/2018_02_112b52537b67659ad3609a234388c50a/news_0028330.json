These conditions included, among others, the Financing Condition, which included the pricing of an offering of notes on terms satisfactory to the Company (the \"New Offering\").\nThe Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation are being terminated by the Offeror and Solicitation Agent because the New Offering has been postponed due to market conditions and, as a result, the Financing Condition has not been satisfied.\nAs a result of the termination, none of the Notes that have been tendered in the Tender Offer will be accepted for purchase and no consideration will be paid or become payable by the Offeror to holders of Notes who have tendered their Notes in the Tender Offer. All Notes previously tendered and not withdrawn will be promptly returned or credited back to their respective holders. All Consents previously delivered and not revoked will be of no effect, and the indenture governing the Notes will not be amended.\nThe Company engaged Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated as the dealer manager for the Tender Offer and as the solicitation agent authorized to act on the Company's behalf for the Consent Solicitation.
