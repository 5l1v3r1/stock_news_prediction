I came,” said Abdeslam, who has been in prison near Paris awaiting trial in France over the attacks that killed 130 people there in November 2015. He was detained in his native Brussels four months later, in March 2016.\n“I am accused, so I am here,” he said. “I will remain silent. That is a right which I have and my silence does not make me a criminal or guilty. That is my defense and I am defending myself by remaining silent.”\nSitting flanked by two armed and masked counter-terrorism policemen, his black hair and beard long, he added: ”Let them base their case on forensic and tangible evidence, and not swagger about to satisfy public opinion.\n“What I notice is that Muslims are judged and treated in the worst kind of ways. They are judged without mercy. There is no presumption of innocence, there’s nothing.”\nCiting the Muslim declaration of faith that “there is no god but God” and that Mohamed is his prophet, Abdeslam concluded: “Judge me. Do what you want with me. I put my trust in my Lord.”\nReporting by Julie Carriat; Writing by Alastair Macdonald\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:52:17.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
