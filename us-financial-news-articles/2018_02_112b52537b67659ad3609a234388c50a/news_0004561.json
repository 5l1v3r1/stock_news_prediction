It is a joint venture between Shell, Iraqi state-owned South Gas Company, Mitsubishi and the Petrochemical Project NEBRAS.\nWith an output of 4.36 million bpd in January, Iraq is the second-largest producer of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), after Saudi Arabia.\nThe country is producing below its maximum capacity of nearly 5 million bpd under an agreement between OPEC and other exporters including Russia to curtail global supply in order to support oil prices.\nReporting Aref Mohamed; Writing by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T11:21:11.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
