Kashkari said he has been surprised at how much optimism his business contacts have expressed over the Trump administration’s tax overhaul, but that the jury is still out on whether the tax cuts will boost growth over the long run.\nAnd until data shows stronger inflation, he suggested, the Fed should leave rates alone.\n“If we have been at 1.5 (percent inflation) for five or six years, then in theory we should let it go to 2 (percent), two and a quarter, two and a half, and shouldn’t be any more concerned about that as long as we are completely committed - and we are - to keeping inflation in check over the long term,” he said.\nThe Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation rose 1.5 percent in the 12 months through December, and has missed the Fed’s 2-percent target since mid-2012.\nReporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:00:29.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
