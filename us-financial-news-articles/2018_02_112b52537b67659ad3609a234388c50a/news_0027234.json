(NASDAQ: MIND) (\"Mitcham\") announced today that it has completed the previously announced acquisition of intellectual property and certain other assets from Hydroscience Technologies, Inc. and Solid Seismic LLC. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (\"Mitsubishi\") has made the initial investment pursuant to its agreement to purchase up to $4.0 million of Mitcham's 9.00% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock (the \"Preferred Stock\").\nRob Capps, Mitcham's Co-Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We are pleased to announce the completion of these agreements to expand our technology offerings and further our relationship with Mitsubishi. In addition to the investment by Mitsubishi, we will provide a variety of support services related to equipment previously purchased by Mitsubishi. The solid streamer and sensor technology that we have acquired has extensive application in the oceanographic and hydrographic industries, as well as traditional seismic applications. We see clear opportunities to integrate some of this technology into other areas such as anti-submarine warfare and maritime security systems. The completion of these agreements is an important step in Mitcham's strategy to reposition itself as a more significant player in the marine technology industry and allows us to further diversify from the oil and gas exploration industry.\"\nHydroscience and its affiliate, Solid Seismic LLC, designed, manufactured and sold marine sensors and solid streamer technology primarily for the hydrographic and seismic industries. The companies filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2017. Mitcham acquired the assets pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement and Sale Order that were approved by the bankruptcy court on January 31, 2018. Under these agreements, Mitcham acquired certain specified intangible and tangible assets free and clear of all prior claims and encumbrances. Mitcham assumed no contracts or prior warranty obligations.\nIn connection with the closing of the acquisition, Mitcham has issued 152,290 shares of Preferred Stock to Mitsubishi for proceeds of $3.5 million pursuant to a securities purchase agreement between Mitcham and Mitsubishi. In addition, Mitsubishi has agreed to purchase an additional 21,756 shares of Preferred Stock for $500,000 upon the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the securities purchase agreement. Mitcham expects to satisfy these conditions during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019.\nThe Preferred Stock sold under the securities purchase agreement has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described above.\nAbout Mitcham Industries\nMitcham Industries, Inc. provides technology to the oceanographic, hydrographic, defense, seismic and security industries.
