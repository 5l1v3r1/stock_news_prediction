Long-term, TenneT will operate more than 10 GW of German offshore power connections by 2025.\n* It is pursuing half a dozen high-profile onshore wind projects in the Netherlands and due to connect some 3.5 GW of offshore wind installations to onshore grids in that country by 2023.\n* Further ahead, it is consulting with the Dutch government about a future big push into more offshore capacity up to 2030, which is not included in current investment planning.\n* TenneT is constructing two new offshore interconnectors, the NordLink subsea cable between Germany and Norway, to be ready in 2020, and the COBRAcable between the Netherlands and Denmark, to be ready in 2019.\n* Investments into maintenance and expansion of grids totalled 1.77 billion euros last year.
