I hope the day we become one comes soon and hope to see all your friendly faces in Pyongyang.” \nSOFT POWER With so little known about her (even her age of 28 is unconfirmed), scrutiny on Kim Yo Jong was intense, dominating local media and internet chatrooms. \n“Personally I think she looked very relaxed during her visit to South Korea,” said Kang Mi-jin, a North Korean defector who works at the Seoul-based Daily NK website. “Her facial expressions were cool and she didn’t seem flustered.” \nReportedly schooled in Switzerland, the youngest daughter of former leader Kim Jong Il was promoted by her brother to the country’s top decision-making body in October. \nKim Man-heum, head of the Korea Academy of Politics and Leadership, said Kim Yo Jong left a largely positive impression on the South Korean public. \n\nFeb 10, 2018; Gangneung, South Korea; Kim Yo-jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during women's ice hockey Group B play between Switzerland and Korea in the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Kwandong Hockey Centre. Mandatory Credit: Andrew Nelles-USA TODAY Sports “North Korea used ‘soft power’ this time to engage the South and her being a woman may have contributed more in that aspect,” Kim told Reuters. \nEven her elegant, sloping handwriting was parsed in South Korean media. Experts said it conveyed confidence, superiority and reflected a positive attitude. \nNot everyone was impressed, however. \nKim Yo Jong’s aloof expression when she wasn’t meeting with high-ranking South Korean government officials and high-tilted chin prompted scorn from many South Koreans, who said she looked “too haughty” or “uppity”. \n\nSlideshow (3 Images) “Her neck is straight and her head is skewed to the right, automatically sending her gaze down. I think this comes from her thinking she is above everyone else,” said Bae Sang-hoon, professor of police science at Seoul Digital University and a former criminal profiler at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. \nBRUTAL REGIME Critics also highlighted Kim Yo Jong’s senior role in a regime accused by a United Nations inquiry of systematic torture, starvation and killings comparable to Nazi-era atrocities. \nLast January, the U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted her along with six other North Korean officials for “severe human rights abuses” and censorship that concealed the regime’s “inhumane and oppressive behavior”. \n”Among the upper class in Pyongyang, she is a frightening presence,” because of her relationship with her brother, said An Chan-il, a former North Korean military officer who now runs a think tank in Seoul. “She has been thought of as royalty since she was born, and she sees herself that way as well.” \nThe body language of the high-ranking North Korean officials who accompanied her was also telling of her status in the North, said analysts. \nNorth Korea’s 90-year-old nominal head of state Kim Yong Nam deferred to her upon arrival, asking her to sit down first ahead of tea with the South’s unification minister. \nIt is customary in Korea and some other Asian countries for the highest ranking, usually the eldest, person in the group to sit down first for a meal or meeting. \nWhile Kim Yo Jong demurred in front of the cameras, insisting Kim Yong Nam sit first, the impression had been made. \n“This showed Kim Yo Jong was the real person in power, and not just because of her lineage,” said Cheong Seong-chang, senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute. \nReporting by Christine Kim; Additional reporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Lincoln Feast\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T15:15:13.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
