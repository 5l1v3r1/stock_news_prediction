Barea connected on a pair of 3-pointers early in the second quarter as the Mavericks rallied within 34-26.\nBut Dallas got no closer the rest of the way, with Thomas short-circuiting a Mavericks threat in the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer after the lead had shrunk to 12.\nThomas, who went for 22 points in his Lakers debut, a 130-123 loss at Dallas, hit five of his 12 shots, including a pair of 3-pointers. He had totaled just 10 points, missing all five of his 3-point attempts, in the Lakers’ most recent two games.\nBall, whose nine points were the product of three 3-pointers, also found time for seven rebounds and six assists in just 17 minutes. The rookie hadn’t played since Jan. 13, when he had nine points in a 107-101 win at Dallas.\nJulius Randle recorded an 18-point, 12-rebound, 10-assist triple-double for the Lakers, who haven’t lost a home game since falling to Charlotte on Jan. 5. The victory gave Los Angeles a winning record at home (15-14).\nThe triple-double was the fifth of Randle’s career.\nKentavious Caldwell-Pope (15 points), Brandon Ingram (15), Ivica Zubac (14), Kyle Kuzma (12) and Hart (12) made it seven players in double figures for the Lakers.\nMatthews scored 15 of his 19 points on five 3-pointers, as the Mavericks made more 3-pointers (19) than 2-pointers (18) in the game.\nYogi Ferrell (13), Dennis Smith Jr. (13), Barea (12), Dirk Nowitzki (11) and Doug McDermott (10) also scored in double figures for the Mavericks, who complete a two-day, two-game trip Saturday at Utah.\nBarnes had a team-high seven rebounds and Barea a team-high six assists for Dallas.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T19:58:25.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
