The helicopter literally came apart during the crash, the report said.\nSpiegel Online reported late Tuesday that investigators believed the crash was caused by incorrect settings on the autopilot, but it remained unclear who programmed the settings on the autopilot software.\nA parliamentary source confirmed the gist of the Spiegel report.\nMilitary officials were meeting with the parliamentary defense committee on Wednesday morning to review the crash investigation.\nAn Airbus spokesman declined comment on the Spiegel report, and referred all queries to German military authorities investigating the accident.\nA defense ministry spokesman confirmed only that a report was presented to committee leaders on Tuesday and would be discussed in greater detail with members on Wednesday.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal and Sabine Siebold; Writing by Andrea Shalal and Michelle Martin; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:38:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
