But while they suggest the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement is by far the most popular party, a centre-right coalition led by Forza Italia and the League party looks the most likely outcome.\nThe yield on Italy’s 10-year government bonds was 1.5 basis points lower at 2.09 percent, and the gap over Germany narrowed to 143 basis points, well off recent highs of 152 bps. ,\nRieger said there were also technical reasons for the outperformance: over 9 billion euros of coupon repayments are due at the end of this week, primarily from Italian debt. For this reason, he expected the Italian debt auction to go well.\nItaly is set to sell up to 7.75 billion euros of debt on Thursday in an auction, including 10-year bonds.\nBetter-rated euro zone government bonds edged higher on Tuesday before the release of German consumer price data, with the yield on benchmark German 10-year bonds rising one basis point to 0.66 percent.\nMarket expectations are for HICP inflation to come in at 1.3 percent, comfortably below the European Central Bank’s target of just below 2 percent.\nThis should keep yields in check, according to Mizuho analysts.\n“We see downside risks to today’s Germany inflation print. This should contribute to the Bund rally and confirm that peak ECB hawkishness is likely behind us,” they said in a note.\nLater in the day, new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to give his first congressional testimony.\nHis debut appearance is seen as critical for financial markets at a time when many investors are nervous about the pace of Fed policy normalisation following years of stimulus.\nReporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:05:28.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
