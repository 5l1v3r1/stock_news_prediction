Alpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Downhill Training – Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 11, 2018 - The finish area of the Alpine venue is seen after the men's downhill was postponed due to strong winds. \nDisruption to the Alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics is not unusual and it is a rare Games where some re-jigging of the schedule is not necessary. \nThat is even more the case on the World Cup circuit and the racers have learned to be phlegmatic about adjustments to the programme.
