Twenty-two people were injured,” said Chukwu.\nSuicide bombings have continued despite repeated assertions by the government and the military since 2016 to have defeated the Boko Haram insurgency, which aims to create an Islamic state in Nigeria’s northeast.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari took office in 2015 with a promise to improve security for ordinary Nigerians.\nBut in addition to the jihadist insurgency, communal violence has plagued swathes of the country in the last few months, including a clash on Thursday that killed 18.\nReporting by Lanre Ola and Ahmed Kingimi; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T09:23:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
