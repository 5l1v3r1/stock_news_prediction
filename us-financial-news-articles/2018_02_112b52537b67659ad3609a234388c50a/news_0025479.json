International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach called it “a very emotional moment,” one that gave him “goosebumps.”\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has taken a hard line on North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program, saying there is no room for negotiations unless Pyongyang abandons it.\nThe official said Pence and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, while watching speed skating together on Saturday night, discussed intensifying sanctions.\nThe official said Pence and Moon did not discuss the North Koreans’ invitation to Moon for a summit in Pyongyang, which would set the stage for the first meeting of Korean leaders in 10 years.\nPence did say, however, that Moon shared with him details of his meeting with North Korean leaders, without elaborating.\nOn his way to Asia earlier this week, the U.S. vice president told reporters he was not seeking direct talks with North Korean officials, “but we’ll see what happens.”\nDuring an Olympics reception and at the sporting event’s opening ceremony, Pence was not trying to avoid North Korean officials in attendance, the senior administration official told reporters on Saturday, adding that he was trying to ignore them.\nThe official also noted that while Trump believes in talking, in this case, the issue is not about words but about deeds on North Korea’s part.\nReporting By Richard Cowan; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T00:03:50.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
