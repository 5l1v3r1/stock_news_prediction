The iconic toy retailer plans to close another 200 stores and lay off a significant portion of its corporate staff following a disappointing holiday sales season, the WSJ’s Lillian Rizzo and Paul Ziobro report, a signal of growing concern over the financial state of a business that has been reeling from the internet-fed upheaval in the toy industry . The latest wave of closings would cut nearly in half the number of U.S. stores it had before its bankruptcy filing. The company had poor holiday sales during a high-stakes period when toy retailers traditionally rake in a big share of their business. Suppliers that have seen a major outlet deteriorate in the changed retail environment now will be weighing how much to feed into Toys “R” Us distribution channels while they consider whether to look for new pipelines to customers.\nRegional grocers appear to be in retreat. Northeast U.S. supermarket chain Tops Markets LLC is entering chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the WSJ’s Katy Stech Ferek and Heather Haddon report, the latest move by a bread-and-butter food retail chain to reset its balance sheet in a shifting consumer market. Tops has been hit by more than the move to online shopping. The business bought a food wholesaler and a logistics provider several years ago, and has been battling a Teamsters union pension fund for more than four years over some $180 million the union says Tops now owes. That’s just one problem at a business with $1.2 billion in debt and operations in an increasingly difficult market. The consumer drive to discount grocers, club chains and e-commerce sites helped push chains Marsh Supermarkets LLC and Central Grocers Inc. into bankruptcy last year, and southeast grocer Bi-Lo LLC is in talks with bondholders about its debt.\nThe push for raw materials in technology supply chains is turning into a race. Apple Inc. has reportedly been in talks to buy cobalt directly from miners to ensure it has enough of an ingredient central to components in its iPhones and other electronics . The talks, reported by Bloomberg, are the latest sign of the stresses that are developing in the tech world as a flood of smartphones and the new and growing production of electric vehicles triggers booming demand for cobalt—an essential ingredient in lithium-ion batteries. Cobalt supplies are limited, and miners are looking for more sources ahead of what could be a big shortage—batteries for power electric cars require far more cobalt than the thin levels needed in smartphones. Car companies are locking in their own supplies and Apple, which usually leaves materials sourcing to its manufacturers, wants to ensure it has the minerals to match its ambitious production goals.\nCOMMODITIES Pure refined cobalt at a Rotterdam warehouse. Photo: Herman van Heusden for The Wall Street Journal The latest sign of resurgence in the commodities sector is that miners are digging not only for metals but for deals. Swiss commodity giant Glencore PLC is the latest operator in the business to trumpet a turnaround, reporting that it quadrupled its net earnings to $5.8 billion and slashed its net debt by nearly a third from the year before. Rising commodity prices have helped drive Glencore’s comeback and that of the larger mining industry , and the WSJ’s Scott Patterson reports that Glencore’s booming cash flows give the company more room for transactions after moves in coal, copper and zinc last year. The improving commodities picture is giving new life to the dry-bulk shipping business. Analysts at Alphabulk say ship orders in the sector are rising after the order book for bulk vessels reached its lowest level in 16 years by one measure at the end of 2017.\nProposed new rules for U.S. meatpackers suggest the companies can speed up their supply chains without compromising food safety. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is advancing changes in oversight in pork production by allowing meatpackers to slaughter hogs faster and play a bigger role in policing food safety on their own. The moves are aimed at freeing up government inspectors while making plants more efficient , the WSJ’s Benjamin Parkin and Patrick McGroarty write, but are raising alarms among consumer advocates and labor groups that argue the new rules would compromise food safety and the safety of workers. The debate highlights the conflict in industrial operations between technology-driven moves to cut costs and attention to factory fundamentals. The USDA and meat companies say the business has fallen behind food-science and slaughterhouse technology, and new inspection practices can provide both safety and speed.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ I think many of us in the trade need to understand and make a decision about whether we can continue to hang on with Toys “R” Us or turn our back and walk away. ’\n—Jay Foreman, chief executive of toy supplier Basic Fun Inc.\nNumber of the Day 7.3% Year-over-year increase in loaded container imports and exports in 2017 at U.S. seaports, according to Cushman & Wakefield.\nIN OTHER NEWS Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell in January at the fastest pace in three years.
