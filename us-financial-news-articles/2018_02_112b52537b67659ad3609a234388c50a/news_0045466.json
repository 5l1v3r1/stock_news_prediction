We can expand. We can link carbon markets across borders,” Lachapelle told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\nThe merging of Ontario’s cap and trade program with the previously linked California and Quebec markets created the world’s second largest carbon emissions market, officials have said.\nMore than 110 million emission permits were being sold at the joint auction, authorities in Quebec said.\nNorth America’s joint cap-and-trade systems, set up over the last six years, have face some questions over how much carbon emissions they actually hold back, Lachapelle said.\nFor now, the European Union is considered the world’s largest carbon emission market, but China’s market is rapidly growing, experts say.\nReporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.
