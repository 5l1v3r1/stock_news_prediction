(NYSE: DDR) today announced operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“2017 was a transformational year for DDR, highlighted by the announced spin-off of Retail Value Inc., a restructuring of our balance sheet, and a stream-lining of our organization. Our operating results decelerated from the prior year, but same store NOI growth was ahead of our original forecasts and was flat in the continental U.S. portfolio despite a significant decline in occupancy from tenant bankruptcies,” commented David R. Lukes, president and chief executive officer. “Going forward, we remain energized about the prospects of realizing value through dispositions and operations of Retail Value Inc. properties and New DDR’s growth prospects as stronger 2017 operating metrics further validate.”\nResults for the Quarter\nFourth quarter net loss attributable to common shareholders was $226.4 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $28.1 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the year ago-period. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to impairment charges of $280.1 million of which $258.6 million are a result of the change in hold-period assumptions for the Retail Value Inc. (“RVI”) asset portfolio. Fourth quarter operating funds from operations attributable to common shareholders (“Operating FFO” or “OFFO”) was $103.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $111.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the year ago-period. The year-over-year decrease in OFFO is primarily attributable to the dilutive impact of deleveraging asset sales.\nResults for the Year\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $270.4 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, which compares to a net income of $37.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share for the prior year. Generated Operating FFO of $1.18 per diluted share for the full year 2017, which compares to $1.28 per diluted share for 2016.\nSignificant Fourth Quarter Activity\nOn December 14, 2017, DDR announced its intention to spin off 50 assets, representing approximately $2.9 billion of gross book value, comprised of 38 continental U.S. assets and the entirety of the Puerto Rico portfolio, into a separate publicly-traded REIT to be named RVI. DDR recorded approximately $2.3 million of costs related to the transaction in 2017. In February 2018, in connection with the strategic transformation to spin off RVI, completed $1.35 billion of mortgage financing and repaid $452 million of mortgage debt using proceeds from the new financing and commenced tender offers for any and all of its $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.500% senior notes due 2021 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of other series of senior unsecured notes. Sold 14 shopping centers and land parcels for an aggregate sales price of $590.1 million, totaling $246.0 million at DDR’s share, including $48.6 million from the repayment of the Company’s preferred equity investment in its two joint ventures with Blackstone. Repaid $104 million of mortgage debt scheduled to mature in 2018.\nKey Quarterly Operating Results\nThe results of “New DDR” described herein represent the results of the assets that will remain in DDR after the completion of both the spin-off of RVI and the previously announced $900 million disposition program Reported 0.8% same store net operating income growth on a pro rata basis for New DDR Reported -0.4% same store net operating income on a pro rata basis, excluding Puerto Rico for the total portfolio; presentation has been adjusted to include bad debt expense on a comparable basis; these results were impacted by approximately 30 basis points of unbudgeted snow removal costs Generated new leasing spreads of 23.9% and renewal leasing spreads of 5.3%, both on a pro rata basis for New DDR for the quarter, and new leasing spreads of 17.2% and renewal leasing spreads of 7.1%, both on a pro rata basis for New DDR for the trailing twelve-month period Generated new leasing spreads of 23.9% and renewal leasing spreads of 2.2%, both on a pro rata basis for the total portfolio for the quarter, and new leasing spreads of 11.1% and renewal leasing spreads of 5.2%, both on a pro rata basis for the total portfolio for the trailing twelve-month period Reported a leased rate of 93.6% for New DDR on a pro rata basis, compared to 94.4% at December 31, 2016 Reported a leased rate of 93.2% , compared to 95.0% at December 31, 2016, on a pro rata basis for the total portfolio Annualized base rent per occupied square foot on a pro rata basis was $17.20 for New DDR, compared to $16.71 at December 31, 2016 Annualized base rent per occupied square foot on a pro rata basis was $16.46 , compared to $15.46 at December 31, 2016 for the total portfolio\nFourth Quarter Update – Hurricane Casualty and Operating\nThe Company’s 12 shopping centers in Puerto Rico were significantly impacted by Hurricane Maria, which occurred in September 2017. The Company maintains insurance on its assets in Puerto Rico with policy limits of approximately $330 million for property damage and business interruption. The Company has been actively working with its insurer relating to both the property damage and business interruption claims. The Company believes its insurance policies provide adequate coverage of lost revenue related to hurricane damage and related store closures. The Company’s insurance policies remain subject to various terms and conditions, including a deductible of approximately $6 million, which was recorded in the third quarter of 2017. The financial impact on the fourth quarter results is summarized as follows:\nReceived payments from its insurer for its estimated business interruption losses for $8.5 million, which are recorded as business interruption income within revenues on the income statement. Reported a reduction of revenues from tenants of $9.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. This loss was netted against the $8.5 million in business interruption income recorded and a $0.2 million true up of uninsured expenses during the quarter with the net impact of $0.6 million excluded from Operating FFO provided later in this release. Recorded an additional write-off of real estate assets of $6.4 million based on updated damage assessments of the properties. The aggregate estimated net book value written off year-to-date related to hurricane damage is $71.0 million and remains subject to change. The corresponding receivable of $58.6 million related to the estimated casualty insurance recovery reflects the aggregate year-to-date write-off of real estate assets of $71.0 million and other expenses expected to be covered by insurance reduced by the $5.1 million insurance deductible and $10 million advance received by the insurer in 2017.\nGuidance\nThe Company’s guidance for 2018, except for OFFO which is for the third quarter of 2018, for New DDR, after an assumed spin-off date of July 2018, is as follows (in millions, except per share data):\nGuidance\n2018\nActual\nFY 2017\nSame Store NOI growth (1) At least 1.5% 0.0% Joint venture fee income $23 – $25 $33.6 Interest income $18 – $22 $28.4 Additional items (2) :\nRVI fee income $10 N/A General and administrative expenses (3) $70 $72.0 3Q18 Estimates:\nNet income attributable to Common Shareholders $0.02 – $0.03 N/A OFFO per share (basic and diluted) At least $0.15 N/A (1) Excludes major redevelopment. 2018 represents New DDR. 2017 represents DDR.

Additional information about the Company is available at www.ddr.com .\nConference Call and Supplemental Information\nThe Company will hold its quarterly conference call today at 4:45 p.m. Eastern Time. To participate with access to the slide presentation, please visit the Investors portion of DDR's website, www.ddr.com/events , or for audio only, dial 888-317-6003 (U.S.), 866-284-3684 (Canada) or 412-317-6061 (international) using pass code 7769620 at least ten minutes prior to the scheduled start of the call. A replay of the conference call will also be available at www.ddr.com/events for one year after the call. A copy of the Company’s Supplemental package is available on the Company’s website at www.ddr.com .\nNon-GAAP Measures\nFFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used as a standard in the real estate industry and is a widely accepted measure of real estate investment trust (“REIT”) performance. Management believes that both FFO and Operating FFO provide additional indicators of the financial performance of a REIT. The Company also believes that FFO and Operating FFO more appropriately measure the core operations of the Company and provide benchmarks to its peer group.\nFFO is generally defined and calculated by the Company as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: (i) preferred share dividends, (ii) gains and losses from disposition of depreciable real estate property and related investments, which are presented net of taxes, (iii) impairment charges on depreciable real estate property and related investments and (iv) certain non-cash items. These non-cash items principally include real property depreciation and amortization of intangibles, equity income (loss) from joint ventures and equity income (loss) from non-controlling interests and adding the Company’s proportionate share of FFO from its unconsolidated joint ventures and non-controlling interests, determined on a consistent basis. The Company’s calculation of FFO is consistent with the NAREIT definition. The Company calculates Operating FFO by excluding certain non-operating charges and gains. Operating FFO is useful to investors as the Company removes non-comparable charges and gains to analyze the results of its operations and assess performance of the core operating real estate portfolio. Other real estate companies may calculate FFO and Operating FFO in a different manner.\nThe Company also uses net operating income (“NOI”), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental performance measure. NOI is calculated as property revenues less property-related expenses. The Company believes NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and, when compared across periods, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and disposition activity on an unleveraged basis.\nThe Company presents NOI information herein on a same store basis or “SSNOI.” The Company defines SSNOI as property revenues less property-related expenses, which exclude straight-line rental income and expenses, lease termination income, management fee expense, fair market value of leases and expense recovery adjustments. The Company presents SSNOI both with and without provisions for uncollectible amounts and/or recoveries thereof. SSNOI also excludes activity associated with development and major redevelopment and single tenant assets and includes assets owned in comparable periods (15 months for quarter comparisons). In addition, due to the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria on its properties in Puerto Rico in 2017, the Company also excludes its Puerto Rico NOI from SSNOI. SSNOI excludes all non-property and corporate level revenue and expenses. Other real estate companies may calculate NOI and SSNOI in a different manner. The Company believes SSNOI provides investors with additional information regarding the operating performances of comparable assets because it excludes certain non-cash and non-comparable items as noted above.\nFFO, Operating FFO, NOI and SSNOI do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as indicators of the Company’s operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this release and the accompanying financial supplement.\nSafe Harbor\nDDR Corp. considers portions of the information in this press release to be within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, with respect to the Company's expectation for future periods. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such are based upon reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved.
