Chief of Staff John Kelly , after hearing about the incident, rushed over and told U.S. officials to keep walking, Axios said. That resulted in a commotion between the Americans and the Chinese. \n\"A Chinese security official grabbed Kelly, and Kelly shoved the man's hand off of his body. Then a U.S. Secret Service agent grabbed the Chinese security official and tackled him to the ground,\" according to the report. \nThe news outlet reported the scuffle was over \"in a flash\" and the Chinese never touched the briefcase. The chief of the Beijing security detail apologized, Axios said. \nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T03:15:19.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
