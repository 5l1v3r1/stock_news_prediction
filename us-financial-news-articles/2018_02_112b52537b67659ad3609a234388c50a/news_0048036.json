The Germans, Francesco Friedrich and Thorsten Margis, were able to make up that time and tie the Canadians, Justin Kripps and Alexander Kopacz.\nWatch more Olympics videos here Messrs. Kripps and Kopacz finished their run and began celebrating. Then they saw the Germans celebrating too. There was only one explanation: The first tie for gold since the 1998 Olympic games.\nOver the course of four runs, each team’s times were both exactly the same -- down to the hundredth of a second: 3:16.86.\nUnfortunately, we can’t show you those precise highlights. NBC paid over $1 billion for the rights to broadcast this and all other Olympic events at the Winter Games in South Korea. The Wall Street Journal paid far less than that to bring you this exclusive look at highlights from the two-man bobsled competition -- portrayed by puppets.\nWe’re very serious about this.\nSign up to receive our Olympics Briefing.
