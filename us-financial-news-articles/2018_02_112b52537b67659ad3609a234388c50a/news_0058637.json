That view weighed on U.S. 10-year Treasuries yields, dragging down the dollar.\nThe Fed, looking past a recent stock market sell-off and concern about inflation, said on Friday it sees steady growth continuing and no serious risks on the horizon that might pause its planned pace of rate hikes.\nGold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion and strengthen the dollar, in which it is priced.\nThe heads of the European Central Bank and Bank of England are also set to give speeches this week.\nHedge funds and money managers raised their net long positions in COMEX gold contracts in the week to Feb. 20, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday, though they reduced positions in palladium.\n“In palladium, money manager long position has been decreasing for six consecutive weeks and is at the lowest level in over a year,” Societe Generale said in a note.\nAutocatalyst metal palladium was up 1.2 percent at $1,059.40 an ounce after touching $1,062.60 earlier in the session, its highest since Jan. 30.\nAmong other precious metals, silver was up 1.1 percent at $16.72 an ounce, while platinum was 0.5 percent higher at $1,000.99 an ounce.\nAdditinal reporting by Eileen Soreng in Bengaluru, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T05:16:20.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
