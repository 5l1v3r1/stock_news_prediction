Gocompare.Com, which demerged from British insurer esure Group, said adjusted operating profit rose to 36 million pounds ($50.0 million) for the year ended Dec. 31, from 30 million pounds a year earlier, helped in part by higher marketing margins. Revenue rose 5.1 percent to 149.2 million pounds in the period.
