The system currently services approximately 133,000 dedicated acres for multiple Bakken producers, including XTO Energy, Inc. Tallgrass anticipates that BNN will spend an additional approximately $45 million in 2018 to further expand the system to accommodate increased dedicated water volumes resulting from expected new drilling and completions. Once the additional infrastructure is completed, Tallgrass expects the total investment will approximate a five times cash flow multiple.\nWith this acquisition, BNN now owns and operates over 230 miles of water supply and gathering pipelines in addition to other water supply, storage, recycle, and disposal assets; making them one of the largest independent operators of water infrastructure in the industry.\n“The acquisition of this Bakken water infrastructure expands BNN’s footprint into another premier oil and gas producing region of the country, while establishing and expanding important customer relationships for BNN and Tallgrass,” said BNN Vice President and General Manager Jeff Nelson. “In addition, this acquisition provides Tallgrass with an opportunity to grow its midstream service offerings in the Bakken.”\nAbout Tallgrass Energy\nTallgrass Energy is a family of companies that includes publicly traded partnerships Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: TEP) and Tallgrass Energy GP, LP (NYSE: TEGP), and privately held Tallgrass Development, LP. Operating across 11 states, Tallgrass is a growth-oriented midstream energy operator with transportation, storage, terminal, water, gathering and processing assets that serve some of the nation’s most prolific crude oil and natural gas basins.\nTo learn more, please visit our website at www.tallgrassenergy.com .\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nDisclosures in this press release contain forward-looking statements.
