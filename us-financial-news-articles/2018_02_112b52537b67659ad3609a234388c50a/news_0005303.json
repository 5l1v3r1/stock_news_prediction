Some brain imaging tests can cost more than 150,000 yen ($915).\nA simple, low-cost blood tests could also make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to secure enough people at risk of Alzheimer’s to test new drugs to fight the disease, said researchers.\n“Our blood test may ... have a transformative potential to facilitate the development of effective drugs for Alzheimer’s disease,” Katsuhiko Yanagisawa, director-general of the Japanese National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology’s research institute, said in a statement.\nUniversity of Melbourne Professor Colin Masters, a member of the Australian team of researchers, said the blood test was a step towards a potential cure for the disease.\n“You have got to walk before you run. You have to learn to diagnose the disease directly before you can hope to see the effect of therapeutic intervention. And that’s where the real value in this test will come,” Masters said.\nAlzheimer’s disease starts years before patients have any symptoms of memory loss, so the key to treatment is in early detection.\nAlzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, affecting up to 70 percent of all people with dementia, with three in 10 people over 85 having dementia, according to the Australian government’s Dementia Australia organisation.\nThe disease was first recorded in 1907 by Dr Alois Alzheimer.
