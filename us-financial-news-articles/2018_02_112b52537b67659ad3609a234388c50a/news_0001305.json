You’d think that with rates up, the dollar would be up, but investors are focusing their interest elsewhere,” such as further evidence that the European economy is picking up, said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\nA survey on Thursday showed eurozone manufacturing continued to boom last month, supporting expectations that the European Central Bank is on track to normalise monetary policy.\nThe euro edged down 0.1 percent on the day to $1.2500 , but remained within sight of last week’s 3-year high of $1.2538. For the week, it was up 0.5 percent.\nAgainst its Japanese counterpart, the dollar was slightly lower on the day at 109.38, holding above a four-month nadir of 108.28 hit a week ago.\nLater on Friday, investors will be watching the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for January, for the latest clues on the strength of the U.S. labour market.\nNonfarm payrolls probably rose by 180,000 jobs in January after increasing 148,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, though many market participants expect a rate hike in March. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year after hiking interest rates three times last year.\nReporting by Lisa Twaronite; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T07:37:43.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
