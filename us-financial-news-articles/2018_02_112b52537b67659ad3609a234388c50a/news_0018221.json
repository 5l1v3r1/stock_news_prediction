The index has now turned negative on the year.\nNo bourse could escape the carnage following another big sell-off on Wall Street overnight where the Dow Jones plunged 4.1 percent and the S&P 500 3.7 percent.\nWilliam Jackson, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said there could be more pain ahead if Wall Street opened weaker again today.\n“Some of the EM asset valuations are relatively high and credit spreads are very tight so there could be scope for more correction,” he said. “But what we would be more concerned about from an EM perspective is a sharper rise in global interest rates triggered by concerns about inflation.”\nChinese mainland shares led the losses, tumbling 4.3 percent to their lowest since August 2017. The blue chip index was down 10 percent on the week, its worst weekly fall since August 2015.\nChinese inflation eased as expected in January, which could support the view that the world’s second-largest economy is slowly starting to lose momentum.\nChina’s yuan steadied after Thursday’s fall, firming 0.4 percent, but looked set for its first weekly loss in two months as demand for dollars increased ahead of the long Lunar New Year holidays.\nThe revival of an outbound investment scheme after a two-year hiatus has also weighed on the yuan.\nHong Kong shares plunged 3.1 percent, set to end the week down 9.5 percent, their worst week since October 2008, while index heavyweight South Korea fell 1.8 percent.\nIn Emerging Europe the biggest fallers included Russia and Turkey, both down over 1 percent and racking up weekly losses of around 4 percent.\nSouth African stocks fell 1.3 percent and were set to end the week down 5 percent, their worst since January 2016 as the waiting game with President Jacob Zuma continued.\nANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa has cleared his diary for Friday, fuelling speculation he is making a final push to force Zuma to step down. The rand firmed 0.4 percent, having slipped to a three-week trough overnight.\nSouth African dollar bonds fell as much as 1 cent across the curve and the average yield spread of South African sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified widened out by 9 basis points (bps) to 240 bps, the highest since early January.\nSouth African five-year credit default swaps also rose 4 bps from Thursday’s close to 159 bps, according to IHS Markit data, the highest since late-December.\nThe Russian rouble was 0.6 percent firmer, off a 1-1/2 month low ahead of a central bank meeting at which it is expected to cut rates by 25 bps to 7.5 percent.\nHowever, some analysts see the possibility of a deeper 50 bps cut. “The weakness in the inflation data, some of the weakness in the hard activity data and the relatively dovish comments from the central bank governor mean there might be scope for a larger cut,” said Jackson.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1143.32 -19.77 -1.70 -1.31\nCzech Rep 1107.00 -10.32 -0.92 +2.67\nPoland 2399.49 -6.99 -0.29 -2.51\nHungary 38737.90 -138.03 -0.36 -1.62\nRomania 8047.22 -20.34 -0.25 +3.79\nGreece 829.77 -11.61 -1.38 +3.41\nRussia 1194.71 -15.98 -1.32 +3.49\nSouth Africa 49248.80 -685.99 -1.37 -6.25\nTurkey 13012.65 -1250.88 -1.09 -2.01\nChina 3130.93 -131.12 -4.02 -5.33\nIndia 33980.85 -432.31 -1.26 -0.22\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.32 25.36 +0.19 +0.83\nPoland 4.20 4.19 -0.16 -0.52\nHungary 311.82 311.29 -0.17 -0.41\nRomania 4.64 4.65 +0.21 +0.73\nSerbia 118.42 118.54 +0.10 -0.02\nRussia 58.05 58.40 +0.59 -0.68\nKazakhstan 327.51 325.96 -0.47 +1.62\nUkraine 27.03 27.08 +0.18 +4.13\nSouth Africa 12.11 12.16 +0.42 +2.05\nKenya 100.90 100.70 -0.20 +2.18\nIsrael 3.52 3.52 +0.02 -1.06\nTurkey 3.82 3.82 -0.01 -0.84\nChina 6.30 6.32 +0.38 +3.31\nIndia 64.32 64.29 -0.05 -0.76\nBrazil 3.29 3.29 -0.00 +0.80\nMexico 18.83 18.89 +0.33 +4.33\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 307 2 .21 7 91.34 1\nEditing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T12:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T12:21:01.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
