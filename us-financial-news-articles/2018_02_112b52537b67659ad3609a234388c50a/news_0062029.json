Zypries told business daily Handelsblatt that she viewed Geely’s move as a corporate decision on which she did not want to comment, adding Germany was an open economy that welcomed investment as long as all parties complied with the rules. But Zypries also said that Germany’s openness generally should not be used as a gateway for other countries’“industrial-political interests”.
