The Dow moved in a range of more than 800 points.\nThe fresh volatility came a day after the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow industrials confirmed they were in correction territory, both falling more than 10 percent from Jan. 26 record highs. On Friday, the intraday low for the tech-heavy Nasdaq also pulled it more than 10 percent from its recent peak.\nFriday’s session marked the latest day of sharp swings in the past week that have pulled stocks lower after a steady climb for months to record highs.\n“I just think the market has to find new footing here,“ said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ”We are in very sloppy territory, until we’re not in sloppy territory.”\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 40.58 points, or 0.17 percent, to 23,901.04, the S&P 500 gained 6.87 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,587.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 18.92 points, or 0.28 percent, to 6,796.08.\nTechnology was among the best performing groups. Energy shares lagged as oil prices tumbled.\nThe Dow Jones Transport Average index fell 1.3 percent. The index was dragged down by shares of package delivery companies FedEx and United Parcel Service after a report said Amazon.com is preparing to launch a delivery service for businesses.\nThe sharp selloff in recent days was kicked off by concerns over rising inflation and bond yields, sparked by last week’s January U.S. jobs report.\nEquities for years have looked relatively attractive compared to the low yields offered by bonds, but the rise in Treasury yields has diminished the allure of stocks, especially with stock valuations at historically expensive levels.\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries hovered around 2.82 percent after touching a four-year peak of 2.885 percent on Monday.\n“That’s part of this recalculation that has gone on in the market: How do we factor in higher bond yields?” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “And that is a process that is playing out.”\nThe S&P 500 lost $2.49 trillion in market value since Jan. 26 through Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nVolatility remained high compared to recent months. The market’s main gauge of volatility, the Cboe Volatility Index , hovered around 34 on Friday, about three times the average level of the past year.\nAdditional reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, Caroline Valetkevitch in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:23:40.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
