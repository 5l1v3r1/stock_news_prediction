Shares of drug distributors Mckesson Corp and Cardinal Health were lower.\n“This purported deal wouldn’t be shocking ... but we’re currently struggling to see the strategic allure of the combination for Walgreens,” Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said in a note.\nThe two companies are already closely allied, having struck a 10-year deal in 2013 for AmerisourceBergen to buy drugs for Walgreens, which subsequently acquired 26 percent of the distributor.\nThe rationale for such a deal is a bit of a head-scratcher as Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen already have a joint venture that affords both the strategic value that combining would provide, Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said.\nThe news comes as the U.S. healthcare landscape remains in a state of flux, with changes to the U.S. Affordable Care Act escalating drug prices and Amazon’s possible entry.\nWalgreens has highlighted that it tends to prefer partnerships, which analysts say could eventually turn into acquisitions.\nA deal, however, would give Walgreens a bigger presence in the specialty pharmacy space, where it does not have adequate exposure, setting it up to compete better against CVS and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co.\n“As the broader healthcare sector focuses more on moving specialty drug administration out of facility-based (hospital/physician’s office) settings, gaining a strong foothold in specialty through ABC could be a valuable strategic move,” Tanquilut said.
