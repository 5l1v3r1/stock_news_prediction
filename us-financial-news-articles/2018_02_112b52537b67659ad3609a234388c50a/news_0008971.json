You’re going to save all that interest,” he said.\nThe city ended what was then the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy in December 2014 after shedding about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations.\nMichigan’s biggest city is on track to end state supervision of its finances this spring after an audit released last week showed it completed a third-straight fiscal year with a balanced budget. One element of the city’s federal court-approved bankruptcy exit plan was Michigan’s creation of an oversight board.\nThe city reported another positive development on Monday -- residential property values had a net increase for the first time in at least 17 years. Higher assessed values, which rose to $3 billion from $2.8 billion last year, could lead to more property tax revenue for Detroit.\nReporting by Karen Pierog in ChicagoEditing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T20:53:55.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
