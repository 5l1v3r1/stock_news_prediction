A further 468 suspects were discharged and 28 suspects were remanded for trial in Abuja or Minna. \nThe other trials were adjourned. \nReporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Chijioke Ohuocha, Andrew Heavens and William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T21:49:18.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
