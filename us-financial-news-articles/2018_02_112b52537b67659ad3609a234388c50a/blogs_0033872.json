Current President Jimmy Morales, a former television comedian who ran on an anti-corruption ticket, came under fire last year from the United Nations, the European Union and the U.S. ambassador in Guatemala for attempting to expel a U.N.-backed prosecutor seeking to put him on trial for alleged corruption.\nThe investigation into allegations of illicit campaign financing, which followed separate graft probes into members of the president's family, had threatened Morales with impeachment. He escaped that fate but his authority has been seriously hampered.\nMorales' predecessor, former president Otto Perez, is currently behind bars, awaiting trial on graft charges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T17:34:26.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
