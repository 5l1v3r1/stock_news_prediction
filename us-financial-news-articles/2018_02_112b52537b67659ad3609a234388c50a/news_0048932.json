(NYSE: GPS) today announced that Jeff Kirwan, president and CEO of Gap brand, will leave the company.\n\"Under Jeff's leadership we made significant progress on the operating model of Gap brand. We are faster and more responsive than ever before, we radically improved quality and fit, and we centered the brand on the aesthetic that our customers love: casual, optimistic and American. We have also seen the results of exceptional marketing and customer engagement reflected in increased traffic, improved sales and the strength of the digital business,\" said Art Peck, chief executive officer of Gap Inc.\n\"While I am pleased with our progress in brand health and product quality, we have not achieved the operational excellence and accelerated profit growth that we know is possible at Gap brand.
