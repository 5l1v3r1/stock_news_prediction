The three losses were unfortunate,” she said.\nIce Hockey – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Women Preliminary Round Match - Korea v Japan - Kwandong Hockey Centre, Gangneung, South Korea – February 14, 2018 - Korea's Lee Jing-yu cries after her team lost to Japan.

The girls are pretty upset.”\nThere may be awards coming, IOC member Angela Ruggiero suggesting the unified team be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, but there will definitely be no Olympic medals.\nSlideshow (2 Images) A 4-1 loss to Japan, a former colonial power and common arch- rival for both North and South Korea, on Wednesday officially brought that fanciful dream to an end.\nFor Murray the work continues with seeding games that will help determine world rankings.\nThe remaining contests, which will be played out quietly away from the medal chase, will be the ones that matter to South Korea as they look toward the future and building the sport which is unlikely to include the North.\nThe 12 North Korea players will, however, continue to be part of the team through the Olympic classification matches.\n”Once the decision was made to combine the teams we were one team so going into this tournament we were one team preparing to play,“ Murray said. ”Our games weren’t a political statement for us, they were just games.\n”We were just a team coming together to play in the Olympics, same as Sweden, same as Japan, same as Canada we were one team.\n“We weren’t trying to make a statement we were just trying to put together our best game with the roster we had.”\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:15:04.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
