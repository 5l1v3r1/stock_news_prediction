Clermont said in a statement that Parra, who picked up the injury before the start of the championship last month, would be sidelined for “four to six weeks”. Parra could return to action for his team’s Champions Cup quarter-final against fellow French club Racing 92 in April, Clermont added. France have lost their first two Six Nations games having been beaten 15-13 by Ireland and 32-26 by Scotland. They take on Italy on Feb. 23 in Marseille, face England at the Stade de France on March 10 and end their campaign in Wales the following week.
