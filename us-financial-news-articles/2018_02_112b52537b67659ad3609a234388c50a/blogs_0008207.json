But on his watch, the company ultimately improved its supply chain, expanded its offering, made inroads with men and continued to thrive. \nLululemon Executive Chairman Glenn Murphy, a former CEO of Gap Inc (gps) , said “protecting the organization’s culture is one of the Board’s most important duties.” \nThe Vancouver company will look for a new CEO, and three senior executives got additional responsibilities: Celeste Burgoyne, EVP for the Americas, will handle stores and e-commerce; Stuart Haselden, Chief Operating Officer, will oversee finance, supply chain, staff, and technology; and Sun Choe, a merchant, will be in charge product development, design, innovation, and merchandising. Lululemon reaffirmed its expectation it will hit $4 billion in revenue in 2020. \nIn the meantime, Lululemon will pay Potdevin an upfront cash payment of $3.35 million and another $1.65 million over 18 months as part of his severance package. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T01:55:53.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
