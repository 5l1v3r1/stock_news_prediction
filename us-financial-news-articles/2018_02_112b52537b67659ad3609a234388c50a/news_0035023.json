The most recent athlete to do so was American Lauryn Williams, in sprinting and bobsleigh.\nWhite will be able to rely on his long-time friend and mentor Tony Hawk for encouragement.\nHawk, widely regarded as the greatest skateboarder in history and a pioneer for many of the tricks in the sport, first met White when he was nine years old.\n“Tony, thank you for being such a great inspiration for me and such a good role model for me to look up to. He told me to come win this thing and then sail off into the sunset and never touch a snowboard again,” White said.\n“I hope he wishes me luck because I think I am going to go on to skateboarding.”\nHawk warned that White would have to completely change his style to successfully compete in Tokyo.\n“It’s an exciting opportunity for skateboarding to be seen by a worldwide audience and I think people will be very surprised to see teams from the most unlikely countries,” said Hawk in an email to Reuters.\n“Perhaps if Vert was one of the disciplines (White could compete), but he would have to completely change his style in order to compete in park or street. So it’s not likely, but he’s welcome to try.”\nWhatever White decides to do it would take a brave person to bet against an athlete whose competitive fire runs deeper than most.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T21:04:22.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
