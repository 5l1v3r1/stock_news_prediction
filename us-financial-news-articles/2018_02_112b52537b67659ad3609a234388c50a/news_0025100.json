To be able to walk around in a tracksuit for three weeks, that’s good too,” she said.

( reut.rs/2G8pGUr ) \nBy far the most common outfit is the pink and gray worn by the army of volunteers deployed across the venues in Pyeongchang and the coastal town of Gangneung. \nYoon Gun-woo, a South Korean volunteer at the Gangneung Olympic Park, said he liked the job but the uniform was a bit too garish for his taste. \n“It’s the colour of meat. It feels a bit strange,” he said.
