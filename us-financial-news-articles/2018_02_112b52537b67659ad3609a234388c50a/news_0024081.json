Its two main units are CEIC and EMIS, which provide economic data, news and analytics.\nThe purchase is expected to close in the first half of this year, Caixin said.\nEuromoney is 49.1 percent-owned by Daily Mail & General Trust Plc ( DMGOa.L ).​\nCaixin described itself as “privately-owned and more entrepreneurial” than its state-owned peers. It is funded by private backers including CMC Capital Partners.\nReporting by Sarah Young in London and John Ruwitch in Shanghai, Editing by Paul Sandle and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T13:41:44.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
