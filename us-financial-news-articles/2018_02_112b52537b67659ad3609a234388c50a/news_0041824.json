We support each other’s missions and exchange visits. Our armies have many joint activities,” Nothapol told Reuters, adding that the Thai army had requested Hlaing’s award since last year.\n“This is a separate issue from human rights.”\nThe Burma Human Rights Network said Thailand had crossed a “red line” by granting the award to Hlaing because Thailand is seen as a place of refuge by many Rohingya and other minority groups fleeing persecution in Myanmar, also a Buddhist-majority country.\n“This kind of person doesn’t deserve to win this great award,” Kway Win, the group’s executive director, told Reuters.\nEarlier this week, Thailand and the United States kicked off the annual Cobra Gold military drills in Thailand - the largest such exercises in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThailand invited Myanmar as observers to the disaster relief and humanitarian assistance portions of Cobra Gold, prompting criticism from rights groups who questioned why a military accused of ethnic cleansing was being given access.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Bangkok this week said Myanmar was not a participant in any of the exercises.\nReporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat, Patpicha Tanakasempipat and Panu Wongcha-um; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T15:19:04.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
