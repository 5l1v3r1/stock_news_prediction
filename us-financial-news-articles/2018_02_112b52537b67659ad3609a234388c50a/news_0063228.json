Closer diplomatic and military ties between Beijing and Islamabad have come at a time when China is helping Pakistan’s economy grow by investing billions in infrastructure projects.\nThe United States and Pakistan have clashed over militants waging war in Afghanistan, with Washington accusing Islamabad of providing safe havens to the Afghan Taliban and their affiliate, the Haqqani network. Pakistan denies helping the militants, saying the Islamist fighters are mostly across the border.\n“Ms. Curtis urged the government of Pakistan to address the continuing presence of the Haqqani network and other terrorist groups within its territory,” the embassy added.\nThe Trump administration suspended about $2 billion in security assistance to Pakistan in January, days after Trump tweeted that Pakistan has given nothing but “lies and deceit” in return for generous aid.\nIslamabad responded that it doesn’t need Washington’s money but wants, instead, respect for the vast sacrifices it has made in the war on terror.\nCurtis, who is also the U.S. National Security Council’s senior director for South and Central Asia, also raised Washington’s worries about gaps in Pakistan’s anti-terrorist financing controls, a frequent criticism by Western powers who say not enough is done to curb fund-raising by militants.\nThe U.S. motion to place Pakistan on the FATF “grey list” of nations with weak terrorist-financing controls was co-sponsored by Britain, Germany and France. Only Turkey opposed the U.S. motion at a Paris meeting of nearly 40 member states.\nReporting by Drazen Jorgic\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T16:12:10.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
