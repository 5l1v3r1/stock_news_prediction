Other Schedule I drugs include heroin and LSD.\nIn their lawsuit, filed in July, the plaintiffs claimed that the federal ban on marijuana violates the U.S. Constitution.\nHellerstein said that even if he had the authority to decide the issue, he would have to rule against the plaintiffs because there was no “fundamental right” to use marijuana.\nReporting By Brendan Pierson in New York, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T02:47:29.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
