Ziga Pance scored their second with under a minute left.\nAll four teams in Group B have a win and a loss each, but the U.S. top the standings with four points because their defeat by Slovenia came in overtime.\nThe Russians are third due to the head-to-head loss against Slovakia, and they play the Americans on Saturday when Slovenia take on Slovakia.
