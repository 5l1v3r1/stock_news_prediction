They then bury the child in an isolated place away from the village.”\nBabies whose mothers die in childbirth, or who are born after something bad has happened to the family, also risk being labeled spirit children.\nSMART GIRL Angela, now a bright seven-year-old, is one of 110 children rescued by Asakibeem and his team at AfriKids.\nShe has learnt to walk with prosthetic limbs, helps her mother with chores, and is thriving at school. Angela’s parents separated after her birth but her father has begged for a reconciliation after seeing her progress, AfriKids said.\n“She’s a very strong girl, she’s smart and a fast learner,” Asakibeem told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by Skype.\n“My hope is one day she will become a nurse or teacher and serve as a role model to the community.”\nAsakibeem, 41, grew up in the Kassena Nankana region in northern Ghana, where the belief in kinkirigo, or spirit children, was deeply embedded.\nIn 2005, up to 15 percent of babies who died were thought to have been killed as spirit children, according to AfriKids.\nAsakibeem began talking to parents, village elders and concoction men to change mindsets and dispel superstitions by informing them about the medical reasons for disabilities and promoting healthcare.\nAsakibeem said many disabilities in the region were linked to poor nutrition and healthcare during pregnancy, and a lack of access to medical help during labor complications.\nAfriKids has set up a center in Asakibeem’s home village, Sirigu, and another in nearby Bongo district, providing help for disabled children, a support group for their mothers and antenatal care for pregnant women.\nIt gives small loans for businesses like basketry, pottery and poultry farming to help mothers support their families.\nOne challenge was persuading the concoction men to stop. AfriKids provided livestock and loans to kickstart businesses.\nIt also takes them to areas where children with disabilities flourish and some of those who once made a living from killing children have become advocates to protect them, Asakibeem said.\nNo child killings have been reported in Kassena Nankana for 10 years, but Asakibeem said they continue elsewhere.\n“We’re now expanding our work to the whole of northern Ghana. My dream is that in 15 years I can stop this practice.”\nReporting by Emma Batha, Editing by Robert Carmichael.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, which covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.
