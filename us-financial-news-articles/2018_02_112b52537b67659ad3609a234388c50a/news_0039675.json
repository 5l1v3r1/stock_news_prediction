The app said it would review all previous serious complaints and, from next month, give riders across Britain the license number of the driver on their booking confirmation and electronic receipt. It will also report any serious incidents to police itself rather than leave it to the individuals involved. Uber is appealing against Transport for Londonâ€™s decision to strip it of its operating license in September last year.
