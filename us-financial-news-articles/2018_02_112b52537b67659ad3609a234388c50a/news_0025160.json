But such clips were no longer suitable and do not reflect values of today’s society.” \nOnce tipped as a potential Richemont chief executive, Kern left for Breitling abruptly in July 2017 just four months after taking over as head of Richemont’s watchmaking division. \nNew Breitling advertisements will start in May, he said, adding he planned to keep Breitling’s airplane theme, including with the company’s jet team, to maintain the watch’s appeal with the aviation community. \nBut he also hopes to highlight Breitling’s broader appeal -- it once sponsored the Tour de France cycling race, for instance -- to boost annual sales of around 430 million Swiss francs ($457.50 million) now. \nKern said he was not sure how long buyout firm CVC [CVC.UL] would keep its 80 percent stake in the company. \n“Breitling has many loyal customers and we grew during the past two very difficult years for the watch industry,” he said. “We are not a restructuring case. The company is very profitable.” \nKern did not give profit figures. \n($1 = 0.9399 Swiss francs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T17:22:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
