French week-ahead power is off Wednesday’s 13-week high but still at its highest level since early December.\nIG BCE is seeking a 5.5 percent pay rise for nuclear employees in E.ON’s PreussenElektra unit and those in regional subsidiary Avacon as well as at power network operator Tennet .\nWorkers already protested at Avacon in Salzgitter on Monday.\nThe union said employers had offered to raise salaries by 2.1 percent over 18 months.\nIG BCE, together with the Verdi union which shares representation of some 10,000 workers across E.ON, say the company’s offer left employees short, in comparison with related industries and given E.ON’s economic situation.\nThe company has said it will help generate a fair deal.
