This is complex technology which would take a lot of effort (for others) to develop originally,” CLSA analyst Chris Richter said.\nReporting by Naomi Tajitsu; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T14:56:41.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
