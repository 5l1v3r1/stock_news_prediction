This is the best thing about my job; the racing. I just feel good in my bubble and focus on myself, my riding and I think it helps me.”\nSnowboard - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Parallel Giant Slalom Finals - Phoenix Snow Park - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 24, 2018 - Ester Ledecka of Czech Republic reacts. REUTERS/Issei Kato SILVER LINING For Joerg, the silver medal could be regarded as a long-awaited redemption after she narrowly missed out on a medal in Vancouver eight years ago.\n“I have worked so hard to be here, on the podium,” the 30-year-old said.\nSlideshow (4 Images) “I remember... in Vancouver getting fourth place, but today it is amazing for me to win a medal and to be on the podium with Ramona (Hofmeister), it is the best possible thing I could imagine.”\nThe German silver and bronze matches the feat the country achieved in Sochi in the shorter parallel slalom, although that event was not retained for Pyeongchang.\nJoerg also lavished praise on Ledecka, who she believes can drive the sport of snowboarding further and push it to the forefront at the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.\n“She is incredible. A second gold medal here, one in skiing, one in snowboarding. I have never heard of that before, is it even possible?” asked Joerg, who is ranked third in the world behind Ledecka and Hofmeister.\n“Just doing one sport is a full-time job.”\nDespite her unique achievement, Ledecka believes there is more to come.\n“I can push myself further and there are still mistakes in skiing and snowboarding and I want to improve myself,” she said.\n“There are no limits.”\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T08:53:44.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
