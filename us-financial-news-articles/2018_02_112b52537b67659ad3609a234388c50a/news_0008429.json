PTT does not typically discuss commercial matters and did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.\nCondensate production capacity of the Wheatstone and Lago fields, and nearby third-party fields, is 30,000 barrels per day, Chevron has said on its website, and original development plans called for the oil to load from the Ashburton terminal on the northern coast of Western Australia.\nThe condensate - an ultra light oil that is often produced alongside natural gas - is expected to have an API gravity of about 66 degrees, the sources said.\nWoodside Petroleum - one of the partners in the Wheatstone project - could market a second condensate cargo from the project for loading in April-May, the sources said.\nWoodside as well does not usually comment on commercial matters and did not respond to an email enquiry.\nChevron’s chief executive said on Friday that the second train at Wheatstone LNG should come online in the second quarter this year.\nThe project started production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in October and exported its first super-chilled gas cargo to Japan in the same month.\nReporting by Florence Tan and Jessica JaganathanEditing by Christian Schmollinger and Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T05:21:00.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
