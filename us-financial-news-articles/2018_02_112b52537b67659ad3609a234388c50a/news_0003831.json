Childs will serve as one of the top media relations professionals for Bayer in the U.S. and report directly to Christopher Loder, Vice President and Head of External Communications for Bayer U.S.\n\"We are fortunate to have someone of Dan's knowledge and experience in journalism and broadcast media join our Bayer team,\" Loder said. \"Through his stellar work with 'Good Morning America,' 'World News with David Muir' and ABCNews.com , Dan has informed Americans about the most pressing health, science and medical news. He has a storyteller's gift of taking complex information and translating it to a lay audience. Dan will bring innovation and creativity to Bayer.\"\nChilds covered numerous public health issues during his time as a producer and editor at ABC News, most notably the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the 2015 Zika epidemic, the Affordable Care Act and the opioid crisis in America. Last year, Childs received an Emmy for his contributions to the network's hospital and medical reporting in the wake of the Pulse Nightclub Massacre. In 2013, Childs shared in two George Foster Peabody Awards: one for his contributions to the reporting of New York City hospital evacuations during Superstorm Sandy; and the other for \"Robin's Journey,\" a segment about \"Good Morning America\" Anchor Robin Roberts' fight against myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), for which he coordinated ABC News' social media efforts promoting the National Marrow Donor Program's Be The Match Registry.\nChilds also coordinated and supervised the ABC News Medical Journalism resident rotation – a unique four-week program that attracted hundreds of physicians from across the United States and trained them to work within a national network news division. Many of these participants went on to become local TV doctors and media contributors in their communities.\nIn addition to his duties at ABC News, Childs is also an adjunct lecturer at the Tufts University School of Medicine, where he teaches a course on health media messaging at the school's Summer Institute. Childs has also served as a panelist discussing patient and health care consumer empowerment at the Association of Health Care Journalists (AHCJ) annual conference.\nPrevious to ABC News, Childs worked as an editor and co-host at Cosmetic Surgery and Beauty magazine and as a staff writer at The Daily Courier. He holds a Master of Arts degree in medical journalism from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Wake Forest University.\nBayer: Science For A Better Life\nBayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the Life Science fields of health care and agriculture.
