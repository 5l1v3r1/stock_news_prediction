With an extensive background in business management and franchise operations as well as international licensing, Beach will lead the continued expansion of the Reis & Irvy’s brand around the world through its master license partnerships.\nThe high-tech robotic vending machines, which serve frozen yogurt, ice creams and sorbets, topped with six delicious toppings in under 60 seconds, have seen a tremendous response from the market. Since its debut in April of 2016, Reis & Irvy’s has grown to over 200 franchisees across U.S. and international markets, representing more than 1,000 pending robot installations. The popularity of the Froyo Robots has expanded exponentially and is sparking demand from entrepreneurs inspired to be part of the newest innovation in on-demand vending robotics, both domestically and around the world. In late 2017, the franchise took aim at the international market, securing its first global agreements within Canada, Oman and Israel representing more than $22.6 million in potential revenue if certain purchase objectives are met from vending robot sales. Beach, whose previous experience includes international licensing for United Franchise Group (representing Signarama, Transworld Business Advisors, Experimac, Venture X, Jon Smith Subs, Paramount Tax & Accounting and Accurate Franchising) will now focus on accelerating the Reis & Irvy’s international expansion efforts.\n“As the Reis & Irvy’s Franchise continues to grow within the United States, it became apparent through our first international agreements, that its popularity has global potential,” said Nick Yates, Chairman of Generation NEXT Franchise Brands. “That being said, our focus is to capitalize and expand the reach of this amazing opportunity to every corner of the world. Andrew brings the expertise and knowledge of international markets that will make that happen.”\nBeach, originally a native of New York, has settled into his role within the Generation NEXT Franchise Brands San Diego headquarters, but has his eye on global opportunities.\n“Reis & Irvy’s is a brand that is transforming and disrupting the frozen dessert industry as a whole, not just within the United States, but on a global level,” said Beach. “Individuals around the world that have the infrastructure to replicate our successful model here in the U.S., now have the opportunity to be the first within their respective countries to provide consumers with a technology that has never been seen before.”\nFor more information on the revolutionary Reis & Irvy’s Froyo Robots or to learn more about Master Licensing opportunities, visit the Reis & Irvy’s website at http://www.reisandirvys.com To learn more about Generation NEXT Franchise Brands or their family of brands, including Reis & Irvy’s, please visit www.gennextbrands.com or call toll free 888-902-7558.\n# # #\nThis information is not intended as an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, a franchise.
