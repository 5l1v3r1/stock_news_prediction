President Calhoun and his leadership team, along with The University of Texas System team that provided strong support, should be very proud of this transformative advancement in healthcare for East Texas,\" said Tucker.\n\"The formation of UT Health East Texas is a game changer for our region,\" said Kevin Eltife, former state senator and Tyler mayor, and current member of the UT System Board of Regents. \"With the support of the UT System and Ardent, UT Health East Texas will continue to raise the bar for quality and accessibility of healthcare services while generating significant economic impact for communities throughout East Texas.\"\nUT Health East Texas will include 502-bed East Texas Medical Center in Tyler, UT Health Northeast hospital and clinics, the UT Health Northeast MD Anderson Cancer Center, eight regional hospitals, more than 50 clinic locations and an EMS fleet of more than 45 ambulances and four helicopters.
