The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in December.\n* In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 230,000 for the week ended Feb. 10.\n* U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax reform will help boost U.S. growth in the short term but may have negative consequences such as on the deficit and debt in the medium term, said International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde.\n* India’s trade deficit in January was the widest in more than 4-1/2 years as a surge in the country’s oil and coal import bill outweighed a rise in exports, government data showed on Thursday.\n* SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.29 percent to 821.30 tonnes on Thursday from 823.66 tonnes on Wednesday.\n* Polyus, Russia’s largest gold producer, posted a 7-percent increase in 2017 adjusted net profit to $1.02 billion, the company said on Thursday.\n* Australia’s top gold miner, Newcrest Mining Ltd, on Thursday reported a 58-percent fall in half-year underlying profit, dragged down by disruptions such as an earthquake hitting one of its key sites earlier in 2017.\nReporting by Eileen Soreng in BengaluruEditing by Joseph Radford\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T05:47:08.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
