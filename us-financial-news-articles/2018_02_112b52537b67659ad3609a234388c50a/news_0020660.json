The steady state production target of c.500koz in 2022 has not changed. The rebase plan was announced in February 2017 A reduction in the gold price assumption used in the life of mine model to R525,000/kg from R600,000/kg\nWe are pleased to announce the successful life extension of the Cerro Corona mine in Peru to 2030 from 2023. The life extension will be achieved through the creation of additional, cost-effective tailings capacity. As a result of the increased life, a previous impairment of US$53m has been reversed.\nAttributable gold equivalent production for Q4 2017 is expected to be 546koz (Q3 2017: 567koz), with all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of US$959/oz (Q3 2017: US$906/oz) and all-in costs (AIC) of US$1,115/oz (Q3 2017: US$1,032/oz).\nFor FY 2017, attributable gold equivalent production is expected to be 2,160koz (FY 2016: 2,146koz), exceeding the guidance range of 2,100-2,150koz.
