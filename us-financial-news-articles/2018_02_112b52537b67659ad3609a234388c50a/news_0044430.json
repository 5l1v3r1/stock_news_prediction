Fourth quarter and full year Adjusted EBITDA was $169 million and $642 million, respectively, and Adjusted EPS was $2.14 and $8.13, respectively.\nNet sales in the fourth quarter increased 20% versus prior year driven primarily by the pass through of higher raw material costs as well as currency. Fourth quarter net income of $118 million, which included a pre-tax gain of approximately $22 million related to changes made to certain Company pension plans, was $39 million higher than prior year. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $169 million was $27 million higher than prior year. The higher operational profitability was due primarily to higher styrene, polystyrene, polycarbonate, and Latex Binders margins as well as higher Performance Plastics sales volume. These impacts were partially offset by lower Synthetic Rubber sales volume.\nNet sales in the full year increased 20% versus prior year driven primarily by the pass through of higher raw material costs. Full year net income of $328 million was $10 million higher than prior year. This increase was driven by improved performance in the Feedstocks, Basic Plastics, and Latex Binders segments due to higher margin. These improvements were partially offset by lower performance in the Americas Styrenics, Synthetic Rubber, and Performance Plastics segments, in addition to a $65 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year. Adjusted EBITDA in the full year of $642 million was $31 million higher than prior year which was comprised of about $55 million of fundamental business improvement, partially offset by about $24 million of unfavorable net timing impacts.\nCommenting on the Company’s performance, Chris Pappas, Trinseo President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continue to be encouraged by our performance. Our fourth quarter results were above the guidance we provided during our third quarter call due to strong operating conditions in several segments as well as pricing initiatives that resulted in higher than expected margins. For the second consecutive year we had record net income and Adjusted EBITDA.”\nPappas continued, “We also had very strong cash generation during the year, and we continue to return cash to shareholders. During 2017 we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares, utilizing about $89 million of cash, and we increased the dividend by 20%. In total, we returned nearly $150 million to shareholders via these actions. In addition, we completed our first acquisition, API Plastics, and we continue to make excellent progress on our other growth initiatives, including the SSBR expansion and pilot plant in Synthetic Rubber, and the ABS capacity in China, which are now all in operation.”\nFourth Quarter Results and Commentary by Business Segment\nLatex Binders net sales of $250 million for the quarter increased 4% versus prior year primarily from the pass through of higher raw material costs. Lower sales volume decreased revenue by 11%, excluding the divested Latin America business, driven by lower sales volume in the North America and Europe paper and carpet markets. Adjusted EBITDA of $33 million was $9 million above prior year from higher margin in Asia due to better market conditions, which was partially offset by lower sales volume. Synthetic Rubber net sales of $127 million for the quarter increased 2% versus prior year primarily due to currency as well as the pass through of higher raw material costs. These impacts were partially offset by lower sales volume which was driven by customer destocking, shipment delays, and a softer tire market. Adjusted EBITDA of $15 million was $14 million below prior year from lower sales volume as well as favorable prior year net timing impacts. Performance Plastics net sales of $227 million for the quarter was 37% above prior year including a 9% increase from the acquisition of API Plastics. In addition, net sales increased due to higher sales volume to the North America automotive and Asia consumer electronics and automotive markets as well as the pass through of higher raw material costs. Adjusted EBITDA of $43 million was $11 million above prior year primarily from higher sales volume. Basic Plastics net sales of $395 million for the quarter was 22% above prior year due mainly to the pass through of higher raw material costs, currency, and higher ABS sales volume. Adjusted EBITDA of $44 million was $11 million above prior year due primarily to higher polystyrene and polycarbonate margin in Europe, from more favorable market conditions, as well as higher ABS sales volume. Feedstocks net sales of $103 million for the quarter was 61% above prior year due to higher styrene-related sales volume as well as higher styrene prices. Adjusted EBITDA of $24 million was $10 million above prior year from higher styrene margin in Europe. Americas Styrenics Adjusted EBITDA of $31 million for the quarter was flat versus prior year as higher margin was offset by lower polystyrene sales volume.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Cash Generation\nCash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter was $196 million and capital expenditures were $38 million, resulting in Free Cash Flow for the quarter of $158 million. Fourth quarter cash from operations and Free Cash Flow included a favorable impact of approximately $34 million from lower working capital. Cash provided by operating activities for the full year was $391 million and capital expenditures were $147 million, resulting in Free Cash Flow for the year of $244 million. Full year cash from operations and Free Cash Flow included an unfavorable impact of approximately $127 million from higher working capital primarily from increasing raw material prices as well as additional working capital requirements from growth initiatives such as the acquisition of API Plastics, and the new SSBR and ABS capacity.\nAt the end of the year the Company had $433 million of cash reflecting the expenditures of $82 million for the purchase of API Plastics, net of cash acquired, as well as $128 million related to the successful debt refinancing earlier in the year. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to cash provided by operating activities, see note 3 below.\nOutlook\nFirst quarter 2018 net income of $104 million to $113 million, and earnings per diluted share of $2.34 to $2.52 First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $175 million to $185 million and Adjusted EPS of $2.34 to $2.52\nThe Company is updating previously issued guidance as follows:\nFull year 2018 net income of $369 million to $386 million and earnings per diluted share of $8.26 to $8.63 Full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $660 million and Adjusted EPS of $8.26 to $8.63\nCommenting on the outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018 Pappas said, “We expect strong performance in the first quarter from higher styrene margins, including impacts from planned and unplanned styrene production outages, as well as continued, healthy fundamentals across our segments.”\nPappas continued, “Looking ahead to the full year performance, we are increasing our prior 2018 net income and Adjusted EBITDA guidance as we continue to see strong business fundamentals, and as we expect a favorable impact from unplanned styrene outages in the first quarter. In addition, we expect continued strong cash generation for the year. As we move forward, we remain committed to balancing future growth initiatives with returning capital to shareholders. I am very proud of the company’s performance in 2017, and we remain focused on achieving a very strong 2018 and delivering returns to shareholders.”\nFor a reconciliation of fourth quarter and full year 2017, as well as first quarter and full year 2018, net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS, see note 2 below.

We believe these measures are useful for investors and management in evaluating business trends and performance each period. These income measures are also used to manage our business and assess current period profitability, as well as to provide an appropriate basis to evaluate the effectiveness of our pricing strategies. Such measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity, as applicable. The definitions of each of these measures, further discussion of usefulness, and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided herein.\nNote on Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As such, we do not separately report net sales of Americas Styrenics within our consolidated statement of operations.\nNote 2: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Performance Measures to Net income\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we refer to in making operating decisions because we believe it provides our management as well as our investors with meaningful information regarding the Company’s operational performance. We believe the use of EBITDA as a metric assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis.\nWe also present Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measure, which we define as income from continuing operations before interest expense, net; income tax provision; depreciation and amortization expense; loss on extinguishment of long-term debt; asset impairment charges; gains or losses on the dispositions of businesses and assets; restructuring; acquisition related costs and other items. In doing so, we are providing management, investors, and credit rating agencies with an indicator of our ongoing performance and business trends, removing the impact of transactions and events that we would not consider a part of our core operations.\nLastly, we present Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as additional performance measures. Adjusted Net Income is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA (defined beginning with net income, above), less interest expense, less the provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, tax affected for various discrete items, as appropriate. Adjusted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income per weighted average diluted shares outstanding for a given period. We believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS provide transparent and useful information to management, investors, analysts and other stakeholders in evaluating and assessing our operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of certain transactions and activities that affect comparability and that are not considered part of our core operations.\nThere are limitations to using the financial performance measures noted above. These performance measures are not intended to represent net income or other measures of financial performance. As such, they should not be used as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance. Other companies in our industry may define these performance measures differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use these or similarly-named financial measures that other companies may use, to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of these performance measures to our net income, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended (In millions, except per share data) December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Net income $ 117.7 $ 78.5 $ 328.3 $ 318.3 Interest expense, net 14.8 18.4 70.1 75.0 Provision for income taxes 26.4 20.5 82.8 87.0 Depreciation and amortization 30.3 24.7 110.6 96.4 EBITDA $ 189.2 $ 142.1 $ 591.8 $ 576.7 Loss on extinguishment of long-term debt — — 65.3 — Loss on extinguishment of long-term debt Net loss (gain) on disposition of businesses and assets (a) — 1.8 (9.7 ) 15.1 Other expense (income), net Restructuring and other charges (b) 1.2 4.9 6.0 23.5 Selling, general, and administrative expenses Acquisition transaction and integration costs (c) (0.1 ) — 4.7 — Cost of sales; Selling, general and administrative expenses Asset impairment charges or write-offs (d) — — 4.3 — Cost of sales; Selling, general and administrative expenses Other items (e) (21.6 ) (6.8 ) (19.9 ) (4.4 ) Cost of sales; Selling, general and administrative expenses; Other expense (income), net Adjusted EBITDA $ 168.7 $ 142.0 $ 642.5 $ 610.9 Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Net Income:\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 168.7 $ 142.0 $ 642.5 $ 610.9 Interest expense, net 14.8 18.4 70.1 75.0 Provision for income taxes — Adjusted (f) 28.4 22.0 98.2 94.6 Depreciation and amortization — Adjusted (g) 30.0 24.7 108.6 95.4 Adjusted Net Income $ 95.5 $ 76.9 $ 365.6 $ 345.9 Adjusted EPS $ 2.14 $ 1.68 $ 8.13 $ 7.28 Adjusted EBITDA by Segment:\nLatex Binders $ 33.3 $ 24.3 $ 138.5 $ 94.3 Synthetic Rubber 15.0 29.1 83.3 110.9 Performance Plastics 42.6 32.5 122.4 136.2 Basic Plastics 43.9 33.1 156.7 148.2 Feedstocks 24.2 14.2 110.5 80.2 Americas Styrenics 30.6 30.9 122.9 135.8 Corporate unallocated (20.9 ) (22.1 ) (91.8 ) (94.7 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 168.7 $ 142.0 $ 642.5 $ 610.9\n(a) Net gain on disposition of businesses and assets during the year ended December 31, 2017 relates primarily to the sale of our 50% share in Sumika Styron Polycarbonate to Sumitomo Chemical Company Limited. Net loss on disposition of businesses and assets during the year ended December 31, 2016 presented above relates to impairment charges recorded for the loss on sale of the Company’s primary operating entity in Brazil, which included both latex binders and automotive businesses. (b) Restructuring and other charges for the 2017 periods presented above primarily relate to employee termination benefit and decommissioning charges incurred in connection with the decision to cease manufacturing activities at our latex binders manufacturing facility in Livorno, Italy, as well as employee termination benefit charges related to the upgrade and replacement of the Company’s compounding facility in Terneuzen, The Netherlands. Restructuring and other charges for the 2016 periods presented above primarily relate to approximately $20.0 million in charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with the Livorno, Italy action discussed above, approximately $3.9 million of which was incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2016. The remaining restructuring charges for 2016 relate to the Company’s decision to divest our operations in Brazil as well as the closure of our Allyn’s Point latex binders manufacturing facility. Note that the accelerated depreciation charges incurred as part of both the upgrade and replacement of the Company’s compounding facility in Terneuzen, The Netherlands as well as the closure of our Allyn’s Point facility are included within the “Depreciation and amortization” caption above, and therefore are not included as a separate adjustment within this caption. (c) Acquisition transaction and integration costs for the 2017 periods presented above relate to advisory and professional fees incurred in conjunction with the Company’s acquisition of API Plastics, which closed in July 2017. These costs also include a non-cash fair value inventory adjustment recorded in conjunction with this acquisition. (d) Asset impairment charges or write-offs for the year ended December 31, 2017 relate to the impairment of certain long-lived assets within the Company’s Performance Plastics segment. (e) Other items for the 2017 periods presented above primarily relate to a curtailment gain recorded as a result of changes to certain of the Company’s pension plans in Europe, offset by fees incurred in conjunction with the Company’s debt refinancing which was completed during the third quarter of 2017. Other items for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily includes other income of $6.9 million from the effective settlement of certain value-added tax positions, which were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016, offset by $2.5 million of fees incurred in conjunction with the Company’s secondary offerings completed during the year. (f) Adjusted to remove the tax impact of loss on extinguishment of long term debt and the items noted in (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g).
