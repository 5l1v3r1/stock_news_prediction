Besides Bioceres, food processor Molino Candelas ( MOLC.BA ), energy producer Gene and real estate developer TGLP SA ( TGLT.BA ) have share listings in the pipeline. \nU.S. equities were up on Wednesday morning after roaring back on Tuesday from the biggest selloff in six years the prior day. \nRosario-based Bioceres develops genes for soy, corn and wheat that withstand drought and cold temperatures. It makes insecticides, fungicides, biofertilizers and chemical-based fertilizers. Argentina is the world’s No. 3 exporter of corn and raw soybeans and the leading shipper of soy meal and soy oil. \nThe indicated price range for the Bioceres IPO is $10 to $12 per share, the company said in an earlier filing.
