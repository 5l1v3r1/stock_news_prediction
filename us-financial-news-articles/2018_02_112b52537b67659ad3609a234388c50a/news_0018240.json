The world’s largest turboprop maker is jointly owned by Airbus and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.\nReporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:44:43.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
