But since then the threat has crept back, and attacks have occurred further and further south, into neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso, and as far afield as Ivory Coast.\nIn a bid to counter the insurgents, international donors on Friday pledged half a billion dollars towards the G5 Sahel, an international force made up of troops from Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania.\nReporting by Kissima Diagana; Writing by Edward McAllister; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T14:16:29.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
