(NASDAQ:MDRX) (Allscripts) announced its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 GAAP revenue was $517 million, an increase of 22 percent year-over-year. Non-GAAP revenue totaled $547 million, improving 27 percent year-over-year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, GAAP revenue totaled $1,806 million, an increase of 17 percent year-over-year. Non-GAAP revenue totaled $1,841 million, also a 17 percent increase from 2016.\nBookings (1) were $314 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This result compares with $406 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017 bookings totaled $1,311 million and contract revenue backlog as of December 31, 2017, totaled $4.6 billion, up 15 percent compared to a year ago.\nGross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 41.4 percent on a GAAP basis and 47.8 percent on a non-GAAP basis, compared with 43.8 and 48.1 percent, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOn a GAAP basis, in the fourth quarter of 2017 total operating expenses, consisting of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses, were $219 million, or a 35 percent increase year-over-year. The company recorded $25 million of legal, transaction-related and other costs in the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares with $7 million of such costs in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $186 million, a 27 percent increase year-over-year. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to the acquisition of the Enterprise Information Solutions (EIS) business from McKesson Corporation.\nGAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $6 million compared with net loss of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $33 million, up 25 percent when compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.03, compared with loss per share of $0.04 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.18, compared with $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $107 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 28 percent increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $106 million, compared to $84 million the same period of 2016, due to strengthening business results. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2017, totaled $68 million, compared to $41 million in the same period of 2016.\n“In the fourth quarter of 2017, Allscripts achieved greater than 20 percent growth across non-GAAP revenue, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share,” Paul M. Black, Chief Executive Officer of Allscripts, said. “We are especially pleased that non-GAAP earnings per share achieved the highest level in more than 5 years. 2017 proved to be a break-out year for Allscripts not only financially, but also from an entrepreneurial, innovation and efficiency perspective.”\nOther Announcements\nToday, we amended the Allscripts Credit Agreement, providing for an increase in available liquidity and tenor as well as lower interest rates. The amendment provides a $400 million term loan and a $900 million revolving facility. This represents an increase in borrowing capacity of $500 million and the maturity date was extended to 2023.\nAllscripts announced today that it has completed the acquisition of Practice Fusion, a cloud-based electronic health record aimed primarily at small, independent physician practices. This transaction gives Allscripts the largest US market share in outpatient settings and makes Allscripts the largest owner of “actionable” clinical data sets. Approximately 30,000 ambulatory sites, serving 5 million patients each month, currently use Practice Fusion EHR, practice management, e-prescribing, lab and patient portal technology.\nAllscripts also announced today that it has entered into an agreement to divest its One Content business to Hyland Software, Inc. One Content is a healthcare document solution that captures, indexes, stores and retrieves patient information. This solution was acquired by Allscripts through the McKesson EIS acquisition.\nBlack continued, “With the closing of the Practice Fusion acquisition, the closing of the EIS acquisition and the divestiture of the One Content business, we have in a very capital efficient way, significantly added to our client footprint, scale and breadth of the Company. We are well positioned in 2018 and beyond to distinguish Allscripts by offering complete, comprehensive healthcare solutions to change the way healthcare is delivered.”\n2018 Financial Outlook\nAllscripts is presenting annual guidance for revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share. Allscripts currently expects to achieve the following financial results in 2018:\nNon-GAAP revenue of between $2.15 billion and $2.25 billion, up 17% to 22% versus 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of between $420 million and $460 million, up 12% to 23% year over year, consisting of Allscripts, excluding Netsmart, Adjusted EBITDA between $310-340 million, and; Netsmart Adjusted EBITDA between $110-120 million Non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.72 to $0.82, an increase of 16% to 32%\nIn providing financial guidance, the company does not reconcile non-GAAP revenue, Adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Allscripts does not provide guidance for the various reconciling items since certain items that impact GAAP revenue and net income are either outside of its control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted.\nPlease see the “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release for detailed information on calculating non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of other non-GAAP items, see the non-GAAP financial reconciliation tables in this release (Tables 4, 5 and 6).\nConference Call:\nAllscripts will conduct a conference call today, Thursday, February 15, 2018, at 4:30 PM Eastern Time to discuss its earnings release and other information.

Non-GAAP Financial Information - Free Cash Flow (In millions) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $106.2 $83.9 $279.4 $269.0 Cash flows from investing activities: Capital expenditures (6.2 ) (10.4 ) (46.4 ) (35.4 ) Capitalized software (31.8 ) (32.5 ) (138.9 ) (102.5 ) Free cash flow $68.2 $41.0 $94.1 $131.1 Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAllscripts reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. To supplement this information, Allscripts presents in this release non-GAAP revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expense, Adjusted EBITDA, effective income tax rate, net income and earnings per share, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The definitions of non-GAAP financial measures used throughout this document are presented below:\nNon-GAAP revenue consists of GAAP revenue, as reported, and adds back recognized deferred revenue from the Enterprise Information Solutions, Netsmart, NantHealth’s provider/patient engagement business and non-material consolidated affiliates that is eliminated for GAAP purposes due to purchase accounting adjustments.\nNon-GAAP gross profit consists of GAAP gross profit, as reported, and excludes acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, acquisition-related amortization, stock-based compensation expense and transaction-related and other costs. Non-GAAP gross margin consists of non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue in the applicable period. For the fourth quarter of 2017, non-GAAP gross margin totaled 47.8 percent, consisting of non-GAAP gross profit of $261.2 million divided by non-GAAP revenue of $546.8 million. For the fourth quarter of 2016, non-GAAP gross margin totaled 48.1 percent, consisting of non-GAAP gross profit of $206.5 million divided by non-GAAP revenue of $429.4 million. Reconciliations to GAAP gross profit are found in Table 4 within this press release.\nNon-GAAP operating expense consists of GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) and research and development expense (R&D), as reported, and excludes transaction-related and other costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded to SG&A and R&D. For the fourth quarter of 2017, non-GAAP operating expense totaled $185.5 million, consisting of $145.9 million of GAAP SG&A and $73.5 million of GAAP R&D expense and excluding $24.2 million of total transaction-related and other costs and $9.8 million of stock-based compensation expense recorded to SG&A and R&D. For the fourth quarter of 2016, non-GAAP operating expense totaled $145.6 million consisting of $115.1 million of GAAP SG&A and $47.8 million of GAAP R&D expense and excluding $6.0 million of transaction-related and other costs and $11.3 million of stock-based compensation expense recorded to SG&A and R&D. Please note operating expense totals may not sum due to rounding.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and consists of GAAP net income (loss), as reported, and adjusts for: acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; transaction-related and other costs; non-cash asset and long-term investment impairment charges; interest expense and other, net; equity in net earnings of unconsolidated investments; and tax provision (benefit).\nNon-GAAP effective income tax rate is based on non-GAAP pre-tax earnings and consists of the statutory federal income tax rate, Allscripts effective state income tax rate and adjustments for permanent differences.\nNon-GAAP net income consists of GAAP net income/(loss), as reported, and adds back acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, acquisition-related amortization, stock-based compensation expense, transaction-related and other costs, non-cash asset and long-term investment impairment charges, non-cash charges to interest expense and other, and equity in net earnings of unconsolidated investments and the related tax effect of the aforementioned adjustments. Non-GAAP net income also includes a tax rate alignment adjustment.\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. is a non-GAAP measure and consists of Non-GAAP net income, as described above, with an adjustment to reduce Non-GAAP net income for the percentage of non-controlling interest outside Allscripts ownership position. For this presentation, Netsmart preferred stock is treated as if it was converted to common stock. There can be no assurance that the holders of Netsmart preferred stock will elect to convert their holdings to common stock.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share consist of non-GAAP net income, as defined above, divided by weighted shares outstanding – diluted in the applicable period.\nFree cash flow consists of GAAP cash flows provided by operating activities in the applicable period, net of capital expenditures and capitalized software costs.\nAcquisition-Related Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Deferred revenue adjustments include acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, which reflect the fair value adjustments to deferred revenue acquired in a business acquisition. The fair value of acquired deferred revenue represents an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin, to perform services related to the acquiree's software and product support, which assumes a legal obligation to do so, based on the deferred revenue balances as of the acquisition date. Allscripts adds back acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments for its non-GAAP financial measures because it believes the inclusion of this amount directly correlates to the underlying performance of Allscripts operations.\nAcquisition-Related Amortization. Acquisition-related amortization expense is a non-cash expense arising primarily from the acquisition of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions or investments. Allscripts excludes acquisition-related amortization expense from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income because it believes (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Allscripts business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods because of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets. Investors should note that the use of these intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue generation, and the related amortization expense will recur in future periods.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards. Allscripts excludes stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Allscripts business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing and valuation of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future periods, and such expense will recur in future periods.\nTransaction-Related and Other Costs. Transaction-related and other costs relate to certain legal proceedings, consulting, severance and other charges incurred in connection with activities that are considered one-time. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Allscripts incurred $25 million of transaction-related and other expenses.\nAllscripts excludes transaction-related and other costs, in whole or in part, from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Allscripts business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods.\nNon-Cash Charges to Interest Expense and Other . Non-cash charges to interest expense include the amortization of the fair value of the cash conversion option embedded in the 1.25 percent Cash Convertible Notes issued by Allscripts during the second quarter of 2013.\nNon-Cash Asset Impairment Charges. Asset impairment charges relate primarily to product consolidation activities and the write-down of the carrying value of equity investments in non-consolidated third parties.\nImpairment of and Losses on Long-Term Investments. Impairment of and losses on long-term investments relates to other-than-temporary non-cash impairment charges associated with such investments based on management’s assessment of the likelihood of near-term recovery of the investments’ value. The amounts recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relate to our investment in NantHealth common stock, which was disposed of in connection with the NantHealth provider/patient solutions business acquisition.\nEquity in Net Income (loss) of Unconsolidated Investments. Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated investments represents Allscripts share of the equity earnings (losses) of our investments in third parties accounted for under the equity method, including the amortization of cost basis adjustments. The majority of the amount recognized in prior periods represents our share of the net loss incurred by NantHealth LLC, along with the amortization of cost basis adjustments. Our investment in NantHealth was accounted as an available-for-sale marketable security after NantHealth’s initial public offering in June 2016.\nTax Rate Alignment. Tax adjustment aligns the applicable period’s effective tax rate to the expected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate.\nManagement also believes that non-GAAP revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expense, effective income tax rate, net income, earnings per share, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the underlying performance of Allscripts business operations. Acquisition accounting adjustments made in accordance with GAAP can make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons of the underlying operations of the business without considering the non-GAAP adjustments provided and discussed herein.\nManagement also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting, as it believes that these measures are indicative of core operating results. In addition, management may use non-GAAP gross profit, operating expense, operating income, net income, earnings per share and/or Adjusted EBITDA to measure achievement under Allscripts stock and cash incentive compensation plans. Note, however, that non-GAAP gross profit, operating income, net income earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA are performance measures only, and they do not provide any measure of cash flow or liquidity. Allscripts considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after capital expenditures and capitalized software costs. Free cash flow provides management and investors a valuable measure to determine the quantity of capital generated that can be deployed to create additional shareholder value by a variety of means. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Allscripts results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors and potential investors are encouraged to review the definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial measures contained within the attached condensed consolidated financial statements.\nSource: Allscripts", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RG8ArVTeaySaOCVKjoLGvel7mConfhzPBEyaW1Q9heFi7ay5g9XwDol3TXrOcCfcy35o0yPODYbZnovrb6guB4HxID77Gv9zrU1E1YTlzg0=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/401c8f4a-6f8b-4b2d-89f2-9b7dbef48d54", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=muGwAKx0DVQNl49YbMoH_m93_Y42dLKVNGrwhJANGzTBQz9Lr3-LkqH7O2gJLkk3p8mzBXpIumeKfI6afbN-7jTdLouzym130acjJJaPLHQ0mVHhvMc1XbTiNn3PPXDG", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cKEkApZl0YP4pqW-rp39hgIJ-ov5652bVzO75-nkgmQeMEpwtm30UJNZTbDYYMMoLt4_gYwJr-TaHfbrqwAjvMdQEZEMDN5y8oxZOj44HimRJy2Gy6EMc_L-9Qi3oLzt5AK78bj4IgjLRcMZJo_HVg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2_tEkSWlfjOAgjuZ-xKY8_vMuFEIFXqX4FCOuahSGf1jx0R_LHKV1VSR1H5kEZuakxyjm0XdWygcx4u8-NYuaQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sjct29JoLnlaJri55SzIodT3bqMNqUXYqFvxKktCFuJcgodigULvi7--V5wbIAG6Miuja47ZWf1mEXUgYUuyqAJKrghR14foKDi-yRK4Iy4GwD-2BLaZdlqUK6nik_Yf", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=s-VnzPO9AprhF-0X-qxiY7Bh5O9LcTDHAreabNSo-lgrVgCeQIYcEldkd0708ijL2W0g6IyGF_sn6zWAVbPL9cv897HL9KEzTLBx6N_jCJQ="], "published": "2018-02-16T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T03:53:54.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
