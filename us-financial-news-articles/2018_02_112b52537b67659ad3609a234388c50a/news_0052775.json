(Photo: Business Wire)\nThe annual Pros to Know listing celebrates supply chain executives in manufacturing and non-manufacturing enterprises who are leading initiatives to position their companies’ supply chains for the significant challenges of the increasingly complex global trade environment. McDaniel was previously recognized for his outstanding contributions to the supply chain profession by Supply & Demand Chain Executive in 2008. With this year’s recognition, Avnet experts have been recognized as Pros to Know 14 times.\nA 30-year, high-tech supply chain veteran and self-proclaimed “supply chain geek,” McDaniel leads a team of supply chain solutions architects in the design of sophisticated, sometimes one-of-a-kind, end-to-end solutions for both digital and physical supply networks throughout the global electronic component ecosystem. One such solution – ProscalNext, a multi-tenant, web-based ordering application configurable for both B2B and B2C models – is currently under review for a patent.\nBeyond his day-to-day responsibilities, McDaniel is frequently asked to speak at prominent supply chain and operations conferences, such as the upcoming SCOPE Supply Chain Conference in Chicago, March 18-20, 2018, where he will discuss the challenges and opportunities of managing innovation and change during disruptive times. McDaniel is also a regular editorial contributor to several leading industry publications, and serves as publisher of Avnet’s award-winning Supply Chain Navigator digital magazine.\n“Wade’s creativity and passion for technology, along with his distinct insights on topics less commonly associated with supply chain management, such as blockchain, the maker movement, trade finance and multi-modal operations, have earned him a reputation as supply chain thought leader,” said Lynn Torrel, senior vice president, global customer and supplier management for Avnet. “In addition, through the many years I have had the privilege of working with Wade, his leadership in the development of so many unique and strategic supply chain tools and processes have demonstrated that he is not just a ‘pro to know,’ but a true architect of change.”\nA complete listing of the 2018 Pros to Know is available on the Supply & Demand Chain Executive website at www.SDCExec.com .
