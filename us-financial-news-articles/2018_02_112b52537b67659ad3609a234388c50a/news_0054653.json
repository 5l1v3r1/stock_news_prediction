Cosan said fuel sales increased 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Diesel sales were particularly strong, jumping 9 percent, due to higher demand from the agricultural sector.\nCosan said the sugar business suffered from low global prices for the sweetener. As a result, the company shifted the production mix of its mills in Brazil toward ethanol.\nThe company said it allocated 48 percent of sugar cane to sugar production in the fourth quarter compared with 56 percent in the same quarter in 2016.\nThe firm, which controls Brazil’s largest natural gas distributor, Comgás, reported a 4 percent jump on gas consumption in Brazil late last year.\nCosan SA is a subsidiary of New York listed Cosan Ltd . It holds 50 percent of Raízen, with the other half owned by Shell.
