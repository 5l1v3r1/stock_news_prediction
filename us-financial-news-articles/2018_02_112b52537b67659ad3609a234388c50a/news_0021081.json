(NASDAQ-CM:CRWS) (the “Company”) today reported results for the fiscal 2018 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2017.\n“We are pleased that with the help of Carousel Designs, sales for the quarter were up compared with the prior year,” said E. Randall Chestnut, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “However, we experienced some challenges during the quarter that caused a decrease in profitability, including charges for acquisition expenses and increased credit costs associated with a major customer who filed for bankruptcy that were not incurred in the prior year. Additionally, due to the timing of the acquisition of the Sassy®-branded product line, we recorded several weeks of expenses compared to a relatively small amount of additional sales during the quarter. One of our subsidiaries also experienced a shift in both customer and product mix that was less profitable, as well as higher sales of closeout inventory, which are typically sold at lower margins. Finally, several non-cash charges to income tax expense were required by recent tax legislation. These charges, which amounted to $541,000, had the effect of lowering net income for the quarter by more than half and cut diluted earnings per share for the quarter by $0.05.”\nFinancial Results\nNet income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $531,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, on net sales of $17.5 million, compared with net income of $1.9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, on net sales of $17.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit for the current-year quarter was 30.1% of net sales, down from 32.7% in the prior-year quarter.\nFor the nine-month period, net income was $1.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, on net sales of $47.6 million, compared with net income of $4.0 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, on net sales of $48.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Gross profit for both nine-month periods was unchanged at 29.2% of net sales.\nThe Company recorded certain pre-tax expenses totaling $241,000 and $1.1 million during the three and nine-month periods of fiscal 2018, respectively, that were not incurred in fiscal 2017. For the quarter, these expenses included $81,000 in credit coverage fees on a retailer that filed for bankruptcy during the second quarter and $160,000 in costs associated with the Company’s acquisitions of Carousel Designs and Sassy. For the nine-month period, these expenses included $572,000 in credit coverage fees, $424,000 in costs associated with the Company’s acquisitions of Carousel Designs and Sassy, and $90,000 in audit fees associated with the Company’s transition from a smaller reporting company to an accelerated filer for SEC purposes. On an after-tax basis, these expenses totaled $170,000 and $728,000 for the three and nine-month periods of fiscal 2018, respectively. Additionally, although tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 lowered the federal corporate tax rate to be applied in future periods to 21%, the Company incurred non-cash revaluations of its deferred tax assets and its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $409,000 and $132,000, respectively, which taken together negatively affected the quarter and year-to-date diluted earnings per share by $0.05. The Company expects the reduction in the tax rate to positively affect its future earnings.\n“The acquisitions that we have completed in the past several months offer the Company exciting new opportunities to diversify both our customer and product mix. Carousel Designs opens a new channel of distribution for the Company – customized and personalized products sold direct to the end consumer – and Sassy’s line of early childhood developmental toys gives us new and exciting product offerings,” continued Chestnut.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s Series A common stock of $0.08 per share, which will be paid on April 6, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 16, 2018. “We are pleased to once again reward our stockholders for their support by providing a dividend, which reflects our Board’s continued confidence in the business and Crown Crafts’ commitment to return value to our stockholders,” Chestnut said.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a teleconference today at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time to discuss the Company’s results, during which interested individuals will be given the opportunity to ask appropriate questions.
