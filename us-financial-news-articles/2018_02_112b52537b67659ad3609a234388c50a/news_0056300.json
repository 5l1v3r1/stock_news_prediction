Sheeran’s pop ballad “Shape of You” was also the best-selling single globally of 2017 and has been certified as multi-Platinum in 32 nations, the organisation said. Slideshow (2 Images) The IFPI said it was the first time that a recording artist has had both the best-selling album and single of the year. Sheeran, 27, first found success in England in 2009 and 2010 by self-releasing his music online. “Ed is truly an incredible songwriter, vocalist and performer, whose ability to tell stories and make people feel is what stands him out from the crowd,” Max Lousada, chief executive of recorded music for Sheeran’s Warner Music Group record label, said in a statement on Monday. Sheeran, known for his ginger hair and shy demeanour, delighted fans last month by announcing his engagement to his childhood friend Cherry Seaborn, who he has known since he was 11 years old. Canadian rapper Drake and his album “More Life” was named the second biggest seller globally for 2017 and the IFPI said Taylor Swift’s “Reputation” was third, despite being released only in November 2017.
