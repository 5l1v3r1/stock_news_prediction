I was devastated, especially because at this point no one from Guess had even seen me,\" Upton told Time .\nShe says the predatory behavior continued: After subsequently hiring her again, Marciano wrote her \"dominant and possessive\" messages, became furious that Upton wanted to bring her boyfriend to the Guess shoot, and fired Tsai, a move that seemed like retaliation after the photographer wouldn't let Marciano stay in a room alone with Upton.\nAfter rebuffing him during a 2011 shoot, Upton says Marciano called her \"disgusting,\" and spread lies about her being unprofessional and drunk on set. \"I was then told to leave because Paul (Marciano) had said, 'Get that fat pig off my set,' \" Upton says.\nA year later, after Upton was on the cover of Sports Illustrated , Guess made a hefty $400,000 offer to have her shoot another campaign. But, Upton says, \"Paul began texting that he would make sure to be on set. He told me that I wasn't allowed to bring my boyfriend. I just couldn't do it.\"\nThe experience with Marciano had her thinking about quitting modeling, and it \"took a huge toll on my confidence and self-worth,\" she says. \"I started slumping my shoulders to hide my breast size, wearing baggy clothes, started despising my own body.\"\nUpton told Time, \"Nobody has a right over my body just because they view me as sexy or a sex icon. I think people need to be educated on the definition of consent. I don't think there are any blurred lines in this. I don't think you should be touching people at the workplace, and I don't think you should be sexually speaking to a model as they're doing their profession.\"\nRead her full account here .\nRepresentatives for Guess have not responded to USA TODAY's requests for comment.\nReuters reports Guess Inc shares fell more than 17% last week following Upton's tweet accusing Marciano of using his power to harass women.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:16:52.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
