Its pharmaceuticals business grew 4 percent from the same time last year, reaching $9.3 billion in the quarter. \nSales of Keytruda, Merck's blockbuster cancer drug, rocketed 169 percent to hit $1.3 billion, narrowly beating Street expectations of $1.27 billion, according to StreetAccount. \nExecutives declined to provide a firm date for the release of full results from a much-anticipated study on Keytruda paired with two chemotherapy drugs. Early results showed the mix helped lung cancer patients live longer and stopped the disease from advancing. \n\"We are certainly encouraged by the strength of the KEYNOTE-189 data, details of which will also be presented as soon as possible in an appropriate time venue,\" said Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories. \nDiabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet reached $1.52 billion, up 1 percent from the year-ago quarter and just above estimates of $1.5 billion. Management told analysts it expects the diabetes business to be \"relatively stable.\" \nFor 2018, Merck forecasts adjusted earnings of $4.08 to $4.23 per share and revenue of $41.2 billion to $42.7 billion. Analysts had been expecting $4.11 per share and $41.1 billion, respectively. \nMerck expects to pay about $5 billion over eight years for a one-time repatriation tax. The company intends to invest about $12 billion over five years in capital projects, including approximately $8 billion in the U.S. \nIt plans to provide a \"one-time, long-term incentive award\" for eligible nonexecutive employees in the second quarter of this year. Further details regarding the award weren't immediately known. \nMerck also made a contribution to its foundation in the fourth quarter. \nThis year, the company expects its effective tax rate to be between 19 and 20 percent, essentially flat compared with last year but down from 2016's rate of 22.3 percent. In coming years, it expects to see \"some additional favorability,\" Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis told analysts. \nShares of Merck dipped 1 percent in morning trading. They've shed 7 percent over the past year.
