There is a problem here of an inability to understand history and a lack of sensitivity to the tragedy of our people,” he said.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during the dedication ceremony of a new concourse at the Ben Gurion International Airport, near Lod, Israel February 15, 2018. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun “I intend to speak with him forthwith,” he added.\nOther officials in Israel, already alarmed by the new Polish legislation, also spoke out against Morawiecki’s comment.\n“The Polish prime minister’s statement is anti-Semitism of the oldest kind. The perpetrators are not the victims. The Jewish state will not allow the murdered to be blamed for their own murder,” Israeli lawmaker Yair Lapid wrote on Twitter. He also called for Israel’s ambassador to Poland to be recalled.\nSome 3 million Jews who lived in pre-war Poland were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for about half of all Jews killed in the Holocaust.\nJews from across the continent were sent to be killed at death camps built and operated by Germans in occupied Poland - home to Europe’s biggest Jewish community at the time - including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor.\nThousands of Poles risked their lives to protect Jewish neighbors during the war. But research published since the fall of communism in 1989 showed that thousands also killed Jews or denounced those who hid them to the Nazi occupiers, challenging the national narrative that Poland was solely a victim.\nAccording to figures from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Nazis, who invaded Poland in 1939, also killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians.\nReporting by Anna Koper in Warsaw and Ari Rabinovitch in Jerusalem; Writing Agnieszka Barteczko; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T21:12:07.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
