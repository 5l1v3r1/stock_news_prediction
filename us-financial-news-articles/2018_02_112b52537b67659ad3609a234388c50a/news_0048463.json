In addition, water naturally expands as it warms above four degrees Celsius (39.2°F).\nThe report also found that every five years of delay beyond 2020 in peaking global emissions would mean an extra 20 centimeters (8 inches) of sea level rise by 2300.\nFILE PHOTO: Tourists walk near the spot where the natural arch known as the Azure Window used to stand before it collapsed into the sea last March after years of erosion, at Dwejra outside the village of San Lawrenz on the island of Gozo, Malta, January 25, 2018.

Global emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas emitted by burning fossil fuels, rose last year after a three-year plateau.\nFILE PHOTO: Residents look at an exposed erosion along the boardwalk of Macumba beach after waves washed away the sand in the weekend storm, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil October 17, 2017.
