The mill is based in southwestern Guizhou province.\nShuicheng Steel had not conducted routine examinations of facilities and had failed to create safe working conditions before carrying out maintenance at the boiler, the bureau said.\nWorkers did not take any precautionary measures, while two supervisors did not arrange immediate evacuation after the accident, it added.\nAnother eight people died and 10 were injured in a gas leak incident at SGIS Songshan Steel Plant in southern Guangdong province on Monday.\nThe incident was still being investigated, the bureau said.\nReporting by Ruby Lian and Josephine Mason; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:04:19.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
