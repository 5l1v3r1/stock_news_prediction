Among other, Deutsche Bank’s DWS asset management unit has brought its IPO forward by several weeks.\nThe SpringerNature joint venture is 53-percent owned by German publisher Holtzbrinck, with buyout group BC Partners holding the rest.\nThe group’s owners have appointed bookrunners including Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas to help with the listing, alongside global coordinators JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.\n$1 = 0.8129 euros Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:46:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
