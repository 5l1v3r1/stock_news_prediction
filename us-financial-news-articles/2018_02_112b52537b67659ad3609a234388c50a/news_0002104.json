Action then paid a €285m dividend to shareholders in 2014 as part of a wider €840m recapitalisation, according to Thomson Reuters LPC.\nThere were two further dividends paid out in December and February of 2016, according to TRLPC.\n“Action is one of those investments that just keeps on giving. There is still implied equity left so if 3i sell or IPO Action they would still have a return to realise, and if they don’t sell then they will just take another dividend,” a syndicate head said.\nABN AMRO, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, ING, Natixis and Rabobank are leading the latest leveraged loan financing and investors have been asked to commit to the deal by February 13, following a bank meeting on Thursday.\nThe €2.285bn TLB is guided to pay 325bp-350bp over Euribor, with a 0% floor at 99.75 OID. The existing TLB pays 350bp over Euribor.\nThe new TLB is covenant-lite, removing a net leverage covenant in the existing covenant-loose term loan.\nPricing of the new €125m RCF is 325bp over Euribor and it is offered with a springing leverage covenant. The RCF has increased from an existing €75m.\nThe dividend recapitalisation will re-lever Action to 4.8 times Ebitda, from 3.0 times.\nDespite a tricky sector where many retailers have suffered, Action has experienced rapid deleveraging, from 4.5 times at the time of its last recapitalisation in December 2016, driven by continued strong Ebitda growth and cash generation, sources said.\nAction is Europe’s largest and best performing non-food discount retailer with net sales in FY16 of €2.7bn. Almost two-thirds of net sales are now generated outside of The Netherlands.\nIt operates nearly 1,100 stores across seven countries in Europe, employing over 40,000 people.\nEditing by Christopher Mangham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:39:17.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
