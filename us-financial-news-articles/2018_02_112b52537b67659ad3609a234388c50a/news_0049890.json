Neon light installations of monkeys, dinosaurs, bananas and aliens playfully displayed outside the building could be seen from the floor to ceiling windows.\nPrada hosted the show in the “Torre” building, a modern tower which will be the latest addition to the group’s “Fondazione Prada” art foundation project. The existing Fondazione buildings, once a gin distillery, were turned in the early 1990s into a space dedicated to contemporary art and culture.\n“I wanted to have a little revenge on the artwork, occupying the space of the Fondazione with fashion,” Prada told reporters at the end of her show.\nThe new building will officially open during Milan’s design week, held annually in April, and will be used as an exhibition space.\nItalian designer Miuccia Prada acknowledges the applause at the end of her Autumn/Winter 2018 women collection during Milan Fashion Week in Milan, Italy February 22, 2018. REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo Models walked with the city skyline and train tracks as a backdrop, wearing oversize nylon and neoprene coats with wide shoulders from which delicate transparent dresses and tulle skirts peeped. All the models wore brightly colored tulle bows around their necks.\n“The idea is the constant struggle women have - a duality, between strength and having to protect yourself and what you like as a woman, such as sweetness and femininity,” the designer said.\nSlideshow (8 Images) She explained that the big sporty pieces wanted to symbolically defend the women wearing them while the light details were included for them to be able to express their womanhood.\nBlack technical material was juxtaposed with fuchsia, yellow and blue. Black stilettos and white boots were paired with fluorescent socks and gaiter-like legwarmers.\nTransparent black tulle, decorated with sparkling beading or bright plastic flowers, gently covered tight sheath dresses, while plastic fringed mini-dresses in lime green and white glowed in the night-time setting.\n“It’s about women being able to go out at night, even wearing super sexy clothes, without fear,” Prada said.\nThe collection was well-received by the public on Thursday evening, with the audience bursting into loud applause as the designer reached the runway at the end of the show.\nBut Prada also voiced concern about the high expectations set on fashion, which she said pushed designers “beyond their job” by the perceived need to engage in political and social issues through their clothes.\nReporting by Giulia Segreti, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T03:29:13.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
