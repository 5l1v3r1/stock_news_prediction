Last month Britain's competition regulator said that it should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent Murdoch, who owns the Times and the Sun newspapers, from influencing Sky's news output.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T17:46:54.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
