But two-time European champion Medvedeva answered with her own outstanding performance.\nWatch more Olympics videos here Medvedeva finished up weeping -- as the entire world awaited a gold medal that could have gone either way and came down to a little more than a point difference. But it was the younger skater who took home gold.\nUnfortunately, we can’t show you those precise highlights.
