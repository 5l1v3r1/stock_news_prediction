Carr, chairman and managing partner of CRI. \"The Shinn & Company offices in Bradenton and Sarasota coupled with our current Florida offices strategically position our expertise throughout the Gulf Coast making CRI one of the best accounting resources in the state.\"\nAllan D. Koltin, CEO of Koltin Consulting Group, who advised both firms on the merger commented, \"CRI is one of the fastest-growing first-generation firms in the entire country.
