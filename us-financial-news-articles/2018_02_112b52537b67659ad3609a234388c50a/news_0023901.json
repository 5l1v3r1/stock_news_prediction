That would still represent the highest production ever, according to official USDA estimates dating back to 1959/1960, beating out a previous record seen 18 years ago.\nDemand was pegged at 12.48 million tonnes, versus January’s 12.55 million tons, with the agency citing slower-than-expected deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTo read more of this month’s USDA sugar outlook, go here:.\nReporting by Chris Prentice; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:50:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
