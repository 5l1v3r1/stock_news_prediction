But what is more important than anything is that we are together.” \nPence arrived at the reception late and had planned to leave directly after a photo session but Moon asked him to “come and say hello to friends”, Moon’s presidential spokesman said.

Unlike Pence, fellow attendee Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did shake hands with Kim Yong Nam, the South’s presidential Blue House said. \nPence’s absence undid some careful organising, according to a seating diagram provided by a South Korean government source and protocol experts. \nThe early plan showed Pence, with his wife to the left and Moon to his right, seated across the round table from Kim, who was nestled between U.N. Secretary General António Guterres and International Olympics Committee President Thomas Bach’s wife.

Other guests at the top table included Moon’s wife, and the German president and his wife. \n“The seating arrangement shows traces of the organisers’ agony,” said a former South Korean chief of protocol who reviewed the early draft of the seating arrangement. \nIn a such a setting, the host nation would usually arrange seating by the alphabetical order of country names or the length of terms the guests had served, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. \nThe work-around showed the host had adopted the principle that “no one should be uncomfortable with the person sitting next to them”, with those from international organisations playing a buffer role, the official said. \nAs it was, the two spaces set aside for Pence and his wife were left empty and seats for others were shuffled to more closely match normal protocols. \nA source in the Moon administration said Pence’s absence at the reception was a “mere bump” in an otherwise successful diplomatic event. \nAnd the dessert? Pictures posted to social media by a South Korean lawmaker appeared to show that in at least one occasion, the chocolate barbed wire failed to dissolve.
