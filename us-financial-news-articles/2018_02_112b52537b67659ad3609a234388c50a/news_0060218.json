We are unable to comment the matter further until the investigation has finalised.”\nReporting by David Mardiste and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen, editing by Silvia Aloisi and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:07:50.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
