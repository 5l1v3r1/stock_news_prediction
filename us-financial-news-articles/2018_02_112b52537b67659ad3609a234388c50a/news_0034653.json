CityMD's strategic acquisition of STAT Health's 12 centers (with two additional locations slated to open later this year) expands its presence in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. CityMD also plans to acquire FirstMed Immediate Medical Care, a single urgent care center located in Queens, New York. Following the completion of these transactions, CityMD will have 100 locations primarily in the New York Metro Area. Terms of the transactions were not disclosed.\n\"I am thrilled to be reaching this milestone of 100 CityMD locations, and excited to welcome STAT Health and First Med to the CityMD team. Our seamless integration will enable us to serve more patients in Eastern Long Island and Queens, and bring us closer to achieving our vision of building healthier, kinder communities,\" said Dr. Richard Park, CEO of CityMD.\nTogether with high-quality, like-minded partners who have been serving Suffolk County for over a decade, and Queens County for more than 30 years, and who share a patient-first philosophy, CityMD is poised to further extend its innovative care model to these areas.\nWith over 400 providers in the combined physician-led network, the company will work to address healthcare access challenges and provide coordinated care through CityMD's unique, centralized Aftercare Department. This expert team of doctors and clinical assistants helps patients coordinate their follow-up care including referrals, pre-approvals and other appointments.\n\"CityMD's expanded footprint, which has grown by 43 percent over the past year, allows us to not only continue making healthcare more inclusive by providing an exceptional experience through high-quality medical care and convenient access, but also to manage population health, address the needs of our payors, health system collaborative partners and employers in the market, and serve our core constituents where they work and live,\" said Dr. Nedal Shami, CityMD's Chief Growth Officer.\nIn 2017, Warburg Pincus, a leading global private equity firm focused on growth investing, announced a majority investment in CityMD to accelerate the company's expansion through new site openings, strategic acquisitions and partnerships.\nDr. Paolo Coppola co-founded STAT Health in 2005 and grew the company to eight units in Long Island before partnering with the investment firm Spanos Barber Jesse & Co (\"SBJ\") in a 2016 control recapitalization. With SBJ's active involvement, the company was on track to double its locations within the first two years of the partnership.\n\"It has been an honor and privilege leading STAT Health and I would like to thank SBJ for their valuable support,\" said Dr. Coppola, President of STAT Health. \"I know I speak for the entire STAT organization when I say we look forward to joining CityMD and continuing to provide our patients with the best possible medical care,\" Dr. Coppola added.\nGus Spanos, Co-Founder and Managing Director at SBJ commented, \"We have enjoyed partnering with Dr. Coppola and the entire STAT team. While this opportunity with CityMD and Warburg Pincus materialized sooner in our investment than we had anticipated, the sale to CityMD was too compelling of an opportunity to pass up.\"\nUpon closing of the transactions, STAT Health's and First Med's centers will begin transitioning to the CityMD brand and will benefit from CityMD's corporate infrastructure.\nThe transactions are subject to regulatory reviews and are expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. Dorsey & Whitney LLP served as legal counsel to CityMD and Credit Suisse acted as financial advisor to CityMD. McGuireWoods LLP served as legal counsel to STAT Health and Houlihan Lokey served as exclusive financial advisor to STAT Health.\nAbout CityMD\nFounded in 2010 by a passionate group of emergency medicine physicians, CityMD 's mission is to serve its communities by providing quality medical care through convenient access and an exceptional experience.
