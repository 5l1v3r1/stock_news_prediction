It has now become a meme and is often used in times of extreme volatility in the cryptocurrency market for people holding rather than selling.\nRoubini said that \"HODL nuts\" will hold bitcoin until it plummets to zero.\nDr Doom also said that traders will use wash trading to prop up the prices. Wash trading in the crypto world involves someone buying and selling their own order to manipulate markets. Some have feared that wash trading takes place on bitcoin exchanges.\nRoubini asked if the authorities will look into this practice.\nTWEET \nHis tweets followed comments on Bloomberg last week in which he called bitcoin the \"biggest bubble in human history.\"\nCryptocurrencies have seen a major sell-off in the last few days. Bitcoin fell below $6,000 for the first time since mid-November on Tuesday. Other major cryptocurrencies are all well off of their all-time highs .\nWATCH: Bitcoin could be the biggest bubble in history – here's how show chapters Bitcoin could be the biggest bubble in history – here's how      7:26 AM ET Wed, 17 Jan 2018 | 02:00", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T14:13:22.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
