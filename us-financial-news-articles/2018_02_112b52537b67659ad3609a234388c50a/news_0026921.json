That means that you really have to attack full-on, from the very top to the very bottom.”\nThat, could be a risky strategy according to U.S. great Bode Miller.\n“I think the mistakes will come from pushing too hard, because when it becomes difficult to win, guys try to take too much risk to try to gain that little bit extra,” Miller told Reuters this week.\nCaution, however, is not Feuz’s style.\nAnd after a disappointing time at Sochi four years ago, where he competed with an ankle injury and his best position from three events was 13th in the downhill, he does not plan to hold back in Pyeongchang.\nA medal in the downhill, scheduled for Sunday, would be a great 30th birthday present, although he may have to wait longer as windy conditions threaten to push the race back a few days.\n“We have to adjust to that,” he said.\n“We hope to go on Sunday - if not, we have to be ready and be able to focus again on Monday. But for us every week is like that.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:07:47.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
