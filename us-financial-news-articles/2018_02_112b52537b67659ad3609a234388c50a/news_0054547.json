Virginia Foxx. In December, the North Carolina Republican successfully pushed her proposed revamp of sweeping higher-education legislation through the House’s education committee.\nMrs. Foxx’s legislation contains a policy proposal that’s appealing to the Harvard grads: It would prevent universities from taking punitive measures against students who opt to join single-gender groups.\n“We would like to see free speech and free association protected,” said Richard Porteus, Harvard class of 1978 and graduate president of the Fly Club, one of several single-sex social clubs that the school says perpetuate misogyny and don’t represent its diverse student population.\nThe Higher Education Act, which governs everything from student loans to the definition of a college credit, hasn’t been updated in a decade. As Mrs. Foxx’s legislation to overhaul it wends its way through Congress, plenty of the usual players from the well-oiled higher-education lobby are gearing up for a fight .\nThe Association of American Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities and the American Association of Community Colleges spent more money lobbying Congress last year than any year since at least 1998. The higher-education sector spent $76 million on lobbying overall in 2017, according to a Center for Responsive Politics analysis of lobbying disclosure data.\nThe bill proposes more flexibility in the pathways leading to a college degree and dramatically consolidates the financial aid system. Mrs. Foxx’s legislation also contains several provisions addressing hot-button social issues, crafted with the support of conservative groups.\nThe bill’s broad reach means that organizations not otherwise engaged on the nuts and bolts of higher education are coming out swinging.\nThe legislation, known as the PROSPER Act, is awaiting a full floor hearing, and the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is drafting its own bipartisan version of a bill this spring. So the groups are making urgent appeals to ensure their priorities are reflected in the final law.\nConservative religious groups, as well as so-called men’s rights organizations that advocate for students accused of sexual assault, are among those that have left their mark on Mrs. Foxx’s proposal.\nHer legislation would allow religious schools to ban same-sex relationships and let schools defer to local law enforcement before adjudicating sexual-assault cases. A late addition to the bill would establish a position at the Education Department to handle free-speech fights on campuses.\nCoding schools, short-term certificate programs and online education firms barely existed in 2008, the last time the Higher Education Act was renewed, but they’re now in the mix and pushing for more creative definitions of a college education.\n“They’re looking at the old regime and saying, ‘This doesn’t reflect what the world looks like for us today,’ ” said one lobbyist who counts among his clients a number of more niche education groups.\nThe College in High School Alliance, which supports dual-enrollment programs for high-school students to earn college credit , spent $80,000 on lobbying in 2017, the alliance’s first year in operation.\nA proposed amendment to the House bill that would encourage more such programs failed in committee, but group members are still meeting with congressional staff.\nRock the Vote, Young Invincibles and Democracy Matters, all advocacy groups focused on younger Americans, teamed up with nearly 40 other organizations on letters to Mrs. Foxx and Rep. Bobby Scott (D., Ky.), the House Education Committee’s top Democrat, in December. The groups expressed concern that the legislation would remove several requirements that schools help students vote in state and national elections.\nRep. Virginia Foxx at the White House in October.

The provision was crafted by lawmakers to protect religious groups who want to exclude gay students or those of other faiths. The ACLU considers the provision discriminatory and counter to a 2010 Supreme Court decision.\nChristian schools have used their sway to mobilize against provisions that would eliminate grant aid for very low-income students and make students pay interest on their loans while still in school. Though they aren’t the only opponents to those elements, their concern has helped slow the House bill’s progress, say several people familiar with the matter.\nThe bill “will make it much more difficult for students to afford school and finish and pay off their debt,” said Chip Pollard, president of John Brown University, an evangelical Christian institution in Arkansas.\nThe current bill wouldn’t affect the Harvard situation, since the so-called final clubs already aren’t formally recognized by the university; the alums are pushing for Mrs. Foxx and other lawmakers to add language building in protections specifically at their school.\nIn recent weeks, members of the centuries-old Porcellian Club at Harvard traded emails urging classmates to donate $350 or $500 to Mrs. Foxx’s fundraiser and to represent “the old barn” in the nation’s capital.\nMike Woeste, a spokesman for the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said he can’t guarantee the Harvard graduates’ interests will be accommodated, but there’s time before the bill comes up for a full House vote. “The door hasn’t totally closed on their concerns,” he said.\nWrite to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com and Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T13:08:43.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
