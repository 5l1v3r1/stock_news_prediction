Republicans also control the Senate, but with a slim 51-49 majority they need some Democratic support to pass spending bills.\nTo avert another shutdown, both the House and the Senate must pass at least a short-term spending bill, the latest in a series of such temporary measures that have become entwined with a months-long debate over protections for young “Dreamer” immigrants.\nA vote on the House measure was expected after 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT).\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested on Monday increasing defense appropriations through Sept. 30 while continuing negotiations on spending for non-defense programs.\nBut Democrats have rejected that idea. If the House passes a short-term funding measure with long-term defense funding it would fail in the Senate, Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer has said. Lawmakers have also been struggling to reach a deal on an immigration bill, despite broad public support for helping Dreamers - immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children.\nDemocratic former President Barack Obama enacted the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program to provide temporary protections for Dreamers, allowing them to study and work without fear of deportation.\nThose protections were thrown into doubt last year when President Donald Trump ordered DACA halted on March 5, saying Congress should come up with a legislative solution. A federal court blocked the Trump administration last month from ending the program, and the administration’s appeal is pending before the Supreme Court.\nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress are struggling to agree on bipartisan legislation that would protect Dreamers and boost border security. Trump has said any deal must also include funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which Democrats strongly oppose.
