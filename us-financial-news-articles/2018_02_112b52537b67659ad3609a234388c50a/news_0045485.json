The revised deal is expected to be signed on March 8.\nAs an incentive, Turnbull will also propose spending an unspecified amount of Australia’s pension pool to fund Trump’s $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan, the official said.\nThe White House wants to use $200 billion in federal funding to try to encourage infrastructure improvements over 10 years by relying on state and local governments and the private sector.\nTurnbull and executives from several Australian pension funds will address a meeting of U.S. governors on Saturday.\n“Infrastructure in a growing and secure economy like the United States is often attractive for those funds,” said Andrew Shearer, senior adviser on Asia Pacific Security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nRegional security is also set to dominate talks, with a particular focus on China, the Australian official said.\nTrump, a harsh critic of China’s trade policies, named U.S. Pacific Commander Admiral Harry Harris, known for his hawkish views on Beijing’s military expansion, earlier this month as the next U.S. ambassador to Australia.\nAustralia’s approach to China, easily its largest trading partner, has typically been more circumspect.\nHowever, Sino-Australia relations soured in December when Turnbull said his government would introduce new laws to clamp down on improper interference by Beijing in Australian politics.\nChina denies the claim, and lodged an official complaint against the allegation.\nReporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom in WASHINGTON; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T05:54:24.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
