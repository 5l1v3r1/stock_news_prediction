The procedure will be more complicated... Such lists are bad,” Alekperov told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.\nThe list, drawn up as part of a sanctions package signed into law in August last year, does not mean that those included will be subject to sanctions, but casts a shadow of sanctions risk over a wide circle of wealthy Russians, including many outside President Vladimir Putin’s immediate circle.\nReporting by Polina Nikolskaya; Writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:05:32.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
