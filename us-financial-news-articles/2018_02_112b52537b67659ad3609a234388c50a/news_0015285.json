A selloff across global stock markets since late Friday and bets that the United States could see at least three interest rate hikes in 2018 have driven the dollar up in recent days.\nThe greenback has gained around 1.3 percent against its basket in the past week, on track to post its largest weekly gain since late October after rising in four of the last five sessions.\nJohn Taylor, Jr., president and founder of global macro and FX research firm Taylor Global Vision was not too convinced about the dollar's strength for most of this week.\n\"The bounce in the dollar is already nearing an end. The feeble move higher in dollar pairs like the dollar/ Mexican peso and the dollar/ South African rand highlights the distaste for the U.S. currency,\" he added.\nIn late morning trading, the dollar index was down 0.07 percent on the day at 90.19.\n\"We expect any bounces are likely to be short-lived and offer better levels to sell,\" said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy, at TD Securities in Toronto.\nThis belief ties in with a Reuters poll of strategists who said the dollar's rebound was unlikely to be sustainable.\nThe euro was up 0.01 percent at $1.2263, after earlier falling to a two-week low. The single currency has declined 2.6 percent since hitting a three-year high of around $1.2536 just 10 days ago.\n\"The market is in consolidation mode,\" said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt. \"The dollar performed relatively well during the stock market turmoil, and this experience determined the market sentiment going forward.\"\nTraditional safe havens such as the yen and Swiss franc , meanwhile, have seen only modest gains during the recent stock market volatility. But on Thursday, the dollar was both down against the Swiss franc and yen.\nHigher U.S. yields also underpinned the greenback's recent rally. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes stood at 2.867 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 2.843 percent on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T04:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T03:40:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
