Empty seats at venues suggested some ticket-holders did not turn up, however.\nFILE PHOTO: Alpine Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women’s Downhill Training - Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 19, 2018 - A man sleeps in the empty stand. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo South Korea estimated the Games had boosted first-quarter economic growth by 0.2 percentage points.\nEven if Gangwon persuades Seoul to underwrite the viability of some venues after the Games, its longer-term challenge is to entice more holidaymakers to the area and hope the Olympics will encourage more South Koreans to take up winter sports.\nIt wants to avoid a repeat of the province’s Alps Ski Resort, a more remote development that is now abandoned. It was developed more than four decades ago but it failed for a lack of visitors.\nSome businesses in Pyeongchang are anxious.\n“Our challenge is how to carry on the Olympic legacy after things go back to normal,” said Park In-jun, executive vice president of YongPyong Resort, which revamped one of its ski slopes for the Games.\n“So far, many people have visited here because of the Olympics but things will be different once it’s over.”\nOne of the biggest question marks hangs over the Games’ sliding centre, used by bobsleigh, luge and skeleton racers -- a breed of athlete unheard of in South Korea before it was built.\n“Iron Man” Yun Sung-bin won the home nation’s first gold medal in men’s skeleton at the Games and Asia’s first medal in a sliding sport, but it is unclear if his success will inspire his compatriots to follow in his tracks and start using the centre.\nSouth Korea’s bobsleigh and skeleton team head coach Lee Yong told a news conference last week that he hoped the government realized that Yun’s victory showed the importance of maintaining a good training facility.\n“This is a way to develop better future of our country’s sports,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by James Pearson and Dahee Kim; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T01:28:36.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
