Last month, cryptocurrency lending and exchange firm Bitconnect said it was shutting down its platform after it received cease-and-desist letters from securities divisions in Texas and North Carolina. \nThe EU joins a number of government authorities in raising concern over cryptocurrencies. \nSouth Korea, for instance, introduced measures to tackle speculation in the sector, banning the use of anonymous bank accounts in cryptocurrency trading. And Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said recently that his government will take measures to \"eliminate\" the use of cryptocurrencies in \"illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T16:22:49.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
