Should they do so, they will become a welcome member of the GCC and we can move forward to improve the security for all of us,” al-Jubeir said.\nReporting by Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T04:36:43.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
