Car registrations in the European Union rose 3.4 percent in 2017 to more than 15 million vehicles for the first time since 2007. ( reut.rs/2EKQiih ) On Thursday, Magna reported a 23 percent rise in European external production sales helped by the launch of the BMW 5-Series, Ford Fiesta and Mercedes-Benz GLC. That helped limit the impact of a 5 percent drop in North America vehicle production volumes. The Aurora, Ontario-based company’s sales rose to $10.39 billion from $9.25 billion. Net income attributable to Magna rose to $556 million, or $1.53 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $478 million, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.57 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
