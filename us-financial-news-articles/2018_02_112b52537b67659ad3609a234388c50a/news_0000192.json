Cash from operations was $238 million, and distributable cash flow was $172 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $254 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $171 million in the third quarter.\n“During the quarter, we operated well and completed our largest transaction to date, increasing earnings by more than 60 percent,” said Greg Garland, Phillips 66 Partners’ chairman and CEO. “We are nearing our $1.1 billion year-end 2018 run-rate EBITDA target and remain on track to deliver 30 percent five-year distribution CAGR. We continue to operate from a strong financial position, which enables us to fund our 2018 growth plans without accessing the equity markets beyond selective use of our ATM program.”\nOn Jan. 17, 2018, the general partner’s board of directors declared a fourth-quarter 2017 cash distribution of $0.678 per common unit, a 5 percent increase over the previous quarter distribution of $0.646 per common unit. The Partnership has increased its distribution per common unit every quarter since its initial public offering in July 2013.\nFinancial Results\nPhillips 66 Partners’ earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $162 million, compared with $99 million in the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to the October 2017 acquisition of Merey Sweeny, L.P. and a 25 percent interest in the Bakken Pipeline, as well as increased volumes on other assets.\nLiquidity, Capital Expenditures and Investments\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, total debt outstanding was $2.9 billion. The Partnership had $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding balance under its $750 million revolving credit facility.\nIn October 2017, Phillips 66 Partners issued $650 million of senior notes and raised $1.05 billion in a private placement of preferred and common units. The majority of the proceeds were used to fund the cash portion of the October acquisition and to repay debt, with the remainder available for general partnership purposes.\nThe Partnership’s total capital spending for the quarter was $127 million, which included $21 million of maintenance capital. Expansion capital spending totaled $106 million, reflecting investments in the Sand Hills Pipeline, Bakken Pipeline and STACK joint venture projects, as well as spending to develop a new isomerization unit at the Phillips 66 Lake Charles Refinery.\nPhillips 66 Partners’ 2018 capital budget of $595 million includes $510 million directed toward growth projects and $85 million for maintenance.\nStrategic Update\nThe Partnership continues to progress its portfolio of growth projects.\nFinal approval has been received for construction of a new 25,000 barrels per day (BPD) isomerization unit at the Phillips 66 Lake Charles Refinery to increase production of higher octane gasoline blend components. The $200 million project will include a long-term agreement with Phillips 66 for processing services, including a minimum volume commitment, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.\nThe Sand Hills Pipeline joint venture has exceeded 300,000 BPD of throughput in the fourth quarter and is expected to reach 365,000 BPD of capacity this quarter. Further expansion of the line to 450,000 BPD is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018. Sand Hills transports NGLs from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast. Phillips 66 Partners owns a one-third interest in this joint venture.\nThe STACK joint venture expansion project to loop the existing pipeline and to extend further into the STACK play was completed in the fourth quarter. The loop increased capacity by 150,000 BPD. The Partnership owns a 50 percent interest in the joint venture.\nPermitting is complete and construction has begun on the Bayou Bridge Pipeline extension from Lake Charles, Louisiana, to St. James, Louisiana. The pipeline is currently operating from Nederland, Texas, to Lake Charles, and commercial operations on the extension are expected to begin in the second half of 2018. The Partnership owns a 40 percent interest in the joint venture.\nThe Sacagawea Pipeline joint venture is constructing a 24-mile raw natural gas pipeline system linking production in Mountrail County, North Dakota, to gathering and processing capacity in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project is anticipated to be completed in the second half of 2018. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 49.5 percent interest in the joint venture.\nInvestor Webcast\nMembers of Phillips 66 Partners executive management will host a webcast today at 2 p.m. EST to discuss the Partnership’s fourth-quarter performance.

Words and phrases such as “is anticipated,” “is estimated,” “is expected,” “is planned,” “is scheduled,” “is targeted,” “believes,” “intends,” “objectives,” “projects,” “strategies” and similar expressions are used to identify such forward-looking statements. However, the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements relating to Phillips 66 Partners (including our joint venture operations) are based on management’s expectations, estimates and projections about the Partnership, its interests and the energy industry in general on the date this news release was prepared. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include the continued ability of Phillips 66 to satisfy its obligations under our commercial and other agreements; the volume of crude oil, refined petroleum products and NGL we or our joint ventures transport, fractionate, terminal and store; the tariff rates with respect to volumes that we transport through our regulated assets, which rates are subject to review and possible adjustment by federal and state regulators; fluctuations in the prices for crude oil, refined petroleum products and NGL; liabilities associated with the risks and operational hazards inherent in transporting, fractionating, terminaling and storing crude oil, refined petroleum products and NGL; potential liability from litigation or for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations under environmental regulations; and other economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting Phillips 66 Partners’ businesses generally as set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Phillips 66 Partners is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information —This news release includes the terms “EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA,” “distributable cash flow,” “run-rate EBITDA,” and “coverage ratio.” These are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are included to help facilitate comparisons of operating performance of the Partnership with other companies in our industry. EBITDA and distributable cash flow help facilitate an assessment of our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our coverage ratio is calculated as distributable cash flow divided by total cash distributions and is included to help indicate the Partnership’s ability to pay cash distributions from current earnings. The GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is net income. The GAAP liquidity measure most comparable to EBITDA and distributable cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The GAAP financial measure most comparable to our coverage ratio is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities divided by total cash distributions. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. They have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nRun-rate EBITDA is a forecast of future EBITDA, and is based on the Partnership’s projections of annual EBITDA inclusive of current assets and future potential acquisitions by the Partnership. Run-rate EBITDA is included to demonstrate management’s intention of future growth through acquisitions and organic projects. We are unable to present a reconciliation of run-rate EBITDA to net income, which is the nearest GAAP financial measure, because certain elements of net income, including interest, depreciation and taxes, were not used in the forecasts and are therefore not available. Together, these items generally result in run-rate EBITDA being significantly higher than net income. The disaggregation of capital spending between expansion/growth and maintenance is not a distinction recognized under GAAP. We provide such disaggregation because the Partnership will generally fund maintenance capital spending with cash from operating activities and fund expansion/growth capital spending with financing activities. We believe this is an important distinction in our liquidity profile.\nReferences in the release to earnings and capital spending refer to net income and capital spending attributable to the Partnership, respectively. References to EBITDA refer to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nResults of Operations (Unaudited)\nSummarized Financial Statement Information Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated\nQ4 2017 Q3 2017* Selected Income Statement Data Total revenues and other income $ 331 299 Net income 164 131 Net income attributable to the Partnership 162 99 Adjusted EBITDA 254 171 Distributable cash flow 172 136 Net Income Attributable to the Partnership\nPer Limited Partner Unit—Diluted (Dollars)\nCommon units $ 0.83 0.51 Selected Balance Sheet Data Cash and cash equivalents $ 185 2 Equity investments 1,932 1,874 Total assets 5,334 5,046 Total debt 2,945 2,390 Equity held by public Preferred unitholders 746 — Common units 2,274 1,966 Equity held by Phillips 66 Common units 487 472 General partner (1,345\n)\n(662\n)\n*Prior-period financial information has been retrospectively adjusted for acquisitions of businesses under common control.\nStatement of Income Millions of Dollars Q4 2017 Q3 2017* Revenues and Other Income Operating revenues—related parties $ 246 222 Operating revenues—third parties 8 11 Equity in earnings of affiliates 76 66 Other income 1 — Total revenues and other income 331 299 Costs and Expenses Operating and maintenance expenses 82 86 Depreciation 28 32 General and administrative expenses 17 17 Taxes other than income taxes 9 7 Interest and debt expense 29 24 Other expenses — 1 Total costs and expenses 165 167 Income before income taxes 166 132 Income tax expense 2 1 Net income 164 131 Less: Net income attributable to Predecessors 2 32 Net income attributable to the Partnership 162 99 Less: Preferred unitholders' interest in net income attributable to the Partnership 9 — Less: General partner’s interest in net income attributable to the Partnership 48 43 Limited partners’ interest in net income attributable to the Partnership $ 105 56 *Prior-period financial information has been retrospectively adjusted for acquisitions of businesses under common control.\nSelected Operating Data Thousands of Barrels Daily Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Pipeline, Terminal and Storage Volumes Pipelines (1) Pipeline throughput volumes Wholly Owned Pipelines Crude oil 989 1,015 Refined products and natural gas liquids 981 920 Total 1,970 1,935 Select Joint Venture Pipelines (2) Natural gas liquids 452 387 Terminals Terminal throughput and storage volumes (3) Crude oil (4) 606 586 Refined products and natural gas liquids 905 828 Total 1,511 1,414 (1) Represents the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed pipeline segment.\n(2) Total pipeline system throughput volumes for the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipelines (100 percent basis) per day for each period presented.\n(3) Terminal throughput and storage volumes include leased capacity converted to a MBD-equivalent based on capacity divided by days in the period.\n(4) Crude oil terminals include Bayway and Ferndale rail rack volumes.\nDollars per Barrel Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Revenue Average pipeline revenue* $ 0.63 0.63 Average terminal and storage revenue 0.41 0.41 *Excludes equity affiliates.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments Millions of Dollars Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Capital Expenditures and Investments Expansion $ 106 87 Maintenance 21 10 Total Partnership 127 97 Predecessors* 1 21 Total Consolidated $ 128 118 *Prior-period financial information has been retrospectively adjusted for acquisitions of businesses under common control.\nCash Distributions Millions of Dollars Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Cash Distributions † Common units—public $ 36 34 Common units—Phillips 66 46 44 General partner—Phillips 66 47 43 Total $ 129 121 Cash Distribution Per Common Unit (Dollars) $ 0.678 0.646 Coverage Ratio* 1.33x 1.12x †Cash distributions declared attributable to the indicated periods.\n*Calculated as distributable cash flow divided by total cash distributions.
