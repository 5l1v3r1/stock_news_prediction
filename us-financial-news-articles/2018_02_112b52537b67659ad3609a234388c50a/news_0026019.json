WestJet has filed its own complaint to the labor board against the pilots and has accused the union of trying to prevent pilots from flying for Swoop.\nDuring a recent call with analysts, WestJet Chief Executive Officer Gregg Saretsky said the carrier estimated it needs around 200 captains to staff Swoop’s planned fleet of 40 aircraft. The company said it would prefer to hire the majority of the pilots from its existing WestJet pilot list.\nALPA said it hopes to get a CIRB ruling in the coming weeks, to stop WestJet from allowing pilots to take leaves of absences to join Swoop.
