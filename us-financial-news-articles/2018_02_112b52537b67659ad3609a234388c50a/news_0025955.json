The dollar has fallen 2 percent this year and declined 10 percent in 2017.\nPositive economic signals in the United States including low unemployment, robust growth and tame inflation do not stem from President Donald Trump’s policies, Nowotny said, but rather those established by his predecessor, ex-President Barack Obama.\n“You have to view the economy over a longer period,” he said. “What the United States is currently experiencing is the inheritance from the previous government, as well as Fed policy,” he said.\nTrump “started with a good inheritance”, Nowotny said.\nReporting by John Miller; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T18:09:26.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
