Many U.S. companies' reported results have been skewed by the law's impact.\nIn his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders on Saturday, Buffett lamented his inability to find big companies to buy and said his goal is to make \"one or more huge acquisitions\" of non-insurance businesses to bolster results at Berkshire.\nBuffett said finding things to buy at a \"sensible purchase price\" has become a challenge and is a major reason Berkshire is awash with $116 billion of low-yielding cash and government bonds, whose average maturity was 88 days as of the end of 2017.\n\"I am fairly confident we will find ways to deploy\" Berkshire's excess cash, Buffett said on CNBC. \"The best chance to deploy money is when things are going down.\"\nBuffett says he has confidence in Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive Tim Sloan, as he tried to move the third-largest U.S. bank past scandals over how it treated customers including by creating unauthorized accounts.\nBerkshire owns nearly 10 percent of Wells Fargo. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve surprised many by imposing limits on the San Francisco-based banks asset growth until it addresses problems.\nBuffett likened the situation to when he was installed in 1991 as chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc after a former chief executive failed to tell regulators that a trader was submitting fake bids at Treasury auctions.\nDigging your way out of it takes time, Buffett said. Hes got a lot to clean up.\nBuffett raised red flags about ordinary investors using borrowed cash to buy stocks, or buying \"on margin.\"\nBuffett said it was \"crazy\" to borrow money to buy stocks and that \"it is insane to risk something you have and need\" for the sake of leveraging up on stocks. Buffett said investors might get a \"euphoric surge\" if they double their money in stocks, but would not be \"happier.\" (Reporting by Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T15:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:10:09.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
