The regulator said market players have six weeks to respond before it finalizes the proposal for submission to the European Commission. It hopes the proposal will come into effect as policy by this summer.\nThe regulator carried out an analysis of the market to include the tie-up between Liberty Global and Vodafone’s Dutch operations, which combined the country’s largest cable network Ziggo with its second-largest mobile network.\nZiggo’s cable network has never been opened for competitors, and the company has always opposed allowing access. VodafoneZiggo could not immediately be reached for comment. Dutch news agency ANP Quote: d a company official as saying it was studying the ACM proposal.\nKPN, which was once the country’s state-owned telecommunications company, already sells the use of most of its networks to internet and mobile providers.\nKPN said in a response on Tuesday that it has submitted a proposal to the ACM on continued access, and that it would also allow competitors use of its complete fibre optic network for seven years.\n“This makes any further remedies through ex-ante regulation by ACM unnecessary and in KPN’s view disproportionate,” the company said.\nACM had asked the European Commission to let it handle Vodafone and Ziggo’s merger proposal -- and was rejected.\nThe merger was completed in January 2017, though KPN has continued legal efforts against the rival combination, winning a procedural ruling against it at the European Union General Court in October 2017.\nThe Commission has generally been more concerned to see large telecoms continue investing in their networks, while ACM is more concerned about preventing market dominance. Both say they are defending consumer interests.
