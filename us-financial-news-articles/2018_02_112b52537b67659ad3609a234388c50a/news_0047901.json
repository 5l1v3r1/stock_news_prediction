The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and prior to its final passage, the tax bill underwent numerous revisions and amendments that had implications for ADES.\nL. Heath Sampson, President and CEO of ADES, commented, “There were a number of significant changes within the recently enacted Tax Act. Overall, we were pleased with the final Tax Act and its reinforcement of tax credits derived from the production and sale of refined coal, which is critical to our equity investment in Tinuum Group, LLC (“Tinuum”). The reaffirmation of these tax credits is an acknowledgment of the critical role they play in advancing our country’s clean energy initiatives. Within the legislation itself, we, along with Tinuum, view the removal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) as a positive.\n\"While the impact of the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (“BEAT”) has some ambiguity, discussion with our current investors has confirmed their continued conviction of their investments in refined coal. Investors that are impacted by BEAT are still able to appropriately use refined coal tax credits; however, their margin related to those credits may be impacted.\"\nSampson concluded, “Despite some temporary uncertainty around this BEAT provision for a few investors, the clarity of this tax legislation and the removal of the corporate AMT provide a net positive for Tinuum's business. The Tax Act eliminates the market uncertainty of what tax reform would bring. It provides additional clarity to the large majority of potential investors in Tinuum's pipeline, and has the potential to open up new prospective tax-equity investors in Tinuum’s ongoing focus to lease or sell its remaining refined coal facilities. Lower corporate tax rates do reduce the total project margins available in a refined coal transaction as the expenses of the projects are worth less in tax benefits. We do note that for some of Tinuum's projects, there are minor one-time rent reduction provisions to account for tax reform. Having said that, as a result of these one-time adjustments, the two additional refined coal facilities Tinuum sold during the fourth quarter of 2017 and our confidence based on this legislation and Tinuum's ongoing conversations with its current investors, we are updating our forecast of expected future cash flows at ADES from our Tinuum investments, net of taxes and applicable interest charges as of December 31, 2017, to a range between $275 million and $300 million through 2021. This is an increase of over 20% compared to our prior estimate at the end of September 2017, even after receiving $16.5 million in distributions from our Tinuum investments in the fourth quarter of 2017. We look forward to providing more details on these developments, as well as insight into our cashflows, capital allocation process, and overall business strategy and status on our upcoming earnings call on March 13, 2018.”\nThe Company expects to release its fourth quarter 2017 financial results and file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 after market close on Monday, March 12, 2018.
