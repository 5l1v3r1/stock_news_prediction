This is testimony to the quality of Orbotech's FPD solutions. Delivery of these solutions is expected to be split between the first and the second quarters of 2018.\nThe second press release relates to $37 million in purchase orders received by Orbotech's SD division for multiple etch and deposition systems from two GaAs foundry customers. These systems will be used to manufacture radio frequency (RF) devices for 4G and emerging 5G wireless infrastructure and mobile device markets. Delivery of the systems is expected to be split between the first and the second quarters of 2018.\nFor more specific details about each of these significant orders, please see the separate press releases.\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $256.9 million, compared with $215.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and $245.7 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nIn the Company's Production Solutions for Electronics Industry segment:\nRevenues from the Company's printed circuit board (\" PCB \") business were $90.4 million (including $55.0 million in equipment sales) in the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares to PCB revenues of $77.2 million (including $48.6 million in equipment sales) in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues from the Company's flat panel display (\" FPD \") business were $72.1 million (including $60.7 million in equipment sales) in the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares to FPD revenues of $71.6 million (including $60.2 million in equipment sales) in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues from the Company's semiconductor device (\" SD \") business were $90.3 million (including $77.8 million in equipment sales) in the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares to SD revenues of $62.1 million (including $48.4 million in equipment sales) in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRevenues in the Company's other segments totaled $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nService revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $61.0 million, compared with $55.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRevenues for the full year of 2017 totaled $900.9 million, compared with $806.4 million for the full year of 2016.\nGross profit and gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $121.6 million and 47.3%, respectively, compared with $100.7 million and 46.8%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016.

GAAP net income and GAAP net income margin for the full year of 2017 were $132.4 million and 14.7%, respectively, compared with $79.4 million and 9.9% in the full year of 2016. The GAAP results reflect a net benefit of approximately $16 million consisting of the impact of increase in deferred tax assets mainly for a valuation allowance releases and decrease in deferred tax liabilities offset by an increase in the Company's tax provisions. The valuation allowance release of $18.8 million occurred in the fourth quarter and the most significant component related to the Company's carryforward losses in the United States. In view of the strong business conditions, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will be able to use these carryforward losses in the United States and therefore released the applicable valuation allowance.\nGAAP earnings per share (diluted) for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.14, compared with $0.53, for the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP earnings per share (diluted) for the full year of 2017 were $2.71 compared with $1.71 in the full year of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (as defined below) and adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $55.6 million and 21.6%, respectively, compared with $49.9 million and 23.2%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year of 2017 were $190.0 million and 21.1%, respectively, compared with $168.1 million and 20.8% for the full year of 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $42.5 million and 16.5%, respectively, compared with $33.7 million and 15.7%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016.

A reconciliation of each of the Company's non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measure (the \" Reconciliation \") is included at the end of this press release.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, short term bank deposits and marketable securities of $327.8 million, and debt of $72.5 million.

All amounts related to the Assessment are given after application of the Company's NOLs. Approximately 80% of the amount of the Assessment, assuming that all NOLs are set off against the other matters included in the Assessment, relates to the following two matters: (i) the use of tax exempt income derived from the Company's approved and benefited enterprises under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investment, 1959, in particular in its investments in, or acquisitions of, foreign subsidiaries; and (ii) the purchase of shares of the Company by its foreign subsidiaries during the audit period. The Company has not taken any reserves or provisions related to these two matters because it reasonably believes its positions are more likely than not correct as a legal matter. The Company intends vigorously to contest the ITA's position on both of these matters and has not, as of December 31, 2017, established, and does not anticipate establishing, a provision related to these matters. The other significant item in the Assessment relates to the Company's transfer pricing with respect to certain intercompany transactions in the Far East. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's tax provisions with respect to the tax audit period cover a majority of the remaining 20% of the Assessment. In light of the Assessment and the ongoing criminal investigation in Israel, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the \" Audit Committee \"), with the assistance of outside advisors, reviewed the Company's tax returns in Israel for certain periods since fiscal year 2009. The Audit Committee did not identify any fraudulent or criminal activity in the course of its review. In addition, the Audit Committee and its outside advisors had the full cooperation of management and the Audit Committee did not identify any 'tone at the top' issues or any significant issues in the Company's control environment.\nThe evaluation of tax positions involves significant judgment. If the Company's judgment with respect to its tax positions proves to be inaccurate, it may be required to increase its provisions or take a charge in future periods. The amount of the increase and/or the charge against earnings could be material. There is an ongoing criminal investigation in Israel against the Company, certain of its employees and its tax consultant related to tax positions taken by the Company in the tax audit period as well as in prior periods. The Company does not have any insight into the scope or time period of the criminal investigation or the timing of any prosecutorial action related to the investigation which may occur in the coming days, weeks, months or years. Although the Company cannot predict the timing of any prosecutorial action, the Company expects to be summoned to the Israeli prosecutor's office for a hearing, at which it will have the opportunity to present its positions, prior to any indictments of the Company and/or certain of its employees and/or payment of monetary amounts in lieu of such indictments. The Company has not conducted its own investigation into any matters that may be the subject of such investigation and will only do so once the criminal investigation has been completed. The Company intends vigorously to contest the Assessment in accordance with Israeli law as well as defend itself and its employees in the criminal matter, but it cannot assure investors as to the outcome or timing of completion of either process, including the amount of tax ultimately payable related to fiscal years 2012-2014 and prior fiscal years, or any additional taxes, penalties, criminal sanctions, indictments, fines and other amounts that may be imposed as a result of the Assessment and criminal investigation, which may be material in amount or in adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position and reputation.\nExcept for historical information, the matters discussed in this press release are forward-looking statements the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to, among other things, future prospects, developments and business strategies and involve certain risks and uncertainties. The words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"will,\" \"plan,\" \"expect\" and \"would\" and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions, have been used in this press release to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made based on management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting Orbotech and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to Orbotech's operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. Many factors could cause the actual results those projected including, without limitation, the risk that the Company may not achieve its revenue and margin expectations within and for 2018 (including, without limitation, due to shifting move-in dates); cyclicality in the industries in which the Company operates, the Company's supply chain management and production capacity, order cancelation often without penalty; timing and occurrence of product acceptance (the Company defines 'bookings' and 'backlog' as purchase arrangements with customers that are based on mutually agreed terms, which, in some cases for bookings and backlog, may still be subject to completion of written documentation and may be changed or cancelled by the customer, often without penalty), fluctuations in product mix, within and among divisions, worldwide economic conditions generally, especially in the industries in which the Company operates, the timing and strength of product and service offerings by the Company and its competitors, changes in business or pricing strategies, changes in the prevailing political and regulatory framework in which the relevant parties operate, including as a result of the 'Brexit' process and political uncertainty in the United States, or in economic or technological trends or conditions, including currency fluctuations, inflation and consumer confidence, on a global, regional or national basis, the level of consumer demand for sophisticated devices such as smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices as well as automobiles, the Company's global operations and its ability to comply with varying legal, regulatory, exchange, tax and customs regimes, the timing and outcome of tax audits, including the Assessment process in Israel and related criminal investigation (see above), the Company's ability to achieve strategic initiatives, including related to its acquisition strategy, the Company's debt and corporate financing activities; the final timing and outcome, and impact of the criminal matter and ongoing investigation in Korea, including any impact on existing or future business opportunities in Korea and elsewhere, any civil actions related to the Korean matter brought by third parties, including the Company's customers, which may result in monetary judgments or settlements, expenses associated with the Korean matter, and ongoing or increased hostilities in Israel and the surrounding areas.\nThe foregoing information should be read in connection with the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F for the 2016, and subsequent SEC filings. The Company is subject to the foregoing and other risks detailed in those reports. The Company assumes no obligation to update the information in this press release to reflect new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income margin, non-GAAP net income per share detailed in the Reconciliation exclude charges, income or losses, as applicable, related to one or more of the following: (i) equity-based compensation expenses; (ii) certain items associated with acquisitions, including release of earn outs, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition costs; (iii) tax impact including tax effect of Non-GAAP adjustments and tax benefit; (iv) share in losses of equity method investee and amounts associated with non-controlling interests company; (v) release of valuation allowance and/or (vi) charges associated with the financing activities related to the retirement of the Company's 2014 credit agreement with JPMorgan.\nThe Company uses the non-GAAP measures indicated in the Reconciliation to supplement the Company's financial results presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures exclude equity based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, share in losses/profits of associated companies, as well as certain financial and other expenses and items that are believed to be helpful in understanding and comparing past operating and financial performance with current results. Management uses all of the non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Orbotech believes that these measures enhance investors' ability to review the Company's business from the same perspective as the Company's management and facilitate comparisons with results for prior periods. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. However, the non-GAAP measures presented are subject to limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude certain recurring items (such as, equity compensation, financial expense and amortization of intangible assets) as described below and in the Reconciliation. The presentation of this additional non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income; net income attributable to Orbotech Ltd. or earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a quantification of the adjustments made to comparable GAAP measures, please see the Reconciliation.\nThe effect of equity-based compensation expenses has been excluded from the non-GAAP measures. Although equity-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees, and the Company believes such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the Company continues to evaluate its business performance excluding equity based compensation expenses. Equity-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.\nThe effects of amortization of intangible assets have also been excluded from the measures. This item is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of acquisitions and dispositions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods and the Company may be required to record impairment charges in the future. The Company believes that it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on total operating expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is also a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Orbotech Ltd., further adjusted, in addition to the items described above, to exclude taxes on income, financial expenses (income) – net and depreciation. The Company presents adjusted EBITDA because it considers it to be an important supplemental measure and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in Orbotech's industry. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a measurement of Orbotech's adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of its revenues. Although the Company believes its presentation of adjusted EBITDA is useful, its adjusted EBITDA measure may not be comparable to similarly named measures presented by other companies.\nFor more information about all of the foregoing items, see the Reconciliation, the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC for the 2016, and its subsequent SEC filings.\nORBOTECH LTD.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nU.
