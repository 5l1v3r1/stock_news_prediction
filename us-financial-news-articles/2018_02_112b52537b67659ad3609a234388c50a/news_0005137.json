Boeing has unsuccessfully petitioned for that program to have import tariffs applied, arguing that it was being sold to customers cheaply after excessive state subsidy.\nAirbus' A321 LR plane is a long-range version of its hugely successful A320 program.\nThe company claimed in a press release Wednesday that more efficient engines and a third tank option will open up new routes for single-aisle aircraft. It added that cost savings as much as 30 percent could be made on routes typically dominated by legacy carriers using bigger planes.\n\"This aircraft can now fly over the Atlantic comfortably from New York to Paris or it can also serve any other routes such as Dubai to Beijing, or Singapore to Sydney,\" said Klaus Roewe, Airbus' head of the A320 program.\nAirbus said the A321 LR is scheduled to go into service later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T13:39:59.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
