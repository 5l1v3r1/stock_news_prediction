Surpassing that mark, set by Canada in 2010, might be cause for celebration on the streets of Oslo, but the Norwegian delegation in Pyeongchang is staying humble. “I was not expecting this level, I‘m positively surprised by this fantastic group that I‘m leading,” Norway’s chef de mission Tore Oevreboe told Reuters. “The main thing is that we are very happy. And we are proud but we’re not bragging. That is very important because this is how we do it in Norway.” Oevreboe has watched stunning performances by his athletes across the disciplines, with the added bonus of cross-country skier Marit Bjoergen becoming the most successful Winter Olympian of all time by claiming her 14th medal. For the Norwegians, who have also plundered 12 silver and 10 bronze medals, fun and friendship come first. “The medal count is one thing, but that’s secondary. The most important thing is that we have had fun all the time and we are friends and we are still friends,” Oevreboe said. Asked about the secrets of Norway’s success, Oevreboe pointed to one of the more obvious advantages the Nordic country has. “Snow. And in our system, if you ask people that are 25 years old, 93 per cent of them have been into sports, they have been members of a club to do sports,” he said.

With the specter of doping a constant backdrop to the Games, the Norwegian team has been open about the medicines it brought to Pyeongchang, particularly for treating asthma. “We chose to be wide open about what we brought, but I can tell the world that we’re bringing most of it back because this suitcase with medication is a nice-to-have suitcase, but we bring it back, nearly all of it,” Oevreboe said. “We want to be prepared to take care of them if they get sick and that’s why we bring these medications ... and we’re not going to use it for any purpose other than what they are diagnosed for,” he added.
