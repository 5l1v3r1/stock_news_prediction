Sales grew by an impressive 21.1% 1 and core operating margin improved by 3.4 points year-on-year, driven by the excellent Specialty Care performance.\nIn 2018, we will maintain the positive momentum of the current business to deliver continued strong growth and further margin improvement, well on track to meet our 2020 financial objectives. Business development and the accelerated transformation of the R&D organization also remain top priorities to expand our innovative pipeline and sustain long-term growth.”\nReview of full year 2017 results\nNote: Unless stated otherwise, all variations in sales are calculated excluding foreign exchange impacts. Currency effects are established by recalculating net sales for the relevant period at the exchange rates used for the previous period.\nGroup sales reached €1,908.7 million, up 21.1% year-on-year.\nSpecialty Care sales reached €1,591.9 million, up 25.9%, driven by the strong growth of Somatuline ® and the €108.6 million contribution from key new products Cabometyx ® (mainly sales from Germany and France) and Onivyde ® (consolidated since April 2017 following the acquisition from Merrimack Pharmaceuticals). Somatuline ® growth of 31.9% was driven by continued positive momentum in North America (62.1% growth in the U.S.) and solid performance throughout Europe. Dysport ® growth was fueled by the good performance of Galderma as well as a strong growth in the Middle East and some Eastern European countries. Decapeptyl ® sales reflect good volume growth across Europe and a positive trend in China despite some continued pricing pressure.\nConsumer Healthcare sales reached €316.8 million, up 1.4% (up 3.2% adjusted for the impact of the Etiasa ® contractual set-up in China), driven by the good performance of Smecta ® and Fortrans/Eziclen ® as well as the contribution of the newly acquired products (including Prontalgine ® and Buscopan ® ).\nCore Operating Income totaled €503.6 million, up 38.4%, driven by the sales growth and after increased commercial investments for the new products Cabometyx ® and Onivyde ® and R&D investments to support the development of the growing pipeline.\nCore operating margin reached 26.4% of net sales, up 3.4 points compared to 2016.\nCore consolidated net profit was €362.7 million, compared to €263.6 million in 2016, up 37.6% and impacted by higher financial and income tax expenses.\nFully diluted core earnings per share grew by 37.0% to reach €4.36, compared to €3.18 in 2016.\nIFRS Operating income was €397.2 million, up 30.4% after higher amortization of intangible assets (excl. software), restructuring and integration costs, slightly offset by lower impairment charges. Operating income margin at 20.8% is up 1.6 points compared to 2016.\nIFRS Consolidated net profit was €272.9 million versus €226.6 million in 2016, up 20.5%, after higher financial and income tax expenses, mainly from the recent U.S. tax reform.\nIFRS Fully diluted EPS (Earning per share) was €3.28 versus €2.73 in 2016.\nFree cash flow reached €309.0 million, up by €80.2 million or 35.1%, driven by the improvement in Operating Cash Flow, partially compensated by higher restructuring and financial costs.\nClosing net debt reached €463.3 million at the end of 2017, versus a net cash position of €68.6 million at the end of 2016, reflecting the acquisitions completed during the first half of 2017 for Onivyde ® , the Consumer Healthcare OTC product portfolio and the equity stake in Akkadeas Pharma, as well as the additional milestones paid for Cabometyx ® and Xermelo ® .\nImpact of U.S. tax reform\nThe Group booked an expense of €46.0 million related to the negative impact of the newly signed U.S. tax reform on the value of its U.S. tax losses carried forward. This expense was partly offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the U.S. for €19.7 million.\nSubject to further analysis and interpretation of the U.S. tax reform, the combined effect of our growth in the U.S. and the reduction of the Federal tax rate will lead to a reduction of the Group effective tax rate by 2 to 3 points in 2018.\nComparison of 2017 performance with financial objectives\nThe Group exceeded the limit of its updated guidance provided on 27 July 2017 for Specialty Care and Consumer Healthcare sales growth and for Core operating margin.\nThe table below shows the comparison between the financial objectives provided on 27 July 2017 and 2017 actuals.\nFinancial objectives 1\nActuals 2017 Specialty Care sales > +24% 2\n+25.9% 2 Consumer Healthcare sales > +0.0% 2 +1.4% 2 Core operating margin\n(as a percentage of sales) > 25.0% 26.4%\n1 2017 revised financial objectives communicated on 27 July 2017\n2 Year-on-year growth excluding foreign exchange impacts. Currency effects are established by recalculating net sales for the relevant period at the exchange rates used for the previous period.\nDividend for the 2017 financial year proposed for the approval of Ipsen’s shareholders\nThe Ipsen S.A. Board of Directors, which met on 14 February 2018, has decided to propose at the annual shareholders’ meeting on 30 May 2018 the payment of a dividend of €1.00 per share, up from €0.85 for the 2016 financial year.\n2018 Financial guidance\nConsistent with its 2020 ambition, the Group has set the following financial targets for 2018:\nGroup sales growth year-on-year at constant currency greater than +16.0%, fueled by strong double-digit growth of Specialty Care and low single-digit growth of Consumer Healthcare. Based on the current level of exchange rates, sales growth at current exchange rates should be negatively impacted by approximately 4%; Core operating margin greater than 28.0% of net sales.\nMeeting, webcast and conference call for the press\nIpsen will host a press conference on Thursday 15 February 2018 at 9:30 a.m. (Paris time, GMT +1) at Salons de l’hôtel des Arts et Métiers – 9 bis avenue d’Iéna – 75116 Paris (France).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect the Group’s future ability to achieve its financial targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words \"believes\", \"anticipates\" and \"expects\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including the Group’s expectations regarding future events, including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover, the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by the Group. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably for regulatory or competition reasons. The Group must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore, the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that the Group may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore, the Group cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during pre-clinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the Group's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the Group’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. The Group also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to the Group’s activities and financial results. The Group cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of the Group’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on the Group’s business, financial position or performance. The Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements, targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, unless so required by applicable law. The Group’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to the Group’s 2016 Registration Document available on its website ( www.ipsen.com ).\nComparison of Consolidated Sales for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 and 2016:\nSales by therapeutic area and by product 1\nNote: Unless stated otherwise, all variations in sales are stated excluding foreign exchange impacts.\nCurrency effects are established by recalculating net sales for the relevant period at the exchange rates used for the previous period.\nThe following table shows sales by therapeutic area and by product for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 and 2016:\n4th Quarter Full Year (in millions euros) 2017 2016 % Variation % Variation\nat constant\ncurrency\n2017 2016 % Variation % Variation\nat constant\ncurrency\nOncology 325.2 247.3 31.5% 35.2% 1,185.2 904.9 31.0% 32.4% Somatuline ® 189.2 146.5 29.2% 33.9% 702.5 538.3 30.5% 31.9% Decapeptyl ® 89.6 88.0 1.8% 3.2% 348.7 339.8 2.6% 3.6% Cabometyx ® 20.6 7.2 NA NA 51.7 7.2 NA NA Onivyde ® 19.7 0.0 NA NA 56.9 0.0 NA NA Other Oncology 6.2 5.7 8.0% 8.6% 25.4 19.5 30.2% 30.5% Neurosciences 88.2 71.9 22.6% 25.4% 331.6 286.7 15.7% 14.8% Dysport ® 87.2 71.2 22.5% 25.3% 328.2 284.7 15.3% 14.5% Rare Diseases 17.7 20.5 -13.6% -11.8% 75.1 81.5 -7.8% -7.1% NutropinAq ® 12.3 14.0 -12.2% -12.1% 51.8 57.7 -10.2% -9.9% Increlex ® 5.0 6.5 -22.7% -17.2% 22.9 23.7 -3.5% -1.9% Specialty Care 431.1 339.8 26.9% 30.3% 1,591.9 1,273.0 25.1% 25.9% Smecta ® 33.3 31.6 5.6% 8.3% 115.5 111.0 4.0% 4.1% Forlax ® 10.4 10.2 1.9% 2.6% 42.1 39.3 7.1% 7.0% Tanakan ® 14.8 15.8 -6.7% -6.6% 41.4 43.6 -4.9% -6.0% Fortrans/Eziclen ® 8.7 7.8 11.3% 12.3% 32.1 26.8 19.8% 16.5% Etiasa ® 3.1 11.5 -72.7% -70.8% 17.8 29.3 -39.3% -37.2% Other Consumer Healthcare 17.6 13.5 31.0% 28.9% 67.8 61.5 10.2% 9.8% Consumer Healthcare 88.0 90.4 -2.6% -1.6% 316.8 311.6 1.7% 1.4% Group Sales 519.2 430.2 20.7% 23.6% 1,908.7 1,584.6 20.5% 21.1%\n1 New sales reporting according to main therapeutic indication of each product\nFull year 2017 sales highlights\nGroup sales reached €1,908.7 million, up 21.1%, driven by the 25.9% growth of Specialty Care sales and 1.4% growth of Consumer Healthcare sales.\nSpecialty Care sales amounted to €1,591.9 million, up 25.9%.

Over the period, sales in North America represented 24.5% of total Group sales, compared to 17.2% in 2016.\nSales in the Rest of the World reached €401.9 million, up 3.7% year-on-year, driven by the resupply of Dysport ® in Brazil in 2017, the good performance of Dysport ® in Australia, and the growth of Somatuline ® in certain countries. These variances were partly offset by the Etiasa ® performance in China (mainly impacted by the new contractual set-up and a negative inventory impact). Over the period, sales in the Rest of the World represented 21.0% of total Group sales, compared to 24.6% in 2016.\nComparison of Core consolidated income statement for 2017 and 2016\nCore financial measures are performance indicators.

These reclassifications had no impact on Operating income or Consolidated net profit. The impact of the various reclassifications on the consolidated income statement for the period ended 31 December 2016 is presented in Appendix 2.\nSales\nIn 2017, the Group's consolidated sales came to €1,908.7 million, up 20.5% year-on-year and up 21.1% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues for the financial year 2017 totaled €103.0 million, up 19.1% versus €86.5 million in 2016.\nThe evolution was attributable to higher royalties received from Group partners, mainly Galderma for Dysport ® , Menarini for Adenuric ® and Shire for Onivyde ® . Other revenues were also positively impacted in 2017 by the new contractual set-up for Etiasa ® in China.\nCost of goods sold\nIn 2017, Cost of goods sold amounted to €385.6 million, representing 20.2% of sales compared to €351.1 million, or 22.2% of sales in 2016.\nThe growth in Specialty Care sales drove a favorable product mix that improved the cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales.\nRoyalties paid to partners increased due to Group sales growth.\nSelling expenses\nIn 2017, Selling expenses came to €715.9 million, representing 37.5% of sales, up 20.9% versus 2016. The increase reflects the commercial efforts deployed to support the Cabometyx ® launch in Europe, the growth of Somatuline ® in the United States as well as the commercial investment for Onivyde ® in the United States following the closing of the acquisition in April 2017.\nResearch and development expenses\nFor the financial year 2017, Research and development expenses totaled €265.8 million, compared to €231.3 million in 2016.\nThe Group increased development costs in Oncology, especially for Cabometyx ® , Onivyde ® , the peptide receptor radionuclide therapy program, and in Neurosciences, mainly for the short acting toxin program and the development of new indications for Dysport ® . In the meantime, the Group discontinued internal investments in peptide discovery during the year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nIn 2017, General and administrative expenses came to €140.8 million, compared to €125.6 million in 2016. The increase resulted primarily from investments to support the Onivyde ® launch in the United States and Ipsen’s overall growth as well as the impact of the Group’s positive performance on variable compensation.\nOther core operating income and expenses\nAt year end 2017, Other core operating income was in line with last year.\nIn 2017, Other core operating expenses totaled €0.5 million, versus €8.0 million in 2016. This evolution is mainly due to the impact of the currency hedging policy.\nCore Operating Income\nCore Operating Income in 2017 came to €503.6 million, representing 26.4% of sales, compared to €363.9 million in Core Operating Income in 2016, representing 23.0% of sales. The strong performance of Specialty Care including the contribution from new products Cabometyx ® and Onivyde ® , the continued performance of Somatuline ® , combined with higher commercial and R&D investments enabled the Group to increase its profitability by 3.4 points. Core Operating Income increased by 38.4% compared to 2016.\nNet financing costs and Other financial income and expense\nIn 2017, the Group incurred net financial expenses of €26.6 million, versus €14.3 million in 2016. Net financing costs amounted to €8.1 million versus €5.0 million in 2016, driven by the full year impact of interest expenses on the bond issued in 2016 and by financing costs related to the debt raised for the acquisitions completed during 2017.\nIn 2017, Other financial income and expense amounted to an expense of €18.4 million, compared to €9.3 million in 2016, mainly attributable to the cost of hedging implemented to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of the Group.\nCore income taxes\nIn 2017, Core income tax expense of €115.7 million resulted from a core effective tax rate of 24.3% on profit before tax compared to a core effective rate of 25.2% in 2016.\nCore consolidated net profit\nFor the year ended 31 December 2017, Core consolidated net profit increased by 37.6% to €362.7 million, with €362.1 million fully attributable to Ipsen S.A. shareholders. This compares to Core consolidated net profit of €263.6 million, with €262.9 million attributable to Ipsen S.A. shareholders, in 2016.\nCore Earning per share\nIn 2017, Core EPS fully diluted came to €4.36, up 37.0% versus €3.18 per share in 2016.\nFrom Core financial measures to IFRS reported figures\nReconciliations between IFRS 2016 / 2017 results and the Core financial measures are presented in Appendix 5.\nIn 2017, the main reconciling items between Core consolidated net income and IFRS consolidated net income were:\nAmortization of intangible assets (excluding software)\nAmortization of intangible assets (excluding software) for 2017 amounted to €53.3 million before tax, compared to €7.7 million before tax in 2016, mainly due to the amortization of intangible assets from Cabometyx ® , Onivyde ® and assets acquired from Sanofi.\nOther operating income and expenses and Restructuring costs\nOther non-core operating income and expenses for 2017 amounted to €48.9 million before tax and Restructuring costs came to €18.8 million before tax.\nThose expenses consisted mainly of integration costs related to the Onivyde ® acquisition, the adaptation of the R&D structure and programs, a settlement with a partner in Japan and a reorganization plan in Europe.\nIn 2016, Other non-core operating expenses totaled €6.8 million before tax and consisted mainly of costs from the change in the Group’s corporate governance and costs from the move to the new research and development site in Oxford, UK. Restructuring costs were €1.9 million before tax in 2016.\nImpairment losses\nIn 2017, a net reversal of impairment of €14.8 million before tax was recognized at Group level mainly related to:\nthe reversal of the IGF-1 / Increlex ® impairment for €50.4 million following the completion of the transfer to the new manufacturing site, approved by both the EMA (European Medicines Agency) and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), securing the production of Increlex ® ; the impairment of Prontalgine ® for €33.9 million following the consequence of the decree announced by the French Ministry of Health on July 12, 2017, listing all medicines containing codeine, dextromethorphan, ethylmorphine or noscapine on the list of medicines available on prescription.\nIn 2016, Ipsen recorded a €42.9 million impairment charge before tax on several intangible assets (OctreoPharm, MCNA from Telesta Therapeutics and Canbex Therapeutics).\nOther\nIn 2017, Other items amounted to an expense of €18.5 million and were mainly related to the negative impact of the newly signed U.S. tax reform on U.S. tax losses carried forward offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the U.S. as well as to discontinued operations.\nIn 2016, Other items amounted to an income of €5.7 million, mainly comprised of €5.3 million in dividends from Rhythm Holding, €2.4 million in dividends from the InnoBio fund as well as the Spirogen earn-out payment.\nAs a consequence, IFRS reported indicators are:\nOperating income\nIn 2017, Operating income totaled €397.2 million versus €304.7 million in 2016, with an Operating margin at 20.8%, up 1.6 points compared to 2016.\nConsolidated net profit\nConsolidated net profit was €272.9 million at 31 December 2017, an increase of 20.5% versus last year at €226.6 million.\nEarning per share\nFully diluted EPS was €3.28 in 2017 versus €2.73 in 2016.\nOperating segments: Core Operating Income by therapeutic area\nSegment information is presented according to the Group's two operating segments, Specialty Care and Consumer Healthcare.\nAll costs allocated to these two segments are presented in the key performance indicators. Only corporate overhead costs and the impact of the currency hedging policy are not allocated to the two operating segments.\nThe Group uses Core Operating Income to measure its segment performance and to allocate resources.\nSales, Revenue and Core Operating Income are presented by therapeutic area for the 2017 and 2016 financial years in the following table.\n(in millions of euros) 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Change % Specialty Care Sales 1,591.9 1,273.0 319.0 25.1% Revenue 1,643.1 1,308.0 335.1 25.6% Core Operating Income 570.6 415.0 155.6 37.5% % of sales 35.8% 32.6% Consumer Healthcare Sales 316.8 311.6 5.2 1.7% Revenue 368.7 363.1 5.5 1.5% Core Operating Income 91.8 99.6 (7.9) -7.9% % of sales 29.0% 32.0% Total Unallocated Core Operating Income (158.8) (150.7) (8.1) 5.4% Group total Sales 1,908.7 1,584.6 324.1 20.5% Revenue 2,011.8 1,671.1 340.7 20.4% Core Operating Income 503.6 363.9 139.7 38.4% % of sales 26.4% 23.0% In 2017, Specialty Care sales grew to €1,591.9 million, up 25.1% over 2016 (or 25.9% at constant exchange rates), reaching 83.4% of total consolidated sales at 31 December 2017, versus 80.3% a year earlier. In 2017, Core Operating Income for Specialty Care amounted to €570.6 million, representing 35.8% of sales. This compares to €415.0 million in the prior-year period, representing 32.6% of sales. The improvement reflects the continued growth of Somatuline ® in the United States and Europe and the contribution of Cabometyx ® and Onivyde ® , along with increased commercial investments to support growth and the commercial launches.\nIn 2017, Consumer Healthcare sales came to €316.8 million, up 1.7% year on year (or 1.4% at constant exchange rates), driven by the good performance of Smecta ® and Fortrans/Eziclen ® and despite the new contractual set-up in China for Etiasa ® . In 2017, Core Operating Income for Consumer Healthcare amounted €91.8 million, representing 29.0% of sales in comparison of 32.0% in 2016. This variance reflects the commercial efforts deployed to support the implementation of the OTx strategy as well as an increase in medical study expenses.\nIn 2017, Unallocated Core Operating Income came to a negative €158.8 million, compared to a negative €150.7 million in the year-earlier period. The evolution is mainly attributable to the Group’s positive performance on higher variable compensation and investments to support Ipsen’s growth. These expenses consisted mainly of unallocated corporate expenses and the impact from the currency hedging policy.\nNet cash flow and financing\nIn 2017, the Group had a net cash decrease of €531.9 million after the acquisition of the Onivyde ® assets, the OTC product portfolio from Sanofi and the equity stake in Akkadeas Pharma, bringing closing net debt to €463.3 million.\nAnalysis of the consolidated net cash flow statement\n(in millions of euros) 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Opening net cash / (debt) 68.6 186.9 Core Operating Income 503.6 363.9 Non-cash items 18.1 15.6 Change in operating working capital requirement (45.2) (2.8) (Increases) decreases in other working capital requirement 40.1 12.1 Net capex (excluding milestones paid) (94.7) (84.0) Dividends received from entities accounted for using the equity method 0.9 2.3 Operating Cash Flow 422.8 307.1 Other operating income and expenses and restructuring costs (cash) (53.4) (20.8) Financial income (cash) (16.8) (3.1) Current income tax (P&L, excluding provisions for tax contingencies) (53.0) (65.5) Other operating cash flow 9.4 11.1 Free Cash Flow 309.0 228.8 Dividends paid (70.6) (70.3) Net investments (business development and milestones) (789.2) (252.9) Share buyback (18.1) (24.0) FX on net indebtedness 33.8 0.0 Other (discontinued operations and financial instrument) 3.3 0.1 Shareholders return and external growth operations (840.9) (347.2) CHANGE IN NET CASH / (DEBT) (531.9) (118.4) Closing net cash / (debt) (463.3) 68.6 Operating cash flow\nIn 2017, Operating Cash Flow totaled €422.8 million, up €115.7 million (37.7%) versus 2016. The increase was driven by higher Core Operating Income, partially offset by an increase in working capital requirement (WCR) and net capital expenditure (excluding milestones paid).\nWorking capital requirement for operating activities increased by €45.2 million in 2017, compared with an increase of €2.8 million in 2016. The change at 31 December 2017 stemmed mainly from the following:\na €38.2 million increase in inventories during the year, in step with business growth and recent acquisitions; a €84.6 million increase in trade receivables, in line with sales growth over the last quarter, compared with a €42.7 million increase in trade receivables in 2016; a €77.6 million increase in trade payables at 31 December 2017, in correlation with the phasing of operating expenses mainly to support the growth of the business. At 31 December 2016, trade payables rose by €47.6 million.\nIn 2017, other WCR need decreased by €40.1 million, mainly driven by the positive seasonality on working capital components at the end of the year notably due to the provision for higher variable compensation. Other WCR decreased by €12.1 million in 2016.\nNet capital expenditure amounted to €94.7 million at 31 December 2017, compared with €84.0 million in 2016. These investments included mainly capital projects to support increased production capacity at industrial sites in the United Kingdom, the United States and France as well as corporate investments in Information Technology and Digital.\nFree cash flow\nIn 2017, Free Cash Flow came to €309.0 million, up €80.2 million (+35.0%) versus 31 December 2016. This evolution is mainly driven by an improvement in Operating Cash Flow, partially compensated by higher Other operating income or expenses and restructuring costs, and increased Financial expenses.\nOther non-core operating income and expenses and restructuring costs of €53.4 million included Onivyde ® integration costs, the adaptation of the R&D structure and programs, a settlement with a partner in Japan and costs arising from the change in corporate governance. At the end of December 2016, €20.8 million of such payments were primarily comprised of costs arising from the change in corporate governance, as well as payments for earlier restructuring plans that were staggered over several fiscal periods.\nThe €16.8 million in financial expenses paid at the end of December 2017 resulted from a full year of interest on the bond issued in June 2016, financing costs related to the debt raised for acquisitions completed during this year and hedging costs. In comparison, the €3.1 million in financial income paid at the end of December 2016 resulted mainly from the collection of dividends, an earnout payment related to the sale of Spirogen shares and realized foreign exchange gains.\nThe change in current income tax stemmed mainly from the reimbursement of the 3% tax on dividends partially compensated by the temporary surtax in France.\nShareholders return and external growth operations\nAt 31 December 2017, the dividend payout to Ipsen S.A. shareholders amounted to €70.2 million.\nNet investments at 31 December 2017 amounted to €789 million, including the acquisition of Onivyde ® from Merrimack Pharmaceuticals on April 3, 2017 for €665 million, corresponding to the purchase price and future earn-outs (discounted and probabilized under IFRS), the acquisition of Consumer Healthcare products in European territories from Sanofi for €86 million, and the equity stake in Akkadeas Pharma for €5 million, as well as additional milestones paid to Exelixis for €26 million following the exclusive license agreement signed in 2016 and to Lexicon for €10 million. This was partially offset by milestone payment received from Radius and from Galderma for the territory extension in Asia for a total of €15 million.\nAt 31 December 2016, net financial investments mainly encompassed a €184 million upfront payment to Exelixis for the exclusive licensing agreement for Cabometyx ® and a €5 million upfront payment to 3B Pharmaceuticals GmbH, partially offset by regulatory milestone payments received from Acadia and Radius (€10 million) and by scheduled payments related to the agreement signed with Galderma in December 2015 for Asia-Pacific markets (collection of net €6 million).\nReconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and net cash\n(in millions of euros) 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Current financial assets (derivative instruments on financial operations) 1.4 - Closing cash and cash equivalents 209.3 422.5 Bonds (297.5) (297.1) Other financial liabilities (**) (102.8) (17.8) Non-current financial liabilities (400.3) (314.8) Credit lines and bank loans (46.0) (4.0) Current financial liabilities (**) (227.6) (35.1) Current financial liabilities (273.6) (39.1) Debt (673.9) (353.9) Net cash / (debt) (*) (463.3) 68.6 (*) Net cash / (debt): derivative instruments booked in financial assets and related to financial operations, cash and cash equivalents, less bank overdrafts, bank loans and other financial liabilities and excluding financial derivative instruments on commercial operations.\n(**) Financial liabilities mainly exclude €20.4 million in derivative instruments related to commercial operations in 2017, compared with €18.2 million in 2016.\nAnalysis of Group cash\nOn 16 June 2016, Ipsen S.A. issued a €300 million unsecured seven-year public bond loan with an annual interest rate of 1.875%.\nIn addition, €300 million in bilateral long-term bank loans were contracted with a maturity of 6.5 years. At 31 December 2017, none of the bank loans were drawn down.\nOn 6 June 2017, Ipsen S.A. amended its syndicated loan to increase the facility amount from €300 million to €600 million and to extend its maturity until 17 October 2022. At 31 December 2017, €42 million were drawn on this facility.\nOn 27 June 2017, Ipsen S.A. increased its program of “NEU CP - Negotiable EUropean” Commercial Paper, from €300 million to €600 million, among which €202 million were issued on 31 December 2017.\nAPPENDICES\nAppendix 1 – Consolidated income statement\n(in millions of euros) 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Restated\nSales 1,908.7 1,584.6 Other revenues 103.0 86.5 Revenue 2,011.8 1,671.1 Cost of goods sold (1) (385.6) (351.1) Selling expenses (1) (715.9) (592.0) Research and development expenses (1) (265.8) (231.3) General and administrative expenses (1) (140.8) (125.6) Other operating income 3.1 6.9 Other operating expenses (105.5) (28.6) Restructuring costs (18.8) (1.9) Impairment losses 14.8 (42.9) Operating Income 397.2 304.7 Investment income 1.1 0.9 Financing costs (9.2) (5.8) Net financing costs (8.1) (5.0) Other financial income and expense (18.4) (1.6) Income taxes (101.4) (73.5) Share of net profit (loss) from entities accounted for using the equity method 1.4 1.9 Net profit (loss) from continuing operations 270.7 226.5 Net profit (loss) from discontinued operations 2.3 0.1 Consolidated net profit (loss) 272.9 226.6 - Attributable to shareholders of Ipsen S.A. 272.3 225.9 - Attributable to non-controlling interests 0.6 0.6 Basic earnings per share, continuing operations (in euros) 3.27 2.74 Diluted earnings per share, continuing operations (in euros) 3.25 2.73 Basic earnings per share, discontinued operations (in euros) 0.03 0.00 Diluted earnings per share, discontinued operations (in euros) 0.03 0.00 Basic earnings per share (in euros) 3.30 2.74 Diluted earnings per share (in euros) 3.28 2.73 (1) As part of the effort to implement its new organization, the Group reviewed the presentation of its financial statements and changed the classification of certain items on its income statement, with the view that the new presentation would provide more relevant information to financial statement readers. These reclassifications had no impact on Operating income or Consolidated net profit. The impact of the various reclassifications on the consolidated income statement for the period ended 31 December 2016 is presented in Appendix 2.\nAppendix 2 – Reconciliation of the income statement reported at 31 December 2016 published in 2016 and the restated income statement at 31 December 2016 published in 2017\nAs part of the effort to implement its new organization, the Group reviewed the presentation of its financial statements and changed the classification of certain items on its income statement, with the view that the new presentation would provide more relevant information to financial statement readers.\nIn order to better reflect the substance of the operations related to global medical affairs, the Group has decided starting from 2017 to recognize global medical affairs expenses in “Research and development expenses”. These costs, which amounted to €26.7 million euros in 2016, were previously recognized in “Selling expenses”.\nThe allocation of internal costs within the various functions was revised in the consolidated income statement. As a result, certain support function expenses were reclassified within the income statement, a move deemed by the Group to be more relevant given the activity of the concerned services and the new organization.\nThese reclassifications had no impact on the Operating result and on the Net profit.\nOn 31 December 2017, the Group restated the comparison reporting periods in accordance with IAS 1 Revised.
