Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: julien.ponthus.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net \n“HERE WE ARE IN OFFICIAL CORRECTION TERRITORY” (0650 GMT) \nSometimes you just have to call a spade a spade, and that’s what Rabobank analysts did in their morning note. \n“Here we are in official correction territory”, they wrote, pointing out that with Thursday’s drops, the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow industrials have fallen more than 10 percent from Jan. 26 record highs. \n(Julien Ponthus) \nBAML‘S BULL & BEAR INDICATOR STILL SAYS SELL (0635 GMT) \nBank of America Merrill-Lynch’s indicator of market sentiment is down from 8.6 to 8.5 but that, according to its analysts, remains in “excess bullish” territory and still signals a “sell”. \nThe indicator had jumped of market sentiment jumped from 7.9 to 8.6 on Jan 30, driven up by record inflows to equities and bullish hedge fund risk appetite. \n(Julien Ponthus) \nMORNING CALL: EUROPE TO OPEN IN THE RED AFTER NEW WALL STREET SELL-OFF (0615 GMT) \nGood morning and welcome to Live Markets. \nEuropean bourses are expected to open in the red this morning after Wall Street’s fresh new sell-off. The bottom of the slide remains elusive but this current trend sure seems to be threatening to throw the market’s bull run off course. \nSpreadbetters are calling the DAX 23 points lower, the CAC 40 down 8 points, and the FTSE down 40 points. \nConsidering that U.S. stocks plunged around 4 percent on Thursday, this looks, so far, like a limited reaction from our side of the pond. . \n(Julien Ponthus)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T09:14:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
