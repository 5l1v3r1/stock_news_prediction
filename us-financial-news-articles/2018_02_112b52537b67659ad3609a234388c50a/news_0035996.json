The company was the only faller on Germany’s Dax share index\n“A sobering report missing a trigger to buy for a rebound,” a local trader said, also pointing to fresh remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump about potential steel import tariffs.\nThyssenkrupp’s shares have shed almost 10 percent since the steel venture was announced, compared with a 1 percent drop in the STOXX Europe 600 Industrial Goods and Services index. Rival ArcelorMittal’s shares are up nearly a quarter.\nOnce approved by the boards and regulators, investors expect a flotation of the combined steel business as well as a potential sale of Materials Services, Thyssenkrupp’s materials distribution and trading division.\nSwedish activist investor Cevian, Thyssenkrupp’s second-largest shareholder, has called for a further restructuring of the group, saying Thyssenkrupp’s conglomerate structure was not creating sufficient value.\nElevator Technology, Thyssenkrupp’s most profitable unit, reported a 3 percent rise in first-quarter profits to 220 million euros. Profits at its struggling Industrial Solutions division fell by 71 percent, but Thyssenkrupp said it expected a strong recovery in the second half of the year.\nThyssenkrupp stuck to its full-year outlook for adjusted earnings before interest and tax of 1.8 billion to 2.0 billion euros.\n($1 = 0.8081 euros)\nEditing by Jane Merriman, Edmund Blair and Kirsten Donovan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T08:36:31.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
