I can’t tell you how un-nervous I was.”\nThe victory capped a remarkable comeback for the United States who sputtered through early preliminary-round play with a 2-4 record before rattling off three straight wins to make the playoffs where they beat twice defending Olympic champions Canada in the semi-finals before seeing off the top-ranked Swedes.\nThe only real miscue involving the Americans on Saturday came when officials mistakenly presented them with the women’s gold medals but that error was quickly corrected and switched for the correct ones.\nCurling - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's Final - Sweden v U.S. - Gangneung Curling Center - Gangneung, South Korea - February 24, 2018 - Vice-skip Tyler George of the U.S. and his teammates skip John Shuster, lead John Landsteiner and second Matt Hamilton react after winning the match.
