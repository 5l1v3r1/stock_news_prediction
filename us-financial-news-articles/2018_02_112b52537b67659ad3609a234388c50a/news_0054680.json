It’s not ideal,” the ad said. “Huge apologies to our customers, especially those who travelled out of their way to find we were closed.” \nThe advert continued: “It’s been a hell of a week, but we’re making progress, and every day more and more fresh chicken is being delivered to our restaurants. Thank you for bearing with us.” \nUp until Feb. 13, KFC’s chicken deliveries were managed by Bidvest, a specialist food distribution group. The chicken shortage came after KFC switched suppliers to DHL. \nSocial media has reacted positively to the advert, describing it as “cheeky” and “[the] best apology ever”. \n— Nish Goyal (@nishgoyalmusic) February 23, 2018 \nPublic relations worker Andrew Block took to Twitter to praise the chain’s “masterclass in PR crisis management”.
