We talk about it, we think about it, it’s in our art, it’s in our culture. It’s an authentic part of the human experience,” Mirren said.\n(This story corrects spelling of Miss Havisham in paragraph 3)\nReporting by Rollo Ross for Reuters TV; Editing by Piya Sinha-Roy and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T00:53:24.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
