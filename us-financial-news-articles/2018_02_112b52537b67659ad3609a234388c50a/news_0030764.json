I am still hunting for one of those medals. This is my third games and if I have to keep on going until I am 100 to get a medal I am going to keep doing it.”\nReporting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T10:49:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
