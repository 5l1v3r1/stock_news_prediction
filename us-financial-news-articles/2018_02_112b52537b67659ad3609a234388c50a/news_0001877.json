Total transfers in 2017 were up nearly 7 percent from a record $27.0 billion in 2016.\nThe peso fell nearly 6 percent in December, hurt by a concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and that his U.S. tax reform could undermine investment in Mexico.\nThe peso has bounced back, partly on hopes that the United States, Mexico and Canada would eventually reach a deal to renegotiate NAFTA.\n“Migrants tend to increase the amount when there is a depreciation of the exchange rate,” said Alejandro Cervantes, an economist at Mexican bank Banorte.\n“Migrants with work permits improved their work situation with better salaries, while undocumented workers increased their shipments due to fear of being deported,” Cervantes added.
