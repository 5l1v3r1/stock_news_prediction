Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), due to be held in Jamaica on March 5-8.\nVidegaray’s visit represents the latest development in U.S.-led pressure on Maduro, who retains loyalty from some Caribbean nations that have long benefited from Caracas’ oil largesse and have been unwilling to shun the country in regional diplomatic efforts.\n“It could be,” Johnson Smith said, when asked if Venezuela would be on the agenda with Videgaray. “Hemispherical matters will, of course, be on the agenda.”\n“But the focus is very much on our bilateral cooperation, deepening trade and investment,” she added.\nVidegaray’s trip follows a visit to Latin America and the Caribbean earlier this month by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who announced plans to study how possible oil sanctions against Venezuela could be mitigated in the Caribbean.\nMexico’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA Mexican official told Reuters last week that Videgaray has sought to engage more with the Caribbean in the wake of a June meeting in which foreign ministers from the 34-nation Organization of American States (OAS) failed to reach agreement on a resolution criticizing Venezuela.\nReporting by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T03:52:38.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
