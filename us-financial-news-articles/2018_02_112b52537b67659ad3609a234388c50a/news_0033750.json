The source pointed to Thames Water’s increased capital spending programme, new management team and improved communication.\n“They (investors) are long term believers in the sector and are committed to increasing the capital spend on improving the operational performance, quality and resilience of the framework,” the source said.\nA source at another infrastructure fund said investors were not taking Labour Party proposals seriously at the moment.\n“As it stands, investors dismiss it as unaffordable rhetoric,” the source said.\nReporting by Kirstin Ridley and Dasha Afanasieva; Editing by Adrian Croft and Kirsten Donovan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:43:17.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
