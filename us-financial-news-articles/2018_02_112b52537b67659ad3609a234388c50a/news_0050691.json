The enactment of this legislation resulted in an estimated income tax benefit and net income increase of $204 million, primarily due to a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on a U.S. federal tax rate of 21%, partially offset by the estimated impact of a one-time transition tax on our unremitted foreign earnings totaling $21 million, which we will elect to offset with historical net operating losses.

To supplement our assessment of results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use the measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital, and Adjusted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital, and Adjusted EPS as described below, and used in the tables above, are not intended as a substitute or as an alternative to net income, cash flow provided by operating activities or diluted earnings per share as indicators of our performance or liquidity or any other measures of performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nThe presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital, and Adjusted EPS are intended to enhance the usefulness of our financial information by providing measures which management internally use to assess and evaluate the overall performance of its business and those of possible acquisition candidates, and highlight trends in the overall business.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to provide additional ways of viewing aspects of operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results provide a more complete understanding of our core business. As we define it, Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for additional items subtracted from or added to net income including the effects of impairment losses, gains or losses on sales, dispositions or retirements of assets, adjustments to reflect the Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments, adjustments to exclude significant unusual or non-recurring items that are not directly related to our operating performance plus adjustments to capital type expenses for our service fee facilities in line with our credit agreements. We adjust for these items in our Adjusted EBITDA as our management believes that these items would distort their ability to efficiently view and assess our core operating trends. Going forward, as larger parts of our business will be conducted through unconsolidated entities that we do not control, we will begin to adjust for our proportionate share of the entities depreciation and amortization, interest expense and taxes in order to improve comparability to the Adjusted EBITDA of our wholly owned entities.\nIn order to provide a meaningful basis for comparison, we are providing information with respect to our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended and three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, reconciled for each such period to net income and cash flow provided by operating activities, which are believed to be the most directly comparable measures under GAAP.\nOur projections of the proportional contribution of our interests in the JV to our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not based on GAAP net income/loss or Cash flow provided by operating activities, respectively, and are anticipated to be adjusted to exclude the effects of events or circumstances in 2018 that are not representative or indicative of our results of operations and that are not currently determinable. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such adjusting items, we do not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of projected net income/loss to an Adjusted EBITDA projection.\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash flow provided by operating activities, plus changes in restricted funds - operating, less maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures primarily to maintain our existing facilities. Free Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital is defined as Free Cash Flow excluding changes in working capital.\nWe use the non-GAAP measures of Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital as criteria of liquidity and performance-based components of employee compensation. We use Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital as measures of liquidity to determine amounts we can reinvest in our core businesses, such as amounts available to make acquisitions, invest in construction of new projects, make principal payments on debt, or amounts we can return to our stockholders through dividends and/or stock repurchases.\nIn order to provide a meaningful basis for comparison, we are providing information with respect to our Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow before Changes in Working Capital for the year ended and three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, reconciled for each such period to cash flow provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the most directly comparable measure under GAAP.\nAdjusted EPS\nAdjusted EPS excludes certain income and expense items that are not representative of our ongoing business and operations, which are included in the calculation of Diluted Earnings Per Share in accordance with GAAP. The following items are not all-inclusive, but are examples of reconciling items in prior comparative and future periods. They would include impairment charges, the effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, significant gains or losses from the disposition or restructuring of businesses, gains and losses on assets held for sale, transaction-related costs, income and loss on the extinguishment of debt and other significant items that would not be representative of our ongoing business.\nWe will use the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS to enhance the usefulness of our financial information by providing a measure which management internally uses to assess and evaluate the overall performance and highlight trends in the ongoing business.\nIn order to provide a meaningful basis for comparison, we are providing information with respect to our Adjusted EPS for the year ended and three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, reconciled for each such period to diluted income per share, which is believed to be the most directly comparable measure under GAAP.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this press release may constitute \"forward-looking\" statements as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"PSLRA\") or in releases made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), all as may be amended from time to time.
