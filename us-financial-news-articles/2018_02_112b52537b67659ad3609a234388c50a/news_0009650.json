The news followed warnings late last year that the contract was in trouble. \n“The problem is that Stagecoach got its numbers wrong. It overbid and is now paying a price,” he told lawmakers. \n“It is now clear that this franchise will only be able to continue in its current form for a matter of a very small number of months and no more.” \nGrayling said he would now be seeking a new arrangement to run the railway, which could include the government running it until 2020, or Stagecoach continuing to operate the line on a not-for-profit basis. \nIn the meantime, Grayling said that the line would continue to operate as usual. From 2020, there will be a new long-term plan for the route in place, he added. \nStagecoach’s financial miscalculations had cost it 200 million pounds, the minister said.
