The post was titled “Berlusconi, seven times a traitor to the country.” \nIn an even more provocative move, 5-Star said its supporters would gather outside Berlusconi’s villa near Milan on Friday to read out a 2014 court document which linked the four-times prime minister to the Sicilian Mafia. \nThe document, which spelled out the reasons the court had sentenced Marcello Dell‘Utri, one of Berlusconi’s closest aides, to seven years in prison for mafia association, said Dell‘Utri had paid members of the mafia on Berlusconi’s behalf. \nBerlusconi himself has never been sentenced for mafia-related crimes.
