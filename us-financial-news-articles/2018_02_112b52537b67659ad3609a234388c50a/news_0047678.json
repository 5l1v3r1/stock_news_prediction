Salah has netted 30 goals in 36 matches across all competitions in his debut season at Liverpool, and is the league’s second highest goalscorer with 22 goals to his name, one fewer than Tottenham Hotspur forward Harry Kane. “With the boss here, I play a little bit closer to the goal, more so than at any other club or more than any of my other coaches have asked me to,” Salah told Liverpool’s official matchday programme. ”So I am always in front of the goal to give me the opportunity to score. The manager is always telling me to stay close to the goal in training. “I don’t want to say too much because we still have a long way to go in the season and I don’t want to give too much away. But yes, it’s something we have worked on in the training sessions.” The 25-year-old’s exploits have led Liverpool to third in the league standings and almost guaranteed of a spot in the Champions League quarter-finals after a 5-0 victory over Porto in the first leg of their last-16 tie. The Egyptian has also taken the second highest number of shots in the league with 103 and is eager to be more clinical. “You cannot score 10 goals from 10 balls - that’s impossible and I know that I have missed many chances too this season. But I am trying to improve,” Salah added. ”I am always trying to see my weaknesses and then work on them and I am always trying to score in different ways. “The coaches help me so much to do that and I also work hard alone after the training sessions.” Liverpool host West Ham United in the league on Saturday.
