(\"Kenon\") (NYSE: KEN) (TASE: KEN) announces that its Board of Directors has approved a distribution in an aggregate amount of US$665 million, or US$12.35 per share (the \" Distribution \"), to Kenon's shareholders of record as of the close of trading on March 8, 2018 (the \" Record Date \") on March 22, 2018 (the \" Payment Date \") (the \" Distribution \").\nIn December 2017, Kenon's shareholders approved a capital reduction, contingent upon the approval of the High Court of the Republic of Singapore, to permit a distribution to shareholders of a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of Kenon's Latin American and Caribbean power generation and distribution businesses (the \" Sale \"). The Sale was completed at the end of 2017. The capital reduction of up to $750 million was approved by the High Court of the Republic of Singapore on February 20, 2018, enabling Kenon to effect a distribution of a portion of the proceeds received from the Sale.\nKenon's Board of Directors considered a number of factors in determining the amount of the Distribution, including the amount of proceeds from the Sale remaining after the repayment of debt, the payment of tax and other expenses, and Kenon's anticipated cash needs after the Distribution, and believes that the Distribution is in the best interests of Kenon's shareholders. Following Kenon's payment of the Distribution, Kenon will retain cash in excess of $50 million.\nThe Sale and the Distribution are consistent with our strategy of realizing the value of our businesses for our shareholders.\nAdditional Information about the Distribution\nThe New York Stock Exchange's (the \" NYSE \") ex-dividend date, which is the date on which Kenon's shares will begin trading on the NYSE without the entitlement to the Distribution, is March 7, 2018 (the \" NYSE Ex-Dividend Date \"). The NYSE will manually adjust the price of Kenon's shares on the NYSE Ex-Dividend Date to reflect the completion of the Distribution.\nThe Tel Aviv Stock Exchange's (\" TASE \") ex-dividend date, which is the date on which Kenon's shares will begin trading on the TASE without the entitlement to the Distribution, is March 8, 2018 (the \" TASE Ex-Dividend Date \"). The TASE will manually adjust the price of Kenon's shares on the TASE Ex-Dividend date to reflect the completion of the Distribution.\nWe encourage you to contact your bank, broker, nominee or other institution if you have any questions regarding the mechanics and timing of having the proceeds of the Distribution attributable to your shares credited to your account.\nSingapore tax is not expected to be imposed on Kenon's shareholders in connection with the Distribution. Nevertheless, the Distribution may constitute a taxable event to Kenon's shareholders according to their jurisdiction and the local tax law applicable (including for the purpose of withholding tax in accordance with applicable law and/or regulation), unless a specific exemption is available. Kenon's shareholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the federal, state, and/or any other local tax consequences of the Distribution, including the classification of the Distribution for tax purposes in light of the fact that the Distribution will be made, in whole or in part, by way of a capital reduction, and the potential imposition of withholding taxes in connection with the Distribution.\nAbout Kenon\nKenon is a holding company that operates dynamic, primarily growth-oriented businesses.
