FUNDAMENTALS * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 1.1 percent at $6,905 a tonne at 0236 GMT, extending gains from the previous session, when it ended up 1.1 percent. * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded April copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was up for the first time in three days, climbing 1.5 percent to 52,120 yuan ($8,231.21) a tonne. * U.S. DOLLAR: The dollar index edged down 0.1 percent. A weaker dollar makes metals cheaper for holders of other currencies and can support prices. * SHFE ALUMINIUM: The most traded March ShFE aluminium contract was up 1.1 percent at 14,335 yuan a tonne, having closed at its joint-lowest since January, 2017 on Monday. * ALUMINIUM: U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday to discuss trade matters, as he ponders whether to takes steps to limit steel and aluminium imports seen as damaging to U.S. businesses. * COPPER: Aurubis AG, Europe's biggest copper smelter, is in advanced negotiations to sell its flat rolled products unit to German cooper products company Wieland-Werke AG as Aurubis looks to expand into other metals besides copper. * COBALT: Makers of electric vehicle batteries will have to keep using scarce, expensive cobalt in their products for the foreseeable future despite a push towards higher nickel compositions, materials technology company Umicore said on Monday.
