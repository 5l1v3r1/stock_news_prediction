The film, which carries an estimated $200 million production cost, had been tracking to bring in between an impressive $100 and $120 million when first estimates emerged on Jan. 25. Since then, “Black Panther” has become far more than just a popular tentpole title. Instead, it’s become a must-see event as it veers into record-setting territory. Thursday previews brought in $25.2 million, the largest Thursday night preview gross for a February opener and the second-largest preview gross for a Marvel film. The film has continued to shatter all projections since then. On Sunday, Disney estimated that “Black Panther” would take in $218 million for Presidents Day weekend, then revised that number upward on Monday morning by an astounding $17 million. The movie finished Sunday with a $60.1 million -- the second best Sunday in industry history, just slightly behind 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” record of $60.6 million. With 73% of schools closed, “Black Panther” business should decline 45% from Sunday for a $33 million Monday and $235 million four-day debut. “Black Panther” has also pushed the 2018 year to date domestic gross up 6.9% to $1.65 billion, according to comScore. It is the highest three-day debut ever for a February film and the fifth highest of all time behind only “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” at $248 million, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” at $220 million, “Jurassic World” at $208.8 million and “The Avengers” at $207.4 million. “Black Panther” has demolished the record for the largest President’s Day weekend, blowing past “Deadpool‘s” 2016 mark of $152 million. Overall North American moviegoing for the four-day period should hit an eye-popping $340 million -- far above the $278 million mark in 2016, according to comScore.

Three new films launch next weekend with initial tracking on Feb. 1 showing Warner Bros.’ comedy “Game Night” was projecting an opening in the $15 million to $20 million range on Feb. 23-25, while Paramount’s sci-fi thriller “Annihilation” debuting in the $12 million to $15 million area during the same weekend. Sony’s second weekend of family comedy “Peter Rabbit” is finishing a distant second with about $23 million at 3,725 sites for an 11-day total of $54 million, followed by Universal’s second session of “Fifty Shades Freed” with $19.4 million at 3,768 venues. The finale of the erotic trilogy has taken in $78.6 million domestically so far.

REUTERS/Peter Nicholls Sony’s ninth weekend of its action-comedy “Jumanji: Welcome to Jungle” finished fourth with $10 million at 2,800 venues. The 62-day domestic total has hit $380 million, just behind 2005’s “Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith” for 32nd spot on the all-time list. “Jumanji” declined only 21% from the eighth weekend and its ninth weekend is the ninth highest of all time. Clint Eastwood’s thriller “15:17 to Paris” followed in fifth with $9.1 million at 3,042 locations for an 11-day total of nearly $27 million for Warner Bros. Fox’s ninth weekend of “The Greatest Showman” finished sixth with $6.4 million at 1,936 venues to bring its 64-day domestic take to $156 million. Lionsgate’s stop-motion animation comedy “Early Man” launched quietly in seventh with $4.2 million at 2,494 sites. Fox’s fourth weekend of “Maze Runner: The Death Cure” slid 58% and took in $3.2 million at 1,892 venues in eighth place for a 25-day total of $54.6 million. Lionsgate-CBS Films’ third weekend of Helen Mirren’s “Winchester” came in ninth with $2.6 million at 1,479 sites for an 18-day take of $22.2 million. Fox’s ninth weekend of Steven Spielberg’s “The Post” rounded out the top 10 with $2.5 million at 1,050 venues for a total of $77.1 million. That was enough to edge Pure Flix’s launch of its faith-based Biblical story “Samson” with a modest $2.3 million at 1,249 sites. Fox Searchlight’s 12th weekend of “The Shape of Water” came in 12th place with $2.1 million at 957 locations for an 81-day total of $53.7 million. The Guillermo del Toro fantasy romance scored a leading 13 Academy Award nominations on Jan. 23.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:53:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
