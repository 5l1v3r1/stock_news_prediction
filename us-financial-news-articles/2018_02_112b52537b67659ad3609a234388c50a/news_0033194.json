The gap for the 2018-19 fiscal year beginning in April was projected at C$18.6 billion.\nIn its autumn fiscal update, the government also outlined more stimulus spending on families, including strengthening a child benefit by indexing it to inflation as of July.\nEconomists do not expect much in the way of major new spending in this year’s budget, although the government may have some leeway given the economy’s strong performance in 2017.\nThe budget will also be scrutinized for any forecast of when Ottawa will balance the books again. The long-term fiscal projections released by the Finance Department in December anticipated Canada would run a surplus by 2045.\nTrudeau promised in his election campaign to run modest deficits over three years and to balance the books by fiscal 2019-20. The Liberals do not face an election until 2019.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Grant McCool and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:47:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
