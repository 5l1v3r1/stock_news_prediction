This new capacity will allow mobile companies to offer more reliable reception, and to prepare for future 5G services.”\nThree, which is owned by Hutchison Telecommunications, wanted the cap set at 30 percent rather than the 37 percent set by Ofcom.\nA Three spokesman said the company was disappointed by the ruling, but added the decision to appeal was the right one.\n“First of all this has not caused any delay to the delivery of 5G services to UK consumers which are not expected to rollout until 2019/20, according to Ofcom,” he said.\n“But more importantly, our appeal is about competition in the UK mobile market and spectrum distribution is the single biggest factor in maintaining a competitive market.”\nIt said it still believed a cap set at 37 percent was too high if the objective was to have a competitive four player market and it would like to see it lower in the future.
