There was no comment immediately available from the court.\nAn Insa poll on Monday showed mounting pressure on SPD leader Martin Schulz, with support for the SPD dropping to just 17 percent, well below its election result of 20.5 percent, the party’s worst since Germany became a federal republic in 1949.\nMerkel’s failure to cobble together a new government more than four months after the election has raised concerns among investors and partner countries at a time when Europe is facing multiple challenges - including the need for euro zone reform and Britain’s looming departure from the EU.\nGermany could face a new election or an unprecedented minority government if SPD members reject a coalition deal.\nIn a sign of progress, the parties concluded their talks on Europe on Monday. Schulz said on Twitter the agreement included “more investment, an investment budget for the euro zone and an end of forced austerity!”\nSchulz made no specific mention in his message, however, of any plans to advocate for more powers and responsibilities for the European Stability Mechanism eurozone bailout fund, as was envisaged in a coalition blueprint agreed on Jan. 12.
