It said it already worked with 100 companies in Germany, and a future contract for the Chinook would create additional work for its supply base.\n“We are developing additional partnerships with German industry for the (heavy-lift helicopter) competition and will announce those at the appropriate time,” said Boeing spokeswoman Marcia Costley.\nLockheed’s CH-53K, which includes an on-board diagnostic system, is due to make its international debut at the Berlin air show in April.\nThe U.S. Marine Corps plans to buy 200 of the new CH-53K helicopters at an average price of around $88 million per plane and expects to declare it ready for combat use in 2019.\nGermany hopes to start buying its helicopters in 2023, and Israel and Japan have also expressed interest in the CH-53K.\nExperts say the Boeing Chinook could cost Germany less to buy, but it will require upgrades in coming years that could add costs. It also carries less, so it would take more flights to accomplish the same mission as a CH-53K.\n($1 = 0.8054 euros)\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T19:17:59.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
