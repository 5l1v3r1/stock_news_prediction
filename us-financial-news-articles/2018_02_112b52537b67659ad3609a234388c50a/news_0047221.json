At the time it had 1,600 stores worldwide, 800 of them in the United States. The additional closures are thought to be the result of a disappointing holiday season.\nIn January, the company had promised severance to all of the employees at the affected stores. It has since reversed that promise and will be offering no compensation for store-level employees that are laid off through store closures , although some may be eligible for bonuses based on the performance of liquidation sales.\nA Toys ‘R’ Us representative tells Fortune that The Journal ’s story about the possible store closures is based on pure speculation and that the company’s focus is currently on the reinvention of its business and its emergence from Chapter 11. The representative says that decisions about the company’s future store footprint and organizational structure will be based on the needs of its new business model and that it’s premature to comment on what that will mean for the future of stores at this time.", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-plans-to-close-another-200-stores-1519254948"], "published": "2018-02-23T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T22:28:05.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
