REUTERS/Juan Carlos Ulate/File Photo \nCosta Rica should be compensated by April 2 for damage caused, the cost of environmental restoration, expenses and interest, the court said. \n“The amount is not what we hoped for, but we accept fully and respectfully what the court decided,” Gonzalez said. “Nicaragua has a valuable opportunity to rebuild trust between the two countries and close the chapters that have distanced us in recent years.” FILE PHOTO: Three representatives of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands look for environmental damage on Isla Portillos, a 16-square-km swath of Caribbean wetland at the center of a dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua April 5, 2011. REUTERS/Juan Carlos Ulate/File Photo \nNicaragua’s government called the environmental verdict a “major defeat for Costa Rica” in a statement. It did not comment on the other cases. \nAs part of the border settlement, the court drew a new maritime boundary between the states, who have had rival claims since 2002, when Nicaragua published maps detailing oil concessions. Some of those were in waters claimed by Costa Rica.

Nicaragua said it was dredging a natural waterway.
