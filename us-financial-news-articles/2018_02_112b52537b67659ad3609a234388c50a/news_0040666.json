The report demonstrates this administration’s clear recognition that swift action is required to stop the surge of aluminum imports from destroying our industry. Aluminum is vital to our national security. Today we face a flood of imports—and that will only accelerate without immediate relief. We call on President Trump to act swiftly and boldly to save the American aluminum industry. We look forward to working with the administration to address this crisis.”\nAbout Century Aluminum\nCentury Aluminum Company owns primary aluminum capacity in the United States and Iceland.
