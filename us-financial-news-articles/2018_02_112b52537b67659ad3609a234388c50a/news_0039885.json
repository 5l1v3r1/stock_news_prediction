In the end everyone was telling me ‘okay, it’s going to be okay’, and I was like ‘No way, there’s still three or four guys’.\n“Finally, I had no more emotion and I was flat.”\nMuffat-Jeandet had recovered his emotions sufficiently by the time he spoke to reporters to start enjoying his unlikely triumph.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “In my dreams I always wanted to be a skiing champion, but I didn’t even think about an Olympic medal,” he added with a beaming smile.\n“It seemed such a long way away, the Olympic Games. It’s my first Olympic Games qualification, my first race, and I won a medal.”\nThe two Frenchman won the only two combined events run on the World Cup circuit this year but Pinturault admitted that when it comes to slalom Hirscher is in a league of his own.\n“He’s actually really unbeatable in this discipline this year,” he said.\n”So I knew that it’s going to be difficult, tight, and I had to do my best to make anything.\n“I‘m simply happy. Proud, too, of what Victor and I did, and also for having fought in such a good way to bring home this silver medal.”\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:45:52.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
