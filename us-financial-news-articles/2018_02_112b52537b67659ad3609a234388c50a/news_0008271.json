The streak is now 1,036 games.\nFreshman guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was Kentucky’s only player in double figures with 15 points, the only time this season that has happened.\nMissouri led 28-18 at halftime thanks to the worst half of basketball for Kentucky in a decade.\nThe Wildcats’ 18 points were seven fewer than the 25 against Utah Valley in the season opener and the worst total since 16 against Virginia in 2008.\nKentucky was just 6 of 30 on field goals, including 0 for 10 from 3-point range. The Wildcats went from 16:59 to 8:52 without a field goal and then from 5:59 to the end of the half without zero baskets.\nKentucky’s leading scorer in the half was Jarred Vanderbilt, who missed the first 17 games of the season with a foot injury. It was just his sixth game back, all coming off the bench.\nDespite building the lead, Missouri didn’t fare much better, recording just one field goal the final 6:42 of the first half. The Tigers were 9-of-23, including 2-of-12 from 3-point range.\nKentucky did open the second half with a 14-5 run to close within 33-32 of Missouri, but then the Tigers hit five shots in a row as part of an 8-0 run in less than a minute to push back on top 41-32. Moments later, it was back to 10 points at 44-34.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:41:41.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
