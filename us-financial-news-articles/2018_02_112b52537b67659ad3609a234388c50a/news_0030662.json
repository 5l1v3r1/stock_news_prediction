Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports MIXING HEART WITH ACROBATICS “We are trying to skate as dancers, because they are skating really well, the quality of their skills are perfect,” said Massot, noting that some dance elements are forbidden for pairs.\n“We really try to mix the heart with the acrobatics ... and I think we are in a good way with this, especially in the long program.”\nPyeongchang is the first Olympics where music with lyrics has been allowed and this is one of the biggest changes, moving the discipline forward from the rigidity of classical instrumentals used extensively in the past.\nSongs used in this year’s short program include: “Paint it Black” by Hidden Citizen, “Hallelujah” by Leonard Cohen, “Big Spender” and an inevitable smattering of classics.\nDespite these changes, pairs figures skaters are an endangered species, with competitors discouraged by the high risk-low economic compensation, growing difficulty of the moves and the physical danger, greater than for other disciplines.\n“When you have some guy throwing you, it doesn’t get any more dangerous than that,” James said.\n“The slightest fatigue, you can throw your partner badly and... your body has to be warmed up to perform properly. Like any discipline -- but ours is a little more risky, I think.”\nPairs skaters have suffered occasional serious head injuries and concussions are far from uncommon. They also get cut, sometimes seriously, from each others’ blades.\nAs a result, the number of teams had diminished, James said, although recently a few new partnerships had formed that she hoped would be spurred on by the changes.\nThe differences with previous generations might be summed up by Massot, who has a giant number seven tattooed on his forearm.\n“It’s my lucky number. I put it on only last year,” he grinned. “I think it’s working. I hope it keeps on.”\nReporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T11:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:17:53.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
