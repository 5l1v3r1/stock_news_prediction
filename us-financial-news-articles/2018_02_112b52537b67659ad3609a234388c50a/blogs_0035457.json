The impulse from this spending bill is likely to be even larger for the economy than the tax cuts because the multipliers are significantly larger,\" he told CNBC.\nGetty Images President Donald Trump speaks following a meeting on infrastructure at Trump Tower, August 15, 2017 in New York City. \"This complicates the job for the Fed because it starts to threaten the idea that they can withdraw policy accommodation gradually,\" Lawson warned, a day before Trump signed a massive spending bill into law.\nThat may sound like the familiar \"good news means bad news\" paradox that has rattled markets in previous bouts of Federal Reserve tightening. But this time could be different, as Jeff Rosenberg, BlackRock chief fixed income strategist pointed out.\nSpeaking to CNBC about the bigger-than-expected fiscal spending, Rosenberg said, \"This has to be financed. The supply side is a lot bigger than we've seen happening at a time when the Fed is pulling back so the net impact of supply going up and the Fed support of that going down, means a lot more issuance.\"\nshow chapters There is a risk of an overheated US market 12:04 AM ET Mon, 12 Feb 2018 | 02:22 Republican Senator Rand Paul pointed to the market sell-off last week as evidence of an \"undercurrent of unease\" among investors worried about government debt and inflation. And he may be right, according to Brian Riedl, senior fellow in budget, tax and economics at the Manhattan Institute.\nRiedl, who puts a $500 billion price tag on the bill this year, estimated the U.S. could be looking at deficits of 7 or 8 percent of GDP over the next decade when combining new spending with the tax package.\n\"I think Rand Paul is right to be spooked,\" he told CNBC hours before the spending bill was signed. \"A lot of people should be spooked.\"\nâ€”CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T08:29:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
