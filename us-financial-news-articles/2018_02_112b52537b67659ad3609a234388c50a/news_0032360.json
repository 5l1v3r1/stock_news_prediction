That's because U.S. shale oil extraction requires higher selling prices to break even than production in states like Saudi Arabia.\nThe Paris-based IEA said Tuesday that the current situation is \"reminiscent\" of a wave of U.S. shale growth that preceded the 2014 crash in energy prices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T15:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T11:13:13.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
