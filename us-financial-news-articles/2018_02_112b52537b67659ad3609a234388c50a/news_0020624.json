This raised fears that Canadian companies with U.S. operations could be open to prosecution. \nThe CSA urged marijuana companies to describe their involvement in the U.S. industry and prominently state that the substance is illegal under federal law. It also urged them to “carefully consider” any regulatory actions or changes that would result in changes requiring disclosure obligations. \n“The notice reiterates that different exchanges may make their own judgments in the application of their listing requirements,” said Beacon Securities research analyst Vahan Ajamian in an e-mailed note. “Bottom line: Looks ‘all clear’. These stocks will continue to trade as usual.” \nCanada has a national, regulated medical marijuana industry and plans to legalize pot for recreational use by mid-2018. \nAfter the U.S. move in January, the Canadian Securities Exchange, which hosts most of the country’s marijuana producers with U.S. operations, said it had contacted 17 companies to ask them to provide details about risks related to those businesses. \nAphria Inc, Canada’s third-biggest weed producer, which is listed on the primary exchange, last week agreed to sell its minority stake in U.S.-based Copperstate Farms to Liberty Health Sciences, which is listed on the CSE, for C$20 million Reporting By Nichola Saminather; Editing by David Gregorio", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T23:52:47.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
