The remainder of the estate — intended to be the larger portion — is then directed to a trust for the surviving spouse.\nOleksiy Maksymenko | Getty Images The looming complication: That exemption amount has doubled to about $11 million in 2018 from $5.49 million in 2017.\nIn other words, for a $12 million estate, that generic wording in the will means $11 million would go to the kids' trust and $1 million to the spouse. And that may not be what you intended.\nIf the same person had passed away in 2017 with the same will, $5.49 million (last year's exemption amount) would have gone into the kids' trust and the remaining $6.31 million would have gone into the trust for the spouse.\n\"When some of these documents were written three, five or so years ago, no one anticipated [an annual] change to be this much,\" Dillon said.\nU.S. wealth by the numbers Assets (excluding value of primary residence) Number of people $100k to $1 million 30.5 million $1 million to $5 million 9.4 million $5 million to $25 million 1.26 million $25 million or more 156 thousand Source: Spectrem Group Market Insights 2017 From 2011 through 2017, the estate tax exemption changed slightly year to year due to inflation adjustments. Rather than rewrite wills each year, it often made sense to avoid a specific number and instead include a calculation that instructs the executor to factor in the then-current exemption amount.\n\"If we don't review these documents, it could have the devastating consequence of not leaving anything for our spouse,\" Dillon said.\nThe higher estate-tax exemption amount of about $11 million, which will be adjusted annually for inflation, is in effect for tax years 2018 through 2025 before returning to the lower amount (which also will adjusted for inflation). Amounts in excess of the exemption that do not go to a spouse or charity generally are taxed at 40 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center.\nThis estate-planning strategy — using two trusts to provide for a spouse while using the estate-tax exemption to pass on assets tax-free to children — is common, Dillon said.\n\"It's been the most tax-efficient way to do it,\" he said. \"You take advantage of the exemption, and there's no estate tax on a transfer to the spouse.\"\nshow chapters American Greed: Web Exclusive - \"Estate Planning: Protecting Money\" 11:58 AM ET Fri, 23 Sept 2016 | 01:04 The same potential for a misdirected windfall could also arise in wills that direct the federal exemption amount to go to grandchildren. Generation-skipping transfers come with a federal exemption from taxation that mirrors the estate tax exemption.\n\"If you leave the full exemption amount to grandkids, and the rest goes to your kids … depending on the size of the estate, you could end up leaving all of the money for your grandchildren and none for your children,\" Dillon said.\nWhile estate-planning attorneys are likely reviewing all client documents in light of new tax law, it's worth reaching out to your advisor if you haven't already.\n\"It's incumbent on individuals or family members to reach out to their estate planner to make sure all documents conform with the new tax law and still conform with their wishes,\" Dillon said.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nStrategies for surviving the volatile stock market\nOlder patients recover from surgery faster if they 'train' for it\nGrandkids come with big tax benefits, if you're raising them", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T16:40:45.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
