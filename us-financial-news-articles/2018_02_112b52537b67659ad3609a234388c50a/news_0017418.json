I think the [competition is] any consumer entertainment property and I wouldn't take that competition lightly. But I think 'Red Dead' will stand alone.\" Source: Rockstar Games Rockstar Games announces new game Red Dead Redemption 2. \nYou'd expect a CEO to say something along those lines, but analysts concede there could be something to Zelnick's thinking. \n\"Red Dead Redemption 2\" is an action game set in the Old West, compared with the urban setting of \"GTA,\" which lends itself to different styles of gameplay. And Rockstar has had 8½ years since the last \"Red Dead\" game (and more than four years since \"GTA V\") to rethink the experience. \n\"Rockstar doesn't like to repeat itself,\" said Handler. \"I'm guessing 'Red Dead Redemption Online' will be very different than 'GTA Online,' because they've already made 'GTA Online.' They like to think outside of the box and create an entirely different experience. You can probably toggle back and forth between the two and whichever one you play it will be a unique experience.\" \nWhile excitement is riding high for \"Red Dead Redemption 2\" — so high that an announced delay in its release take knocked Take-Two's stock — it's important to note that the game isn't a juggernaut on the level of \"Grand Theft Auto.\" The last game in the \"Red Dead\" series sold 15 million units. \"GTA V\" has now sold more than 90 million copies. \nAnd, analysts note, the game's Old West setting could work against it. \n\"To the extent that players who are currently playing 'GTA Online' decide to play 'Red Dead Redemption Online,' there will be cannibalization,\" said Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities. \"However, I'm skeptical that a multiplayer western will be as fun as a multiplayer organized crime game, so we'll see.\" \nSome gaming enthusiast sites have suggested the game could feature a battle royale mode, similar to the staggeringly popular \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,\" which has 30 million players on PCs and has sold 3 million copies for the Xbox One. Though Rockstar — and Zelnick — aren't yet discussing details about online modes for \"Red Dead Redemption 2,\" relying on the game maker's track record and a few short teaser videos to create demand. \n\"Our view is if you put something out that's fantastic, consumers will show up for it,\" Zelnick said. \nOf course, it could be that \"Red Dead Redemption Online\" results in a significant increase in overall online players for Take-Two, which is what investors (and the company) are hoping for. \"GTA Online\" has generated more than $500 million in revenue, according to a lawsuit against Take-Two by former Rockstar North President Leslie Benzies. Adding \"Red Dead\" to the mix (and the continued growth of \"GTA Online\") could push it to the next level. \n\"If they keep on delivering fantastic consumer experiences, these two combined could ... do $750 million to $1 billion of gross revenue,\" said Handler.
