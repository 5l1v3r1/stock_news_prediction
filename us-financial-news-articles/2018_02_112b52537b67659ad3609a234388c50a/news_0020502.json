Texas A&M shot 63.3 percent from the floor, connecting on 7 of 11 3-point attempts in the first half. Starks had 16 of his points in the first half, and the Aggies led 46-36 at intermission.\nTexas A&M opened the second half with a 7-0 run, and the lead quickly ballooned to 17.\nAuburn rallied behind Heron, who made six consecutive free throws during a two-minute stretch that trimmed the A&M lead to 65-60 with 10 minutes to go.\nHeron kept getting to the rim for baskets, and Jared Harper added a layup that capped a 9-0 Auburn run and gave the Tigers a 69-67 lead with 7:28 left.\nHarper finished with 13 points and eight assists.\nRobert Williams had 16 points and seven rebounds, and Tyler Davis finished with 15 points and eight rebounds for the Aggies.\nTexas A&M returns home to host No. 24 Kentucky on Saturday.
