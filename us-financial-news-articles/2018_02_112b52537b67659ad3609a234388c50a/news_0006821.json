They are watching you work and they need to see you succeed.”\nTo support job creation, France aimed to double the rate of private sector investment over the five years of Macron’s term, which ends in 2022.\n“A number of companies have already confirmed their willingness to invest,” Macron said, without naming any.\nFrench direct investment in Tunisia was worth 3.3 billion dinars ($1.39 billion) in 2016, making it the second biggest foreign investor behind the United Arab Emirates, according to figures from the French economy ministry.\nMacron had pledged more than 270 million euros ($335 million) in new financing for Tunisia on Wednesday, as he began his two-day state visit.\nIn his speech to parliament, Macron also said France would put all its energy into finding a solution to the conflict in neighboring Libya and would push for elections to be held there by the end of the year.\nWriting by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:15:18.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
