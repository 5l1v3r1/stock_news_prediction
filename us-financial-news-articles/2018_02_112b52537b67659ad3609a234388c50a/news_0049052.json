There will “likely be an extended period of cold and dry weather across much of Europe, with warmer and wetter weather confined to parts of southern Europe,” said Todd Crawford, chief meteorologist with the company. ”This will be the first period of extended North Atlantic blocking in about 5 years, so the change should be quite noticeable, he said. In meteorological terms blocking is when an area of high pressure becomes stationary, which can block, or redirect other weather systems. The Weather Company, owned by IBM , provides weather forecasts aimed at the commodities and energy sectors.
