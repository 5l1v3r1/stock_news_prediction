Non-GAAP net income was $40.0 million, or $0.72 per diluted share.\nIRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Masimo (NASDAQ: MASI) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results:\nFourth quarter total revenue, including royalty and other revenue, increased 22.9% to $225.2 million, up from $183.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Product revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 13.4% to $199.2 million, compared to $175.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company’s worldwide direct product revenue, which accounted for 87.1% of total product revenue, increased by 13.5% to $173.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $152.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. OEM sales, which accounted for 12.9% of total product revenue, increased 12.6% to $25.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $22.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue from sales of Masimo rainbow ® products increased 42.5% to $24.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $16.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $215.3 million, or $3.97 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in the fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share was a non-recurring charge of $43.5 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act) that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share included a non-recurring gain of $270.0 million, or $3.43 per diluted share, related to the Philips Settlement Agreement. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported fourth quarter net income of $40.0 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to net income of $24.6 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company shipped approximately 54,100 SET ® pulse oximeters and rainbow SET ™ Pulse CO-Oximeters ® , excluding handheld and finger oximeters. Masimo estimates its worldwide installed base of oximeters to be 1,591,000 units as of December 30, 2017, up 5.8% from 1,504,000 units as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 30, 2017, total cash and cash equivalents were $315.3 million compared to $306.0 million as of December 31, 2016. During 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $68.3 million.\nJoe Kiani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Masimo, said, “Our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results clearly illustrate the strength of our technology and hence, our business as we once again exceeded expectations for product revenues and earnings. We realized another record high for shipments of our SET® Pulse Oximeters which reached 54,100 for the quarter and exceeded 200,000 for the year, a significant milestone for the Company. We anticipate rising adoption of our technologies as more care providers appreciate the value they provide for patients.”\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe Company provided the following estimates for its full year 2018 guidance:\n2018 Guidance (in millions, except percentages and earnings per share) GAAP Non-GAAP Total revenue, including royalty and other revenue $ 836 $ 836 Product revenue $ 808 $ 808 Royalty and other revenue $ 28 $ 28 Operating margin 24.2 % 24.4 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.90 $ 2.80 EBITDA 26.9 % 29.9 % Estimated tax rate 22.0 % 25.0 % Total revenue, including royalty and other revenue, of $836 million; Product revenue increasing 9% to $808 million compared to $741 million for 2017; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.90, an increase of approximately 23% compared to $2.36 for 2017; and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.80, an increase of approximately 14% compared to $2.45 for 2017.\nSupplementary Non-GAAP Financial Information\nFor additional non-GAAP financial details, please visit the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.masimo.com to access Supplementary Financial Information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude the items described below. Management believes that adjustments for these items assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results or that these items are not indicative of the Company’s on-going core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of the Company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe Company has presented the following non-GAAP measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s core net operating results on an on-going basis: (i) non-GAAP net income, (ii) non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, (iii) non-GAAP gross profit, (iv) non-GAAP operating income and (v) adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of the Company’s core operating results with those of other companies. Management believes non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA are important measures in the evaluation of the Company’s performance and uses these measures to better understand and evaluate our business.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments for the following items, as well as the related income tax effects thereof:\nAcquisition-related costs, including depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization related to the revaluation of assets and liabilities (primarily intangible assets, property, plant and equipment adjustments, inventory revaluation, lease liabilities, etc.) to fair value through purchase accounting related to value created by the seller prior to the acquisition rather than ongoing costs of operating our core business. As a result, we believe that exclusion of these costs in presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides management and investors a more effective means of evaluating historical performance and projected costs and the potential for realizing cost efficiencies within our core business. Depreciation and amortization related to the revaluation of acquisition related assets and liabilities will generally recur in future periods.\nLitigation damages, awards and settlements.\nIn connection with litigation proceedings arising in the course of our business, we have recorded expenses as a defendant in such proceedings in the form of damages, as well as gains as a plaintiff in such proceedings in the form of litigation awards and settlement proceeds; most recently in connection with our November 2016 settlement agreement with Koninklijke Philips N.V. We believe that exclusion of these expenses and gains is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of our ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis. In this regard, we note that these expenses and gains are generally unrelated to our core business and/or infrequent in nature.\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nAccounting Standard Update No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), requires that excess tax benefits or costs recognized on stock-based compensation expense be reflected in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital. Since we cannot control or predict when stock option awards will be exercised or the price at which such awards will be exercised, the impact of ASU 2016-09 can create significant volatility in our effective tax rate from one period to the next. We believe that exclusion of these excess tax benefits or costs is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of our ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis. These excess tax benefits or costs will generally recur in future periods as long as we continue to issue equity awards to our employees.\nTax impacts that may not be representative of the ongoing results of our core operations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law in December 2017, and became effective January 1, 2018. The 2017 Tax Act included a number of changes to existing U.S. federal tax law impacting businesses including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time transition tax on the “deemed repatriation” of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 and changes in the prospective taxation of the foreign operations of U.S. multinational companies. We believe that exclusion of the tax charges related to the 2017 Tax Act is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of our ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis. In this regard, we note that this tax charge is unrelated to our core business and non-recurring in nature.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Actuals versus Fourth Quarter 2016 Actuals:\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE\nThree Months Ended December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in thousands, except earnings per share) $ Per Diluted Share $ Per Diluted Share GAAP net income $ 367 $ 0.01 $ 215,293 $ 3.97 Non-GAAP adjustments: Acquisition related depreciation and amortization 390 — 434 0.01 Litigation damages, awards and settlements — — (270,000 ) (4.98 ) Tax impact of above item 1 (88 ) — 84,096 1.55 Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation (4,149 ) (0.07 ) (5,263 ) (0.10 ) Tax impact of U.S. Tax Reform 2 43,483 0.78 — — Total non-GAAP adjustments 39,636 0.71 (190,733 ) (3.52 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 40,003 $ 0.72 $ 24,560 $ 0.45 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 55,595 54,166 1\nThe impact results from tax effecting the pre-tax adjustments above at the effective statutory rate, taking into account any discrete items applicable to the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments. 2\nThe 2017 Tax Act resulted in an unfavorable charge of $43.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Our mission is to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care by taking noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications. In 1995, the Company debuted Masimo SET ® Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion ® pulse oximetry, which has been shown in multiple studies to significantly reduce false alarms and accurately monitor for true alarms. Masimo SET ® is estimated to be used on more than 100 million patients in leading hospitals and other healthcare settings around the world. In 2005, Masimo introduced rainbow ® Pulse CO-Oximetry technology, allowing noninvasive and continuous monitoring of blood constituents that previously could only be measured invasively, including total hemoglobin (SpHb ® ), oxygen content (SpOC), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO ® ), methemoglobin (SpMet ® ), Pleth Variability Index (PVi ® ) and more recently, Oxygen Reserve Index (ORi ™ ), in addition to SpO2, pulse rate and perfusion index (PI). In 2014, Masimo introduced Root ™ , an intuitive patient monitoring and connectivity platform with the Masimo Open Connect ® (MOC-9 ® ) interface. Masimo is also taking an active leadership role in mobile health applications (mHealth) with products such as the Radius-7 ® wearable patient monitor and the MightySat ™ fingertip pulse oximeter.
