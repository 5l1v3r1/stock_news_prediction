He made 11 of 17 field-goal attempts and 11 of 17 free throws.\nStanford made 27 foul shots in the game in 47 attempts. Washington went 12-for-20 at the line.\nTravis also found time for a team-high nine rebounds.\nPickens had 20 points, Michael Humphrey 15 and Oscar da Silva 14 for the Cardinal. Stanford shot 52.6 percent from the field and connected on 7 of 17 3-points attempts (41.2 percent) en route to its third straight home win.\nStanford’s Daejon Davis, who did not attempt a shot from the floor, was the night’s leader in assists with nine.\nJaylen Nowell had 18 points and a team-high five assists to lead Washington, which missed all eight of the 3-point shots it attempted in the first half. The Huskies finished 6-for-26 (23.1 percent) from beyond the arc.\nNahziah Carter had 17 points, Matisse Thybulle 10 and Noah Dickerson 14 to go with a game-high 13 rebounds for the Huskies, who took their third straight road defeat.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:04:31.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
