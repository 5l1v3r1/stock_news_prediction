The jet has already received U.S. and European certifications, in 2015 and 2016, respectively. \nThe company applied for certification from China’s aviation regulator in August last year and predicted it would need 18 months to obtain approval. \n“But it seems to me that the timeframe might be much better than 18 months,” Chief Executive Michimasa Fujino said. \n“We are expecting around the end of this year,” Fujino, who is also the chief engineer of the six-seater light business jet, said on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow. \nHe sees strong potential demand in the country and Asia for its light plane as more rich young people opt for personal jets, a space currently dominated by larger planes in China. \n“Generally aviation manufacturers do not disclose the exact number of prediction, but many third-party statistics show that there will be (demand for) 700-800 units in next ten years (in China and Asia),” he said. \nWhile tight government controls over China’s airspace, which analysts say have hurt growth of the private jet market, remained a concern, CEO Fujino said he was optimistic regulations would gradually ease. \nHondaJet has already partnered with Guangzhou-based Honsan General Aviation to provide sales services in China, Hong Kong and Macau. It has also opened a new sales outlet at China’s Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in December. \nHondaJet currently has 15 dealers globally, including in Bangkok through which it serves the Southeast Asian market. \nFujino said he sees demand for HondaJet in India and the Middle East, but added the firm was considering its plans there. \nHe declined to comment on recent media reports that the firm was planning to introduce new models, but said the HondaJet could, from an engineering standpoint, be stretched.
