Those promised increases were central to winning the support of Democrats for the deal, which also included large defense spending increases.\nMulvaney, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, squarely backs the $165 billion defense increase contemplated for fiscal 2018 and 2019. But he and many conservatives in Congress were indignant over the $131 billion non-defense component of the deal.\nIn a Fox News interview on Sunday, Mulvaney said: “These are spending caps ... they are not spending floors. You don’t have to spend all that.”\nThe deal, which Trump signed into law, was painstakingly negotiated over several months by Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate and the House.\nTrump and the Republicans demanded significant increases in defense spending. Democrats refused to go along without higher spending for non-defense programs as well, ranging from healthcare to infrastructure.\nWithout both, there would have been no agreement to break a long deadlock. Even so, some lawmakers balked at the large deficit spending needed to pay for the deal.\nCongress now has a March 23 deadline for executing the deal to fund thousands of federal programs through Sept. 30, the end of fiscal 2018.\nWhen the deal was approved last week, lawmakers hoped it would end partisan standoffs that led to a three-day government shutdown in January and hours-long one earlier this month.\nBut with Mulvaney signaling that the administration may be backing away from the pact, the outlook was unclear.\nDemocrats, whose votes will be needed to pass upcoming appropriations bills, would not likely support shortchanging non-defense programs while allowing a big military buildup.
