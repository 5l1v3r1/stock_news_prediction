In its fourth-quarter earnings report last month , Boeing said it expects to set another record this year, estimating it will deliver 810 to 815 commercial aircraft in 2018.\nIn the most recent quarter, Boeing saw each of its three businesses increase its orders further, bring the value of the company's total orders backlog to $488 billion.\nThe aerospace market as a whole \"has changed,\" according to Muilenburg. He said the industry has gone \"from being a high-cycle business in the past\" to now becoming \"a long-term sustained growth business.\"\nThe higher stock price may reflect that Wall Street is now recognizing the shift and is changing both its \"attitude and perspective,\" he said. \nCompanies that produce more sustained earnings growth often fetch higher stock valuations than those with earnings growth that fluctuates with the ups and downs of an economic cycle. \nBoeing's stock has risen more than 109 percent as of Wednesday's close, and has added nearly 18 percent just this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T18:08:25.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
