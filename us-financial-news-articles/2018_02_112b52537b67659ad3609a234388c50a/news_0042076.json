A government spokesman later said in a The Wall Street Journal report that Jung, 52, “died from some unknown cause.” \nHis colleagues also raised the possibility that stress — following increased pressure from crypto-related duties — led to Jung’s death, Yonhap reported. Jung was in charge of coordinating the opinions of various South Korean ministries and offices in preparation for weekly meetings led by Hong Nam-ki, minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, the news agency said.

However, officials have dialed back comments that they might shut down cryptocurrency exchanges, where high demand often causes the cryptocurrencies to trade at higher prices than at other major global exchanges. \nOn Tuesday, Yonhap reported that Choe Heung-sik, governor of South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service, said in a meeting with representatives of cryptocurrency exchanges that the government will support cryptocurrency trading if “normal transactions” are made. \nBitcoin traded about 3 percent higher Tuesday morning New York time near $11,500, according to CoinDesk’s bitcoin price index. About 5.8 percent of trading volume in the cryptocurrency was in South Korean won, according to CryptoCompare.
