ConocoPhillips Canada, ExxonMobil Canada and the Aboriginal Pipeline Group were the other participants in the venture. \nAccording to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, Imperial earned 51 Canadian cents per share, excluding items, while analysts on average had expected a profit of 68 Canadian cents. \nThe company’s production in the quarter remained unchanged at 399,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day from a year earlier. \nExxon on Friday posted a rare quarterly earnings miss.
