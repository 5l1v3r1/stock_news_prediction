FedEx did not experience problems that year.\nSince getting peak season right in 2015, executives have said repeatedly UPS is deepening cooperation with major customers to improve visibility on orders and better manage network bulges.\nThe company has also invested heavily to handle ecommerce packages, while trying to figure out ways to cut the higher costs associated with delivering packages to residential addresses versus businesses. It has also raised shipping rates and added peak-season surcharges. [nL2N1N026T]\nAbney said UPS will expand the number of customers it receives package volume forecasts from.\n“The area that we’ve got to focus on of course for this year is cyber week, and we already announced changes in the surcharges that we think we will help that for 2018,” he said. “We’re going to continue to discuss other ways we can send that message across.”\nEarlier Thursday, UPS reported a quarterly net profit that was boosted by growth in deliveries in the U.S. and abroad and benefits from changes to U.S. tax law, though its capital spending and the 2018 earnings outlook overshadowed its results.
