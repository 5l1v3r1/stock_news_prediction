Total domestic debt stood at 15.68 trillion naira by September.\nThe West African country wants to switch its borrowing mix so that foreign loans account for up to 40 percent of its total debt portfolio by 2019, from about 25 percent, to lower its funding costs and lengthen the repayment period, the DMO said.\nNigeria has reappointed the banks that handled its last Eurobond sale - Citigroup, Stanbic IBTC Bank and Standard Chartered Bank - for the new bond sale.
