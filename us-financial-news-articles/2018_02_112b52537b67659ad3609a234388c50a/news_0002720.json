REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo The “Joanne” tour, named after the singer’s rock-style album released in 2016, was promoted by Live Nation Entertainment Inc. She began the tour on Aug. 1 in Vancouver, Canada, the first of more than 40 shows across North America.\nIn September, Lady Gaga said that due to severe pain, she had to postpone the tour’s European leg, which had originally been scheduled to start on Sept. 21 in Barcelona, Spain.\nAt the time, she posted photos online of herself in a hospital with a drip in her arm.\nThose European shows were rescheduled to early this year.\nOn Jan. 14, Lady Gaga performed in Barcelona and went on to Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. Her most recent concert was on Thursday evening in Birmingham, England.\nLady Gaga ranked 14th on music industry trade publication Pollstar’s list of top-grossing concert tours of 2017, with sales of nearly $86 million from her shows in North America.\nThe singer was hospitalized in 2013 for a hip injury, and a documentary, “Lady Gaga: Five Foot Two,” revealed her struggles with chronic pain.\nReporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T17:14:20.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
