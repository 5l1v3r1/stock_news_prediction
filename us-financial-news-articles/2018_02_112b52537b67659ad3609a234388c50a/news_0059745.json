These forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s historical performance and its plans, estimates and expectations as of Feb. 26, 2018. The words “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “plans,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees that the future results, plans, intentions or expectations expressed or implied by the Company will be achieved. Matters subject to forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including economic, legislative, regulatory, competitive and other factors, which may cause levels of assets serviced, actual financial or operating results, levels of activity, or the timing of events, to be materially different than those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. In particular, the Company can provide no assurance that the assets reported as serviced by financial advisors and/or firms mentioned in this press release will translate into assets continuously serviced at LPL Financial or that such financial advisors and/or firms will remain at LPL Financial. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include: the choice by one or any of the clients of the Company's newly recruited financial advisors and/or firms mentioned in this press release not to maintain brokerage and/or advisory accounts at LPL Financial; discovery of errors made in the calculation of assets serviced reported by the newly recruited advisors; changes in general economic and financial market conditions, including retail investor sentiment; fluctuations in the value of assets under custody; effects of competition in the financial services industry; and the other factors set forth in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent SEC filing. Except as required by law, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this press release, even if its estimates change, and you should not rely on those statements as representing the Company’s views as of any date subsequent to Feb. 26, 2018.\nMedia Contact:\nLauren Hoyt-Williams\n980-321-1232\nLauren.Hoyt-Williams@lpl.com\nSource:LPL Financial Holdings, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8YViT-l25w-gc-snizNef-vBB5jP3IL5lu7EGMWv2yaoOnzvWFMKudfhzWwzXMh_GaA7D0AgYsOXOjrJJ5VTPw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8cBd6PsIAk-6B22HJtONBRi2Kob8MjRCduW0apupal6YwJkI7DWAF672NtCcFl4Cb_IKSfB_qq8UiV4jp-TXUWQsju4eWUM-U9wYMcwLsvRmdYdm4rkxuHFoFKQvSNBs", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/lpl-financial", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3oiOO0K4kWJXxnMOkiPRsL_DSzMeodMPHkCPx-FRHza1QnygQylJVEo_bG2KkyfYT4i_8Ycz5IN4Y0XAOR8knUkA4zS-Bb6W43rf_qMu5NY=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BAr2hIXve1tUjq1d4WnWFNmsoZlSHqZ_AkkPn02SHY7Pn2OJ8jGxGvTr9ctbojj31Aj57W5_hmS9M1lZwfW01TT1SY3I0aVpn3F_qfFH3x8eJ7BaR890mbonHMukPRIEYMxJljTf6S-YmjMT1Csh07Kc-yZ73fX7oKo0oFOoElTRnBLJcu91fx9pjSQdTlDjZwVM4DRR5FzaKWL9pf5xGIPUNyVH7_V-aSE05xkQYM0=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3oiOO0K4kWJXxnMOkiPRsOgcKvkhBn_LeIPrA_54gcGlgUvCJhpfTAccOJUGS2n_tnh9UUsUM2kHVAEdxljLzmArPndtC1cT3BVVFCJcBPR1StWhAYXlpBjIJFGnT2DXhp9i7dA6VEoV9dnndMDmNqGywpwGTWk1GiTKOafoBiM=", "https://www.facebook.com/LPLFinancialLLC", "https://twitter.com/lpl", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CqlA-yo19W80S8BpopwtxVnmj-Wx3_5x25Yim9MGmoznKPBjRJxJnLM-IHFuMq58oMBNWV8Hs9bpNnAtrOc4mA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3oiOO0K4kWJXxnMOkiPRsCnd21a8P_pLrz-WHkS9AfKCbisCibrkXtsCVsi6DEVQkoyOtxMH4I1lGARfe9TfNSrM1tmoZa1uUXiYxujHWvYhUoahrnioAyoY5V4LW0Tf2_7SRu6xcniZVDYrHmoGdw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/53e1e8c9-85a6-4959-822d-a2cead7e0840", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3oiOO0K4kWJXxnMOkiPRsPn7jJ6VeqyxWjHpTdasgwdraNQ7rDkjvTLiWm1LgAjsbUyYuCL4ikiXm-QizPhlVYNJyYtT0q08B_XqycIynO2Ra7755cJVlK0Q2R2MJq7Lp7Mbe8Ui4_-tBlojTylRag==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CqlA-yo19W80S8BpopwtxTQTOkXx4QqHVRuw_lr8ZrwODn6k1bDOUzuz_XdU0OcUuD3s85kSQG6frsBxgBfIUg==", "https://www.youtube.com/user/lplfinancialllc"], "published": "2018-02-26T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:36:52.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
