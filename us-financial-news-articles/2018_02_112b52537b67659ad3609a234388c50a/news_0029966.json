Data for earlier periods was not immediately available.\nAnd ownership by hedge funds of Dryships Inc, which is active in dry bulk, tanker and offshore shipping markets, meanwhile, rose to 80 percent, from 10.3 percent.\nHedge funds had invested $308 million in Kirby Corp, $26 million in Nordic American Tanker and $9 million in Dryships.\nDry bulk firm Golden Ocean and oil transporter Teekay Tankers were also popular as well as Ship Finance International, which has a diversified fleet, the data showed.\nFunds had also invested $35 million to their holdings of Golden Ocean and $77 million in Ship Finance International.\nGreywolf Capital Management, which initially invested in Tanker Investment before it merged with Teekay Tankers, is now among the hedge funds holding a combined $39 million in Teekay stock, and is bullish for the sector’s prospects.\n“We’re starting to see fundamental improvement in many shipping markets with rates moving up, not because of temporary events, but rather as a result of a true balancing of supply and demand,” a spokesman for Greywolf said.\n”With global growth accelerating, this an industry we continue to focus on and that should deliver highly attractive returns in the coming years.”\nA spokesman for Blue Mountain declined to comment.\nSome hedge funds have started moving into liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker stocks, investing $4 million in Dynagas LNG Partners, and $62 million in Golar LNG Partners after pulling back from the sector in the preceding three months.\nAlthough other investors pulled back from LNG stocks, a pick up in transport demand has helped the outlook for vessel owners in the LNG sector.\nediting by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T14:54:29.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
