It has not been charged with anything by the U.S. authorities.\nThe EIB said it would need to wait for the outcome of official investigations before deciding whether Daimler should repay the loans, the newspaper said.\nA Daimler spokesman told Reuters it had received a request for information from the EIB and was cooperating with the bank.\nVolkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) was found in 2015 to have illegally installed software “defeat devices” to dupe U.S. regulatory tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history. It settled the principal U.S. cases for $25 billion the following year, although a host of others are still pending.\nThe Daimler spokesman declined to comment on the amount of outstanding loans from the EIB, while the bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSince 2009, the EIB has granted more than 8 billion euros ($10 billion) in preferential loans to back development of vehicles with lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by carmakers, including VW.\nIn France, the bank has asked investigators to find out whether 800 million euros of EU-backed loans to French carmaker Renault ( RENA.PA ) could have been used to develop test-cheating diesel engines, according to documents seen by Reuters.\nReporting by Georgina Prodhan; editing by Clelia Oziel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T01:47:08.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
