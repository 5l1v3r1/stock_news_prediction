However, our key problem are limited investment opportunities at home,” said Grbavac, who is also chairman of the Raiffeisen pension fund.\nAt the moment the funds invest most of their assets in Croatian debt, and just above 10 percent in foreign investment instruments.\n“Our exposure to foreign assets may further rise a bit, but the majority of investments must be focused locally and that is why we would like to see a capital market expansion through new, fast-growing firms, notably those in the IT business and oriented towards international markets,” Grbavac said.\n“At this moment the most dynamic sector is tourism, but we also eye new opportunities in the energy sector and transport infrastructure,” Grbavac said.\nAround a year ago the government floated the idea of listing 25 percent of the state power board HEP, but no concrete steps or plans have been put forward.\n$1 = 6.0339 kuna Reporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:13:03.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
