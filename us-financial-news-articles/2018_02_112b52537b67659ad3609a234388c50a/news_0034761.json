We think this technology has the potential to dramatically change the food processing industry, and we are fortunate that Chris and Colleen Carroll, who are the owners and founders of Flavorseal, chose M&Q to be their partner to accelerate this transformation.”\nChris Carroll, President and CEO of Flavorseal, agreed, “I’m extremely proud of Flavorseal’s long history of developing cutting-edge packaging products like Seasoning Transfer Technology.
