(Panjiva) , a privately-held company that provides deep, differentiated, sector-relevant insights on global supply chains, leveraging data science and technology to make sense of large, unstructured datasets.\nThe terms of the transaction, which is expected to close in the coming weeks, were not disclosed.\n\"Panjiva is an exciting acquisition for our division given their core strength in leveraging machine intelligence to combine 1 billion transaction records into a proprietary supply chain graph,\" noted Mike Chinn, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence and Executive Vice President of Technology and Innovation at S&P Global . \"Their highly skilled and innovative leadership team and employees will help strengthen the insights, products and data that we provide to our clients throughout the world.\"\n\"Together with our customers, the Panjiva team has developed novel ways to generate value from global supply chain data. In the years ahead, we are committed to ensuring that both Panjiva and S&P Global customers receive unrivaled insight into global supply chains,\" commented Josh Green, Chief Executive Officer of Panjiva, who co-founded the company with Chief Technology Officer James Psota . \"As part of S&P Global Market Intelligence, we are confident that we can fulfill our ambitious goal of bringing transparency to global supply chains and are excited to continue to leverage technology to make sense of the rapidly expanding universe of unstructured data.\"\nPanjiva provides clients with macro data covering 95% of global trade flows, as well as transactional data covering 35% of global trade flows. The company tracks supply data from retailers, exporters and shippers across a myriad industries and commodities.\nThe acquisition of Panjiva is expected to be profitable in 2019 (excluding integration costs). Given the transaction's modest size, S&P Global does not expect a material impact to its adjusted earnings per share in 2018. The return on invested capital (ROIC) is expected to exceed the Company's required rate of return (hurdle rate) shortly after the integration period.\nForward-Looking Statements: This press release contains \"forward-looking statements,\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
