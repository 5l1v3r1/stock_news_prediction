It said Pakistan had given no commitment to take any action.\nThe attacks came at a time of heightened tension in the region, after the United States said it would cut security aid to Pakistan, complaining the South Asian nation was not doing enough to fight terrorist groups sheltering there.\nReporting by Hamid Shalizi; Writing by James Mackenzie; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:23:09.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
