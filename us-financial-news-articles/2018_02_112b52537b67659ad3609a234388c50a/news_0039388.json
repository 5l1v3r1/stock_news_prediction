REUTERS/Mike Segar Holdener, who has never won a World Cup slalom race, is hoping to add to her medal count.\n“This gives me confidence for the next races – I’ve got the combined and the team event and the pressure will not be as high as today,” she said.\n“It was a good experience because I hope in the future to have more occasions where I am standing there as leader from the first run.”\nThe bronze medal was a major surprise with 20-year-old Austrian Katharina Gallhuber, ranked 10th in the World Cup slalom standings, finishing above strong favorite Shiffrin,\n“I can’t believe it. I am speechless. I did not expect it. I have not been on the podium before. It feels like a dream, I hope it’s real. I have no words for this moment” Gallhuber said\n“My second run was really good. I stood on the start and thought ‘All in’ because I was really far behind.”\nReporting by Simon Evans, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:46:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
