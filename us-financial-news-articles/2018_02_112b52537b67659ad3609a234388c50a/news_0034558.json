Under his stewardship, the USHCC has grown into one of the nation's most influential advocacy groups for Hispanics and American small business. Nonetheless, after much deliberation and careful consideration for the future of the USHCC, Mr. Palomarez and the board of directors have mutually agreed to undergo a leadership transition for the organization effective immediately. A Governance Committee has been appointed to oversee leadership changes.\nAn interim Chief Operating Officer will be named to lead the transition along with the Board of Directors and chamber staff to ensure a seamless transition, including uninterrupted support and promotion of its members.\n\"I am extremely proud of my 9 year tenure as the President & CEO of the USHCC,\" said Mr. Palomarez. \"I will always value what we, as a team, have accomplished for America's 4.4 million Hispanic-owned businesses and corporations. I know that representing those individuals is a mission too important for distractions and internal division, and so I look forward to working with the Board and staff over the coming weeks to put in place a leadership team that can inspire more in our community to build businesses and achieve the American dream,\" he said.\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\nCarmen Castillo\nJoseph DeLeon\nFernand Fernandez\nRegina Heyward\nJuan Carlos Liscano\nJose Mas\nBetty Manetta\nMonika Mantilla\nJoe Mella\nAlice Rodriguez\nAleida Rios\nDon Salazar\nRosa Santana\nPeter Villegas\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-from-the-board-of-directors-of-the-us-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce-300598356.html\nSOURCE United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-from-the-board-of-directors-of-the-us-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce-300598356.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T05:01:05.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
