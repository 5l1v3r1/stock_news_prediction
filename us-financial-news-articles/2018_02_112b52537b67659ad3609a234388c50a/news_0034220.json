Training begins on Saturday with the opening heats on Tuesday.\n“Fact is that I have not abandoned the team but have chosen not to continue due to the unacceptable conditions offered by the federation without any explanation and which would have forced me to sacrifice my reputation and my professionalism,” Kiriasis said.\n(This story has been refiled to fix typo in headline)\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T03:39:14.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
