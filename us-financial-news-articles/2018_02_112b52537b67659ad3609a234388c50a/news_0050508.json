Línea de Ayuda will feature four 90-second spots with Angélica Vale, a Mexican American actress and singer known as \"Mexico's Sweetheart\". Ms. Vale covers critical information during these segments with Dr. Ralph Caraballo, CDC Chief Epidemiologist, about smoking-related illnesses, health benefits from quitting, and accessing free help to quit. Each segment directs callers to the Spanish-language Quitline, 1-855-DÉJELO-YA (1-800-QUIT-NOW), for support.\nThe Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition is promoting the Línea de Ayuda television events as a Lead Agency of the Nuestras Voces (Our Voices) Network, which works to reduce tobacco use and cancer incidence in Hispanic communities. Activities to support CDC's efforts include bilingual social media and individual cessation support through the National Alliance for Hispanic Health's (the Alliance) Su Familia Helpline.\n\"The information provided through the Línea de Ayuda campaign gives the tools and encouragement to smokers to make the decision to quit and others not to start. We are proud to support these efforts, including through the Alliance's Su Familia Helpline at 1-866-783-2645 where callers can get information in Spanish and English on quitting smoking, talking to a loved one about smoking, or connecting to health services in their communities,\" emphasized Mrs. Sciammarella.\nAbout Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition.
