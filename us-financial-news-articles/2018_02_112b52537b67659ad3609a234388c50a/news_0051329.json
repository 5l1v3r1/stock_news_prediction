Three rate rises are now almost fully priced in for this year, compared to two as recently as December.\n“Participants saw a more favourable outlook as supporting gradual rate hikes,” noted Barclays analyst Michael Gapen.\n“Since then, more stimulus has arrived and there is some tentative, though not conclusive, evidence of stronger wage and inflation data,” he added. “We continue to expect four rate hikes in 2018 and 2019.”\nTHE THREE PCT BARRIER That risk was not welcome in the Treasury market, where yields on 10-year notes touched their highest in four years, and those on two-year paper the highest in nine.\nYields on 10-year debt were last trading at 2.94 percent and creeping ever closer to 3 percent - a huge psychological milestone for bulls and bears alike.\nFor once, the lift in yields seemed to benefit the U.S. dollar which edged up to 90.123 against a basket of currencies after having rallied 0.3 percent overnight.\nThe euro slipped to $1.2274, from a $1.2359 top on Wednesday and looked in danger of testing its February trough at $1.2204.\nThe next hurdle will be minutes from the European Central Bank’s last meeting with markets wary in case there is more talk of an eventual winding back on stimulus.\nThe dollar fared less well on the yen as the Japanese currency caught a safe-haven bid, falling back to 107.32 from an early 107.68.\nThe euro skidded to its lowest on the yen in three months at 131.57 and risked cracking major support at its 200-day moving average of 131.12.\nHigher bond yields were a deadweight on gold, which pays no return, and left the metal stuck at $1,323.88 an ounce.\nIn oil markets, U.S. crude futures fell 61 cents to $61.06 a barrel, while Brent lost 48 cents to trade at $64.94.\nReporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Eric Meijer and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:32:20.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
