They know well about the power of the digital ecosystem, and Go-Jek has built it in Indonesia, like Google in the U.S. and WeChat in China,” Wang said.\nGo-Jek told Reuters that some investments that came in this year were part of the funding round that kicked off last year but it declined to comment on the amount raised or the names of investors.\nIt said the funding was aimed at developing technology for micro, small and medium enterprises in Indonesia.\nGo-Jek delivers everything from meals and groceries to cleaners, masseuses and hairdressers across Indonesia’s capital city Jakarta, all at the touch of a smartphone app - helping it become a crucial workaround in a city with some of the worst traffic in the world.\nSources said BlackRock and Temasek are investing about $100 million each in Go-Jek’s latest fundraising.\nBlackRock declined to comment. A Temasek spokesman confirmed participation in the fundraising but declined to say how much it had invested.\nThis month, Indonesian conglomerate Astra International said it will invest $150 million in Go-Jek, while sources said Djarum Group’s PT Global Digital Niaga is putting in $100 million.\nGo-Jek’s payment system, known as Go-Pay, has emerged as one of the most popular mobile payment platforms in Indonesia. Grab, which bought Indonesian payment service Kudo last year, also sees its future in mobile payments as much as in transport.\nGo-Jek is expanding in other Indonesian cities and has said it plans to start operations in the Philippines this year, followed by other Southeast Asian countries.\nReporting by Anshuman Daga; Additional reporting by Cindy Silviana in JAKARTAEditing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T13:01:36.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
