He told Reuters last year about the wooden crutches that he left North Korea with in 2006. \nThis is an edited translation of his story: \n”I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coal from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. \nI had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn’t have them, I wouldn’t have made it here. The state doesn’t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made so they’re not perfect and break easily. \nI had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. Wooden crutches of North Korean defector Ji Seong-ho which he used when he defected, are seen in Seoul, South Korea, August 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-ji \nI would steal coals from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they’d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside. \nWhen I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. North Korean defector Ji Seong-ho, 35, poses for a photograph leaning on the crutches he used when he defected, in Seoul, South Korea, August 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-ji \nSouth Korea’s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. \nBut I couldn’t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. \nThere is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn’t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories.” Translated and written by Heekyong Yang and James Pearson Edited by Sara Ledwith", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:09:02.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
