Duterte said on Friday that suspension would remain indefinitely.\nKuwait’s Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled al-Jarallah expressed “surprise and sorrow” at Duterte’s remarks in January, saying that legal proceedings had been taken in the cases of the four suicide cases mentioned by the president.\nMore than 250,000 Filipinos work in Kuwait, the Philippine foreign ministry estimates, most as domestic helpers. There are also large numbers in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\nThe government would help repatriated workers look for jobs, Bello said.\n“We are into a re-integration program, we have a program in place for them,” he told the ANC news channel. “They will be given a livelihood.”\n“We are now in the process of looking for alternative markets. One of them is China and even Russia,” he said, without elaborating.\nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T17:23:44.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
