NO FRENCH FLAG \nWhile the French tricolor flies over official buildings throughout France, it was not to be seen in Talamoni’s office, or on the front of the town hall in Granace, a tiny village of ancient stone houses in southern Corsica. \nInstead, mayor Jean-Yves Leandri proudly displayed the black-and-white flag with a Moor’s head that symbolizes Corsica. \nRather than the tricolor sash French elected officials wear for ceremonial duties, Leandri conducts weddings with one he had specially made, again adorned with a Moor’s head. He never went to pick up the portrait of Macron that should be hanging on his wall. \n“We took away the French flag, it’s got nothing to do here, it’s Corsica,” the 54-year-old mayor said.

REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier \nLeandri, a nationalist since his early 20s, is not the first in his family to be elected mayor of the village of about 100 souls. But he is the first nationalist. \nNationalist groups had staged thousands of attacks over four decades before laying down their weapons in 2014, and it took a long time to convince voters to back nationalist politicians, Leandri said. \n“People used to be afraid of us,” he said. He managed to convince people to vote for him only when the violence stopped. \n“Now we need to work, and work more than the others, to build a country,” he said. AUTONOMY OR INDEPENDENCE? Slideshow (11 Images) \nIn a sign of how widespread demands for autonomy have become in Corsica, Jean-Andre Miniconi, a local business leader, said authorities on the island needed more powers to boost its economy and deal with specific problems such as higher transport costs and a shortage of affordable housing. \nEven the conservative mayor of Ajaccio, Laurent Marcangeli, said he favored giving the Corsican language official status alongside French, and wanted special status for the island in the French constitution. \nBut where they differ with nationalists, and where even nationalists disagree among themselves, is on whether autonomy would be enough or if they should aim for independence. \nIn wealthy Catalonia, which has had wide powers and where Catalan is an official language, Corsica’s demands for autonomy would seem modest. \nBut Corsica has only 325,000 inhabitants and accounts for less than 0.5 percent of France’s economy. One in five inhabitants lives under the poverty threshold. Related Coverage Talk or risk violence, Corsican nationalist tells Macron \nParliament speaker Talamoni, who wants independence at some point in the future and calls France “a neighbouring country”, says independence currently only has minority support and Corsica must first build up its economy and administrative infrastructure. \nHe struck a 10-year deal with nationalist politician Gilles Simeoni, who is also not a separatist, to seek more powers for Corsica but not independence. \nThis pact, together with the new-found peace and disillusion with mainstream parties, propelled them to victory in December, with Simeoni emerging to lead the regional government. \nWhile they must convince Macron to delegate powers to their region, Simeoni and Talamoni must also ensure that activists who fought for such powers, often by blowing up buildings and attacking government officials, don’t feel left out, said Jean-Paul Carrolaggi, a veteran separatist. \nSimeoni said Macron must show next week that he is willing to heed some of their demands, warning that some return to violence on the island could not be excluded if Corsicans felt they were not being heard.
