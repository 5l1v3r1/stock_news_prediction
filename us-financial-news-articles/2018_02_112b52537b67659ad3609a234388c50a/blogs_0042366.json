Wall Street eventually bottomed out on Feb. 8, briefly plunging into 10 percent correction territory. The market had been up for six straight sessions before Tuesday's decline.\n\"There's probably a 35 percent chance that we still have to retest earlier lows from a week and a half to two weeks ago,\" said Cashin, UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange. Most similar pullbacks have rarely \"ended in a V shape,\" rising straight back up after lows, he said.\n\"You wind up with a little bit of a W,\" Cashin told CNBC's \" \"The market has kind of shrugged its shoulders at seasonal patterns,\" periodic fluctuations that occur regularly based on a particular season.\nOn Tuesday , Andrew Sheets, chief cross-asset strategist at Morgan Stanley , predicted the recent correction was just a prelude of what's to come later in 2018.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average , S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain on track for their biggest monthly declines since January 2016.\nEarlier in the month, Cashin had predicted that the wage number in January's stronger-than-expected jobs report was unhelpful to an already worried stock market.\nCashin, 76, began his career at Thomson McKinnon in 1959. In 1964, at age 23, he became a member of the NYSE and a partner in P.R.
