REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic/File Photo As refugee numbers surged since mid-2016, donors responded to urgent appeals for extra aid.\nThe European Union, a major donor, said the allegations had been forwarded to its own anti-fraud office for investigation.\n“It is indeed of utmost importance to address swiftly and thoroughly any allegations of malfeasance in order not to impair ... public support from the European taxpayers,” the EU delegation in Uganda said in a statement.\nCorruption is widespread in Uganda and successful prosecutions are rare, with courts usually targeting low ranking officials.\nMucunguzi said although it was too early to say whether the allegations were true: “It’s likely that there may be malice, and people wanting to tarnish a good program.”\nReporting by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Clement Uwingiyimana and Robin Pomeroy\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:18:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
