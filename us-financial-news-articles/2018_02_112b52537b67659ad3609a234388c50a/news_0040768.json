LOUIS, Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aegion Corporation (“Aegion” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:AEGN) today reported its preliminary revenue and earnings expectations for full-year 2017. Aegion’s preliminary results are based on management’s current review of its results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and are subject to change based on completion of the Company’s financial closing process and year-end audit. Adjusted earnings per diluted share is a non-GAAP financial measure that does not include certain non-routine items that are not indicative of Aegion’s ongoing financial results.\n“While 2017’s earnings results fell short of our expectations, our ongoing efforts to focus and simplify the Aegion business are expected to result in significantly improved 2018 earnings. Strong opening backlog across all three of our operating segments, the strength of our key markets and the expected savings from restructuring activities combined with an expected lower effective tax rate are projected to result in an adjusted diluted earnings per share improvement of more than 30 percent in 2018 compared to full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share,” said Charles R. Gordon, Aegion’s President and Chief Executive Officer.\nGordon continued, “Strong 2017 operating income from the Energy Services and Corrosion Protection segments combined with record revenue and operating profit from Aegion’s North American CIPP operations were offset by losses of approximately $0.33 per diluted share in the portions of the Infrastructure Solutions segment being restructured, in addition to operational challenges in the Corrosion Protection segment’s U.S. cathodic protection business. We believe we have taken definitive actions to address the issues in these underperforming businesses and expect these operations to have significantly improved performance in 2018.”\nThe Company announced a series of strategic actions in August 2017 intended to generate more predictable and sustainable long-term earnings growth. Total restructuring and impairment charges of approximately $110 million were recorded in 2017, and included an impairment charge of $86 million recorded in the third quarter related to the exit of the Infrastructure Solutions segment’s North America activity for non-pressure pipe contract applications of the Tyfo® Fibrwrap® system. Total costs associated with the restructuring and related impairments are now estimated to be between $115 and $120 million, of which approximately $19 to $21 million are expected to be cash charges. The Company expects to generate annual cost reductions in excess of $20 million from these restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives, most of which are expected to be fully realized in 2018. The cost reductions are partially offset by strategic investments made across the Company.\nAegion has completed an initial assessment of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Company expects its 2018 effective tax rate will be between 23 and 24 percent. The Company also recorded a provisional charge of approximately $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the estimated impact of the tax reform. This one-time charge was excluded from adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per diluted share. The impacts of the legislation may differ materially from this estimate (and the amount of the provisional charge may be adjusted over the course of 2018) due to changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the tax legislation.\nAegion will release its fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results after market close on Wednesday, February 28, 2018. Charles R. Gordon, Aegion’s President and Chief Executive Officer, will host a conference call on Thursday, March 1, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss Aegion’s performance and outlook. There will be a question and answer period after the prepared remarks.\nEARNINGS RELEASE:\nWednesday, February 28, 2018 – After market close\nLIVE CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST:\nThursday, March 1, 2018 – 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time\nListen-only, Toll-free: 877-312-8824\nListen-only, Toll: 408-940-3830\nConference ID: 1378738\nThe conference call will be webcast live via the internet at http://www.aegion.com/investor/webcasts .
