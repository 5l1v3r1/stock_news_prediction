Poletto was previously at Italian handbag maker Furla, whose sales doubled during his tenure.\n“To Mr Poletto the most vivid appreciation for having contributed to the start of a new chapter in the company’s history, characterised by great dynamism,” the statement added.\nReporting by Giulia Segreti and Valentina Za, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:53:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
