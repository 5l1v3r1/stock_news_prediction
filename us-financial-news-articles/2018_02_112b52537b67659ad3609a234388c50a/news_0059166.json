A Transneft executive said last month that the dispute had been resolved on “mutually beneficial terms”.\n$1 = 55.6898 roubles Reporting by Tatiana Voronova and Vladimir Soldatkin Writing by Katya Golubkova Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:27:23.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
