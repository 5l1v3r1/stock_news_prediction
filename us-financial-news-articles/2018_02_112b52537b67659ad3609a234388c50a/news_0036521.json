He was the first outside investor in Facebook and made early-stage investments in Yelp, LinkedIn, and Quora. Last year, his Founders Fund reportedly made a $15 to $20 million investment in Bitcoin as well. \nHis political ideology, which leans toward libertarianism, is at odds with many in the tech industry. He came under fire from some in the tech community, including Netflix founder Reid Hastings, for his support of Trump. \nIn L.A., which is hardly a conservative haven, he could create a right-leaning media outlet, the Journal reports . \nThiel Capital and Thiel Foundation, and their 50 employees, will accompany Thiel to L.A. Other firms, including Founders Fund and Mithril Capital, will remain in San Francisco.
