It did not disclose how much each partner was investing.\nState news agency Xinhua, which reported the news on Wednesday, said this was the biggest industrial investment in Chongqing since it became China’s fourth province-level municipality in 1997.\nTsinghua Unigroup Ltd, China’s biggest state-owned semiconductor group, leads Beijing’s ambitions to develop a domestic chip champion. It is also building a $30 billion memory chip factory in Nanjing and a $24 billion chip factory in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\nSino IC Capital was set up in August 2014 by Chinese state investors and has about 138.7 billion yuan in funds under management to invest in the semiconductor space.\nIts subsidiary, Unic Capital Management, last year agreed to acquire U.S. semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corp for $580 million in cash.
