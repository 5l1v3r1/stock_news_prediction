The fourth quarter and full year 2017 results include the benefit of the 53 rd week of operations which contributed approximately $31.0 million. Excluding the 53 rd week, the revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $2.9 million or 0.7%. This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in company-owned restaurant sales due to negative comparable sales of 4.7% and the impact of refranchising 42 Domestic company-owned restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2016. These decreases were somewhat offset by increases in International revenues due to higher comparable sales of 2.6% and an increase in equivalent units as well as an increase in North America commissary sales due to higher commodity prices. Foreign currency exchange rates during the fourth quarter of 2017 favorably impacted International revenues by approximately $1.8 million.\nConsolidated revenues for the full year 2017 were $1.78 billion, increasing $69.7 million, or 4.1%, compared to 2016. Excluding the 53 rd week, 2017 revenues increased $38.8 million, or 2.3%, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher North America commissary sales from commodity price increases and higher volumes. International revenues also increased due to higher comparable sales of 4.4% and an increase in equivalent units. The increased revenues from International were somewhat offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates approximating $4.1 million. North America franchise revenues also increased primarily due to the impact of refranchising 42 Domestic company-owned restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2016; this increase was more than offset by a related decrease in Domestic company-owned restaurant sales.\nConsolidated income before income taxes of $32.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $18.5 million, or 36.6%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of Special items, adjusted income before income taxes was $33.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $5.7 million, or 14.5%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as detailed below. Adjusted income before income taxes as a percentage of consolidated revenues was 7.2% for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 1.8% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. See “Items Impacting Comparability - Non-GAAP Presentation” table for more details.\nDomestic company-owned restaurant operating income decreased $6.1 million, or as a percentage of related revenues decreased 3.3%. This was primarily attributable to the impact of negative comparable sales, higher vehicle and workers’ compensation insurance costs and higher commodities prices. The higher labor costs from higher minimum wages were offset by lower restaurant bonuses due to the lower sales and operating results. The decrease in operating income was somewhat offset by the benefit from the 53 rd week of operations of approximately $2.4 million. North America commissary and other operating income increased approximately $500,000 but as a percentage of related revenues, decreased 0.4%. The benefit from the 53 rd week of operations was approximately $2.0 million. The operating income decrease excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week was due primarily to higher online operating costs due to digital initiatives as well as lower operating income in our print and promotions subsidiary from lower revenues. North America commissary operating income approximated the prior year. International operating income increased $3.3 million, or 1.5% as a percentage of related international revenues. The benefit from the 53 rd week of operations was approximately $700,000. The additional increase in operating income was primarily due to both higher revenues on higher comparable sales and equivalent units and the favorable timing of marketing spend in the United Kingdom, which had no impact on full year results. General and administrative costs increased $450,000, improving 0.5% as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Excluding the impact of the 53 rd week of $900,000, general and administrative costs were down $450,000 primarily attributable to lower management incentive costs of $4.7 million, substantially offset by higher salaries and benefits. Interest expense increased $2.9 million, or 154.2%, for the fourth quarter. This increase was attributable to both an increase in average outstanding debt, which is primarily due to share repurchases, as well as higher interest rates.\nConsolidated income before income taxes was $140.3 million, a decrease of $18.5 million, or 11.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of Special items, adjusted income before income taxes was $142.0 million, a decrease of $5.7 million, or 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was driven by the fourth quarter results, as previously discussed. Adjusted income before income taxes as a percentage of consolidated revenues was 8.0%, a decrease of 0.6% for the full year.\nThe effective income tax rates were 9.6% and 24.1% for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, representing decreases of 22.6% and 7.2% from the prior year comparable periods. The decreases in the effective income tax rates for the fourth quarter and full year are primarily attributable to the impact of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” (the “Tax Act”) which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act contains substantial changes to the Internal Revenue Code including a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment of this tax legislation in 2017, deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured. This remeasurement yielded a one-time benefit of approximately $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. See “Items Impacting Comparability-Non-GAAP Presentation” table for more details. Given the substantial changes associated with the Tax Act, the estimated remeasurement of deferred taxes for fourth quarter and the full year 2017 are provisional and subject to further interpretation and clarification of the Tax Act.\nDiluted earnings per share (“EPS”) decreased 8.0% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 3.3% for the full year. Excluding Special items, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.65 for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 5.8%. The decrease is primarily attributable to the lower operating income results previously discussed, which more than offset the favorable impact of the 53 rd week. The 2017 full year adjusted diluted EPS was $2.62, an increase of 2.7% over 2016 EPS of $2.55. This full year increase includes the $0.11 favorable impact of the 53 rd week, a favorable tax rate and lower share count. These favorable items were somewhat offset by other decreases in income, as previously discussed.\nGlobal Restaurant and Comparable Sales Information\nThree Months Ended Year Ended Dec. 31,\n2017\nDec. 25,\n2016\nDec. 31,\n2017\nDec. 25,\n2016\nGlobal restaurant sales growth (a) 9.9 % 5.3 % 5.8 % 5.2 % Global restaurant sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency (a)\n9.6 % 7.0 % 6.3 % 6.8 % Comparable sales growth (b) Domestic company-owned restaurants (4.7 %) 4.8 % 0.4 % 4.4 % North America franchised restaurants (3.5 %) 3.4 % (0.1 %) 3.1 % System-wide North America restaurants (3.9 %) 3.8 % 0.1 % 3.5 % System-wide international restaurants 2.6 % 5.6 % 4.4 % 6.0 % (a) Includes both company-owned and franchised restaurant sales. (b) Represents the change in year-over-year sales for the same base of restaurants for the same fiscal periods. Comparable sales results for restaurants operating outside of the United States are reported on a constant dollar basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. We believe global restaurant and comparable sales growth information, as defined in the table above, is useful in analyzing our results since our franchisees pay royalties that are based on a percentage of franchise sales. Franchise sales generate commissary revenue in the United States and in certain international markets. Global restaurant and comparable sales growth information is also useful in analyzing industry trends and the strength of our brand. Management believes the presentation of global restaurant sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency provides investors with useful information regarding underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign currency exchange. Franchise restaurant sales are not included in company revenues.\nFree Cash Flow\nThe company’s free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the full year of 2017 and 2016 was as follows (in thousands):\nFull Year Ended Dec. 31 Dec. 25 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities (a) $ 134,975 $ 150,257 Purchases of property and equipment (52,594 ) (55,554 ) Free cash flow $ 82,381 $ 94,703 (a) The decrease of $15.3 million was primarily due to changes in working capital amounts.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities (from the consolidated statements of cash flows) less the amounts spent on the purchase of property and equipment. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor that management uses in determining the amount of cash available for discretionary investment. Free cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our measure of free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the company’s liquidity or performance than the company’s GAAP measures.\nSee the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for additional information concerning our operating results and cash flow for the full year ended December 31, 2017.\nGlobal Restaurant Unit Data\nAt December 31, 2017, there were 5,199 Papa John’s restaurants operating in all 50 states and in 44 international countries and territories, as follows:\nDomestic\nCompany-\nowned\nFranchised\nNorth\nAmerica\nTotal North\nAmerica\nInternational System-wide Fourth Quarter\nBeginning - September 24, 2017 705 2,736 3,441 1,660 5,101 Opened 5 37 42 118 160 Closed (1 ) (41 ) (42 ) (20 ) (62 ) Acquired - 1 1 - 1 Sold (1 ) - (1 ) - (1 ) Ending - December 31, 2017 708 2,733 3,441 1,758 5,199 Year-to-date\nBeginning - December 25, 2016 702 2,739 3,441 1,656 5,097 Opened 9 110 119 257 376 Closed (3 ) (116 ) (119 ) (155 ) (274 ) Acquired 1 1 2 - 2 Sold (1 ) (1 ) (2 ) - (2 ) Ending - December 31, 2017 708 2,733 3,441 1,758 5,199 Unit growth (decline) 6 (6 ) - 102 102 % increase (decrease) 0.9 % (0.2 %) - 6.2 % 2.0 % The 2017 International franchise closures include 66 India closures for the year ended December 31, 2017. There was no significant impact on our 2017 operating results from the closure of the market.\nOur development pipeline as of December 31, 2017 includes 1,190 restaurants (200 units in North America and 990 units internationally), the majority of which are scheduled to open over the next six years.\nItems Impacting Comparability – Non-GAAP Presentation\nThe following table reconciles our GAAP financial results to our adjusted financial results, which are non-GAAP measures, for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016:\nThree Months Ended Full Year Ended Dec. 31, Dec. 25, Dec. 31, Dec. 25, (In thousands, except per share amounts) 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP income before income taxes $ 32,064 $ 50,573 $ 140,342 $ 158,809 Special items: Refranchising and impairment (gains)/losses 1,674 (10,222 ) 1,674 (10,222 ) Legal settlement - (898 ) - (898 ) Adjusted income before income taxes $ 33,738 $ 39,453 $ 142,016 $ 147,689 53rd week $ (5,900 ) $ - $ (5,900 ) $ - Adjusted income before income taxes - 52 weeks $ 27,838 $ 39,453 $ 136,116 $ 147,689 GAAP net income $ 28,509 $ 32,630 $ 102,292 $ 102,820 Special items, net of income taxes: Refranchising and impairment (gains)/losses 1,323 (6,455 ) 1,323 (6,455 ) Legal settlement - (567 ) - (567 ) U.S. tax legislation effect on deferred taxes (7,020 ) - (7,020 ) - Equity compensation tax benefit (19 ) - (1,879 ) - Adjusted net income $ 22,793 $ 25,608 $ 94,716 $ 95,798 53rd week $ (3,900 ) $ - $ (3,900 ) $ - Adjusted net income - 52 weeks $ 18,893 $ 25,608 $ 90,816 $ 95,798 GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.81 $ 0.88 $ 2.83 $ 2.74 Special items: Refranchising and impairment (gains)/losses 0.04 (0.17 ) 0.04 (0.17 ) Legal settlement - (0.02 ) - (0.02 ) U.S. tax legislation effect on deferred taxes (0.20 ) - (0.20 ) - Equity compensation tax benefit - - (0.05 ) - Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 0.65 $ 0.69 $ 2.62 $ 2.55 53rd week $ (0.11 ) $ - $ (0.11 ) $ - Adjusted diluted earnings per share - 52 weeks $ 0.54 $ 0.69 $ 2.51 $ 2.55 Refranchising and impairment (gains)/losses includes impairment charges in 2016 and 2017 related to our company-owned stores in China that are held for sale. 2016 also includes a refranchising gain from the sale of the company–owned Phoenix market with 42 restaurants to a franchisee.\nThe legal settlement represents the favorable 2016 finalization related to the collective and class action litigation, Perrin v. Papa John’s International, Inc. and Papa John’s USA, Inc.\nU.S. tax legislation effect on deferred taxes is related to the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n2017 also includes the favorable impact of adopting the new guidance for accounting for share-based compensation. This guidance requires excess tax benefits recognized on stock based awards to be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense rather than stockholders’ equity.\nThe non-GAAP adjusted results shown should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the company’s performance than the company’s GAAP results. Management believes presenting the financial information excluding these items is important for purposes of comparison to prior year results. In addition, management uses these metrics to evaluate the company’s underlying operating performance, to analyze trends, and to determine compensation.\nShare Repurchase Activity\nThe following table reflects our repurchases for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 and subsequent repurchases through February 20, 2018 (in thousands):\nPeriod Number\nof Shares\nCost Fourth Quarter 2017 1,387 $ 87,881 Full Year 2017 2,960 $ 209,586 January 1, 2018 through February 20, 2018 546 $ 32,713 There were 35.1 million and 36.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, representing decreases of 6.1% and 2.9%, respectively, over the prior year comparable periods. Approximately 34.1 million actual shares of the company’s common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company expects to repurchase shares in an amount equal to the remaining authorization by the end of 2019. The timing and volume of share repurchases may be executed at the discretion of management on an opportunistic basis, or pursuant to trading plans or other arrangements. Any share repurchase under this program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The Company continues to evaluate the use of an accelerated share repurchase program to execute a portion of the share repurchase authorization. There can be no assurance as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases, whether through an accelerated share repurchase program or otherwise. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on prevailing market conditions and other factors. Repurchases under the Company’s share repurchase program may be commenced or suspended from time to time at the Company’s discretion without prior notice.\nCash Dividend\nWe paid a cash dividend of approximately $7.8 million ($0.225 per common share) during the fourth quarter of 2017. Subsequent to the fourth quarter, on February 2, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.225 per common share (approximately $7.6 million based on the current number of shares outstanding). The dividend was paid on February 23, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 12, 2018. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to the company’s financial results, cash requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\n2018 Key Operating Assumptions and Financial Outlook\nIn 2018, the Company is targeting the following performance:\nDiluted EPS of $2.40 to $2.60 in comparison to the $2.83 2017 GAAP EPS. Excluding the $0.11 impact of the 53 rd week in 2017, EPS decrease is 4.5% to 12.0% on adjusted 2017 EPS of $2.72. 2018 Diluted EPS outlook also includes the following assumptions: EPS will decrease $0.30 to $0.40 due to lower operating results, primarily from expected continued pressure on Domestic restaurants’ sales, higher delivery and insurance costs for our company-owned restaurants and the higher costs for technology and marketing investments. EPS will decrease $0.05 to $0.10 related to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. EPS will increase an additional $0.04 to $0.10 for the favorable impact of U.S. tax legislation above the $0.20 favorable impact in 2017. Our preliminary 2018 income tax rate estimates are 20% to 24%. These estimates are provisional and subject to further interpretation and clarification of the legislation. The tax rate excludes any tax impact from a potential divestiture of our China company-owned operations. EPS will increase $0.05 to $0.10 due to share repurchases. North America comparable sales of negative 3% to flat International comparable sales of 3.0% - 5.0% Net global new unit growth of 3.0% - 5.0% Block cheese prices are projected to be in the low $1.60’s Capital expenditures of $45 - $55 million Total Debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0x to 3.5x\nConference Call and Website Information\nA conference call is scheduled for February 27, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to review our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings results.
