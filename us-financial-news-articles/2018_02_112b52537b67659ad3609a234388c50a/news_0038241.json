Neymar was widely criticised as being ineffective during Real’s 3-1 win over PSG in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie in Spain. “In a war there are those who feed off victories and those who, like vultures, feed off the carcasses of the defeated,” Neymar’s father wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of his son. Neymar Snr, who is also his son’s agent, was nevertheless adamant that PSG can qualify for the quarter-finals with a win in second leg of the tie in Paris on March 6. ”My son has been battling since he was a child,“ he wrote, ”always fighting fair, always avoiding the vultures, always rising again stronger. “We lost a battle but as for the war, we’ll see, because it will last as long as we’re on the field.” Reporting by Andrew Downie; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T01:36:11.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
