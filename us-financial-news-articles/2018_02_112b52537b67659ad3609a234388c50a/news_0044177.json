Zuma and the Guptas have consistently denied any wrong-doing.\nMammburu said NUM members at the coal mine east of Johannesburg, which supplies state-run power utility Eskom, were also anxious about the future of the mine and were wondering if it had been sold or not.\nThe Business Day newspaper reported this week that the mine could be shut down over its failure to operate a community water desalination plant, which is a requirement for its mining licence. South African mining companies are required to meet social and labour obligations to maintain their permits.
