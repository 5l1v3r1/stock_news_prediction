That wasn’t what happened, but if it had happened, I would have been looking forward to that spurt.”\nFaced with a battery of microphones and cameras immediately after her victory, Nilsson stilt had not had a chance to plan her celebrations.\n“We’ll see - I’ve never won an Olympic gold before, so we’ll have to see how it turns out,” she said with a broad smile.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:38:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
