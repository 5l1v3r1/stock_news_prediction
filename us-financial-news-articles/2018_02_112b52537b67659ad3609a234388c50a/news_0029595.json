(NYSE:HTA), the largest dedicated owner and operator of medical office buildings in the United States, announced today that its board of directors issued a quarterly dividend of $0.305 per share of common stock. This represents an annualized rate of $1.22 per share of common stock with an annualized yield of 4.75% based on HTA's closing share price as of February 14, 2018. The dividend will be paid on April 10, 2018 to stockholders of record on April 3, 2018.\nAdditionally, the eligible holders of HTA's operating partnership units (\"OP Units\") will receive an increase in their quarterly OP Unit distributions, which is on par with HTA's common stock dividend described above.\nThe amount of common stock dividends HTA pays to its stockholders is determined by HTA's board of directors, at its discretion, and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for the payment of distributions, HTA's financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain HTA's status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code. HTA's board of directors may reduce its dividend rate and HTA cannot guarantee the amount of dividends paid in the future, if any.\nAbout HTA\nHealthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE: HTA) is the largest dedicated owner and operator of medical office buildings in the United States, based on gross leasable area. We provide the real estate infrastructure for the integrated delivery of healthcare services in highly desirable locations. Over the last decade, we have invested approximately $7.0 billion primarily in medical office buildings and other healthcare assets comprising over 24 million square feet of GLA. Our investments are targeted in 20 to 25 key markets that we believe have superior healthcare demographics that support strong, long-term demand for medical office space. We have achieved, and continue to achieve, critical mass within these key markets by expanding our presence through accretive acquisitions, and utilizing our in-house operating expertise through our regionally located property management and leasing platform. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona and directed from our full-time service offices, HTA has developed a national brand with dedicated relationships at the local level. We have achieved scale in 16 markets with greater than 500,000 square feet and 10 markets with approximately 1 million or greater square feet; in each market we service our healthcare providers through our institutional full-service operational platform including property management, leasing and development services. This drives efficiencies, strong tenant and health system relationships, and strategic partnerships that result in high levels of tenant retention, rental growth, and long-term value creation across the portfolio.\nFounded in 2006 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, HTA has produced attractive returns for its stockholders that we believe have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and US REIT indices.
