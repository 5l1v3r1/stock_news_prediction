It is not giving Britain a later date as yet, however, as a way to put pressure on London in the negotiations.\nFor the same reason, EU officials and diplomats have also sent conflicting signals on whether they would still present their joint stance on their future deal with Britain in March, regardless of whether London offers some lines on that, or not.\nAdditional reporting by Elizabeth Piper in London; Writing by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T16:53:32.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
