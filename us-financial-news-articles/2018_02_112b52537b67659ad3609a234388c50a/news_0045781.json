The statement did not say when the investigation will be concluded.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Carnival has offered passengers a 25 percent “cruise credit” on future trips.\nA NSW police spokeswoman told Reuters on Monday that inquiries were continuing with no charges laid yet.\nThe video on social media shows passengers brawling with each other and with security officers. A Carnival spokesman said the company could not confirm the veracity of the video.\nSeveral passengers who got off the cruise in Melbourne, including Michael Haddara and Jacob Summers, told local media on Saturday that the security staff made matters worse.\nCompanies and their brands can suffer reputational damage from the actions of their employees. Last April, United Airlines reached a settlement for an undisclosed sum with a passenger who was dragged from a Chicago flight.\nVideos of the passenger, Dr. David Dao, being dragged down the aisle of a United jet and the company’s handling of the incident touched off a public outcry and even prompted calls from congressmen for new industry regulation.\nReporting by Jonathan Barrett in SYDNEY; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T08:22:09.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
