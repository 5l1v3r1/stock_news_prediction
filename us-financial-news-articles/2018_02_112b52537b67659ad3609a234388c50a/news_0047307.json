In 2018, we expect to continue this cadence of clinical and preclinical data disclosures, while also working to progress avapritinib quickly toward potential approval for gastrointestinal stromal tumors and systemic mastocytosis and to define the development path for BLU-554. We also plan to devote additional resources to commercial readiness as we progress pivotal clinical trials in multiple patient populations.\"\nClinical Programs:\nAvapritinib: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST)\nIn November 2017, Blueprint Medicines presented updated data from the dose escalation and expansion portion of its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of avapritinib in patients with advanced GIST, called the Navigator trial, at the 22 nd Connective Tissue Oncology Society (CTOS) Annual Meeting. Among evaluable patients with heavily pretreated KIT-driven GIST treated with 300 to 400mg of avapritinib once daily, the data showed radiographic tumor reductions in 67 percent of these patients, an objective response rate (ORR) of 17 percent and median progression free survival (PFS) of 11.5 months. In evaluable patients with PDGFRα D842-driven GIST, the data showed an ORR of 71 percent and an estimated 12-month PFS of 78 percent. The data also showed that avapritinib was generally well-tolerated, and most adverse events (AEs) reported by investigators were Grade 1 or 2. Read the full data here . Also in November 2017, Blueprint Medicines expanded its ongoing Navigator trial to increase the enrollment target for patients previously treated with imatinib and at least one additional prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) from 50 to 100 patients and added a new cohort to evaluate avapritinib in second-line GIST patients. Blueprint Medicines continues to expect to complete enrollment of the PDGFRα D842V expansion cohort by the middle of 2018. Blueprint Medicines also plans to initiate a global, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating avapritinib compared to regorafenib in third-line patients with KIT-driven GIST, called the Voyager trial, in the first half of 2018, with the goal of supporting the potential approval of avapritinib in a broader population of GIST patients.\nAvapritinib: Systemic Mastocytosis (SM)\nIn December 2017, Blueprint Medicines presented updated data from the dose escalation portion of its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of avapritinib in patients with advanced SM, called the Explorer trial, at the 59 th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition (ASH). The data showed an ORR of 72 percent and a disease control rate of 100 percent in patients evaluable for response, based on the International Working Group – Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment and European Competence Network on Mastocytosis consensus criteria. The data also showed that avapritinib was generally well-tolerated and most AEs reported by investigators were Grade 1 or 2. Read the full data here . Also in December 2017, Blueprint Medicines announced plans to engage global regulatory authorities in the first half of 2018 to obtain input on registration pathways for avapritinib in patients with advanced SM and patients with indolent and smoldering SM. Blueprint Medicines expects to initiate a registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with advanced SM in the first half of 2018 and a dose-finding and proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with indolent and smoldering SM in the second half of 2018. Blueprint Medicines continues to enroll patients in the expansion portion of its ongoing Explorer trial, with the goal of generating additional data in 2018.\nAvapritinib: Recent Scientific Publications\nIn November 2017, Blueprint Medicines announced the publication of preclinical data and clinical case studies for avapritinib, highlighting the potent activity of avapritinib against activation loop mutations, as well as a broad spectrum of additional clinically relevant mutations, with a selectivity profile minimizing inhibition of other kinases. The paper, titled \"A precision therapy against cancers driven by KIT/PDGFRA mutations\" was published online in Science Translational Medicine.\nBLU-554: Hepatocellular Carcinoma\nBlueprint Medicines continues to enroll patients in the expansion portion of its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of BLU-554 in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In November 2017, Blueprint Medicines added a new cohort to this trial to enroll approximately 40 TKI-naïve patients with FGFR4-driven HCC. Blueprint Medicines is also exploring opportunities to evaluate BLU-554 in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Blueprint Medicines plans to report updated data from the expansion portion of its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for advanced HCC, including from the new TKI-naïve cohort, in the second half of 2018.\nBLU-667: RET-Altered Solid Tumors\nBlueprint Medicines continues to enroll patients in the dose escalation portion of its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of BLU-667 in patients with RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and other advanced solid tumors. In December 2017, Blueprint Medicines provided an update on its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. As previously reported, as of December 1, 2017, 30 patients were enrolled in the trial, and BLU-667 was generally well-tolerated. The majority of adverse events reported by investigators were Grade 1, and the maximum tolerated dose or recommended part 2 dose had not yet been established. Investigators reported preliminary evidence of clinical activity in patients with RET-altered NSCLC, including patients with KIF5B and other RET fusions, and RET-altered MTC. Blueprint Medicines plans to report preliminary clinical data and initiate the expansion portion of this Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2018.\nResearch Programs:\nIn December 2017, Blueprint Medicines announced the selection of BLU-782 as its development candidate for the treatment of patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in the ALK2 gene. Blueprint Medicines plans to initiate investigational new drug (IND) application-enabling studies for BLU-782 in the first half of 2018 and plans to report preclinical data for this program in 2018.\nCorporate Highlights:\nIn December 2017, Blueprint Medicines announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of 4,259,259 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $81.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. Blueprint Medicines received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $325.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nFourth Quarter and Year End 2017 Financial Results:\nCash Position: As of December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and investments were $673.4 million, as compared to $268.2 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an aggregate of $541.3 million in net proceeds from Blueprint Medicines' underwritten public offerings in April and December 2017, partially offset by $119.9 million in cash used to fund operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. Collaboration Revenues: Collaboration revenues were $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the termination of the Alexion agreement during the fourth quarter of 2017. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $43.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $24.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to increased clinical and manufacturing expenses associated with advancing avapritinib, BLU-554, and BLU-667 further through Phase 1 clinical trials and increased personnel-related expenses. Research and development expenses included $1.9 million in stock-based compensation expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $6.3 million in stock-based compensation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $8.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $5.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel-related expenses and professional fees, including market research and public relation costs. General and administrative expenses included $1.8 million in stock-based compensation expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $6.2 million in stock-based compensation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net Loss: Net loss was $49.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $148.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or a net loss per share of $1.23 and $3.92, respectively, as compared to a net loss of $21.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or a net loss per share of $0.75 and $2.64, respectively.\nFinancial Guidance:\nBased on its current plans, Blueprint Medicines expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, excluding any potential option fees and milestone payments under its existing collaboration with Roche, will be sufficient to enable it to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the middle of 2020.\nConference Call Information:\nBlueprint Medicines will host a live conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. ET.
