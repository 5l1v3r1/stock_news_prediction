The Swiss-based company declined to comment. \nThe EU competition authority has given rivals and customers until Friday to provide feedback on Bayer’s proposed concessions. It is possible that some could ask for more time. \nThe Commission, which is scheduled to decide by April 5, can either accept the concessions, demand more or veto the deal. \n($1 = 0.8157 euros) Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Additional reporting by Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt and Oliver Hirt in Zurich; Editing by David Goodman and Elaine Hardcastle", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T18:32:31.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
