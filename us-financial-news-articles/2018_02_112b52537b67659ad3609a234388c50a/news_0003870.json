(“New Media” or the “Company”, NYSE: NEWM), one of the largest publishers of locally based print and online media in the United States as measured by number of publications, announced today that it has acquired a 20% equity stake in TapOnIt, an opt-in text-based platform that delivers offers from local businesses direct to consumers’ phones.\nTapOnIt was launched in April 2015 by digital advertising veteran Katie Wilson in Quad Cities, Iowa. In under three years, the company expanded to three additional Iowa markets – Des Moines, Iowa City and Cedar Rapids – and built a database of over 70,000 registered users. The investment by New Media is expected to help TapOnIt to expand across the country by being added as an available product offered to advertisers at New Media’s publications across its 540 markets.\nTapOnIt users register to receive up-to three image-based text messages per week featuring three local offers per message. With a 98% open-rate – including 90% who open within three minutes of receiving – the TapOnIt platform delivers immediate results at a fraction of the cost of traditional direct mail. And unlike other app-based discount offer platforms, TapOnIt business customers keep 100% of the revenue generated by users.\n“Because our platform is text-based with no apps to download or update, we experience less than a 2% monthly churn rate compared to 70% churn for apps in their first 90 days,” said Wilson. “And our users redeem the offers they receive at rates of up to 11%.”\nBeginning in this quarter, TapOnIt will start rolling out their platform in select New Media markets. “We are incredibly excited to partner with New Media,” continued Wilson. “We believe its investment in and commitment to the TapOnIt Reseller Network will rapidly accelerate our expansion to additional markets and allow us to bring special offers to consumers and drive traffic, revenue and awareness for businesses.”\n“The platform that Katie and her team have built has been embraced by businesses and consumers throughout the markets they have launched,” noted New Media CEO Michael E. Reed. “With their proprietary technology that leads to immediate and trackable results for local businesses, we see an incredible opportunity to bring the TapOnIt platform to the millions of consumers and small businesses that reside in our markets across the country. There is the potential for great revenue upside for both companies as TapOnIt is sold into New Media’s footprint.”\n“We were really impressed with not only the quantity of traffic but also the quality,” said Shaun Page, Owner/Operator of a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Davenport, IA and TapOnIt customer. “TapOnIt drives an impressive amount of traffic and branding for my business.”\nTapOnIt is based in the Quad Cities and is led by Founder and CEO Katie Wilson and Co-Founder Sara Castillo.\nAbout New Media Investment Group Inc.\nNew Media supports small to mid-size communities by providing locally-focused print and digital content to its consumers and premier marketing and technology solutions for our small and medium businesses partners.
