The company's growth has been driven by efforts to advance artificial intelligence (AI) development and mobile search optimization. \nLast quarter, the company spun off its Baidu Deliveries and mobile games businesses to focus more resources on AI and a variety of other projects. In that same quarter, Baidu beat expectations on earnings by a wide margin, but just missed analyst consensus on revenue. \nEven as it trimmed deliveries and mobile games, Baidu pushed further into projects executives hope will help level the playing field with competitors Alibaba and Tencent. \nBaidu has also thrown its hat into the autonomous vehicle game, striking up relationships with Ford, ON Semiconductor and, most recently, BlackBerry to develop self-driving technology. \nBaidu even announced plans in October to release a fully autonomous bus in China in 2018. \nAs of Monday's close, Baidu shares were up 20.46 percent year over year.
