However, the Penguins then scored three in a row over a stretch of 6:12 for a 4-1 lead.\nGuentzel started everything 52 seconds after the Ottawa goal when he put away the rebound of a Phil Kessel shot.\nMalkin made it 3-1 at 10:01 with an assist from Carl Hagelin. Malkin took a behind-the-back pass from Hagelin to the right of goalie Mike Condon and then wheeled around and put a backhander in on the short side.\nAston-Reese, playing in his fifth NHL game, scored his first goal to stretch the lead to 4-1 just 1:21 later.\nCraig Anderson then replaced Condon, who allowed the four goals on only nine shots.
