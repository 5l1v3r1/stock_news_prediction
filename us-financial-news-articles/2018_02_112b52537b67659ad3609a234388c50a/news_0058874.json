Will criticism from a liberal law professor persuade the Times to reconsider?\nSince the overwhelming majority of Americans is receiving a tax cut this year, much of the press corps has naturally sought to find and highlight those few taxpayers who won’t be enjoying any relief, and may even be facing higher tax bills. On Friday the Times published a story typical of the genre, but with a twist.\nPerhaps because of the difficulty of identifying particular victims of tax increases, the Times created two fictional characters to illustrate the story: \nThanks to lower rates and a doubled standard deduction, 2018 taxes will fall for many people. But that won’t be true for quite a few others, like this hypothetical couple in suburban New York, Samuel and Felicity Taxpayer. The Times then described their imaginary family, which includes two children and an elderly parent living in the household. The paper elaborated: “Both Samuel and Felicity earn income, she as an employee of a design firm and he as a self-employed engineering consultant.” And the Times sketches out the family finances, writing that “their total income for 2017 was $183,911, but after deductions, their taxable income is $88,293. In 2018, it would be $116,097.” \nThe Times added other relevant details, accompanied by compelling graphics, and delivered the sad news to their imaginary couple:\nThe family would owe $3,896 more in taxes under the new tax law. But actually they wouldn’t, according to Daniel Hemel, who teaches tax law at the University of Chicago. This is particularly awkward for the Times, because his biography on the university’s website suggests that he is someone the Times would normally regard as a perfect source: \nDaniel graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College and received an MPhil with distinction from Oxford University, where he was a Marshall Scholar. He then earned his JD from Yale Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal. Prior to his appointment, he was a law clerk to Associate Justice Elena Kagan on the US Supreme Court. In a series of recent tweets, Mr. Hemel has described how the Times seems to have botched the analysis, mainly by not realizing that a 20% deduction is now available to self-employed “consultants (& doctors and lawyers & everyone else)” with taxable income below $315,000 for a married couple.\nTweets Mr. Hemel: \nNYT has a really nice infographic explaining the ways in which the new tax law will play out on the 1040. Unfortunately, the bottom line conclusion -- that Samuel & Felicity will owe $3,896 more in taxes under the new law -- appears to be wrong. They’ll actually owe less... I say this as someone who is generally happy to point out the ways in which the new tax law produces unattractive results. But this couple appears to be among the winners -- largely on account of the fact that Samuel is self-employed. This must be some package of tax cuts, if even fictional characters invented by the New York Times are getting one! \n***\nIn Other News \nNot Bernie’s Party Yet \n“National Democrats target Houston Democrat for defeat,” Houston Chronicle, Feb. 23 \nFrackers Gonna Frack \n“U.S. to overtake Russia as top oil producer by 2019 at latest: IEA,” Reuters, Feb. 26 \nAlternative Headline: Shareholders Keep More of Their Money \n“Buffett says $29 billion tax cut windfall boosts Berkshire Hathaway , ” Washington Post, Feb. 24 \n***\nBottom Stories of the Day \nIn Laguna They’re Calling It A ‘Teardown’ \n“Buffett’s $11 Million Beach House Is Still on the Market,” Bloomberg, Feb. 27 \nNow That’s a Teardown \n“Assembly candidate’s brothel shut down on suspicion of fire code issues,” Nevada Independent, Feb. 26 \nNews You Can Use (Assuming You Plan to Eat Crickets) \n“Try the Chips of the Future, Today,” Atlas Obscura, Feb. 26 \nOut on a Limb \n“Jupiter’s Great Red Spot May Soon Disappear... or it may not,” National Geographic, Feb. 21 \n***\nFollow James Freeman on Twitter. \nSubscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click. \nTo suggest items, please email best@wsj.com . \n(Carol Muller and Lisa Rossi help compile Best of the Web.
