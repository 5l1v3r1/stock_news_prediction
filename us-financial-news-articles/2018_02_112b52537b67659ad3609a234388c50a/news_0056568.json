ISS in 2013 paid $300,000 to resolve U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it failed to safeguard client information.\nReporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:24:08.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
