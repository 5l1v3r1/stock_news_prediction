The S&P 500 also gained, up 1.1 percent with a strong performance in telecommunications, technology and financials stocks. \nBerkshire Hathaway Class B stock led the charge higher with a 3.6 percent gain after CEO Warren Buffett told investors that, should the company fail to find any market bargains, it will likely return cash to shareholders. \nThe Dow and S&P 500 have more than halved their correction losses; both are down roughly 3 percent from all-time highs notched in January. \nThe Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, also climbed 1.1 percent thanks to a 2 percent rally in Apple shares and a 2.75 percent gain in Intel . \nThe Cboe Volatility index (VIX) — the market's best fear gauge — hit a low of 15.97 in a choppy session, its lowest level since Feb. 2. \n\"The economy is still in acceleration mode. That's true here and generally overseas,\" said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. \"I don't really see things getting out of whack or an economic imbalance that would suggest you're nearing the end of the uptrend.\" \n\"The next thing we've got to think about is when we hit the end of the year and the comparisons get tougher,\" she added. \nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note stabilized just under the key psychological level of 3 percent over the past few weeks. At the latest reading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note traded at 2.857 percent, below its high of 2.95 percent hit last week. \nThat has given stocks some breathing room, with the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 1,100 points over the past two weeks of trading. The so-called \"FAANG\" stocks — including Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google-parent Alphabet — have already returned to pre-correction levels. \nAn equal-weighted portfolio of the stocks is up 18.4 percent this year , versus the S&P 500's 2.8 percent gain, Bespoke said in a Friday report. \n\"I am fairly optimistic about the current state of the economy,\" said Fed Governor Randal Quarles in prepared remarks on Monday. \"Along many dimensions, it has been quite some time since the economic environment has looked as favorable as it does now.\" \nThe new Fed governor noted that with the economy appearing healthy, the central bank should prepare for further interest rate increases to keep growth and markets from overheating. \nGeneral Electic, on the other hand, broke below $14 per share after naming three new directors to its board. The latest depreciation in shares price comes after months of turbulent times for the original Dow member; new chief executive officer John Flannery has pledged to trim the company by exiting several businesses. \nWhile U.S. government debt yields remained under pressure Monday , concerns around the future of the economy and monetary policy in the States keep markets on edge. \n\"We've a got a full slate of economic data which should probably be the most important thing [this week],\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR, referring to key inflation metrics. \"Earnings are great and they're better for tax reform, while economic data continues to improve.\" \nThe strategist noted that a number of companies are set to report this week, including consumer-facing companies like Lowe's, and that a calmer debt market seems to have stabilized equities for the moment. Hogan believes market consensus sees 3 rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in 2018.

Though many market experts hope Powell will pacify an ongoing tug-of-war between bonds and stocks, the central bank could stick to script and assure lawmakers of a continued, gradual path of rate hikes. \nThe Fed's preferred inflation data, personal consumption expenditures (PCE), will be released Thursday. \n\"I would think there's no upside for [Powell] making a splash because he's dealing with a committee that's in flux, just coming together,\" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"The market tends to do a good job of panicking and defining the range you're likely to be in ... Once the taper tantrum got going, 3 percent was the watermark.\" \nIn other data news, sales of new homes fell for a second straight month in January . The Commerce Department said on Monday that sales dropped 7.8 percent; economist polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales up nearly 4 percent. \nThe contraction in sales is being blamed largely on a shortage in houses as well as rising mortgage rates. \nLooking at markets overseas, both stocks in Europe and Asia posted solid gains Monday. The German DAX was traded up 0.35 percent while Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed nearly 1.19 percent. \nInvestors will be waiting for news surrounding the NRA's relationship with leading businesses , with a growing list of companies choosing to end their partnerships following the mass shooting at a public high school in Florida.
