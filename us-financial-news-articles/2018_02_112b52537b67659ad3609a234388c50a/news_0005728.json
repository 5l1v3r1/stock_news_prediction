Our partners around the world may have their own views on this,” Barnier told a news conference on Monday. \nBritain will be leaving more than 750 international agreements after Brexit. \nOne issue raised during Wednesday’s briefing was tariff-rate quotas that allow the import of farm products, such as beef and lamb, from fellow World Trade Organization members.

A 'Brexicon' of the UK-EU break-up \nBritain and the European Commission told other WTO members in October how they plan to split the quotas, but this requires unanimous approval from the 164-member WTO. \nAgricultural exporters to the EU have said they would not accept the plan simply to split the quotas based on past trade flows, arguing it would reduce their flexibility.
