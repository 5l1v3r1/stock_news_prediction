If it’s not there, in the majority of the cases ... they will not wait for months.”\nBut some early adopters of ‘see now, buy now’, such as U.S.-based designer Tom Ford, found it backfired.\nFord dropped his one-season dalliance with the concept in 2017, and was Quote: d in industry media saying that his label lost out on a month of selling while clothes sat in storage before the runway presentation.\nFILE PHOTO: A model displays a creation during the Mulberry show at London Fashion Week, in London, Britain February 16, 2018. REUTERS/Paul Hackett/File Photo “There are people who have been tempted by this model and have turned back on it,” said Eve Corrigan, whose Paris-based business Malhia Kent makes fabrics for Chanel, LVMH’s Louis Vuitton and other labels.\nBLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS One challenge is to keep up the pace of sales after an initial rush when an “instant” collection goes live.\nBurberry tweaked the format at its latest show, offering some items such as 350-pound ($490) sneakers in rainbow-colored check for sale immediately, with others to land in the coming months.\nThat twist comes as Italy’s Moncler, maker of 1,000 euro-plus puffer jackets, ditches the usual fashion calendar altogether in favor of monthly product launches.\nIt will unveil designs under the new strategy later on Tuesday ahead of Milan Fashion Week, and aims to start selling the first ones in June.\nMuch depends on brands’ aspirations and business set-up, including whether, like Mulberry, they own the majority of their own shops, meaning they are less reliant on the needs and orders of intermediaries like department stores.\nTo make the instant shopping format work, fashion houses would have to order textiles well in advance of shows, and get early feedback from commercial buyers so they can avoid the risk of unsold stocks piling up.\nBut many argue designers need to be free to make last-minute changes before a show and run with their emotions.\n“Our clients would be tempted to make more low-key clothing to ensure it will be sold, which would be detrimental to their creativity,” Corrigan said.\nTop couture houses from France’s Christian Dior, part of LVMH, to Italy’s Gucci, owned by Kering, have so far resisted the instant runway-to-shop model. “The fact we question the way of working is intelligent,” said Laurent Garigue, a London-based luxury textile producer.\n“(But) we have to make sure fashion doesn’t become less beautiful by organizing it in a way that makes it easier - it’s about blood, sweat and tears.”\nReporting by Sarah White; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T10:39:50.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
