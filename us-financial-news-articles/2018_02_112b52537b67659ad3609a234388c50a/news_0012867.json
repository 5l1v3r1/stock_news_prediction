The company was seeking to replicate the success of its hardware business Bunnings, the market leader in Australia, but instead joins the ranks of other Australian companies that have struggled abroad. \nNational Australia Bank Ltd, one of the nation’s largest, quit Britain in 2016 after struggling with an acquisition of Clydesdale Bank, and law firm Slater & Gordon Ltd made an A$876.5 million writedown on its British acquisition in 2016. \n“It doesn’t matter how big you are here, the challenges when you move offshore are substantial, even when you buy an existing business,” said James McGlew, executive director of Perth stockbroker Argonaut Ltd, which owns Wesfarmers shares. \nThe stock touched a three-month low in early trade, and closed 4.5 percent lower, as the broader market dropped sharply on fears of rising U.S. interest rates. TIME TO QUIT? \nBunnings has posted double-digit growth for the past two quarters, easily fending off a challenge from would-be rival Masters, a short-lived joint-venture between Australia’s Woolworths Group Ltd and U.S.-based Lowe’s Companies Inc. \nHomebase, by contrast, is expected to post a half-year underlying loss of A$165 million for the six months to Dec. 30, Wesfarmers said, adding that it planned to close up to a sixth of its 234 stores in Britain. It did not give a timeframe. \nHomebase is currently under a review due to be finished in June, managing director Scott said. A sale “certainly wouldn’t be the preferred outcome” but all options were under consideration, he added. \nHugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, which owns Wesfarmers shares, said the retailer had found the British market “very different and more fragmented” than what they were used to in Australia. \nWesfarmers booked a A$795 million impairment against Homebase’s goodwill and brand name, plus another A$228 million in store closure costs, stock write-offs and tax writedowns. \nThe A$1.3 billion impairment included a non-cash writedown of A$306 million against struggling Australian discount department store Target. $1 = 0.7092 pounds $1 = 1.2645 Australian dollars Reporting by Tom Westbrook and Byron Kaye in Sydney.
