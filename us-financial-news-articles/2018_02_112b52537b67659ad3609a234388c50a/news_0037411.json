(NASDAQ:AMAG) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Makena® subcutaneous auto-injector drug-device combination product as a ready-to-administer treatment to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with one baby and who spontaneously delivered one preterm baby in the past. The prefilled Makena auto-injector offers a new administration option for patients and providers and contains a shorter, thinner non-visible needle compared to the intramuscular (IM) Makena injection.\n“We are proud to deliver on back-to-back FDA approvals of our next-generation programs for both Makena and Feraheme, and look forward to maximizing the impact that these innovative products can deliver for patients and providers,” said William Heiden, AMAG’s president and chief executive officer. “Today’s approval provides a significant opportunity for us to extend the Makena franchise in 2018 and beyond. We have been preparing for this approval for months and are poised to execute on our aggressive launch plans, leveraging deep relationships with providers and payers in the maternal health space to bring this important therapy to at-risk pregnant women.”\nMakena was approved by the FDA in February 2011 and remains the first and only FDA-approved treatment option currently available for pregnant women who have had a prior spontaneous preterm birth. Makena revenues grew to nearly $400 million in 2017, and the company estimates that approximately half of all eligible patients are currently treated with Makena. While the product’s 7-year orphan drug exclusivity expired earlier this month, the company does not anticipate a generic version of the IM formulation of Makena to enter the market until mid-year. AMAG expects the subcutaneous auto-injector to be available in the second half of March, and the company will continue to offer the IM formulation of Makena in both single-dose and multi-dose vials. The auto-injector will be priced at parity with the IM formulation to help ensure timely and affordable access.\n“About one in 10 babies in the U.S. are born prematurely. The consequences of preterm birth are a significant public health issue, and Makena has served an important medical need for appropriate at-risk pregnant mothers over the past several years,” said Sean Blackwell, M.D., Chair of the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at the University of Texas Medical School and President of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM). “The Makena subcutaneous auto-injector offers healthcare providers an important alternative mode of delivery for patients at risk of recurrent preterm birth.”\n“Our recent regulatory successes are important steps toward achieving AMAG’s growth strategy, which includes broadening the company’s focus on product development and bringing new therapies to market that address important unmet medical needs,” said Julie Krop, M.D., chief medical officer and executive vice president of clinical development and regulatory affairs at AMAG. “The introduction of our next-generation Makena auto-injector underscores our continued commitment to maternal and women’s health. This drug-device combination product, which features a smaller, non-visible needle, was designed to address some of the known barriers to treatment of recurrent preterm birth, including lack of patient acceptance and adherence.”\nThe majority of Makena IM prescriptions flow through the Makena Care Connection, which provides patient support and helps ensure timely and affordable access to Makena therapy. Makena Care Connection services will be extended to assist providers and patients with access to the new Makena auto-injector. These services include prescription support, financial assistance, connecting mothers to home healthcare services and an education and adherence program.\nAMAG developed the Makena auto-injector with its device partner Antares Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATRS), which holds issued patents on the auto-injector device and drug-device combination, the last of which expires in 2034. AMAG also holds a U.S. patent directed to subcutaneous administration and dosing of the Makena auto-injector product which expires in 2036. AMAG will request Orange Book listing of the eligible AMAG and Antares patents.\nToday's approval marks the second sNDA approval this month for AMAG. In addition, the company expects to file a new drug application (NDA) this quarter for a new chemical entity (bremelanotide) to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), a common sexual health condition affecting an estimated 15 million American women. Later this month AMAG plans to report full-year 2017 financial results and provide a company update. The company anticipates providing an update to its financial revenue and earnings guidance on its first quarter earnings call in May.\nAbout Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)\nMakena is a progestin indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth.\nThe effectiveness of Makena is based on improvement in the proportion of women who delivered <37 weeks of gestation. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a direct clinical benefit, such as improvement in neonatal mortality and morbidity.\nLimitation of use: While there are many risk factors for preterm birth, safety and efficacy of Makena has been demonstrated only in women with a prior spontaneous singleton preterm birth. It is not intended for use in women with multiple gestations or other risk factors for preterm birth.\nMakena should not be used in women with any of the following conditions: blood clots or other blood clotting problems, breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, or history of these conditions; unusual vaginal bleeding not related to the current pregnancy, yellowing of the skin due to liver problems during pregnancy, liver problems, including liver tumors, or uncontrolled high blood pressure. Before patients receive Makena, they should tell their healthcare provider if they have an allergy to hydroxyprogesterone caproate, castor oil, or any of the other ingredients in Makena; diabetes or prediabetes, epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma, heart problems, kidney problems, depression, or high blood pressure.\nIn one clinical study, certain complications or events associated with pregnancy occurred more often in women who received Makena. These included miscarriage (pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of pregnancy), stillbirth (fetal death occurring during or after the 20th week of pregnancy), hospital admission for preterm labor, preeclampsia (high blood pressure and too much protein in the urine), gestational hypertension (high blood pressure caused by pregnancy), gestational diabetes, and oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid levels).\nMakena may cause serious side effects including blood clots, allergic reactions, depression, and yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. The most common side effects of Makena include injection site reactions (pain, swelling, itching, bruising, or a hard bump), hives, itching, nausea, and diarrhea. The most common side effects reported with the Makena auto-injector use (and higher than with the Makena intramuscular injection) was injection site pain.\nFor additional product information, including full prescribing information, please visit www.makena.com .\nAbout Bremelanotide\nBremelanotide, an investigational product, is thought to possess a novel mechanism of action, activating endogenous melanocortin pathways involved in sexual desire and response.\nThe Phase 3 studies for HSDD in pre-menopausal women consisted of two double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized parallel group studies comparing on desire use of 1.75 mg of bremelanotide versus placebo, in each case, delivered via a subcutaneous auto-injector. Each trial consisted of more than 600 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the treatment arm or placebo with a 24 week evaluation period. In both clinical trials, bremelanotide met the pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints of median improvement in desire and decrease in distress associated with low sexual desire as measured using validated patient-reported outcome instruments.\nWomen in the trials had the option, after completion of the trial, to continue in an ongoing open-label safety extension study for an additional 52 weeks. Nearly 80% of patients who completed the randomized portion of the study elected to remain in the open-label portion of the study, and all of these patients will continue to receive bremelanotide.\nIn both Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, the most frequent adverse events were nausea, flushing, and headache, which were generally mild-to-moderate in severity.\nAbout AMAG\nAMAG is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering important therapeutics, conducting clinical research in areas of unmet need and creating education and support programs for the patients and families we serve.
