The real estate sector, however, came under pressure after data showed U.S. home sales unexpectedly fell in January.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, were slightly below the four-year peak at 2.8932 percent.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of near-term stock market volatility, eased to a session low of 18.38 and below Friday’s close of 19.46.\nA jump in these two gauges to multi-year highs were at the center of the selloff in equities earlier in the month.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,145 to 649. On the Nasdaq, 2,068 issues rose and 686 fell.\nReporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T17:56:01.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
