Juwan Parker added 13 points.\nThe Bulldogs were just 12 of 19 on free throws (63.2 percent) and 2 of 9 on 3-point attempts (22.2 percent), and they never led. They hit 43.3 percent of their field-goal attempts.\nVanderbilt had fits trying to stop Maten in the second half, helping Georgia go in the bonus with 9:55 left. Commodores starting center Ejike Obinna fouled out with 7:47 left on just 13 minutes of floor time, and that 10th foul put the Bulldogs in the double bonus.\nMaten led Georgia to a 9-0 run that got the Bulldogs to within one early in the second half.\nHowever, the short shots quit falling soon thereafter, allowing Vanderbilt to run away. A Willis 3-pointer with 8:06 left put the Commodores up by a dozen, and Georgia never got within single digits again.\nThe advantage became 16 when forward Toye hit a 3-pointer from the left corner with 6:47 left.\nVanderbilt raced out to a 9-0 lead before Georgia got its first points on a mid-range jumper from guard Teshaun Hightower at 16:05.\nThe biggest advantage in the first half was 11, when Lee tipped in a missed 3-point try from Willis with 2:49 left.\nLee led all scorers with 14 at the break, with LaChance adding nine. Parker and Ogbeide each had eight for Georgia in the first half.\nMaten had two first-half fouls and was limited to six points in nine minutes before the break.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:44:59.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
