Since then at least 20 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed.\nTrump’s reversal of decades of U.S. policy enraged Palestinians, who want to create an independent state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nIsrael captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognised internationally. It says the entire city is its eternal, indivisible capital. It pulled out of Gaza in 2005.\nU.S.-led peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. A bid by Trump’s administration to restart negotiations has shown no real signs of progress.\nReporting by Ali Sawafta, additional reporting by Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem; editing by Alexander Smith and G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T06:30:49.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
