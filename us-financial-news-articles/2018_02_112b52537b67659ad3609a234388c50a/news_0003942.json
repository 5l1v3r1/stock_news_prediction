Tina Weirather of Liechteinstein was third. \nThe U.S. team also had a scare, one day after Jacqueline Wiles crashed and was ruled out of this month’s games in Pyeongchang after fracturing her fibula and tibia and suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament. \nThis time, Stacy Cook fell at over 100 kilometres per hour, crashing dramatically into the safety netting, but staggered to her feet after a few tense minutes and brushed herself down. \nThere was no immediate comment on her condition from the U.S. skiing federation.
