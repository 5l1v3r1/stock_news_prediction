There are reserve days, plenty of time to get competitions in.”\nAlpine skiing race directors have had contingency plans in place for several days after receiving the forecasts of the high winds, which are predicted to ease towards the end of Tuesday.\nThe women’s giant slalom, which will take place at Yongpyong, was moved to Thursday with an earlier start time to allow a window for the men’s downhill, which was postponed on Sunday.\nRunning races on separate mountains on the same day is hardly ideal, however, especially when one, the men’s downhill, is the marquee event of Alpine skiing at the Games.\nThe men’s Super G at Jeongseon Alpine Park has been switched to Friday, previously a rest day, to make room for the downhill.\nDisruption to Alpine skiing competitions is not unusual, however, and it is a rare Games where some re-jigging of the schedule is not necessary.\nThe Alpine skiing at the 1998 Games in Nagano was heavily disrupted by heavy snow and rain and the men’s downhill was rescheduled three times.\nThe schedule for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics was similarly impacted by poor course conditions and bad weather at Whistler with the men’s downhill postponed by two days.\nThere was also some rescheduling of the Alpine skiing at the last Winter Olympics in Sochi when rain, fog and rising temperatures disrupted the final part of the competition.\n“It is a little bit early to discuss (scrapping competitions),” Adams added.\n“Nagano held the downhill five minute before the closing ceremony. We have reserved space so this is a touch premature.” (Additional reporting by Jack Tarrant, Karolos Grohmann and Phil O‘Connor, editing by Greg Stutchbury)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:50:19.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
