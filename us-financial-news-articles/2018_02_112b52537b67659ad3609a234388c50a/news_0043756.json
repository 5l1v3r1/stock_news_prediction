The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead.\nOn Jan. 17, the Chinese government said the sunken tanker had created two oil slicks.\nJapan’s environment ministry said in January it saw little chance that the spill would reach Japanese shores.\nSeawater samples taken from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 at 14 different locations offshore southern Japan detected no oil pollution from the sunken tanker, the Coast Guard said in a separate statement on Wednesday.\nReporting by Osamu TsukimoriWriting by Aaron SheldrickEditing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T06:56:03.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
