If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin’s job for him,” McCain said in a statement. He was referring to the federal probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion by Trump’s campaign.\nReporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-03T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:44:35.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
