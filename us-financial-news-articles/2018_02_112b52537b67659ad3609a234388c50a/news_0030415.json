On an adjusted basis, the Calgary-based company earned 82 Canadian cents, beating the average analyst estimate of 77 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Keystone’s profitability was boosted, among others reasons, by the expansion of its NGTL gas pipeline, Chief Executive Officer Russ Girling said in a statement.
