They’re blocked by the left’s soapbox. Party politics from the 70‘s”, Sampo Terho, minister for European affairs and leader of the co-ruling Blue Reform party, wrote on his Twitter account. \nThe Finnish economy has recovered from a slump and is now growing briskly. But at 8.4 percent, its jobless rate remains higher than unemployment in other Nordic countries, putting a strain on public finances and a generous welfare system in the face of an ageing population.

That violates the 2016 pact, unions say. \n“The government has let us down. We agreed to the competitiveness pact with the condition that unemployment benefits stay untouched. And now they’ve done it anyway,” Jani Polla, a metal worker who had traveled from south-western city of Turku, told Reuters. \nThe government has promised to give more money for services to support jobseekers, noting that the activation model was part of a larger reform package which has been negotiated together with labour unions.
