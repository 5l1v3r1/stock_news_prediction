This revenue increase is comprised of a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase of approximately 0.8%, a 4.7% increase in average daily census, offset by Medicare Cap which reduced revenue 0.9% and acuity mix shift which negatively impacted revenue 1.7%, when compared to the prior-year period.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, VITAS had a 24.3/75.7 RHC Days-of-Care ratio and generated approximately $1.3 million in SIA revenue. This compares to a fourth-quarter 2016 RHC Days-of-Care ratio of 24.2/75.8 and SIA revenue of $1.2 million.\nVITAS recorded $2.4 million in Medicare Cap billing limitations for two programs in the quarter, all of which are related to the 2018 Medicare Cap billing period.\nAt December 31, 2017, VITAS had 30 Medicare provider numbers, two of which have an estimated 2018 Medicare Cap billing limitation.\nOf VITAS’ 30 unique Medicare provider numbers, 25 provider numbers have a Medicare Cap cushion of 10% or greater, three provider numbers have a cap cushion between 5% and 10% and two provider numbers have a Medicare Cap liability on a trailing twelve-month period.\nAverage revenue per patient per day in the quarter was $189.33, which is 1.0% below the prior-year period. Routine home care reimbursement and high acuity care averaged $163.50 and $713.35, respectively. During the quarter, high acuity days of care were 4.7% of total days of care, 58 basis points less than the prior-year quarter.\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 gross margin, excluding Medicare Cap, was 24.5%, which is a 41-basis point improvement when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense was $22.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which is a decrease of 3.2% compared to the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding Medicare Cap, totaled $49.9 million in the quarter, an increase of 7.9%. Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding Medicare Cap, was 16.9% in the quarter which is a 66 basis point improvement when compared to the prior-year period.\nRoto-Rooter\nRoto-Rooter’s plumbing and drain cleaning business generated sales of $136 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $16.8 million, or 14.1%, over the prior-year quarter. Revenue from water restoration totaled $22.1 million, an increase of $8.4 million or, 61.7%, when compared to the prior-year quarter.\nRoto-Rooter’s gross margin in the quarter was 49.3%, a 241 basis point improvement when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $31.1 million, an increase of 24.2%, and the Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.8% in the quarter, 185 basis points higher than the prior year.\nChemed Consolidated\nAs of December 31, 2017, Chemed had total cash and cash equivalents of $11 million and debt of $101 million.\nIn June 2014, Chemed entered into a five-year Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that consisted of a $100 million amortizable term loan and a $350 million revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility has a floating rate that is currently LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $288 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under this credit agreement.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares of Chemed stock in the quarter. Chemed repurchased a total of 500,000 shares in 2017 for $95 million which equates to a cost per share of $189.28. As of December 31, 2017, there was $55.5 million of remaining share repurchase authorization under this plan.\nGuidance for 2018\nRevenue growth for VITAS in 2018, prior to Medicare Cap, is estimated to be in the range of 2.5% to 3.5%. Admissions and Average Daily Census in 2018 are estimated to expand approximately 3% to 4% and full-year Adjusted EBITDA margin, prior to Medicare Cap, is estimated to be 15.4%. We are currently estimating $5.0 million for Medicare Cap billing limitations in the 2018 calendar year.\nRoto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve full-year 2018 revenue growth of 4.0% to 5.0%. This revenue estimate is based upon increased job pricing of approximately 2% and continued growth in water restoration services. Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2018 is estimated at 22.3%.\nBased upon the above, full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding non-cash expense for stock options, costs related to litigation, and other discrete items, is estimated to be in the range of $10.60 to $10.85. This compares to Chemed’s 2017 reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $8.43 . This 2018 guidance assumes an effective corporate tax rate of 25.7%.\nConference Call\nChemed will host a conference call and webcast at 10 a.m., ET, on Thursday, February 15, 2018, to discuss the Company's quarterly results and to provide an update on its business.

In reporting its operating results, Chemed provides EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS measures to help investors and others evaluate the Company’s operating results, compare its operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and evaluate its ability to meet its future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Chemed’s management similarly uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS to assist it in evaluating the performance of the Company across fiscal periods and in assessing how its performance compares to its peer companies. These measures also help Chemed’s management to estimate the resources required to meet Chemed’s future financial obligations and expenditures. Chemed’s EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculated Adjusted EBITDA Margin by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by service revenue and sales.

Telephone directories are generally in circulation 12 months. If a directory is in circulation for a time period greater or less than 12 months, the publisher adjusts the directory billing for the change in billing period. The timing of when a telephone directory is published can and does fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. This \"direct expensing\" results in significant fluctuations in quarterly advertising expense. In the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, GAAP advertising expense for Roto-Rooter totaled $8,145,000 and $7,323,000, respectively. If the expense of the telephone directories were spread over the periods they are in circulation, advertising expense for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 would total $8,809,000 and $7,303,000, respectively.\nSimilarly, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, GAAP advertising expense for Roto-Rooter totaled $31,042,000 and $26,717,000, respectively. If the expense of the telephone directories were spread over the periods they are in circulation, advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 would total $32,413,000 and $28,050,000, respectively.\n(d) VITAS has 11 large (greater than 450 ADC), 16 medium (greater than 200 but less than 450 ADC) and 17 small (less than 200 ADC) hospice programs. Of VITAS' 30 unique Medicare provider numbers, 23 provider numbers have a Medicare cap cushion of 10%, five provider numbers have Medicare cap cushion between 3% and 5% and two provider numbers have a Medicare cap liability for the current cap year.\n(e) Amounts exclude indirect patient care and administrative costs, as well as Medicare Cap billing limitation.\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180214006100/en/\nChemed Corporation\nDavid P.
