Private consumption accounted for about 46 percent of GDP in 2016. \nThursday’s comments reinforced the likelihood of the BOK keeping interest rates KROCRT=ECI on hold at the current 1.50 percent for longer after a widely expected 0.25 percent point hike in November 2017. \nAt 1,419.1 trillion won ($1.31 trillion), South Korea’s household debt is at about 190 percent of GDP, forcing consumers to spend less on items such as food and clothes - weighing on economic growth. \nStill, the bank believes a sharp improvement in exports and recovering investment will spur growth this year with global demand for South Korean memory chips and petrochemical products expected to stay robust. \nSouth Korea’s annual inflation eased to 1.0 percent in January, the slowest in 17 months.
