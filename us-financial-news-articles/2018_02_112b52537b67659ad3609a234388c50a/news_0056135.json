The insurgents said they would commit to a truce, but would respond to any violation by the Syrian government and its allies.\nThe U.N. Security Council adopted the resolution on Saturday, as one of the deadliest air assaults of the seven-year war pounded eastern Ghouta this week.\nReporting by Ellen Francis, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T11:05:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
