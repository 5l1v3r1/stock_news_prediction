All I can say about the situation is that this is the best decision for Leicester, in the best interests of Leicester. It is also the best decision for Riyad,” Puel told a news conference on Friday. \n”The position with Riyad, we will assess after the transfer window. It is a tough decision for us to manage now. \n“It is important now to move on and to keep our focus on the pitch. I hope Riyad can clear his head and come back with us as he is a valuable player for us and crucial in our play. We will deal with his side and the club, not in public.” \nMahrez, an instrumental figure in the club’s remarkable Premier League title triumph in 2016, has scored nine goals and made seven assists in all competitions this season.
