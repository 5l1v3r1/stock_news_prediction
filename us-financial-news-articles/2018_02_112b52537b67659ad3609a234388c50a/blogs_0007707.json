For the first time, Google provided some color on its cloud unit, saying that it now brings in $1 billion per quarter. That's perhaps more than expected , but still a long way from achieving the lofty goal that cloud guru Urs HÃ¶lzle stated several years back of turning Google into a cloud company by 2020.\nAdam Jeffery | CNBC Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, at the New York Economic Club on May 22, 2017.

Alphabet reeled in $1.2 billion from its \"Other Bets\" this year, while cutting its operating losses to $3.4 billion, down from $4.6 billion in 2016.\nThat revenue growth was primarily driven by Nest, Fiber, and Verily, Porat said, adding that Alphabet was able to drop its capex to $570 million from $1.4 billion in 2016 by reducing its investment in Fiber, the high-speed internet service that required it to dig up gardens .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:10:41.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
