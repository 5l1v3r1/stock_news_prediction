But he added it has not fundamentally shifted into a higher gear due to the recent U.S. tax cuts or other factors. Fed officials have said since late last year that they expect three rate hikes to be appropriate for this year.\nReporting by Ann Saphir Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:32:28.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
