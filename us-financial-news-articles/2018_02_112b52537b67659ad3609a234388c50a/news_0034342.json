The stock surged 18 percent on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.\nTrading in Harbin Pharma shares has been suspended since Sept. 28 last year, pending ownership change and assets reorganization, according to its filings to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\nThe deal comes at a time when GNC faces growing competition from online rivals and amid a wider move among customers toward organic foods rather than supplements.\nChina, however, has been a bright spot for GNC, which sells vitamins and herbal supplements, and has become one of the top sellers on China’s online shopping platforms.\nHarbin Pharma produces more than 20 dosage forms and over 1,000 drugs, including antibiotics, over-the-counter products, modern Chinese medicines, and animal vaccines. CITIC Capital Holdings Ltd, the private equity arm of state-owned Citic Group Corp [CITIC.UL], is a major shareholder in Harbin Pharma.\nA definitive agreement on the China joint venture is conditional on the deal’s completion.\nGoldman Sachs & Co was GNC’s financial adviser on the deal, while Morgan Stanley & Co LLC and PingAn Securities advised Harbin Pharma, the companies said.\nReporting by Kane Wu; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T06:35:17.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
