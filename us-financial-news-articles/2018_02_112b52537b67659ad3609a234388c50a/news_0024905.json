Trump last year lifted long-standing sanctions against Sudan, saying it had made progress fighting terrorism and easing humanitarian distress, in a major turnaround for Bashir’s government. \nBut he kept Sudan on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism - alongside Iran and Syria - which carries a ban on weapons sales and restrictions on U.S. aid, according to U.S. officials. \nThe news agency gave no reason for the shake-up at the security agency. Moula last week accompanied Sudanese Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour to Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials on topics including security and water issues. \nGosh was detained in 2012 and held for several months on suspicion of “inciting chaos”, “targeting” some leaders and spreading rumors about President Omar Hassan al-Bashir’s health, the information minister said at the time, but Gosh was released without going on trial. \nHe served as a security adviser to Bashir for two years prior to his arrest. \nThe New York Times reported in 2005 that U.S. intelligence officials had allowed Gosh to visit the country for consultation with the CIA as a reward for his country’s cooperation in detaining suspected militants and providing information on al Qaeda following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
