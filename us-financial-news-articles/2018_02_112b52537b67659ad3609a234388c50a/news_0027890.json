They profit from our style of play as well. They play in areas where they like to have the ball. \n“But, in this strong league, you cannot be third without fantastic players. They are two of them.” \nLiverpool play Porto in the Champions League knockout stages on Wednesday followed by a league fixture against West Ham United on Feb. 24.
