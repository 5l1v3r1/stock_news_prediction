Richard Weil, co-chief executive of Janus Henderson Group plc, which owns the VelocityShares brand and markets the product, said last week they are “performing as advertised.”\nOther firms stood behind their products. ProShare Advisors LLC, run by the manager of a competing product not being pulled off the market, said that fund’s performance “was consistent with its objective and reflected the changes in the level of its underlying index” and that they “intend to continue to manage the fund as usual.”\nThiam said XIV contributes approximately 10 million Swiss francs ($10.7 million) in revenue to the bank, a drop in the bucket for a bank that pulled in 20.9 billion francs in 2017.\n“It’s not material, and yet Credit Suisse looked like they blew the world up because they happen to have their name as the ETN issuer,” said Jack Fonss, a fund structuring consultant who previously worked at Credit Suisse and later created a volatility product that competed with XIV.\n“The thing worked for so long and it attracted so many assets and it was free money.”\nSo far, investors are validating banks’ and asset managers’ decisions to stay in the volatility business.\nEven in a period that U.S.-based inverse-volatility notes sank by as much as 96 percent, a group of those products tracked by Thomson Reuters’ Lipper unit attracted nearly $257 million in new cash from investors during the most recent week. Some investors burned by the steep drop in such products told Reuters they would use them again.\nUBS Group AG launched two volatility products last year in the United States that are tied to the European equity market. They declined to comment.\nJust last month, Barclays plc rolled out two volatility-tracking notes that effectively replace existing products that were already due to end their lives next year. Unlike XIV, those Barclays’ iPath products are meant to profit when VIX futures increase in value.\nThe company is also de-listing or redeeming its relatively small U.S.-listed inverse VIX products in April, a decision that was made before XIV ran into issues. Barclays declined to comment.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York, Simon Jessop in London, Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi in Zurich and Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T00:12:02.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
