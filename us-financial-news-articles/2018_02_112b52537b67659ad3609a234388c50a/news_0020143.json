These Six Nations games do become, if nothing else, mentally attritional. By the time we came back from Paris on Sunday evening, we had some fairly sore, tired bodies.” \nSchmidt said he was delighted to get out of the opener with the points after Ireland surrendered a game-long lead with less than 10 minutes to go, but that they had to be better at building up a more commanding advantage in the weeks ahead. \n“We felt that we stayed in control of that match for a long time. I think in a test match of that magnitude it only takes one lapse for a team to get back into the game and we want to make sure those lapses aren’t repeated,” Schmidt said. \n“Yes there are things we need to be better at, some of our platforms didn’t quite provide what we were looking for. You don’t just want control, you want to dominate and we have to be better than that.” \nIreland team \n15-Rob Kearney, 14-Keith Earls, 13-Robbie Henshaw, 12-Bundee Aki, 11-Jacob Stockdale, 10-Johnny Sexton, 9-Conor Murray; 8-Jack Conan, 7-Dan Leavy, 6-Peter O‘Mahony, 5-Devin Toner, 4-Iain Henderson, 3-Tadhg Furlong, 2-Rory Best (captain), 1-Jack McGrath. \nReplacements: 16-Sean Cronin, 17-Cian Healy, 18-Andrew Porter, 19-Quinn Roux, 20-CJ Stander, 21-Kieran Marmion, 22-Joey Carbery, 23-Jordan Larmour.
