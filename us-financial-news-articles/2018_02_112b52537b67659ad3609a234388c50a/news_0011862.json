The state-owned airline once owned minority stakes in eight other carriers.\nAt the time of the bond issues through EAP, they were seen as strengthening Etihad’s partnerships with the other airlines. However, it has since sold two, while Alitalia and Air Berlin have declared insolvency.\nEtihad posted its first loss in six years in 2016 and began a strategic overhaul. Last month it pulled its Airbus freighter fleet from service and asked some pilots to take unpaid leave.\nCOMPLEX SOLUTIONS None of the potential solutions are straightforward, the sources said, but Etihad could reach one over the next few weeks and one idea being considered, two sources said, is that Etihad could buy Alitalia’s mini-bond within EAP.\nEtihad agreed at the end of 2016 to repay the principal of Alitalia’s portion of debt issued by EAP, equivalent to $235 million. But this was signed before Alitalia’s workers rejected a restructuring plan for the Italian carrier in early 2017, leading the company to bankruptcy.\nWith Alitalia now under administration, it is not clear whether the agreement would succeed in repaying Alitalia’s debt in the EAP bonds, as it could be used by the administrator to repay Alitalia’s more senior creditors.\nAlitalia did not respond to a request for comment.\nAnother option might be for Etihad to pay directly into the EAP bonds’ liquidity pool, to guarantee coupon payments.\n“If Etihad does nothing, they’ll end up paying a lot. If they don’t try to save EAP, their reputation for sophisticated financial management would take a battering,” one source said.\nAdditional reporting by Alexander Cornwell; editing by Andrew Torchia and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T18:29:41.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
