This represents a year-over-year increase of €0.15, or 12% compared to last year's dividend of €1.25. If the shareholders approve this recommendation and if treasury shares remain at the 2017 closing level, the total amount of dividends to be distributed will be approximately €1.67 billion (2016: €1.5 billion), representing a pay-out ratio of 41% (2016: 41%). Further, SAP has increased the dividend policy to 40% or more of profit after tax (previously more than 35%).\n\"With strong growth and positive cash flow in 2017, we had a very successful year. We are recommending a 12% higher dividend, so our shareholders will participate greatly in this success,\" said Luka Mucic, Chief Financial Officer, SAP. \"Further, to emphasize our attractive dividend, we are adjusting our dividend policy upwards, to consistently pay an annual dividend of 40% or more of profit after tax.\"\nThe Annual General Meeting of Shareholders is scheduled for May 17, 2018 in Mannheim, Germany. The 2017 fiscal year dividend is scheduled to be paid on or after May 22, 2018.\nNote to holders of SAP ADRs (American Depositary Receipts): One SAP ADR represents one SAP SE share. The final dividend amount per ADR is dependent upon the euro/US dollar exchange rate. Since SAP SE pays cash dividends on the ordinary shares in euro, the exchange rate fluctuations will affect the US dollar amounts received by holders of ADRs. The final dividend payment by SAP SE to the depositary bank is scheduled for May 22, 2018. The depositary bank will then convert the dividend payment from euro into US dollars as promptly as practicable.\nAbout SAP\nAs a market leader in enterprise application software, SAP (NYSE: SAP) helps companies of all sizes and industries run better.
