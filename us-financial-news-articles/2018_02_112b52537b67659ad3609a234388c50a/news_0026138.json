In December, both price readings had jumped to their highest levels in months.\nGovernment data showing a strong rise in U.S. wage growth in January prompted, last week, the worst stocks selloff in two years. Investors said the volatile drop was due to worries that a pick-up in U.S. inflation would force the central bank to raise rates quicker than expected.\nThe Fed raised rates three times last year even as inflation dipped. With signs that prices may be turning around, the Fed is expected to hike again in March. The key U.S. CPI inflation reading for January is set to be published on Wednesday.\nThe New York Fed survey, in which a third party taps a rotating panel of about 1,200 household heads, also found less uncertainty about inflation expectations.\nReporting by Jonathan SpicerEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T19:23:06.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
