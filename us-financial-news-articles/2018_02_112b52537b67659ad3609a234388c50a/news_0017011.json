Net income was higher across all of our operating segments compared to 2016, however these results were predominantly offset by the impact of non-cash movements on foreign currency hedges. The prior year period also included non-recurring gains of $190 million related to our toll road and ports businesses.\nFFO of $1.17 billion increased by 24% compared to the prior year. Results reflect the contribution of new investments, as well as organic growth of 10% across the company. Our payout ratio 6 for the period was 68%, which remains within our target range of 60-70%.\n“2017 was a strong year for Brookfield Infrastructure, completing a successful decade for the business. We posted solid financial results, acquired a large marquee utility, invested almost $1 billion across our various networks and strengthened our balance sheet,” said Sam Pollock, Chief Executive Officer of Brookfield Infrastructure. “Upon completion of the sale of our Chilean electricity transmission operation, corporate liquidity is expected to be approximately $3 billion. We are well positioned to fund our organic growth project backlog and execute on several interesting new investment opportunities that we are currently pursuing.”\nSegment Performance\nOur utilities segment contributed FFO of $610 million for 2017 compared to $399 million in the prior year. This step-change increase was primarily attributable to contribution from our newly acquired Brazilian regulated gas transmission business, and to a lesser extent, an increase in our rate base and upward inflation adjustments in our other utility businesses. Results were modestly offset by the impact of the sale of our Canadian electricity transmission asset in late 2016.\nOur transport segment reported FFO of $532 million in 2017, which was 26% ahead of the prior year. This increase was driven by higher tariffs and volumes across a number of our operations. Results for this segment were positively impacted by full-year contribution from new investments in our toll road and ports businesses, organic growth of 13% from year-over-year volume growth predominantly at our toll road businesses, and positive foreign exchange movements.\nOur energy segment generated FFO of $209 million in 2017, compared to $175 million in the prior year. This improvement in results captures the incremental contribution from new contracts, higher gas transport volumes and reduced leverage at our natural gas transmission operations. We also benefited from a full-year contribution from the newly acquired gas storage business in North America, which was partially offset by the impact of the sale of a U.K. gas distribution business in 2016.\nOur communications infrastructure segment contributed FFO of $76 million for the year which was consistent with the prior year. The business delivered results in-line with expectations as a result of its stable and predictable cash flow profile.\nThe following table presents FFO by segment:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31 Year Ended\nDecember 31\nUS$ millions, unaudited 2017 2016 2017 2016 FFO by segment Utilities $ 172 $ 97 $ 610 $ 399 Transport 139 115 532 423 Energy 56 52 209 175 Communications Infrastructure 19 20 76 77 Corporate (73 ) (39 ) (257 ) (130 ) FFO $ 313 $ 245 $ 1,170 $ 944 Update on Strategic Initiatives\nCapital Recycling\nChilean electricity transmission – In December, we signed definitive agreements to sell Brookfield Infrastructure’s approximately 28% interest in Transelec, our Chilean electricity transmission business for $1.3 billion ($1.1 billion net of applicable taxes). While Transelec generated strong and predictable cash flows throughout the time we held it, it has now matured and the net proceeds from the sale can be reinvested for unitholders at significantly higher returns. Upon closing, we will have generated a compound internal rate of return on this investment of approximately 16% since acquisition (18% pre-tax). Closing is subject to customary closing conditions, certain third-party consents and applicable regulatory approvals and is targeted to occur in the first half of 2018.\nPending Transaction\nColombian regulated gas distribution – In November, we signed a binding agreement to acquire a minimum 53% controlling interest in Gas Natural S.A. ESP (“GN Colombia”), the second largest natural gas distribution system in Colombia. GN Colombia operates a high-quality distribution system with regulated revenues and predictable cash flows. At the end of December, we acquired an initial stake of 11% of GN Colombia for $105 million (BIP’s share – $30 million) and we will be making subsequent investments in a staged approach, which may result in Brookfield Infrastructure and our institutional partners owning all or virtually all of the company.\nBalance Sheet Update\nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet to prepare to execute on investment opportunities. Subsequent to quarter end, a preferred unit issuance was completed for C$200 million, capitalizing on Brookfield Infrastructure’s investment grade credit rating and strong market demand. Corporate liquidity is approximately $2 billion inclusive of this issuance.\nDistribution Increase\nThe Board of Directors has declared a quarterly distribution in the amount of $0.47 per unit, payable on or about March 29, 2018 to unitholders of record as at the close of business on February 28, 2018. This distribution represents an 8% increase compared to the prior year. The regular quarterly dividends on the Cumulative Class A Preferred Limited Partnership Units, Series 1, Series 3, Series 5, Series 7 and Series 9 have also been declared.\nAdditional Information\nThe Board has reviewed and approved this news release, including the summarized unaudited financial information contained herein.\nBrookfield Infrastructure’s Letter to Unitholders and Supplemental Information are available at www.brookfield.com/infrastructure .\nBrookfield Infrastructure Partners is a leading global infrastructure company that owns and operates high-quality, long-life assets in the utilities, transport, energy and communications infrastructure sectors across North and South America, Asia Pacific and Europe.
