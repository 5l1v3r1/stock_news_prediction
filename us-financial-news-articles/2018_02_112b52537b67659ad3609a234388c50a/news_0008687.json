Esa Lindell also got an assist on the play.\nIt was the only score on the power play in eight combined man-advantage chances for the two teams, five of them for Dallas.\nThe Stars forged a 41-32 advantage in shots on goal, while New York had more hits than Dallas (30-26) and more blocks (28-13).\nThe Rangers have lost five of their past six games.\nDallas outshot the Rangers 21-9 in the first period, but New York had the one shot that counted the most. David Desharnais deflected a shot on goal, scooped up his own rebound and tucked the puck in behind Dallas goaltender Ben Bishop for a 1-0 Rangers lead at the 17:55 mark. Vinni Lettieri and J.T. Miller were given assists in the goal.\nThe Stars tied the game on a goal by Tyler Seguin with 5:16 to play in the second period. Seguin’s slap shot from the top of the circle bounced off the post and New York goalie Henrik Lundqvist’s blocker.\nJason Spezza and Alexander Radulov assisted on the tally, which was Seguin’s 26th of the season, tied for seventh best in the NHL.\nLundqvist made 39 saves, while Bishop stopped 31 shots in the win.\nDallas returns to the ice on Thursday in Chicago while the Rangers head back to the Big Apple for games Wednesday and Friday against Boston and Calgary, respectively.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T12:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:51:27.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
