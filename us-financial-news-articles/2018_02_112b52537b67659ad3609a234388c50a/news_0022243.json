The company reported turnover of 18.0 billion crowns and a margin of 8.4 percent for full-year 2017.\n“In 2018, we expect increasing revenue and a higher EBITA margin,” the company said in a statement.\nAhead of the earnings release, analysts were on average expecting the group’s revenues to be 18.8 billion crowns this year with an EBITA margin of 9.2 percent.\n$1 = 6.0276 Danish crowns Reporting by Niklas Pollard and Johannes Hellstrom; Editing by Simon Johnson and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:44:32.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
