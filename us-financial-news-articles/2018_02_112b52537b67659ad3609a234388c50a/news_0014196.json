That followed a very sedate 0.1 percent gain the previous quarter.\nFILE PHOTO: Business people walk outside the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in Sydney May 5, 2015. REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo The revival greatly improved the outlook for GDP growth, given household spending accounts for around 57 percent of annual economic output.\nConsumers are spending elsewhere too with new vehicle sales hitting another record in January. Besides, measures of business and consumer confidence have also lifted in recent weeks.\nFourth quarter GDP data is due on March 7.\nDespite all that, household consumption still remained a source of uncertainty for the RBA, Lowe said.\nConsumer spending has been under pressure from record-high household debt and sluggish wage growth, one reason the RBA is in no rush to raise interest rates from record lows.\nInflation has undershot the RBA’s 2-3 target for more than two years now and it is only expected to pick up gradually.\nFutures markets imply around a 50-50 chance of a hike by November and are not fully priced for a rise until early next year. The local dollar slipped further after the RBA statement to $0.7849.\nOther data out Tuesday showed Australia recorded a trade deficit of A$1.36 billion ($1.07 billion) in December, confounding forecasts of a A$200 million surplus.\nHowever, November’s result was revised sharply to show a surplus of A$36 million, from an initial deficit of A$628 million, in part reflecting updated prices for iron ore and coal.\n($1 = 1.2698 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T07:14:29.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
