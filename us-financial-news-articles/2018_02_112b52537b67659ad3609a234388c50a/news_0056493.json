(“Centennial” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:CDEV) today announced financial and operational results for the full year 2017 and 2018 operational plans and targets.\nRecent Financial and Operational Highlights:\nIncreased fourth quarter daily crude oil production 30% quarter-over-quarter Grew 2017 daily oil and equivalent production volumes 233% and 278% year-over-year, respectively Delivered strong well results from the Northern and Southern Delaware Basins Successfully completed wells in the 3 rd Bone Spring Sand and Carbonate in Reeves County, Texas Increased 2017 total proved reserves 125% at attractive finding and development costs with organic reserves replacement ratio over 950% Acquired approximately 4,000 net acres in Lea County, New Mexico adjacent to Company’s existing position Announced pending sale of approximately 8,600 mostly non-operated net acres in Reeves County, Texas\nFinancial and Operational Plan:\nExpect to grow 2018 crude oil production approximately 85% year-over-year Expect to increase 2018 total company production approximately 86% year-over-year Plan to maintain seven rig drilling program throughout 2018 Announced full year 2018 total capital budget of $885 million to $1,050 million Increased 2020 oil production growth target from 60,000 to 65,000 barrels per day (“Bbls/d”)\nFinancial Results\nCentennial reported 2017 net income of $75.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, net income increased 111% to $30.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $14.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the third quarter 2017.\nCrude oil production increased 30% to 27,402 Bbls/d compared to the third quarter 2017. For the full year 2017, average daily oil and total equivalent production volumes increased to 19,161 Bbls/d and 31,864 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“Boe/d”), or 233% and 278% compared to 2016, respectively.\n“In our first full year of operation, Centennial delivered on the 2017 goals we articulated last March. After raising production targets three times during the year, the Company delivered oil production that ultimately exceeded the high-end of our 2017 guidance range. Within a short period of time, we assembled one of the highest quality technical teams in the industry,” said Mark G. Papa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Based on the Company’s strong operational outperformance in 2017 and the continued confidence in our technical capability, we are increasing our 2020 oil production target to 65,000 barrels per day, which is likely one of the highest four-year oil growth rates in the E&P industry.”\nOperational Update\nIn Reeves County, Texas, Centennial posted a number of strong well results from multiple zones in the Southern Delaware Basin. Targeting the 3 rd Bone Spring Sand, the Weaver C T34H (86% WI) was Centennial’s first well in the horizon using modern completion techniques. The well was drilled with an approximate 9,350 foot lateral and tested at an IP-10 rate of 2,072 Boe/d (75% oil).\n“We are excited about the initial results of the Weaver. Based on early flowback, it appears comparable to a strong Upper Wolfcamp A well,” Papa said. “It's encouraging to see positive industry results from the same zone offsetting our acreage. We expect to drill additional wells in the 3 rd Bone Spring Sand during the year and test the viability of co-developing this zone with the Wolfcamp.”\nAdditionally, Centennial drilled the Big House C 3H (100% WI), one of the industry's first 3 rd Bone Spring Carbonate tests in Reeves County. The well was drilled with a short 4,150 foot lateral and produced 806 Boe/d (60% oil) for the initial 30-day production period. The well proved an important test for the Company, and plans are to drill a two-mile lateral later in the year to further test the economics of the zone. Centennial is in the early stages of testing several Bone Spring intervals on its Reeves County acreage and will continue to evaluate these zones throughout the year.\nCentennial's ongoing Wolfcamp development program in Reeves County drove its strong fourth quarter oil production growth profile. The Blackstone West 1H and 2H were drilled in the Upper Wolfcamp A interval with 880-foot spacing and approximate 4,115 foot laterals. The Blackstone West 1H (100% WI) produced 1,745 Boe/d (81% oil) for the initial 30-day production period. The Blackstone West 2H (100% WI) reported an initial 30-day production rate of 1,316 Boe/d (82% oil). On a per lateral foot basis, the Blackstone West 1H and 2H delivered initial 30-day oil production rates of 342 and 263 Bbls/d per 1,000 foot of lateral, respectively.\nTargeting the Upper Wolfcamp A, the Big House A 4 57-60 1H and 2H were drilled using 660-foot spacing, or eight wells per section, with average 7,040 foot effective laterals on the Company’s Silverback acreage. The Big House A 4 57-60 1H (100% WI) achieved an initial 30-day production rate of 2,705 Boe/d (52% oil). The Big House A 4 57-60 2H (100% WI) achieved an initial 30-day production rate of 2,731 Boe/d (53% oil). During its initial 60-day production period, the two well-pad produced approximately 137,300 barrels of oil.\n“The Big House A 4 57-60 was a positive 660-foot test. To date, our development program and drilling inventory has been based on 880-foot spacing. With continued successful down-spacing tests, there is the potential to meaningfully increase our drilling inventory in this area. We plan additional spacing and delineation tests throughout the year,” Papa said. “We drilled these wells with extended laterals reflecting our shift to more efficient, higher return drilling operations. During the fourth quarter, we completed more extended lateral wells than in the first three quarters of the year combined.”\nThe Company drilled the Sundown 1H (82% WI) on the southern portion of its Reeves County acreage position with an approximate 4,150 foot effective lateral targeting the Lower Wolfcamp A interval. The well achieved an initial 30-day production rate of 1,263 Boe/d (88% oil), with 268 Bbls/d of oil per 1,000 foot of lateral.\nIn the Northern Delaware Basin, Centennial reported strong results from its first wells completed in different intervals in Lea County, New Mexico. The Pirate State 101H (100% WI), Centennial’s first operated well, was completed in the Avalon Shale with an approximate 4,190 foot effective lateral and delivered an initial 30-day production rate of 1,112 Boe/d (79% oil). The Tour Bus 23 State 503H and 504H (both 100% WI) were completed in the 2 nd Bone Spring with an average effective lateral length of 4,040 feet. The wells averaged 1,016 Boe/d (83% oil) for the initial 30-day production period.\n“We continue to see higher well productivity from our enhanced completion techniques. Centennial’s current completion design represents a 30% increase in pounds of proppant per foot and an 80% increase in clusters per stage, compared to 2016,” Papa said. “We expect to combine these new completion techniques with longer laterals to improve the overall drilling returns of our capital program in 2018.”\nCentennial reported total 2017 drilling and completion (\"D&C\") capital expenditures incurred of approximately $624 million. D&C capital expenditures incurred for the fourth quarter were approximately $226 million, compared to $163 million in the third quarter 2017.\n2018 Operational Plans and Targets\nThe Company is targeting total company production growth of 86% during 2018. Centennial added a seventh drilling rig in February and plans to continue operating a seven rig program throughout the year. With a focus on capital returns, Centennial expects the majority of its wells drilled during the year to be extended laterals on multi-well pads.\nDuring 2018, Centennial expects to operate six of its seven rigs in Reeves County, where it will spend approximately 85% of the total operated D&C capital budget. Centennial will focus its Reeves County activity in the Upper Wolfcamp A zone following successful results from its 2017 capital program, with plans to develop additional zones throughout the year. The remaining operated rig and associated D&C capital will be allocated to a newly expanded Lea County position. (For a detailed table summarizing Centennial’s 2018 operational and financial guidance, please see the Appendix of this press release.)\n“In 2018, we expect to grow our annual oil production by approximately 85% while maintaining a low and differentiated leverage profile,” Papa said. “We remain focused on generating corporate returns for our shareholders and estimate our 2018 total capital program could generate GAAP return on equity and return on capital employed of approximately seven to ten percent, assuming $60 oil.”\nEstimated fiscal year 2018 total capital budget is approximately $885 million to $1,050 million, including D&C capital, facilities, infrastructure, seismic, land and other expenditures. Centennial’s production profile is predicated on a D&C budget of $710 million to $820 million, of which approximately 90% is associated with operated activity. To support future production growth, in 2018 Centennial has allocated approximately $125 million to $160 million to facilities, infrastructure and other, which includes production facilities, saltwater disposal wells, water pipeline infrastructure and seismic, among other capitalized items.\nAcreage Position Update\nOn February 8, 2018, Centennial acquired approximately 4,000 net acres in Lea County, New Mexico from OneEnergy Partners, LLC for a total purchase price of $95 million. The operated acreage position contains an average 95% working interest and is largely contiguous to Centennial’s existing position. Centennial has identified approximately 100 gross horizontal locations on the acreage, which are additive to its existing inventory in Lea County.\nCentennial also entered into a definitive agreement with an undisclosed third-party for the sale of approximately 8,600 net acres in Reeves County for a purchase price of $141 million. The divested acreage represents a largely non-operated position (average 32% WI) on the western portion of Centennial’s position in Reeves County. 2017 average net production on the divested acreage was less than 250 Boe/d, or less than 1% of total company production. The transaction is expected to close on March 1, 2018, subject to customary closing terms and conditions.\n“These transactions are consistent with our strategy to own and operate high-quality acreage in the Delaware Basin. The acquisition increases our Northern Delaware position by approximately thirty percent to over 16,000 net acres and adds operated locations to our inventory in Lea County,” Papa said. “The net of these two transactions will upgrade our overall portfolio. We basically sold acreage with low working interest in Reeves County for higher quality, operated acreage in Lea County.”\n(For a map summarizing Centennial’s recent acquisition and divestiture, please see the presentation materials on Centennial’s website under the Investor Relations tab.)\nYear-End 2017 Proved Reserves\nCentennial reported a 125% increase in year-end 2017 total proved reserves to 186,454 MBoe, consisting of 54% oil, 29% natural gas and 17% natural gas liquids. Proved developed reserves increased by 197% to 74,929 MBoe (40% of total proved reserves) as reflecting the continued successful development of the Company's horizontal well inventory. During 2017, Centennial’s organic reserves replacement ratio was 954%. The Company's 2017 proved developed finding and development cost totaled $10.62 per Boe. Centennial's drill-bit finding and development cost was $5.47 per Boe for 2017. Using SEC prices and discounting the present value at 10% (“PV-10”), the value of Centennial’s total proved reserves at December 31, 2017 increased 309% to $1,748 million, and Centennial had a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of $1,503 million. Netherland Sewell & Associates, Inc., an independent reserve engineering firm, prepared Centennial’s year-end reserves estimates as of December 31, 2017. (For additional information relating to our reserves, in addition to an explanation of how we calculate and use the organic reserve replacement ratio and finding and development costs, please see the Appendix of this press release.)\nCapital Structure and Liquidity\nAs Centennial had approximately $117 million in cash on hand and $400 million outstanding of long-term debt. During the fourth quarter 2017, Centennial bolstered its liquidity position and extended debt maturities by issuing $400 million of 5.375% senior notes due in 2026, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $391 million which were used to fully repay borrowings under the Company’s credit facility and pre-fund capital expenditures. As total liquidity was approximately $591 million, which included $474 million of availability under the revolving credit facility.\nHedge Position\nAs of February 26, 2018, Centennial had no crude oil or natural gas hedges in-place. (For a summary table of crude oil and natural gas basis swap contracts as please see the Appendix of this press release.)\n“Despite the recent increase in U.S. oil production, we remain bullish on the macro crude oil environment given current supply and demand fundamentals, showing strong global demand and declining global inventories. As a result, our future oil production will remain unhedged until we see a change in these market fundamentals,” Papa said.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nCentennial’s financial statements and related footnotes will be available in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is expected be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 26, 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast\nCentennial will host an investor conference call on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Mountain (10:00 a.m. Eastern) to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 operating and financial results and 2018 outlook.

We define Adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration costs, impairment and abandonment expenses, non-cash gains or losses on derivatives, non-cash stock-based compensation, gains and losses from the sale of assets, transaction costs and write-off of deferred offering costs. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income as determined by GAAP.\nOur management believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful as it allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to net income, our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP:\nSuccessor Predecessor (in thousands) Three\nMonths\nEnded\nDecember\n31, 2017 Year\nEnded\nDecember\n31,

considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC and is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (the ‘‘Standardized Measure’’), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV 10% is computed on the same basis as the Standardized Measure but without deducting future income taxes. We believe pre-tax PV 10% is a useful measure for investors when evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. We further believe investors may utilize our pre-tax PV 10% as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to other companies because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Our management uses this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and gas properties and acquisitions. However, pre-tax PV 10% is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our pre-tax PV 10% and Standardized Measure do not purport to present the fair value of our proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves.\nThe following table summarizes the approximate volumes and average contract prices of swap contracts the Company had in place as of December 31, 2017:\nPeriod Volume (Bbl) Weighted\nAverage\nDifferential\n($/Bbl) (1) Crude oil basis swaps January 2018 - June 2018 905,000 $ 0.18 January 2018 - December 2018 1,825,000 $ 0.00\n(1) The oil basis swap transactions are settled based on the difference between the arithmetic average of the ARGUS MIDLAND WTI and ARGUS WTI CUSHING settlements, during the relevant calculation period.\nPeriod Volume (MMBtu) Weighted\nAverage\nDifferential\n($/MMBtu) (1) Natural gas basis swaps January 2018 - December 2018 1,825,000 $ (0.43 ) January 2019 - December 2019 1,825,000 $ (0.43 )", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Qp6Zicwz5vpGYJc9kYLO3kRrNdIlwXDf90nUj2qc1DUa9PKFalDhb2Qs6T0kk4zVHFDMlkVAefWC2-XFrfgkAA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Qp6Zicwz5vpGYJc9kYLO3v6SStrbBRZdHYgv2qlzrztOKOvgzCCVCx0XYKfdldlpCUWaropd7i_YsIBJAu3X3Q==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=iofzPAsYD-lhdz0IadQ3a9J3-iYqIGR7UItjPX5iAWpKqfgLqRZIDDt49libQ3ynDuek9WPgDHpBFLEnhgEjdQ=="], "published": "2018-02-27T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:17:53.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
