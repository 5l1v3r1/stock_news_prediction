Ahed Tamimi, 17, has drawn international attention following her arrest after the Dec. 15 confrontation with an Israeli officer and a soldier outside her West Bank home of Nabi Saleh. The incident was streamed live on Facebook by her mother and went viral. Tamimi and her mother, Nariman, were arrested a few days later. On Tuesday morning Tamimi, wearing prison uniform and with her hands and feet in restraints, was led into the courtroom at the Ofer military prison near Ramallah for preliminary trial hearings. Her father Bassem, the only member of her family in the courtroom, said to her: “How are you? Stay strong.” Palestinian teen Ahed Tamimi enters a military courtroom escorted by Israeli security personnel as her lawyer Gaby Lasky (L) stands near, at Ofer Prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Ammar Awad The teenager faces 12 charges, including aggravated assault. An adult could be jailed for up to 10 years, but such an outcome is considered unlikely for a minor who was 16 when the incident happened. The case has polarized opinion. Some Israelis have accused her of courting publicity and being a troublemaker. Palestinians say she was protesting against Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. On the eve of her latest appearance the human rights group Amnesty International called for her immediate release.

Tamimi remains in custody.
