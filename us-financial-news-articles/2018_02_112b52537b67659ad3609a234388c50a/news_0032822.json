It will fly there three times a week, allowing Britons to join German, French and Belgian holidaymakers who have been going for the last two years.\nTUI Group, the operator with whom the victims had travelled, said last month it too planned to offer holidays in Tunisia again, starting in May.\n“It’s amazing to come back to Tunisia with my husband. I’ll go to Sousse and I‘m not afraid,” a British tourist who have her name as Julia said. “Tunisia is obviously very secure. I want to spend a pleasant holiday again in the nice resort of Sousse.”\nREVENUES UP TUI said its decision to resume holidays to Tunisia was due to returning appetite. Tunisia’s tourism revenues rose by 15.7 percent to 150 million dinars ($63 million) in January versus the same period last year, central bank data showed.\n“We opened the destination because demand was there, that’s very clear,” CEO Fritz Joussen said after the company announced its first quarter results.\nNeji Ben Othman, the general director in the tourism ministry, told Reuters he hoped the return of Thomas Cook would encourage other Europeans to return too.\nLast year, the number of tourists visiting Tunisia rose by some 23 percent as hotels filled beds with Russian and Algerian visitors, but operators say they spend less than Western European holidaymakers during their stay.
