Operating profit from the networks business fell 25 percent year-on-year. \nChief Executive Rajeev Suri cautioned that its worldwide network sales were expected to remain weak, but a potential rebound of spending by operators in the Americas could help. \n“We expect our market to decline again in 2018, although at a slightly lower rate than our previous forecast, given early signs of improved conditions in North America,” he said in a statement. \nHe said he expected market conditions to improve markedly in 2019 and 2020 due to rollouts of next-generation 5G networks.
