The company has said that it expects to lift its full-year revenue by at least 6 percent and increase its operating profit “significantly”.\nVoestalpine shares traded 3.5 percent lower at 47.72 euros at 0850 GMT. The stock gained around a third in 2017, outperforming rivals Arcelor Mittal and United States Steel which have seen their shares rise 29 and 7 percent respectively in the period.
