(NASDAQ:AGIO), a leader in the field of cellular metabolism to treat cancer and rare genetic diseases, today reported business highlights and financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, Agios highlighted select 2018 corporate milestones and data presentations for its clinical development programs.\n“2017 was an extraordinary year for Agios with the U.S. approval of IDHIFA ® , our first internally discovered and developed drug, the NDA submission for our wholly owned medicine ivosidenib and our sixth IND submission since the company’s inception,” said David Schenkein, M.D., chief executive officer at Agios. “It was a data-rich year where we set the stage for building long-term value across our cancer and rare disease portfolios. Execution in 2018 will be equally critical as we ready our organization for the potential approval and launch of ivosidenib, initiate our pivotal program for AG-348 in pyruvate kinase deficiency and advance our robust discovery portfolio.”\nKEY UPCOMING MILESTONES\nThe company plans to achieve the following key milestones in 2018:\nCancer:\nPotential approval and commercialization of ivosidenib in the United States for relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation in the third quarter of 2018.

The decrease in cash was driven by expenditures to fund operations of $306.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. These expenditures were offset by an increase in cash driven by net proceeds of $270.2 million from the April follow on offering, $17.0 million of cost reimbursements under our collaboration agreements with Celgene and $14.2 million received from employee stock transactions.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $43.0 million, which includes $41.1 million of collaboration revenue and $1.9 million of royalty revenue from net sales of IDHIFA ® . Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $69.9 million, which included a $25.0 million milestone payment related to the initiation of the Phase 3 IDHENTIFY trial with IDHIFA ® under the 2010 Agreement.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $292.7 million, including $30.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $220.2 million, including $25.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in R&D expense was primarily attributable to the ivosidenib program, including manufacturing and regulatory activities to prepare the NDA submission, start-up costs for the Phase 3 AGILE clinical trial, and on-going site activation and patient enrollment of the Phase 3 ClarIDHy clinical trial. R&D expense also increased compared to the prior year due to IND enabling activities for AG-270.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $71.1 million, including $17.0 million of stock-based compensation expense, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $50.7 million, including $16.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in G&A expense was primarily attributable to an increase of $21.1 million to support our growing commercial organization for the launch of IDHIFA ® and the potential launch of ivosidenib in 2018.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $314.7 million, compared to a net loss of $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCASH GUIDANCE\nIn January, Agios completed an underwritten public offering of 8,152,986 shares of common stock, which includes the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 1,063,433 shares, at the offering price of $67.00 per share, resulting in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of approximately $516.2 million.\nThe company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017, together with the net proceeds from the recent financing, anticipated product and royalty revenue, anticipated interest income, and anticipated expense reimbursements, but excluding any additional program-specific milestone payments, will enable the company to fund its anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of 2020.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nAgios will host a conference call and live webcast with slides today at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and recent business activities.
