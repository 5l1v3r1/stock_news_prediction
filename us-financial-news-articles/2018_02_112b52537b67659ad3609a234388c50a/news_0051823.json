But they are so close to our amendments,” he said.\nStarmer said Labour backed staying in a customs union to preserve trade in its biggest markets after Britain leaves the European Union in March 2019, and because it is the best way of avoiding the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n“Obviously it’s the only way realistically to get tariff-free access,” he said.\n“It is really important for our manufacturing base, nobody can answer the question how you keep your commitment to no hard border in Northern Ireland without a customs union,” he said.\nBritain’s next national election is scheduled for 2022.\nReporting By Andrew MacAskill; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T12:39:55.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
