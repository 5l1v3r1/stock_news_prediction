A data center can typically employ a few hundred people. \nThe company is also planning a “massive expansion” into San Jose, Calif., not far from its Mountain View headquarters, according to CNN . \nFacebook (fb) and Apple (aapl) are also planning to build out more facilities and hire more staff across the U.S., and jobs are a key part of Amazon’s pitch for a second North American headquarters. \nAlphabet’s adjusted earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations when they were released Thursday. Google’s traffic acquisition costs are increasing, and then there was a one-time $9.9 billion tax charge relating to recent changes in tax law. \nThose contributed to a $3 billion quarterly net loss, as did operating losses from Alphabet’s “Other Bets” unit. \nOverall revenues beat analyst forecasts, though, increasing 24% to $32.3 billion. Google’s enterprise unit, including its cloud business, is notably expanding.
