Analysts projected profit of 377 million reais in the period, according to consensus estimates compiled by Reuters. \nSame-store sales, a measure of sales at stores open for at least 12 months, climbed 8.7 percent from the same period a year before in the fourth-quarter, below an estimate of 9.6 percent by analysts at BTG Pactual. \nOperational costs, meanwhile, shot up 22.8 percent, with a heavy increase in general and administrative costs putting pressure on margins. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 6.3 percent in the quarter to 603 million reais, below a Reuters estimate of 661 million reais. \nRenner, based in the southern city of Porto Alegre, has become an investor-darling as an effective transition from a traditional department store to a tech-savvy fast-fashion retailer - combined with a consumer-led rebound in Brazil - has boosted sales and profit. Shares in 2017 climbed over 70 percent. \nHowever, results have occasionally come in below analysts' lofty expectations. \n(Reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Chris Reese and Diane Craft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T02:51:31.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
