Philly Philly! Apparently, there was a pretty nail-biting game of football Sunday between all the ads. But that isn’t what you’re here for. Let’s dive in to the biggest marketing stories from NBC’s sold-out Super Bowl LII.\nRoll Tide! Tide Pod Challenge? What Tide Pod Challenge? The Procter & Gamble detergent brand was earning PR for the right reasons on game day, purchasing ads in every quarter. The spots played on tired Super Bowl ad tropes to push the idea that perhaps every ad is a Tide ad. David Harbour, of “Stranger Things” fame, ran viewers through several stereotypical Super Bowl ad scenes , from the nerdy insurance guy with a tie and a clipboard, to the “hilarious” beer spot and the return of the “Old Spice Guy.” What’s the one thing they all have in common? Everyone’s wearing spotlessly clean clothes. A simple, if expensive, idea that no doubt boosted brand recall as viewers second-guessed whether the next commercial they watched was really a Tide ad. Adweek has the behind-the-scenes detail on how the campaign, created by Saatchi & Saatchi New York, came about.\n—The Madison Avenue View—\nTide was the big winner among users of the networking app Fishbowl, where professionals can have semi-anonymous discussions about their industries. More than 25% of advertising professionals from the top ad agencies in the U.S. are on Fishbowl, the company tells me, and Tide made up 27% of Super Bowl discussions on the app on the night. “TIDE, JUST TAKE THE LION ALREADY,” one Grey employee wrote.\nFly Eagles Fly! NFL : A charming spot starring New York Giants Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr., with their own take on the classic “Dirty Dancing” theme dance.\nPhoto: NFL/Grey New York Coca-Cola : Coke earned plaudits from some viewers on Twitter for using the nonbinary “them” pronoun in a heartwarming ad championing diversity.\nTourism Australia : Actors Chris Hemsworth, Paul Hogan and Danny McBride potentially had viewers thinking a “Crocodile Dundee” reboot was in the works, before the big reveal that the ad was actually a tourism campaign.\nDoritos Blaze and Mountain Dew Ice : Morgan Freeman and “Game of Thrones” actor Peter Dinklage partake in an epic lip-sync battle in this combined ad for the pair of PepsiCo brands.\nAmazon : Alexa has “lost her voice” in this ad. But fear not, Jeff Bezos (who makes a cameo)! Amazon’s execs have come up with a killer plan: celebrity replacements—and lots of them. Anthony Hopkins, Rebel Wilson, Cardi B and Gordon Ramsay all star in the fun 90-second spot. Bonus: A fun read from Bloomberg on the lengths Amazon went to in order to ensure people’s Echos wouldn’t light up in their living rooms every time the word “Alexa” was uttered.\nNetflix : The streaming giant dropped a huge surprise during the Super Bowl with the trailer for the latest “Cloverfield” movie, “The Cloverfield Paradox.” And in another twist on the usual movie marketing playbook, the film was made available on Netflix right after the game.\nRequiem For a Theme As you’re probably gathering, humor was a key theme of many Super Bowl spots. Diversity was also a common topic , as WSJ reported. Aside from Coca-Cola, T-Mobile US ran a spot with a bevy of cute babies, promoting racial and gender equality, and Toyota ran three shots with a diversity theme, including one showing a rabbi, imam and priest all enjoying the football together. Some observers also noticed a “humanitarian” theme , the New York Times reported. Beer makers Stella Artois and Budweiser, for example, both ran ads focusing on their philanthropic efforts, while Verizon’s spot thanked first responders. And then there was Dodge Ram…\nRambusters CMO Today’s Suzanne Vranica reports : Not all brands scored touchdowns. A spot from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which promoted Dodge Ram by using the audio from a Martin Luther King Jr. speech , was widely criticized online. Many people expressed outrage that his words would be used to sell trucks. “That was a disrespectful Dodge Ram commercial esp during #BlackHistoryMonth,” one tweet read . Brandwatch, a firm that tracks brand mentions on sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, said Dodge Ram was mentioned about 24,700 times from 6:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., and half the mentions were negative. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles issued a statement Sunday, saying Dr. King gave said speech exactly 50 years ago. “Ram was honored to have the privilege of working with the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. to celebrate those words during the largest TV viewing event annually,” the statement continued.\nYou Can Still Advertise in the Dark Did you notice the approximately 20-second blackout in the second quarter? As CNN reported, some people thought their TV sets had given up, while others speculated a brand was running an attention-grabbing ad, a la Chevy in 2015 . Not so this time. NBC Sports said the glitch was due to a “brief equipment failure.” But even though the blackout appeared to fall in the ad break, NBC said “no game action or commercial time was missed.” As CNN’s Brian Stelter points out, that might indicate that only network promos were due to be shown during that time and that NBC won’t have to cough up any expensive make-goods for the millions of dollars of airtime an advertiser might have missed. If we’ve learned anything by now, social media managers love a good blackout. Brands including Tide and Doritos immediately seized upon the opportunity—although neither of their efforts really set Twitter on fire. Oreo’s social team appears to have been taking the night off this year.\nThe Super Social Bowl Justin Timberlake performs onstage during the Pepsi Super Bowl LII Halftime Show. Photo: Getty Images I’m always a little skeptical of using social media mentions to declare the Super Bowl ad winner, but nevertheless, it is a good way to take the temperature of what people were discussing on the night. Pepsi was the most talked-about brand during the Super Bowl, with 254,518 tweets sent about the brand from 6.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m., according to marketing tech company Amobee. That was somewhat engineered, though, as Pepsi ran a sweepstakes competition, offering prizes to people using a dedicated hashtag. Pepsi also ran an ad, with a new take on Cindy Crawford’s famous Super Bowl commercial from 1992 . And, of course, Pepsi once again sponsored the halftime show, which saw a performance from Justin Timberlake featuring dodgy audio and an even dodgier outfit—although thankfully no Nipplegate this time around. But it was rival Coca-Cola who won the hearts of viewers. Amobee says Coca-Cola earned the most “real-time positive sentiment” of all the big-game advertisers: 78% of tweets about the brand on the night were positive.\nTop 10 most tweeted-about brands during the Super Bowl (Amobee):\n1. Pepsi — 254,518 tweets\n2. “Avengers: Infinity War” — 150,234 tweets\n3. “Solo: A Star Wars Story” — 88,998 tweets\n4. Tide — 76,436 tweets\n5. “The Cloverfield Paradox” — 51,109 tweets\n6. “Mission: Impossible Fallout” — 34,008 tweets\n7. “Westworld” — 33,116 tweets\n8. “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” — 31,622 tweets\n9. Dodge Ram — 29,187 tweets\n10. Doritos — 28,557 tweets\nBest of the rest Companies big and small are eschewing celebrities and are making their lesser-known founders their brand ambassadors instead. [ WSJ ]\nDrugstore staples such as CoverGirl, Maybelline and Revlon are employing new marketing techniques to win back women as they lose ground to smaller rivals. [ WSJ ]\nMore than half of the launch partners for Facebook’s Instant Articles appear to have abandoned it, according to research from Tow Center. [ Columbia Journalism Review ]\nBig brands in the consumer-staples space are losing their pricing power. [ Financial Times ]\nAustralian telecoms company Telstra has written off its investment in video platform Ooyala and has said it will exit the ad tech business. Telstra had invested $270 million to boost its stake in Ooyala to 98% in 2014. [ CMO ]\nAdvertising agencies are rethinking their dating policies.
