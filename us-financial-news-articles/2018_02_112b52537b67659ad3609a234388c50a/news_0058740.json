Of 6,833 potential mergers notified to the Commission since 1990, only 27 have been rejected.\nThe European Commission rejected the proposed 5.2 billion euro deal in 2013, saying UPS had not offered sufficient concessions to allay concerns that the deal would hurt consumers. UPS challenged this decision.\nThe General Court of the European Union, the EU’s second highest court, found that the Commission had infringed UPS’s rights of defense by relying on a different econometric model in its analysis than that used in previous exchanges of views and arguments.\nThe Commission has appealed against that court ruling.\nU.S. rival FedEx ( FDX.N ) acquired TNT in 2015, winning unconditional EU regulatory approval.\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop/Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:21:20.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
