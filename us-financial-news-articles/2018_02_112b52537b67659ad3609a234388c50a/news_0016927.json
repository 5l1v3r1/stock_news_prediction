Investors use earnings multiples to judge whether a stock looks cheap or overvalued. reut.rs/2BHl6P3\nPrior to the selloff that began last Friday, the S&P 500 was trading at 18.2 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14.5. In December, the S&P 500’s forward PE reached as high as 18.9 before analysts began to increase their estimates for companies reporting their fourth-quarter results.\nWall Street's largest companies are not the only ones to have seen their earnings valuations decline in recent sessions. The S&P 600 index of small-cap U.S. companies ended Monday at 18.2 times expected earnings, its lowest level since before August last year, which is the most recent data collected by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. reut.rs/2Bgxe8q\nAlthough Wall Street’s recent selloff accounts for part of the recent dip in the S&P 500’s earnings valuation, analysts’ earnings estimates for companies have also been steadily rising, fueled by corporate tax cuts passed by Congress in December as well as by an improving global economy.\nS&P 500 components are expected by analysts to grow their earnings per share in 2018 by 18.4 percent. At the start of January, analysts estimated that S&P 500 EPS would rise 12 percent in 2018. reut.rs/2BIAomq\n(Data for all graphics provided by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S)\nReporting by Noel Randewich Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://reut.rs/2BIAomq", "http://reut.rs/2BHl6P3", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://reut.rs/2Bgxe8q"], "published": "2018-02-07T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:51:40.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
