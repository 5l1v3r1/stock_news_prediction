A roll-call at the girls’ school in the village of Dapchi, Yobe state, on Tuesday showed 91 students were absent.\nThe kidnapping may be one of the largest since Boko Haram abducted more than 270 schoolgirls from the northeastern town of Chibok in 2014. Many of those girls are still being held, though others have escaped or been freed for ransom.\n“This is a national disaster. We are sorry that this could have happened and share your pain,” Buhari said in a statement directed to the parents of the missing girls.\nEarlier in the week he sent more security forces and a ministerial team to the area.\nBoko Haram, whose name roughly translates as “Western education is forbidden” in the Hausa language, is trying to create a state adhering to a strict interpretation of Islamic law.\nThe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said the tragedy of the Chibok girls’ abduction had not been forgotten and described the latest kidnapping as a “new horror”.\nIt said more than 2,295 teachers hade been killed and almost 1,400 schools destroyed since the jihadist insurgency began in 2009.\nReporting by Stephanie Ulmer-Nebehay in Geneva and Felix Onuah in Abuja; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram and Chijioke Ohuocha; Editing by Kevin Liffey\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:38:03.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
