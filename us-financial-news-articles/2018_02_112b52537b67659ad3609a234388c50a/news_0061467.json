He was taken into custody without incident about 30 to 45 minutes later, police spokesman Bruce Frazier told reporters later. \nThe suspect was later identified as Jesse Randall Davidson, 53, a social studies teacher at the school who police said also serves as the play-by-play announcer for the Dalton High School football team. \nThe incident began when a group of students tried to enter the classroom, “and the teacher was not letting anybody inside,” Frazier said. \nWhen the principal arrived and tried opening the door with a key, a single gunshot was heard from inside the room, prompting a security lockdown of the school as police were notified and the school’s resource officer was summoned, Frazier said. \nArriving police evacuated teachers and students from the hallway as they confronted the instructor. \nFrazier said he had no immediate explanation for what may have precipitated the incident, and he declined to say whether he believed it stemmed from a suicide attempt, but added: “This teacher apparently did not want to involve students in this incident in any way.” \nThe incident came two weeks after a shooting rampage at a high school in Parkland, Florida, left 17 dead and led to calls from U.S. President Donald Trump for arming teachers as a way to protect students. \nOnly one minor injury was reported on Wednesday - a girl who hurt her ankle while fleeing in the pandemonium, Frazier said. \nThe police spokesman said it was not immediately clear whether any students had previously been in a classroom with the teacher while he was armed. The weapon involved was a handgun, he said. \nStudents at the high school, which has an enrollment of about 2,000 pupils, were all being taken to a nearby convention center in Dalton, authorities said. \n“It is really serious after so many things have happened all over the country,” student Ricardo Perez told television station WTVC-TV in a telephone interview after the incident. “I‘m shocked, I can’t believe it. I thought it was a dream.” \nReporting by Jonathan Allen, Joseph Ax, Gina Cherelus and Peter Szekely in New York; Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago and Keith Coffman in Denver; writing by Steve Gorman; editing by G Crosse and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T21:02:14.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
