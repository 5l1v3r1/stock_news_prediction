We can handle the risk and the merchandising from within the sugar milling business,\" he said. \nLast year was another tough year for sugar traders and producers, with raw sugar prices tumbling more than 20 percent. \nIn addition to its eight sugarcane mills in top sugar producer Brazil, Bunge is a major player in the global sugar trade, with a strong destination book. \nIts Brazilian mills can produce both sugar and ethanol and have a capacity of more than 20 million tones, according to Bunge's website. \nBunge is the target of a takeover offer by larger rival Archer Daniels Midland Co, which wound down its global sugar trading in 2015.
