Details of the contract and its value were undisclosed.\nThe world’s third-biggest ad group negotiated with Daimler at the holding company level for about six months and beat its two bigger rivals WPP ( WPP.L ) and Omnicom ( OMC.N ) to win the contract, according to the internal memo sent to Publicis employees.\nMercedes-Benz is aiming to give a more consistent look worldwide to its brand and better coordinate its central and local digital content that spans 40 markets, the German company said in a separate statement.\nPublicis, whose revenue and margins have been under pressure in a sector marked by the rise of tech giants Facebook ( FB.O ) and Alphabet’s Google ( GOOGL.O ), as well as new competition from consulting firms like Accenture ( ACN.N ), is betting on the expertise of its digital arm Publicis.Sapient to win new business.\nPublicis will create a dedicated agency, dubbed Publicis Emil, using resources from different agencies that it wants to see better collaborate. The agency will be based in Berlin and led by Justin Billingsley, chief operating officer of Publicis’s creative division.\nReporting by Mathieu Rosemain and Gwenaelle Barzic; Additional reporting by Edward Taylor in Frankfurt; Editing by David Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:16:47.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
