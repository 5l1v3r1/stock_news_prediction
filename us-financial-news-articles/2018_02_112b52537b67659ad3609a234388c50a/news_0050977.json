Before upgrading its target, analysts had wondered whether Metro Bank would have to compromise on credit quality in order to meet its goals.\nThe deal, financed using cash from the bank’s existing resources, is expected to complete on March 1.\nMetro Bank on Wednesday reported its first annual profit, raising its 2020 targets and saying it would open 12 branches this year, creating 900 jobs.\n($1 = 0.7155 pounds)\nReporting by Emma Rumney, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:22:39.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
