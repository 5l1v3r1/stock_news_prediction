It tried to sell two of its plants in judicial auctions last years, but in both cases Brazil’s development bank BNDES, who is a large Renuka creditor, obtained injunctions blocking the auctions.\nCastlelake and Shree Renuka did not immediately return requests for comments.\nThe Revati mill is a relatively new, large installation with capacity to process four million tonnes of cane per year.\nThe two sources, who asked not to be named, said the private equity group is set to present a formal proposal in March, if it manages to secure agreements with cane suppliers in the region.\nOne of the sources also said Castlelake is negotiating with Shree Renuka for the company to stop operations on its second plant in the region, called Madhu, as a way for the Revati mill to have more cane supplies, being able to operate at higher capacity. The source said there is disagreement over this aspect.\nCastlelake would like Renuka to transfer all cane supplying contracts for a period of three years, but the Indian firm would agree to a shorter period, of two years.\nThere are no guarantees that a deal would not be affected by other court hurdles, since Renuka holds around 3 billion reais ($928.53 million) in debt.\n$1 = 3.2309 reais Writing by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:23:53.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
