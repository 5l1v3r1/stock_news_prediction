Designed by the architect Franklin Azzi, the building offers light-filled spaces with an area of about 1,920 s qm for the full-sized floors as well as a large range of services for occupiers: staff canteen, cafeteria, indoor garden and furnished terraces. All this comes with an outstanding level of environmental performance, meeting international standards (NF HQE Construction Exceptional, HQE Exploitation Excellent, BBC Effinergie - RT 2005).\nThe office building is entirely leased to two blue-chip occupiers: Kérudys (SVP group) and RSI (Régime Social des Indépendants).\n“The fully owned Dock-en-Seine building is a solid investment for SCPI Accimmo Pierre, thanks to its fully guaranteed rental status. Its outstanding connections make it part of the dynamism of the Grand Paris project” explains Guillaume Delattre, Deputy General Manager of BNP Paribas REIM France, in charge of Investments.\n\"For Gecina, the sale of this building, in conditions that comply with the Group's requirements, is part of the sales plan announced upon the acquisition of Eurosic,\" comments Méka Brunel, Gecina's Chief Executive Officer.\nIn this transaction, BNP Paribas REIM France was advised by Thibierge; Gecina was advised by BNP Paribas Real Estate Transaction France as part of a co-exclusive mandate with Catella and the Oudot & Associés study.\nGecina, living the city in a different way\nGecina owns, manages and develops property holdings worth 19.5 billion euros at end-August 2017, with nearly 92% located in the Paris Region.
