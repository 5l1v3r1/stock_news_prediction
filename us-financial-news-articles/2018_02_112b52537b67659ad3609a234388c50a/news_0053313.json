The premium is paid by customers above the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark.\nThis was below the $88 a ton 2018 premium offered by the world’s biggest copper miner, Codelco [COBRE.UL].\nReporting by Michael Hogan; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:28:37.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
