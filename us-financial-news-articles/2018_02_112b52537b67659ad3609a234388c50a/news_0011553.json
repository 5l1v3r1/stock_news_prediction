Qualcomm will have no further comment on the proposal until its Board of Directors has completed its review.\nOn November 13, 2017, Qualcomm's Board of Directors unanimously rejected Broadcom's non-binding, unsolicited proposal to acquire Qualcomm for per share consideration of $60.00 in cash and $10.00 in Broadcom stock. After a comprehensive review, conducted in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, the Board concluded that Broadcom's proposal dramatically undervalues Qualcomm and comes with significant regulatory uncertainty, and therefore is not in the best interests of Qualcomm stockholders.\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Evercore and Centerview Partners are acting as financial advisors to Qualcomm. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and DLA Piper LLP (US) are acting as legal advisors to Qualcomm.\nAbout Qualcomm\nQualcomm invents breakthrough technologies that transform how the world connects and communicates.
