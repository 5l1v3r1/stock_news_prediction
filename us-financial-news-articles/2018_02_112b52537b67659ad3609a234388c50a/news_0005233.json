REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo Critics called it an effort to increase division within the opposition and weaken turnout.\nLEADERS JAILED OR BARRED October’s gubernatorial elections were a warning sign of how the Socialist Party can score electoral victories despite fury over economic mismanagement.\nEven though polls showed the opposition winning most of the 23 governorships, Maduro allies took 18 of them as a result of heavy abstention.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Many insisted that participating in the vote was legitimizing Maduro’s government following what they said was a power grab with the creation of an all-powerful legislature called the Constitutional Assembly in a July ballot boycotted by the opposition.\nThe governors’ vote gave Maduro a political boost and left the opposition divided and squabbling. It boycotted elections for 335 mayors in December, further fueling abstentionism.\nWith the election at most three months away, the opposition still does not have a standard bearer.\nAnd the field of candidates has been heavily limited by the government’s aggressive moves to jail its best-known leaders or bar them from politics.\nTwo-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles is banned from holding office. Former Mayor Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest for leading protests against Maduro while his protege Freddy Guevara is holed up in the residence of the Chilean ambassador, seeking to avoid arrest on similar accusations.\nHowever, former union leader Andres Velasquez has shown interest in a presidential bid, while ex-Lara state Governor Henri Falcon has called on the opposition to unite behind him. Former Congress chief Henry Ramos has also said he would run in opposition primaries.\nBoth Ramos and Falcon have done better in recent polls than Maduro, according to Luis Vicente Leon, director of pollster Datanalisis, adding that Maduro is widely rejected by the population.\nBut doubts about the fairness of elections and limited motivation following the opposition’s recent ballot box fiascos may make that irrelevant.\n“The opposition is indeed the majority, but that won’t matter if it make can’t mobilize its people in an election,” Leon said in a telephone interview.\n Andreina Aponte; Editing by Alexandra Ulmer and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T08:21:46.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
