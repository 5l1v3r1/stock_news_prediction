Fitch also has an investment grade on Russia which it left unchanged late on Friday.\nMarket players expect demand for Russian state bonds to increase as major international funds require two investment grades as a minimum to invest in a country’s financial instruments.\nLONG-AWAITED MOVE\nThe Russian finance ministry had said before it expected international rating agencies to upgrade Russia after it lived through the peak of economic turmoil in 2014-2015. But the agencies avoided rapid moves as they contemplated Western sanctions and Russia’s tepid economic activity.\nIn its report, S&P lowered Russia’s rating outlook to stable from positive, but said it expects “broad policy continuity and macroeconomic stability” after the election.\n“In the longer term, the limited track record and uncertainty surrounding the succession of power could undermine predictability of policy priorities,” it said.\nThe agency praised Russia’s policy response to lower commodity prices and international sanctions, highlighting its strong net external asset position, low government debt and the central bank’s monetary policy.\nIt forecast economic growth at 1.8 percent this year, continuing to recover through to 2021, and noted that Western sanctions would remain in place through the forecast horizon.\n“Sanctions will continue to limit Russia’s trend growth and economic diversification efforts due to high investor uncertainty and constraints on technology transfer.”\nReporting by Andrey Ostroukh in Moscow and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Clelia Oziel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:45:37.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
