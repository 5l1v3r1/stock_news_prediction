Several producers expressed frustration at what they called creative interference by Amazon executives, often leading to production delays and greater expenses. David E. Kelley, who created the legal drama “Goliath” for Amazon told The Wall Street Journal last fall that the company is “in way over their heads.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T21:38:31.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
