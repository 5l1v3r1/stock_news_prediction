The initial investment will cover the expenses associated with the drilling of the first few target wells and expenses associated with preparing the acquisition of the field (environmental review, purchase agreement, etc.). The permitting and AFE process for the first few drilling locations will begin immediately and the entire transaction should be completed in the next 60 days.\n“I am very excited to bring you all this news. It has been a very smooth process working with the new financial partners, but it has taken a long time to get all of the agreements in place. The new partners are obviously bringing money to the project but, most importantly, they have substantial oil and gas exploration experience and some of their own team members are going to take full time roles at the White Top field through the initial phase of drilling,” commented CEO Alex Walsh. “This should be a very exciting project and, ultimately, our projections put us cash-flow-positive by the end of 2018, ensuring that we will continue on as a 'going concern' for the next decade.”\nAbout Lithium Exploration Group\nLithium Exploration Group is a US-based exploration and development company focused on the acquisition and development potential of lithium brines and other precious metals that demonstrate high probability for near-term production.
