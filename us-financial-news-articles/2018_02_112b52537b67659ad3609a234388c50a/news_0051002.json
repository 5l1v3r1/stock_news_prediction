REUTERS/SaumyaÊKhandelwal Trump Jr. said he had been coming to India for more than a decade to build business for The Trump Organisation and it had reached a take-off stage but there were self-imposed curbs following the election of his father as president.\n“I learnt about doing business here through the school of hard knocks, we have built partnerships here,” he said.\nSlideshow (3 Images) This week he was wooing buyers to book luxury apartments in Trump Towers in Gurgaon on the outskirts of New Delhi as well as in Mumbai, attending champagne receptions.\nTrump’s partners in India are playing up the Trump brand. In the days leading up to Trump Jr.’s visit, one of its development partners in Gurgaon began an advertising campaign in newspapers offering dinner and conversation with the president’s son.\nBut Trump said his company could not build on the gains it had made in India because of the curbs over the past year.\n“Ten years of hard work to get there, this would be a time to capitalize, but its a sacrifice, its a big sacrifice,” he said. “But we will be back, once we are out of politics.”\nShortly before taking office last year, Trump Sr. said he would hand off control of his business empire, which includes luxury homes and hotels across the world, to his sons Donald and Eric, and move his assets into a trust to help ensure that he would not consciously take actions as president that would benefit him personally.\nSeveral government and private ethics watchdogs said he should have gone further, divesting himself of assets that could cause a conflict of interest.\nReporting by Sanjeev Miglani and Manoj Kumar; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T19:44:55.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
