It’s more about skiing it better than it is about taking risks. The risk isn’t going to be a reward here.” \nHe was followed by Norwegian medal contender Kjetil Jansrud (1:40.76) with Swiss Mauro Caviezel third fastest (1:40.90) and defending champion Matthias Mayer just off podium pace in fourth (1:41.20). \n“It was a little bit slower than I expected but it’s a really nice downhill,” said Austrian Mayer, who skied the race of his life to win gold in Sochi four years ago. \n“I think everyone wants to be fast here but I‘m feeling good in my mood.” Alpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Downhill Training – Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 8, 2018 - Manuel Osborne-Paradis of Canada trains. REUTERS/Mike Segar \nBeat Feuz, the reigning downhill world champion after his triumph in St. Moritz last year, was 15th quickest in 1:41.86 and thought the conditions could make for some fast times on Sunday. \n“It’s a very fine slope. It’s cold, which is good for the piste. It’s a slope where a lot of people can ski very fast,” said the Swiss.
