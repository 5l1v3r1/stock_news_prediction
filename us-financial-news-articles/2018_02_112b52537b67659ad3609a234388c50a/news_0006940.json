Nacional won the first leg 1-0 in Brazil. \nChapecoense requested that “the judgment take place before Feb 7 or that the game be delayed until after the judgment”. \n“Chapecoense is asking for Nacional to be excluded from the ... Libertadores,” the club said in a statement. \nThe Uruguayan club apologized on behalf of their fans in an open letter published on Thursday and a day later identified one of those responsible and stripped him of his club membership.

The winner will qualify for the third and final qualifying round ahead of the group stages.
