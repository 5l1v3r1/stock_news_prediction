Credit portfolio manager Marina Lutova left to join hedge fund Citadel LLC. All left in December.\nMichael Mauboussin joined BlueMountain as director of research in May and Lance Rosen arrived in June as head of equities.\nBlueMountain’s Credit Alternatives Fund gained 1 percent last year and 1 percent in the first month of trading in 2018, according to a report from HSBC’s Alternative Investment Group seen by Reuters. The firm’s Global Volatility Fund gained 0.05 percent in 2017 and climbed 0.39 percent in January. The hedge fund benchmark HFRI Asset Weighted Composite Index gained 6.5 percent for the year.
