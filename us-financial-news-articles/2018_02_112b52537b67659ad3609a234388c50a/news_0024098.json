The Tar Heels went 4-for-6 on free throws the rest of the way.\nThe first half had several fluctuations, with N.C. State leading 37-35 at the break.\nNorth Carolina built a 28-18 lead, but N.C. State followed with a 19-0 run. During that stretch North Carolina didn’t call for a timeout, but the Tar Heels missed 13 shots in a row.\nThe Tar Heels had 11 first-half turnovers after matching a program low with two in the entire game against Duke.
