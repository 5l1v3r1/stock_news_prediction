Markets widely expect the central bank to enact a quarter-point hike in March, then perhaps two more the rest of the year. \n\"I have more confidence in the durability of the expansion and more confidence that the Federal Reserve is going to have to continue to more monetary policy accommodation,\" he said. \nIf he saw the stock sell-off persist and threaten to choke off business and household spending, Dudley said he might change his view.
