Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\nTwin Cities business leader and entrepreneur Margaret Murphy recently launched Bold Orange with a two-fold purpose: to create business and societal progress. The acquisition of the Grand Rapids, Michigan-based company that provides the gift card fundraising platform ShopWithScrip.com complements both of those principles.\n“Great Lakes Scrip Center has done a fantastic job of deepening connections among communities, loyal supporters and the brands they love, and we are excited to build on that legacy and drive greater engagement for our partner and retail organizations and the millions of families that are connected through this powerful network,” said Margaret Murphy, Bold Orange founder and CEO. “Together with their talented team of employees, we plan to blend traditional scrip fundraising with a more modern digital experience – connecting with people in ways that are even easier, more relevant, and more meaningful.”\n“Building this company over the last 23 years has been an incredibly fulfilling journey for my family and all of our dedicated employees,” said Jack Smith, former GLSC CEO. “We are thrilled to be handing over the leadership at this exciting time in our industry to Margaret Murphy and Bold Orange.”\nFor more than two decades, GLSC has helped over 48,000 local organizations and nonprofits such as schools, community groups, sports teams, and churches raise more than $680 million for needs such as computers, tuition, band instruments, athletic equipment, or church operations all while driving $9 billion in revenue to partner brands.\nThose brands include Starbucks, Target, Amazon, Safeway, Best Buy and Delta Air Lines among more than 750 others. GLSC works with the local organizations to sell the branded gift cards to their supporters, who in turn, use the cards to shop at their favorite stores, both online and at brick-and-mortar. A percentage of every gift card purchase is returned to the organization as a rebate and can be used to fund its initiatives. Thousands of private K-12 schools across the country also allow families to apply a portion of the funds they raise toward their family tuition.\nBold Orange will be investing in the online experience and marketing tools to make GLSC even easier for organizations, their supporters, and brand partners to engage.\n“This move is a significant step for Bold Orange, and a natural extension of our goal to help companies relate in more personal and relevant ways,” Murphy added. “By making them part of an experience built around local initiatives people care about, brands become everyday allies in community development.”\nThe acquisition also allows Bold Orange to partner with companies on a deeper level, helping them not only create a local community platform and drive sales through gift cards, but also helping them transform their own business through modern loyalty and CRM experiences.\nIn connection with the acquisition, Bold Orange secured backing from Denver-based private equity firm Mountaingate Capital.\n“Great Lakes Scrip Center has built a powerful network of national and local brands, community based organizations, and dedicated families that has been disruptive to the fundraising industry. We are extremely bullish on the prospects for expanding this network under Margaret Murphy’s leadership and will be investing aggressively to support her efforts at Bold Orange to execute our shared vision,” said Colton King, Mountaingate managing director.\nLincoln International served as the exclusive financial advisor to GLSC in the transaction, working closely with the company’s management team and shareholders throughout the process.\nAbout Bold Orange Company\nBold Orange, based in Minneapolis, Minn., is a human connections company with a two-fold purpose: business and societal progress.
