In an unsourced report, it said doctors wanted him to go to hospital for a full check-up, but the billionaire media mogul denied he was ill.\n“I am sorry to disappoint our competitors, but I am well. Seriously, I am well,” he said, speaking by telephone to the Matrix current affairs programme, which is broadcast by his family-controlled Mediaset company.\nBut he said he had been under strain last week when Forza Italia had finalised its list of candidates, with existing lawmakers battling to remain part of the team in the face of fierce competition from eager newcomers.\n“After working 17 hours a day for five days, changing my mind, making difficult decisions, causing upset and grief, I have taken a bit of a break. They were stressful days. I would say downright painful. But we will now restart the election campaign to win it.”\nHis party gave no immediate details of when Berlusconi would next make a media appearance or take to the campaign trail.\nBerlusconi had open heart surgery in 2016 and regular hospital check-ups and lengthy stays in health spas over the past 18 months. His last public appearance was on Jan. 22, when he went to meet EU officials in Brussels, while his last television interview was on Jan. 16.\nOpinion polls suggest his centre-right bloc, which includes Forza Italia and the far-right Northern League and Brothers of Italy party, will win the March 4 vote, but will fall short of an absolute majority.\nBerlusconi cannot run for public office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction, but he has presented himself as a moderating force who will keep his allies in check should they win power at the forthcoming election.\nWriting by Crispian Balmer; Additional reporting by Gavin Jones; Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-31T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T00:11:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
