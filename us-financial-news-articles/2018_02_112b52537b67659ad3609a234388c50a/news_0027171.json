It was not going to be a major improvement,” he told Reuters.\n“We played our cards. We evaluated the situation with what we had at that moment. And at that moment nobody was pulling back. They were good to go for it.”\nMoresi accepted the argument for making the scheduling of the event more flexible, but said that would be difficult as there are multiple ski and snowboard freestyle events being run at a single location in the mountains of Pyeongchang.\nMoresi, who is an experienced member of the FIS’ organizational team and a popular official among the athletes, admitted the final was not the most spectacular advert for the sport of freestyle snowboarding but that issues with the weather were inevitable.\n“I always like the fact that these sports should shine for the performance itself, not only from the competition point of view, but the pure spectacular sport that it can be,” added Moresi, who used to coach the Italian team.\n“It would always be great if we could shine for the high end spectacular sport it is, but it is not always like that. Sometimes you have to adapt to what Mother Nature gives us.”\nWriting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:38:03.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
