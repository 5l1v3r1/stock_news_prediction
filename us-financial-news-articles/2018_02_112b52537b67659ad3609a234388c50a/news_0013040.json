By structuring the financing through vehicles without any U.S. link, whether to the currency or otherwise, the aim is to avoid the extraterritorial reach of U.S. legislation.\nThe move could anger U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to pull out of the Iran nuclear agreement reached by his predecessor Barack Obama. Washington has maintained some financial restrictions, leaving private banks - even those based outside the United States - wary of financing deals.\n\"We put a lot of preparation into this in 2017 and we keep on working, every single day, on the conditions of our entrance into Iran,\" Bpifrance's chief executive Nicolas Dufourcq said on Wednesday, referring to the new loans.\n\"This is a completely separate flow (of money),\" he added. \"There is no (U.S.) dollar in this scheme... no one holding a U.S. passport.\"\nThere is a pipeline of about 1.5 billion euros in potential contracts from interested French exporters, Dufourcq told lawmakers on Wednesday.\nRISKING TRUMP'S IRE\nFrance, which has had close business ties with Iran since before the fall of the Shah in 1979 and still operates several large factories there including Renault and PSA plants, is not alone in Europe in seeking to deepen trade ties.\nA French banking source said Italy, Germany, Austria and Belgium were also working on mechanisms that would shield their companies from the risk of U.S. sanctions. It was not immediately clear how closely coordinated the efforts are.\nEarlier this month, Italy and Iran agreed a framework credit agreement to fund investments in Iran worth up to 5 billion euros. The accord was signed by Iran's government-owned Bank of Industry and Mine and Middle East Bank, and the investment arm of Italian state-owned holding Invitalia.\nThe Rome government chose Invitalia over state lender Cassa Depositi And Prestiti (CDP) because, unlike CDP, it has no exposure to U.S. investors and no U.S. footprint.\nIn October, Trump accused some signatories to the nuclear deal of profiteering from the accord. He later rowed back, saying he had told French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel they could \"keep making money\" in Iran.\nFrench banks have been severely penalised by U.S. financial authorities for their dealings with Iran before.\nBNP Paribas received a $9-billion fine in 2014 for violating U.S. financial sanctions - even though it was imposed before the nuclear agreement was reached.\nEuropean aerospace giant Airbus has complained about the banks' wariness, which has cast a shadow over deals linked to rival Boeing.\nDufourcq said French export credits could be offered as soon as May or June.\nBpifrance's total export credits jumped to 186 million euros ($231 million) in 2017 from 30 million euros a year earlier. It plans to more than double the amount to 400 million euros in 2018.
