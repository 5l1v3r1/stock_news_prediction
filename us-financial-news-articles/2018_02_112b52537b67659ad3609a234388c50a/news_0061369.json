CCTV footage posted on the local newspaper’s website showed the entire front of the building shooting into the road as a car passed. The scene was then engulfed in fire. The Leicester Mercury said the shop was a Polish convenience store called Zabka Leicester and above it was a two-storey apartment. Police and the fire service said it would take time to establish what caused the explosion but that there was no immediate indication it was linked to terrorism.

Local resident Harrish Patni told Sky News: ”We heard this massive explosion, the shop window six doors away vibrated and we thought it can’t be a car accident, it didn’t sound like a crash. “We came outside and there was a big cloud of smoke, bricks all across the road.” Leicester, in the center of England, has long been one of Britain’s most culturally diverse cities, with a large population of people from the Asian subcontinent and many other ethnicities.
