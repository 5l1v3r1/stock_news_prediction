If we truly embrace this moment, a line in the sand will turn to stone,” it added.\nKate Kinninmont, who heads the Women in Film & Television UK group, said the money would support organisations that help victims of harassment and abuse.\n“Many of these organisations are woefully underfunded, and we want to help fund their vital work,” she said in an email.\nAward-winning director Susanna White called for the establishment of an independent body to deal with reports of harassment and bullying in the entertainment sector.\nThe initiative comes after a slew of allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein last year sparked the #MeToo campaign, with women and men using social media to share their experiences of harassment.\nAt Sunday’s BAFTA awards in London many of the female attendees wore black outfits in a gesture of protest, mirroring last month’s Golden Globes awards ceremony in Los Angeles.\nBoth male and female attendees sported badges name-checking the \"Time's Up\" campaign against sexual harassment.
