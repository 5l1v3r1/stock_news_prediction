I never thought it would be a routine win. Wales are tough, well-coached and a good side.” \nWales coach Warren Gatland was proud of his team’s display but was left to rue the TMO decision. \n“It looked like a try to me,” he said. \nEngland got off to a flying start and were a try to the good with only three minutes on the clock. Rugby Union - Six Nations Championship - England vs Wales - Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain - February 10, 2018 Wales’ Rhys Patchell misses a penalty kick Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs \nAnthony Watson got the better of fly-half Rhys Patchell to knock back a 50-50 high ball and when Owen Farrell gathered he instantly spotted a yawning gap behind Welsh lines. \nHis grubber-kick was perfect and there was only going to be one winner as May raced through to gather and dive over. \n“Only one player in the team could have scored that,” Jones said of his flying winger. CONCERTED ASSAULT Slideshow (10 Images) \nFarrell missed the conversion and Rhys Patchell failed with a long-range penalty for Wales before England launched a concerted assault on the Welsh line. \nWales defended desperately as England battered away for phase after phase but eventually cracked when lock Joe Launchbury off-loaded superbly in the corner to open the door for May to make the short dash to the line. \nThis time Farrell kicked the conversion. \nAnscombe appeared to have scored for Wales when he seized on Patchell’s kick but French referee Jerome Garces took the decision upstairs and the video official deemed that Jonathan Joseph had got the first touch and that Anscombe had not applied enough downward pressure on the ball. \nAll Wales had to show for their first half effort was Patchell’s penalty. \nEngland made a change at the interval with Underhill replacing Sam Simmonds in the back row and they were forced into another substitution when Watson tweaked a hamstring and was replaced by Jack Nowell. \nWales made little headway as handling errors and England’s tackling frustrated their efforts but when George North replaced Patchell with 25 minutes left Wales began to take control. \nWhen the visitors did finally open up England Williams was denied by Underhill’s heroic last-ditch tackle. \nIn the end, England needed all eight replacements to subdue Wales and stay on course for an unprecedented third straight Six Nations title.
