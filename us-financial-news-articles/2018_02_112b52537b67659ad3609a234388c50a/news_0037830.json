Founded by former agency heads of a national insurance carrier that was exiting the agency distribution system, IDA was conceived to fill the distribution void as insurance companies narrowed their scope solely to the manufacture of products.\nToday, IDA has over 50 member agencies across the country and is a leading distributor of life insurance, annuities and related products, all of which help give IDA the scale and resources necessary to help over 30,000 financial professionals with their client's insurance needs.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insurance-designers-of-america-announces-j-craig-collins-as-president-300599823.html\nSOURCE Insurance Designers of America", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insurance-designers-of-america-announces-j-craig-collins-as-president-300599823.html", "https://www.ida-national.com/"], "published": "2018-02-16T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T18:24:31.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
