(Nasdaq:HTLD) announced today financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nThree months ended December 31, 2017:\nNet Income of $38.6 million, Earnings per Share of $0.46, including a deferred income tax benefit of $32.8 million ($0.39 earnings per share) related to the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Operating Revenue of $165.7 million, a year over year increase of 18.3%, Operating Ratio of 94.0% and 93.1% Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Ratio (1) , Cash balance of $75.4 million, a $24.1 million increase from September 30, 2017.\nTwelve months ended December 31, 2017:\nNet Income of $75.2 million, Earnings per Share of $0.90, including a deferred income tax benefit of $32.8 million ($0.39 earnings per share), and Operating Revenue of $607.3 million, Operating Ratio of 89.5% and 88.1% Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Ratio (1) , Total Stockholders' Equity of $574.6 million and Total Assets of $789.1 million.\nHeartland Express Chief Executive Officer Michael Gerdin, commented on the operating results and ongoing initiatives of the Company, \"I am excited about our future as an organization given our accomplishments and the challenges we have navigated during the third and fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the positive income tax impact noted above, we delivered operating results during the fourth quarter that reflect the challenging effects on our financial results related to the acquisition of Interstate Distributor Company (IDC) on July 6, 2017 and subsequent decisions made in relation to their legacy operations. During the fourth quarter we continued to build off our initial transitions and operational integrations of IDC by focusing on operational investments and decisions that resulted in short term increased operating expense. This also required current and future cash investments which we feel will reward us in long-term operational improvements. To continue to invest in our current drivers that have been loyal to us and have built our company over the years as well as to attract new drivers to our organization, we introduced a consolidated pay package across all of our operating areas to address the ongoing issue in our industry of attracting and retaining safe and experienced over-the-road drivers. With an improving freight environment as compared to prior periods we feel that this investment was required at this time to further address and target driver hiring and retention.\nAs noted above, we have focused on cash investments to buy-out and retire certain acquired operating lease arrangements for revenue equipment to improve future operating expense results and allow us more flexibility in managing our fleet of revenue equipment. We also made the decision to end services which are not our core areas of focus as an organization such as brokerage, intermodal, contract carriers, and eliminated the overuse of brokers and third party logistics customers which were a notable component of IDC revenues. These items together created a headwind of lower revenue and lower profit during the quarter but we believe this will provide for improved cost structure and overall operating improvements in the near future as these services and past operating decisions resulted in operating losses at IDC or profit margins far below our expected levels of operation. We believe these efforts will better position us to focus on our goal of returning to a low-80's operating ratio with stronger cash flows generated from our operations that we have expected and delivered to our shareholders over the long-term. Even though we navigated these noted items in the third and fourth quarter of 2017, we were able to deliver an operating ratio of 89.5% and 88.1% Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Ratio (1) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 which continues to place us among the select few leaders across our industry that are able to consistently deliver results below a 90% operating ratio. I am proud of our team and our accomplishments in 2017 and believe we are properly positioned to navigate the exciting road ahead.\"\nFinancial Results\nHeartland Express ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with net income of $38.6 million, compared to $13.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which includes a $32.8 million deferred income tax benefit resulting from the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, see table presentation below. Basic earnings per share were $0.46 during the quarter compared to $0.16 earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $165.7 million, compared to $140.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating revenues for the quarter included fuel surcharge revenues of $21.8 million compared to $14.7 million in the same period of 2016, a $7.1 million increase. Operating revenues excluding fuel surcharge revenue (1) increased 14.8%, primarily due to higher miles driven during the quarter as a result of the IDC acquisition which increased our operating fleet as compared to the same period in 2016 which did not include IDC revenues. During the fourth quarter, we ended the operation of the IDC brokerage, intermodal, and contract carrier services which had a negative impact on revenue as compared to the third quarter of 2017. Operating income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 decreased $11.0 million as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the negative operating impacts from the consolidation of IDC financial results and lower miles driven across the legacy operations of the Company. The Company posted an operating ratio of 94.0%, an adjusted operating ratio (1) of 93.1%, and a 23.3% net margin (net income as a percentage of operating revenues) in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 85.1%, 83.3% and 9.4%, respectively in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nEarnings Impact of Deferred Income Taxes Benefit (in thousands, except share information) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Net Income: Excluding deferred income taxes benefit $ 5,815 $ 42,384 Deferred income taxes benefit 32,789 32,789 Net Income $ 38,604 $ 75,173 Basic earnings per share: Excluding deferred income taxes benefit $ 0.07 $ 0.51 Deferred income taxes benefit 0.39 0.39 Basic earnings per share $ 0.46 $ 0.90 For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 the Company recorded net income of $75.2 million, compared to $56.4 million in the same period of 2016.

Operating revenues included fuel surcharge revenues of $72.5 million compared to $58.4 million in the same period of 2016, a $14.1 million increase. Operating revenues excluding fuel surcharge revenue (1) decreased 3.6%. Operating income for the twelve-month period decreased $22.0 million mainly as a result of the negative financial impacts following the acquisition of IDC as well as fewer miles driven. The Company posted an operating ratio of 89.5%, an adjusted operating ratio (1) of 88.1% and a 12.4% net margin (net income as a percentage of operating revenues) in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 86.0%, 84.6% and 9.2%, respectively in 2016.\nBalance Sheet, Liquidity, and Capital Expenditures\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $75.4 million in cash balances and no borrowings under the Company's unsecured line of credit.

The average age of the Company's tractor fleet was 1.8 years as of December 31, 2017 compared to 1.7 years at December 31, 2016.

The Company currently estimates a total of approximately $95 to $105 million in net capital expenditures for 2018. The Company ended the past twelve months with a return on total assets of 9.7% and a 13.9% return on equity.\nThe Company continues its commitment to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and repurchase of common stock.

The Company has now paid cumulative cash dividends of $470.7 million, including three special dividends, ($2.00 in 2007, $1.00 in 2010, and $1.00 in 2012) over the past fifty-eight consecutive quarters.
