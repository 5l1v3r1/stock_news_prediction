He recently directed an advertising campaign featuring Jennifer Lopez and attended a party celebrating its launch Wednesday evening, reports Bloomberg . \nUpton’s post caused the brand’s shares to drop 12% down to $16.16. They had risen 40% in 2017. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T05:00:38.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
