(NYSE American: CTO) (the “Company”) today announced the purchase of a 19,596-square foot, newly constructed commercial building (the “Property”) located in downtown Aspen, Colorado, for $28 million, with the Company’s net investment totaling $26.5 million after giving affect for contributions made by the Master Tenant, as defined below. Simultaneous with the closing, the Company entered into a twenty-year master lease on the Property with an affiliate of A.G. Hill Partners, a Dallas, Texas based family office (the “Master Tenant”). The Hill family owns and operates Highland Park Village, a 265,000-square foot luxury shopping center in Dallas and is developing The Haven, a luxury shopping outlet center in West Haven, Connecticut. The lease includes annual rent escalations, tenant repurchase options and is absolute net to the Company.\nThe Property is located at E. Hyman Avenue and Hunter Street in downtown Aspen, approximately one block from the new Aspen Art Museum and two blocks from The Little Nell hotel. The Master Tenant currently has approximately 26% of the Property leased to three retail sub-tenants and is in on-going negotiations for the remaining available space.\nThe initial investment yield is below the low end of the Company’s 2018 guidance, however, the actual yield could meet or exceed the upper end of the Company’s guidance in the first 2 to 3 years of the lease.\nAbout Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co.\nConsolidated-Tomoka Land Co. is a Florida-based publicly traded real estate company, which owns a portfolio of income investments in diversified markets in the United States including over 2.1 million square feet of income properties, as well as nearly 8,100 acres of land in the Daytona Beach area.
