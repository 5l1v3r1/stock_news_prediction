Crypto-commodities are those that trade in bitcoin.\nCyber theft is seen as a major risk for bitcoin trading, highlighted by last month’s heist of about $530 million from a Tokyo-based exchange, a theft rivaling Mt. Gox’s as one of the biggest ever for digital currency.\nThere have been increasingly loud warnings around the world about the dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies, which remain largely outside the regulatory net.\nHowever, Regal RA DMCC’s announcement came as the regulator of Abu Dhabi’s international financial center said this week it could create rules for exchanges handling virtual currencies, in a sign that authorities in the United Arab Emirates may allow trade in cryptocurrencies to develop.\nRegal RA DMCC, is a subsidiary of Regal Assets, an alternative asset firm which has offices in the United States, Canada and the United Arab Emirates.\nDubai is a major hub for gold trading, thanks to its proximity to the world’s largest gold consumer, India.\n“At the heart of DMCC’s long term strategic growth plan is the use of technology and innovation to disrupt and connect new markets, industries and customers,” said Ahmed Bin Sulayem, executive chairman, DMCC.\nElsewhere in the Gulf, many regulators are wary of cryptocurrencies. The Saudi Arabian central bank has advised people not to trade bitcoin, and last week, Qatar’s central bank told banks not to deal in any way with cryptocurrencies.\nOn Monday, the European Union’s banking, securities and insurance watchdogs warned that virtual currencies such as bitcoin have shown clear signs of a pricing bubble and consumers could lose all their money.\nReporting by Saeed Azhar; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:29:25.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
