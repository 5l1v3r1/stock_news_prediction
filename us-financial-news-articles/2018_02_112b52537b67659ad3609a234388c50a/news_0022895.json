U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration wants to hike this to 85 percent.\n“You have to be very prudent on what the level is because you can shoot yourself in the foot,” Guajardo said on local television. “Let’s put a realistic integration figure that everyone agrees on, its not going to be the current 62.5 percent ... but it also can’t be 85.”\nReporting by Christine Murray\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T07:53:23.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
