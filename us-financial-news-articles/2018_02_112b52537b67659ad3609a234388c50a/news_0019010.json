And a lot of the technology you’re going to start to see in the second half,” Chief Executive Liam Griffin said on a conference call late on Monday, after Skyworks reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.\nIn contrast, Cirrus Logic Inc ( CRUS.O ), whose audio chips are used in Apple’s iPhones, reported quarterly revenue and profit below estimates, citing an unanticipated weakness in smartphone demand late in December.\nNorthland’s Sepenzis said that though Skyworks’ revenue would come down modestly moving forward, its earnings would actually increase due to the new lowered U.S. tax rate.\nSkyworks shares hit a session high of $106.74 before easing to $102.50, still up 8.3 percent and giving the biggest boost to the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index .SOX.\nCirrus shares were down 2.3 percent at $43.82, making then the second-biggest percentage loser on the chip index.\nReporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:58:45.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
