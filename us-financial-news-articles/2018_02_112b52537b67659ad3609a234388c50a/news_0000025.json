It’s going to be difficult but I‘m excited for it.” \nEarlier in the day, defending champion Kristina Mladenovic finally had a singles result to celebrate as she defeated Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia 6-4 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals. \n“What can I say? I come in here, and from the first moment, I was super happy, and kind of proud, and having very positive vibes,” the Frenchwoman, who ended her 15-match losing streak, said. \n“Like last year I felt like I haven’t left this place. St Petersburg is definitely magic for me, and I feel like home, like this is my home.” \nFifth seed Julia Goerges also marched on to the last-eight on her debut in the tournament after overcoming Italian qualifier Roberta Vinci 7-5 6-0. \nGoerges had never beaten Vinci in three previous meetings dating back to 2010 but she grew in confidence in a difficult first set, before recording her second bagel of the year to claim the victory. \nThe German will next face 18-year-old Russian qualifier Elena Rybakina for a place in the semi-finals.
