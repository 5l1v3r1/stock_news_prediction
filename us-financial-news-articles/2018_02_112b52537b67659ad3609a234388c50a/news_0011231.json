We do see it and you need to stop. If you don't, you're going to just continue to invite consequences for yourself,'\" Tillerson told Fox. \nThe secretary of State's warnings follow similar statements from CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who told BBC News that he expects Russia to target this year's midterm elections . \n\"I have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that, but I'm confident that America will be able to have a free and fair election (and) that we will push back in a way that is sufficiently robust that the impact they have on our election won't be great,\" Pompeo told the BBC. \nPompeo also recently met with top Russian intelligence officers, according to CNN . \nThe U.S. intelligence community has said that Russia interfered in the 2016 general election, which pitted Democrat Hillary Clinton against Republican and eventual winner Donald Trump . \nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the extent of Russian involvement, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin during the campaign. Trump has repeatedly denied collusion and called the Russia meddling story a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats.
