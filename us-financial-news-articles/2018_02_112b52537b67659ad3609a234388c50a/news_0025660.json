The company is looking to further a regional drive with the sale of its multi-role combat jet to Malaysia.\nBAE believes Malaysia will arrive at a decision after the elections, which must be held by August.\n“I sense there is an appetite to move forward in the next couple of years,” BAE Systems Malaysia & Southeast Asia managing director John Brosnan said.\n“We would like to see some progress made in the year after the election....because governments tend to make these kind of decisions slightly earlier in their time in office than later,” he added.\nMalaysia’s economy has been on a recovery over the last year, after a few years of slow growth and a currency slide due to weak oil prices.\n“We think there is a window of opportunity there with the strengthening economic position,” said Brosnan.\nBAE is in competition with France’ Dassault Aviation - makers of the Rafale - which until recently was seen as frontrunner.\nPrime Minister Najib Razak said in March last year the Rafale deal was discussed during then-French President Francois Hollande’s visit to the Southeast Asian nation, but that Malaysia was “not ready yet to make a decision”.\nDassault was awarded a contract in 2016 to deliver 36 Rafale jets to India, and the company sass it is still in talks to make additional sales to New Delhi.\nReporting by Praveen Menon and Tim Hepher; editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T07:45:03.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
