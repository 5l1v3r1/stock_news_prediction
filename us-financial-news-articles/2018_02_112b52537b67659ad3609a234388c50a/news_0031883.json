Most U.S. shipping channels are too shallow, although Port Corpus Christi, Texas, is undergoing improvements to deepen its channel.\nAnalysts believe operators will start to run into bottlenecks if exports rise to 3.5 million to 4 million barrels a day. Exports peaked at 2 million barrels a day (bpd) last year.\nLOOP made only minor modifications to existing facilities to operate the port complex for both imports and exports, it said in a statement on its website. It has until now only imported crude oil.\n“The configuration safely enables both loading and offloading of Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) without multiple shuttle tanker movements,” the company said.\nThe vessel that is currently being used for tests is the ‘Shaden’, according to traders and Reuters vessel tracking data.\nThe supertanker previously loaded in Saudi Arabia’s export terminal at the port of Ras Tanura in December, according to Reuters data.\nA spokesman for LOOP did not immediately respond to requests for comment as the offices were closed.\nUnipec - China’s largest buyer of U.S. crude - has chartered the vessel to load in the U.S. Gulf Coast with Singapore as its destination and will be ready to load on Feb. 15, according to a fixture associated with it.\nUnipec, the trading arm of Asia’s largest refiner, state-owned Sinopec, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nReporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Editing by Susan Thomas and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:27:37.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
