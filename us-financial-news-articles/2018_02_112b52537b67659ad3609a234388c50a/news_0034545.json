Why should people suffer from not only sickness but also high expenses?”\nIsraa, 9, who was diagnosed with cancer, sits with her mother and waits to get treatment during her stay at Zaza Ogaz's free housing for patients receiving treatment at a nearby cancer hospital, in Cairo, Egypt February 12, 2018.

Ogaz refuses to accept donations, saying he is doing his charitable work in honor of his late mother and mother-in-law.\nSlideshow (13 Images) In the entrance hall, children’s scooters are parked next to wheelchairs. In a bedroom decorated with cartoons of Winnie the Pooh and Minnie Mouse, children watch television. Some have traveled with their families from distant parts of Egypt.\n“I came here and he welcomed me and I found a place to stay. I told him I am not moving until I am done,” said Om Israa, a mother whose child is being treated at the hospital.\n“He treats the children very well. He buys gifts and plays with them.”\nEditing by Giles Elgood\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T18:17:43.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
