I don't actually think it's safe, just like Elon Musk… to develop these superhuman computers until we have a direct link to the human brain… and then don't get way ahead.\"\nAt the World Government Summit in 2017, Musk, who has warned about the power of AI in the future, said humans and machines must merge to still be relevant with the advent of more powerful technology.\n\"Over time, I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence,\" Musk said in February 2017.\n\"It's mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output.\"\nMusk has founded a start-up called Neuralink that is aimed at just that.\nPearson said Tuesday that some jobs that don't require humans will disappear. AI and the impact on jobs has been a big theme at the World Government Summit this year.\nOn Monday, Sebastian Thrun, the CEO of education start-up Udacity, and one of the pioneers of Google's driverless car project, told CNBC that AI will turn us into \"superhuman workers.\"\nArjun Kharpal Technology Correspondent Related Securities Symbol Price Change %Change TSLA --- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T18:15:26.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
