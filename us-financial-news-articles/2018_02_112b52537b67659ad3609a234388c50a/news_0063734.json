B&S, which is jointly owned by its founder and CEO, supplies consumer goods to cruise ships, military bases, and low-cost retailers. B&S Group did not reveal what stake it will sell in the IPO, but said CEO Bert Meulman and founder Willem Blijdorp will sell shares, and Blijdorp will remain majority shareholder after the offer. “Over time, both Mr. Blijdorp and Mr. Meulman intend to remain significant long-term shareholders,” the company said. Registered in Luxembourg but with operational headquarters in Dordrecht, Netherlands, it reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 106 million euros ($130 million) in 2017 on sales of 1.5 billion euros. The company will use the IPO to raise it profile and give it additional flexibility in its financing, CEO Meulman said. ABN AMRO, ING Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint global coordinators of the offering, with Rabobank and Deutsche Bank as joint bookrunners.
