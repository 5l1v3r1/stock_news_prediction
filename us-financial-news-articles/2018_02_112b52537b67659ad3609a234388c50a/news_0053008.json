Completion is expected by the end of 2018 and funding is to come from internal resources, Zurich said.\nIn a separate statement, QBE said it expected a pre-tax profit from the sale of about $100 million.\nAustralia’s biggest insurer will retain its Puerto Rico operations to service claims from Hurricane Maria, it said.\n”The decision to exit Latin America is consistent with our\nfocus on simplifying the group, reducing risk and improving the consistency of our results,” QBE Chief Executive Pat Regan said.\nEurope’s fifth-biggest insurer last year bought Australia and New Zealand Banking Group’s ( ANZ.AX ) life insurance arm for $2.1 billion, a deal that propelled it to the top rank in the attractive Australian market.\nReporting by Silke Koltrowitz, additional reporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru; editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T23:51:03.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
