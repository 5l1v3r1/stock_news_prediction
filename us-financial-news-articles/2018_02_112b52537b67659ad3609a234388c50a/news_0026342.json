Cyclical names and companies with relatively low labor costs may be some of the best bets, according to Kostin. \n\"These strategies have dislocated from their fundamental drivers as they underperformed during the market decline. Rising inflation and interest rates should benefit cyclical sectors, such as Financials, relative to bond proxies,\" Kostin added. \"Firms with low labor costs should be most insulated from accelerating wages, a trend that our economists expect will persist in 2018.\" \nHere is a selection of stocks Goldman Sachs believes may be resistant to rising wage pressure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T17:01:25.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
