Tim Hardaway Jr. added 17 points, Michael Beasley had 15, Troy Williams 14 and Emmanuel Mudiay 13 as the Knicks couldn’t build off Thursday’s 120-113 win at Orlando that snapped a season-high eight-game skid.\nThe Celtics won their season series with the Knicks, 3-1.\nAfter 15 points from Irving in the third quarter, Boston entered the fourth with an 88-81 lead. A 13-6 New York run capped by Burke’s pull-up jumper with 7:43 remaining trimmed the deficit to 96-94.\nIrving answered with a 3-pointer with 7:08 to play, sparking a 10-2 run that ended with Horford’s 3-pointer at 5:24 to effectively put the game away.\nBoston led 59-56 at halftime.\nDaniel Theis was inserted into the Celtics’ starting lineup in place of injured center Aron Baynes. Theis, who scored a career-high 19 points in Friday night’s 120-113 win at Detroit, finished with six points and seven rebounds.\nBaynes did not play after exiting Friday’s game in the first quarter with a left elbow sprain. Boston’s Shane Larkin returned after missing the last 10 games with a knee ailment, going scoreless in five minutes.\nBoston returns home to face Memphis on Monday. New York hosts defending champion Golden State on Monday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:00:05.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
