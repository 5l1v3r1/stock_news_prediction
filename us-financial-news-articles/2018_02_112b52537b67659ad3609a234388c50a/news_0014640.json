Over time, more oil and gas fields, now in excess of 50, were linked to it. \nRoyal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) said production at its Shearwater platform in the North Sea had been shut down as a result of the outage. The Nelson field, which also connects to the pipeline, had already been closed for maintenance, a spokesman said. \nTotal ( TOTF.PA ) said it had to stop gas exports from its Elgin Franklin terminal due to the Forties pipeline outage.
