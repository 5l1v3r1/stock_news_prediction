I’m taking the baton during part of Lara’s vacation. Between Fashion Week, Valentine’s Day and Fifty Shades Freed (you know you want to see it), ad blockers might burst at the seams this week. Expect a lot of romance-themed commercials, Fifty Shades promos (this spoof starring James Corden made me giggle) and Fashion Week influencer events, like this collab between Hearst’s branded content group and BCBG Max Azria.\nSkating Away NBC’s coverage of the Winter Olympics hit a few speed bumps over the weekend, when an NBC analyst got fired over comments that insulted Koreans and when U.S. viewers complained about a tape delay that led to medal spoilers. Despite the issues, the Olympics and its massive audience are still be one of the biggest draws for advertisers looking for a sizable stage. NBC said it set a record for national ad sales in this year’s Winter Games. But big Olympic advertisers including General Motors, Procter & Gamble, AT&T and Coca-Cola are expected to spend less on this year’s Games than they did in 2014, a warning sign that even the Olympics may not be immune to TV’s broader woes, I reported for CMO Today. Some advertisers are moving away from big, expensive events in favor of more targeted media and digital platforms. Others are concerned about viewership for the Games because of changes in consumers’ media-consumption habits and less buzz around the winter edition than the Summer Games.\n—A Complete Picture—\nAn NBC Sports spokesman said the network will still have national TV and digital ad sales of over $900 million, with roughly 60% from new advertisers, “a sign that the Olympic movement remains of great interest.” NBC is guaranteeing audiences by tallying up live viewing across all platforms—TV and streaming—for the first time. As Bloomberg’s Gerry Smith explains , “whether a fan is following figure skating on the NBC broadcast channel or tuned into curling online, that person will count the same toward the audience NBC is promising to advertisers -- and cost the same for a marketer to reach.” If NBC had guaranteed audiences this way during the Summer Olympics in Rio, its reach would have been 7% larger, presumably leading to more ad dollars, he reports.\nMoney Talks Packaged-goods giant Unilever is threatening to withhold its precious ad dollars from tech platforms like YouTube and Facebook if they don’t take more action to stifle the spread of fake news and other divisive content, reports CMO Today. “Unilever will not invest in platforms or environments that do not protect our children or which create division in society, and promote anger or hate,” Unilever CMO Keith Weed is expected to say Monday during the IAB’s annual leadership meeting, according to prepared remarks. Mr. Weed said that he’ll work privately with the companies to come up with solutions, and has already had conversations with Facebook, Google, Twitter, Snap and Amazon. Major tech platforms have already increased their efforts to curb offensive content, such as more manual screening, algorithm changes and more controls for marketers, but Mr. Weed said their efforts don’t go far enough. “I believe they should still go further and human screen all videos with children that are monetized,” he said in an interview with CMO Today.\nIt’s Not Over Till It’s Over The media consolidation drama continues as Comcast Corp. considers reviving its bid for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, reports The Wall Street Journal’s Amol Sharma and Shalini Ramachandran. Fox rebuffed the cable giant’s pursuit late last year, in favor of doing a deal with Walt Disney Co. But, as WSJ reports, Comcast’s bid was in the low-$60 billions range, more than 15% above Disney’s winning offer of $52.4 billion in stock for essentially the same assets. Fox’s main concern about a deal with Comcast was the significant antitrust risks. Comcast may ultimately decide not to make a move, but the cable company will be keeping a close eye on whether the AT&T-Time Warner deal is allowed to go through and on Fox’s proxy statement, which may shed some light on the deal process before Fox’s shareholder vote on the Disney tie-up. (21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent company News Corp share common ownership.)\nWhat’s in a Logo? “What does it mean to brandish a brand name in 2018? Is it possible to play with logo fashion without looking like a status-hungry follower?” These are questions that The Wall Street Journal’s Off Duty fashion director, Rory Satran, asks as she ponders this year’s logo-toting design trend at the start of New York Fashion Week. While she offers no definitive answer—it really depends on who’s wearing the logo and where they work—Ms. Satran shares a few fun facts. The first wave of “logomania” peaked in the mid-90s, thanks to Aaliyah and her head-to-toe Tommy Hilfiger-branded gear and Chanel sending a logo-printed bikini down the runway. But logos in fashion date back centuries, to the tradition of sewing one’s initials into a handkerchief.\n—Is Fashion Week Losing Its Luster?—\nPerhaps Fashion Week needs a new logo. For years, editors, influencers, buyers and brand sponsors have gathered biannually, in February and September, to ooh and aah over designers’ new lines for the following year. But the event has fizzled somewhat, as designers come under pressure to market their collections closer to the time of sale and some big-name designers pull out. Alexander Wang recently announced that he’s jumping ship in September, instead opting to only present his collections during a pre-collection period in June and December, according to the New York Times. His move will shorten the wait time between product reveal and store delivery and come with more frequent product drops. Last week, I met with executives from a fashion PR agency who said that nearly 50% of the shop’s fashion roster in recent years has traded in the glitzy runway show for other marketing opportunities throughout the year. If more major labels pull the plug, will Fashion Week sponsors follow suit?\nBest of the Rest Snap is offering advertisers who are buying inventory on competing platforms free ad credits to try Snapchat, in an effort to lure ad dollars from rivals like Instagram. [ Recode ]\nYouTube has been cracking down on content it deems unsafe for advertisers. In its latest move, the Google-owned site is temporarily banning ads on YouTube star Logan Paul’s channels. [ AP ]\nAmazon has hired NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke, who has since 2011 overseen the network’s prime-time programming including “This Is Us,” as head of Amazon Studios. She succeeds Roy Price, who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations in October. [ WSJ ]\nOxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma said it will stop marketing its opioid drugs to physicians following years of backlash and lawsuits. [ L.A. Times ]\nA proposed deal to sell Weinstein Co. crumbled after the New York attorney general filed a lawsuit against the film studio and its co-founders, Bob and Harvey Weinstein. The suit alleging sexual harassment and civil-rights violations introduced too much uncertainty for the sale and means the company will likely enter bankruptcy reorganization, people familiar with the matter said.
