I promise not to fail them, we’ll build the road with quality and on time,” Rrok Gjoka, the president of Gjoka Konstruksion (Construction), told reporters. \nThe 69 km road from Tirana to Diber on the border with Macedonia - which has not shown much enthusiasm for connecting it with a similar one on its territory - passes through mountainous terrain, making it a difficult engineering project. \nInfrastructure Minister Damian Gjiknuri told reporters the company would secure the financing and start building the road this year. It is expected to be ready in 46 months. $1 = 0.8057 euros Reporting by Benet Koleka; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T22:02:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
