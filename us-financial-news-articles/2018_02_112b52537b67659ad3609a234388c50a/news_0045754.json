The Fed currently forecasts three rate rises this year, and persistent weak inflation readings had given most policymakers pause against upping the pace of rate hikes even in an economy with strong growth and ultra-low unemployment.\nThe Fed's preferred measure of inflation has been below its 2 percent target rate for nearly six years but the Labor Department reported earlier this month that underlying consumer prices posted their biggest gain in more than a year in January.\n\"Almost all participants continued to anticipate that inflation would move up to the...2 percent objective over the medium term as economic growth remained above trend and the labor market stayed strong,\" the minutes said.\nIn the previous set of minutes, fewer policymakers had expressed such confidence.\nA sustained uptick in inflation and further boost to an already strong economy from the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion in corporate and individual tax cuts passed late December could cause the Fed to tighten more aggressively.\nInvestors have all but priced in another rate increase at the central bank's next meeting on March 20-21.\nSince the January meeting U.S. stocks have been volatile, although Fed officials have played down the impact of a recent sell-off given how high the stock market has risen.\nA first proper insight into Powell's thinking as Fed chairman will come next Wednesday during a scheduled appearance before Congress.
