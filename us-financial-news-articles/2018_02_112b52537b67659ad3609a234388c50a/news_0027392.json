Barzagli could miss the match with a calf injury and Juventus will be without Blaise Matuidi, the central midfielder who provides vital cover in front of the defence. \nKane can also look back to a friendly between Tottenham and Juventus at Wembley in August, when he scored the opening goal in a 2-0 win for Mauricio Pochettino’s side. \nHe will no doubt be buoyed by scoring 14 goals in his last 11 games, including a last-gasp equaliser in the 2-2 draw at Liverpool on Feb. 4 and a winner in the 1-0 victory over north London rivals Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday.
