In the interview, Jeff said he likes to surprise her with gifts in the form of clothing. \n\"I pay attention to what she likes to wear, and you'd be amazed by how often things work,\" he told the magazine. \"Sometimes I call her and say, 'What's your such-and-such size?' and she says, 'Why?' and I say, 'None of your business!' It delights her.\" \nHe continued, \"I highly recommend it to any man.\" \nJeff and MacKenzie met in 1992 when he interviewed her for a position at the New York City hedge fund firm D.E. Shaw. One year later, they were married. \nIn a 1999 interview with Wired , the Amazon founder admitted that before meeting his now wife, he would allow his friends to set him up on blind dates â€” with a caveat: The woman had to be resourceful. \n\"The number one criterion was that I wanted a woman who could get me out of a Third World prison,\" he told the publication. \nHe also explained his reasoning for asking to be set up on blind dates: \"I'm not the kind of person where women say, 'Oh, look how great he is,' a half hour after meeting me. I'm kind of goofy.\" \nBut that's exactly what his wife loved about him. She told Vogue that hearing his laugh pushed her to make the first move. show chapters 1:13 PM ET Mon, 30 Oct 2017 | 01:12 \n\"My office was next door to his, and all day long I listened to that fabulous laugh,\" she told the magazine. \"How could you not fall in love with that laugh?\" \nShe also ticked off the necessary boxes on Jeff's list of requirements for a spouse. \"I think my wife is resourceful, smart, brainy and hot,\" he told Vogue. \nThis ability to be resourceful is a trait that Jeff still holds in high regard and one that his wife of 25 years works hard to instill in their four children. \n\"My wife has a great saying,\" Jeff told his brother Mark Bezos at a SummitLA panel. \"She says, 'I would much rather have a kid with nine fingers than a resourceless kid.'\" \nAnd although the CEO spends much of his time overseeing his various companies, which include Whole Foods and the Washington Post , it doesn't preclude him from being a family man. \nIn fact, in a 2014 interview with Business Insider , the billionaire said that doing the dishes is a part of his daily routine . \n\"I do the dishes every night,\" said Jeff, who's currently worth $118 billion . \"I'm pretty convinced it's the sexiest thing I do.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T19:07:49.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
