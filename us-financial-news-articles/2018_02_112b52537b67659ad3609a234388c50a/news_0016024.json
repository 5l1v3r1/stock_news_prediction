A sister survey on Thursday showed manufacturing growth slowed to a three-month low.\nBut the latest PMI showed the recovery in demand led services firms to increase hiring last month at the second fastest rate in 6-1/2 years, surpassed only in September.\nBusinesses transferred some escalating cost pressures to consumers with both input and output prices rising at a faster pace in January from the previous month.\nThat, coupled with the government’s plan to increase spending for rural areas and support farmers in its federal budget, could push up inflation and prompt the central bank to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected.\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday, in his last annual budget speech before a general election next year, that the pace of fiscal consolidation would be slowed to boost growth.\nReporting by Indradip Ghosh; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T07:36:21.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
