Torrential rains from Gita, which was downgraded on Tuesday from a tropical cyclone to storm, lashed the centre of New Zealand, causing floods in the city of Christchurch and other provinces. Heavy rain caused landslips, closing arterial roads, including a state highway. New Zealand’s weather bureau told local media the worst was likely over.

Fiji escaped major damage but Tonga suffered widespread destruction and flooding. Earlier, the storm had caused extensive damage in Samoa and American Samoa. In New Zealand’s South Island, about 200 tourists were still trapped after spending the night in their buses or in welfare centres, Radio NZ reported. Schools in Canterbury remained shut on Wednesday and around 14,000 households in the central North Island remained without power.
