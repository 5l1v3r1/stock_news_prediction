It is in the midst of increasing output and last week said it may speed up further. \nA prolonged delay could have a financial impact for the planemaker, as it waits for payments that usually fall due on delivery, and for leasing companies, who start receiving rent on aircraft allotted to airlines as soon as they enter service. \n“It is too early to determine financial implications, but the fact that it impacts a limited population of engines is a potentially mitigating factor,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew McConnell said before the delivery freeze emerged. \n“Still, this will put GTF (geared turbofan) execution issues back in the spotlight after a smooth few months when news flow was mostly focused on solid orders and ramping production.” Additional reporting by Promit Mukherjee; Editing by Andrew Heavens", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T12:12:01.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
