I don’t think that’s going away any time soon,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.\nCleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, a voting member in the central bank’s rate-setting committee this year, said inflation should gradually rise this year, but not at a rate that requires a faster Fed reaction in terms of raising rates.\nShe said the recent stock market sell-off and jump in volatility will not damage the economy’s overall strong prospects.\nAfter a wildly volatile week that pushed the market into correction territory, U.S. stocks gained roughly 3 percent over Friday and Monday, their best two-day gains since June 2016.\n“We saw an impressive rebound yesterday but by no means are we in the clear,” Bakhos said.\nBy 9:41 a.m. ET (1441 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 73.22 points, or 0.3 percent, at 24,528.05 and the S&P 500 was down 7.42 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,648.58. The Nasdaq Composite was down 13.09 points, or 0.19 percent, at 6,968.87.\nAll the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by losses in technology and healthcare indexes.\nBenchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were hovering at 2.8475 percent, shy of their four-year peak of 2.9020 percent on Monday.\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, a widely-followed measure of short-term stock volatility, rose about 1 point to 26.70, but stayed well short of the 50-point level it touched last week.\nThe recent pullback has wiped out all of the year’s gains for the benchmark S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow, which are now down 1 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively, so far in 2018.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq was still clinging to a 0.87 percent gain for the year.\nMore than three-fifths of the companies on the S&P 500 have reported earnings, with nearly 78 percent of them topping profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is above the 72 percent average beat-rate in the past four quarters.\nShares of Under Armour rose more than 15 percent after the sportswear maker reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts’ estimates.\nAmerisourceBergen jumped nearly 12 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported Walgreens made a takeover approach for the drug distributor. Walgreens rose 1.1 percent.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,830 to 714. On the Nasdaq, 1,697 issues fell and 684 advanced.
