It recommends that to sustain growth, Chile should diversify its economy beyond activities related to natural resources.\nInflation expectations in Chile remain well-anchored, meaning monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative in 2018, according to the OECD.\nThe OECD report, presented by the organization’s secretary general Angel Gurria in Santiago, comes days before President-elect Sebastian Pinera, a conservative billionaire who has pledged to slash red tape and revive investment, is set to take office in the world’s No. 1 copper producer.\nReporting by Cassandra Garrison; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T15:14:27.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
