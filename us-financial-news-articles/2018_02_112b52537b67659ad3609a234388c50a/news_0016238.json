Third Quarter 2018 reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 41.6% to $0.17, compared to the prior year period of $0.12. Third Quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.32, compared to the prior year period of $0.31. Year-to-date revenue growth of 15.0% over the prior year period; Year-to-date reported earnings per share from continuing operations increased 53.3% to $1.41 per diluted share from $0.92 per diluted share. Company announces Coatings business moved to discontinued operations; strategic action enhances profitability and drives significant improvement in free cash flow. Consolidates operations into two segments: Industrial Products and Specialty Chemicals, and flattens operations leadership structure.\nDALLAS, CSW Industrials, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSWI), a diversified industrial growth company with well-established, scalable platforms and domain expertise across two segments: Industrial Products and Specialty Chemicals, today reported results for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNet revenue from continuing operations during the fiscal third quarter of 2018 increased 5.8% to $69.0 million, compared to the prior year period of $65.3 million. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to sales from the acquired Greco business ($4.3 million) and increased sales into the HVAC and plumbing end markets, partially offset by lower volume in the architecturally specified building products and energy end markets.\nReported operating income from continuing operations in the fiscal third quarter of 2018 increased to $8.3 million, or 12.0% of sales, compared to $5.1 million, or 7.9% of sales, in the prior year period. The increase in operating income was driven by continued strength in the Industrial Products segment and savings from prior year restructuring activities in the Whitmore / Jet-Lube consolidation, partially offset by lower sales volumes and unfavorable product mix in Specialty Chemicals.\nCSW Industrials has strategically realigned its businesses by reducing exposure to the Coatings business, which is now classified as held for sale. This action resulted in several changes detailed below:\nIn the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company initiated a plan to sell the Coatings business, the revenues of which were roughly one third of the former Coatings, Sealants and Adhesives segment. As a result, the Company has moved the Coatings business to assets held for sale and discontinued operations.\nCSWI has condensed its three reportable segments into two reportable segments, Industrial Products and Specialty Chemicals. The Sealants and Adhesives businesses, which were part of the former Coatings, Sealants and Adhesives segment, are now included in Specialty Chemicals. The Company’s reported quarterly results reflect this change.\nTo assist the investment community in analyzing the Company’s historical financial results, the Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K to provide supplemental unaudited financial information for the previous six quarters that reflects the Coatings business as assets held for sale and discontinued operations.\nJoseph B. Armes, CSW Industrials’ Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our business realignment meaningfully enhances our ability to generate free cash flow and provides opportunities to further enhance shareholder value. We considered the sale of the Coatings business carefully, and ultimately made this decision in light of the sustained deterioration of end market conditions, and its current inability to meet our profitability standards.” Armes continued, “In our continuing operations, we are pleased to report another quarter of top line growth and operating profit growing at a faster rate than revenue, which speaks to the strength of our platform and our team’s ability to execute on business opportunities and improve efficiency.”\nCSW Industrials also announced that Chris Mudd, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer, will depart the Company to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Mudd will continue in his role with the Company through February 28, 2018 to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities. As part of this action, segment leaders Craig Foster in Specialty Chemicals and Don Sullivan in Industrial Products, will report directly to Mr. Armes. Armes noted, “Both Craig and Don are seasoned leaders with strong track records of execution in their respective segments, and I look forward to working more closely with them to drive incremental success.”\nArmes added, “I would also like to thank Chris for his contributions to the creation of CSWI and I wish him well as he moves on to his next role.”\nThird Quarter Results of Operations\nThe below results reflect the Company’s financial results from continuing operations unless otherwise noted.\nConsolidated revenue increased 5.8% to $69.0 million, compared to $65.3 million in the prior year period.\nIndustrial Products segment revenue increased 19.5% to $37.9 million, compared to $31.7 million in the prior year period. Higher revenue was driven by acquisition related revenue and strong sales into HVAC and plumbing end markets. Reported segment operating income increased 82.5% to $7.3 million, compared to $4.0 million in the prior year.\nSpecialty Chemicals segment revenue was $31.1 million, compared to $33.5 million in the prior year period. Lower sales were driven primarily by the timing of volume related to the Whitmore/Jet-Lube integration in the prior year and flattening rig counts. Reported segment operating income increased 30.6% to $4.0 million, compared to $3.1 million in the prior year period.\nConsolidated gross profit increased to $30.2 million, compared to $27.4 million in the prior year period. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 43.7%, compared to 41.9% in the prior year period. Higher gross margin compared to the prior year primarily reflected the increased sales volume.\nConsolidated operating expenses were $21.9 million, or 31.8% of sales, compared to the prior year level of $22.2 million, or 34.1% of sales. Lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to savings resulting from prior year restructuring and realignment activity that did not recur during the current year, partially offset by acquisition–related operating expenses.\nThe effective tax rate on continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was 66.1%. The high tax rate was primarily due to the one-time transition tax of $4.9 million for mandatory repatriation based on cash and net accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries as a result of recent U.S. tax reform legislation. The Company is still determining the effective tax rate on an ongoing basis but expects the tax rate beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter to be in a range of 25% to 27%.\nReported income from continuing operations was $2.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to $1.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted to exclude one-time expenses and applying a normalized tax rate, adjusted income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2018 was $5.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of $4.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the prior year period.\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2017, was $47.1 million, compared to $33.7 million in the prior year period. The Company expects cash flow from continuing operations to be further enhanced in the future as a result of the lower corporate tax rate due to tax reform.\nConference Call Information\nThe company will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the results, followed by a question and answer session for the investment community.
