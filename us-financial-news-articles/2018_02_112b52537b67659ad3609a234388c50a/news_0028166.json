The production is expected to be exported via a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. \nSenegalâ€™s President Macky Sall signed an inter-governmental cooperation accord on Friday with his counterpart in Mauritania, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, during a state visit. \nKosmos said the agreement provides for development of the Tortue field through cross-border unitization, with a 50-50 initial split of resources and revenues, and a mechanism for future equity redeterminations based on actual production and other technical data. \nThe agreement comes at a time when energy companies are pushing further west from the waters off established African producers such as Angola, Nigeria and Gabon. \nHowever, in a region where maritime boundaries are often poorly established, the move into new, untapped territory carries the risk of inflaming tensions between neighbours.
