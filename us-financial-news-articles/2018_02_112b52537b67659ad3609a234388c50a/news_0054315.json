REUTERS/Marco Bello The Democratic Unity’s decision leaves Maduro facing just one confirmed candidate so far: a little-known evangelical pastor named Javier Bertucci.\nAnother likely candidate is opposition leader Henri Falcon, a former state governor who parted with the socialists in 2010. He has expressed his desire to run against Maduro and may break with the coalition decision to boycott the vote.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Falcon’s candidacy will likely infuriate Maduro’s adversaries, many of whom see him as a Trojan horse seeking to help Maduro legitimize a rigged vote.\nMaduro has faced calls in Latin America and internationally to improve conditions for the vote, with the United States pondering oil sanctions to pressure him.\nHe says the country is victim of an “economic war” led by the opposition with the help of the United States.\n“We’ll get to the elections whether there’s rain, thunder, or lightning - with or without the (Democratic Unity Coalition),” Maduro told a news conference in response to the opposition’s announcement.\nHe added that he supports a proposal to hold an early congressional vote on April 22, adding that elections should be held the same day for state and local legislatures.\nReporting by Corina Pons, Deisy Buitrago, and Andrew CawthorneEditing by Cynthia Osterman and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T01:24:42.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
