He has a great history here and he is very friendly with the shareholders,” added the American, who joined the Woking-based outfit at the end of 2016.\nHamilton won his first title with McLaren in 2008, a year after his debut, before moving to Mercedes in 2013 and taking three more championships.\nThe sport’s most high-profile driver, who enjoys a private jet and all the trappings of success, said last November he expected a new contract to be straightforward -- a sentiment echoed by team boss and shareholder Toto Wolff.\n“Lewis has become such an important pillar within the team that it’s a no-brainer that we continue with each other,” said the Austrian.\nBrown felt any delay in signing was likely to be more down to Hamilton than the team.\n”I am going to guess that he’s contemplating how much longer he wants to go,“ he said. ”If you’re Lewis, with what you’ve done with Mercedes and where Mercedes are headed, you’d re-sign with the team.\n”He’s talked about when he stops, so that would be my guess. I can’t imagine it’s money or the quality of the team.\n”He just might be going ‘let me see how this year goes, what’s the rush? They’re not going to sell the seat from underneath me’. That would be my speculation.\n“We might find they actually have signed and are just not telling us.”\nThe season starts in Australia on March 25.\nFerrari are likely to have a vacancy at the end of the season, with 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen out of contract, and the sport’s oldest and most successful team also have a special allure.\nMcLaren are the second most successful team but have not won a race since 2012 and finished ninth of 10 teams last year, splitting with Honda and starting a new partnership with Renault.\nThey are hoping to be challenging for the podium again this campaign.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T02:37:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
