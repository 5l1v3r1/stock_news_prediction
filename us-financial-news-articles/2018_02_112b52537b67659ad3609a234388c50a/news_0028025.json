After considering many alternative geographies we decided on the vibrant technology corridor in Maryland, and the City of Gaithersburg was chosen. The city's support for our transition and their fast-tracking of the normal permitting process and overall support enabled us to move here with relative ease and speed. We look forward to contributing to the local economy, being part of the ever-broadening technology local network, and aspire to serve as a model corporate citizen.\"\nNissen added: \"We are grateful for the support provided by the University of Cincinnati over the past several years in hosting us, and providing the infrastructure and support to help us evolve our technology and people. Incubation centers such as these are vital in providing a shared services model of expensive laboratory equipment, and they help in establishing the visibility to attract technology talent.\"\nThe Montgomery County Economic Development Corporation (MCEDC), along with Gaithersburg and state partners, helped assist the move from Cincinnati. \"We welcome Applied Biomimetic to Montgomery County,\" said MCEDC President & CEO, David Petr. \"The company's unique combination of biotechnology and engineering has great potential to improve the water purification industry and others. Their work leverages Montgomery County's strong biotech talents while expanding our industry reach. We see a great future in Montgomery County for this growing, innovative company.\"\n\"We are so pleased that Applied Biomimetic recognized Montgomery County's advantages for both research and development and manufacturing,\" noted Montgomery County Executive Ike Leggett.\n\"Attracting and maintaining innovative biotechnology companies strengthens our community and adds to its vibrancy,\" said Jud Ashman, Mayor of the City of Gaithersburg. \"We look forward to welcoming Applied Biomimetic to Gaithersburg and witnessing its future growth.\"\nRecalling Applied Biomimetics' Danish roots, Jacob Vind, Danish Consul General & Head of the Danish Water Technology Alliance added: \"At the Danish Trade Council we are working closely with Applied Biomimetic through our Water Technology Alliance in the US. We are happy to see our partners succeed, grow and expand their businesses, not only in Denmark but also here in the US.
