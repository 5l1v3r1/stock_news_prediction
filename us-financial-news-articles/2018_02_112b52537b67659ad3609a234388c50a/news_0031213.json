Shep Garner led the way with 16 points, while Tony Carr scored 15. Lamar Stevens added 11 points, and Josh Reaves and Mike Watkins each tallied 10.\nLeron Black scored a game-high 18 points for the Fighting Illini (12-14, 2-11), who managed just 16 second-half points. Kipper Nichols and Te‘Jon Lucas came off the bench to notch 12 and 10, respectively.\nA 26-9 burst enabled Penn State to turn a four-point deficit late in the first half into a commanding lead. Garner’s 3-pointer with 13:07 remaining upped the margin to 49-36. The advantage never dipped into single figures for the game’s remainder.\nThe Nittany Lions still have a chance to earn an at-large NCAA Tournament berth. Their next three games are against Ohio State, Purdue and Michigan, and the only one of those on the road is Purdue.\nIllinois got off to a fast start, as it has done in several conference games, and established a 16-10 lead at the 14:48 mark of the first half when Lucas canned a jumper. Penn State rallied and grabbed a 24-23 edge when Julian Moore converted a three-point play with 7:51 left.\nAn 11-4 run by the Fighting Illini, capped by a Lucas jumper, restored a 34-28 advantage with 2:37 remaining. A Lucas layup at the 1:16 mark made it 36-32, but the Nittany Lions started their game-breaking spurt with five points in the final 3.7 seconds of the half.\nAfter Garner made a 3-pointer with six seconds left, Illinois called its use-it-or-lose-it timeout to set up a final play, but Mark Alstork committed a turnover on the inbounds pass. Carr converted that into a short jumper as time expired, giving Penn State a 37-36 halftime edge.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:43:38.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
