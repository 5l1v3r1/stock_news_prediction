Emerging Europe also opened stronger, with Polish and Hungarian shares bouncing 1.6-1.8 percent and Turkish stocks up 1.1 percent.\nSouth African stocks chalked up some tentative gains and the rand firmed 0.4 percent ahead of a meeting at which the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party will determine Zuma’s fate.\n“It’s positive but we have this feeling that most of the positive news has been priced in,” said Tresca, adding Credit Agricole was slightly negative on the rand in the short-to-medium term as it would not be easy to present a tough budget.\n“The business model is completely broken in South Africa. You need to change the whole country and it will take time. The bar is set high for (ANC leader and Deputy President Cyril) Ramaphosa,” Tresca said.\nThe average yield spread of South African sovereign dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global index narrowed by 7 basis points (bps) to 239 bps and five-year credit default swaps fell 4 bps from Friday’s close to 159 bps. Local benchmark 10-year bond yields, which had topped 9.5 percent in November - fell to 8.4 percent.\nThe Russian rouble gained 0.7 percent, helped by oil prices rallying 2.2 percent. Russia’s central bank trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Friday to 7.5 percent, as expected, after inflation hit a record low.\nWith the dollar weakening 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies, Turkey’s lira and Mexico’s peso firmed around 0.3-0.4 percent.\nChina’s yuan was an underperformer, weakening 0.5 percent after recording its ninth straight weekly gain, its longest winning streak since early 2013.\nRecent strength in the yuan has sparked speculation that the Chinese central bank could reinstate the “counter-cyclical” factor, a discretionary factor it introduced into the yuan midpoint formula last year to contain the currency’s decline.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1151.74 +8.89 +0.78 -0.58\nCzech Rep 1114.16 +8.10 +0.73 +3.34\nPoland 2420.68 +37.89 +1.59 -1.65\nHungary 38940.36 +620.04 +1.62 -1.11\nRomania 8120.55 +118.00 +1.47 +4.73\nGreece 842.49 +13.71 +1.65 +5.00\nRussia 1206.02 +20.23 +1.71 +4.47\nSouth Africa 49461.38 +173.93 +0.35 -5.85\nTurkey 14996.34 +1406.07 +1.24 -0.29\nChina 3153.56 +23.71 +0.76 -4.64\nIndia 34251.05 +245.29 +0.72 +0.57\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.36 25.36 +0.02 +0.68\nPoland 4.18 4.18 -0.03 -0.19\nHungary 312.15 311.73 -0.13 -0.52\nRomania 4.65 4.65 +0.10 +0.59\nSerbia 118.36 118.40 +0.03 +0.03\nRussia 57.90 58.33 +0.74 -0.42\nKazakhstan 326.11 327.47 +0.42 +2.05\nUkraine 26.83 27.02 +0.71 +4.90\nSouth Africa 11.95 12.03 +0.65 +3.39\nKenya 100.80 100.70 -0.10 +2.28\nIsrael 3.52 3.51 -0.16 -1.20\nTurkey 3.81 3.82 +0.28 -0.58\nChina 6.33 6.30 -0.51 +2.80\nIndia 64.30 64.37 +0.11 -0.73\nBrazil 3.29 3.29 -0.03 +0.52\nMexico 18.63 18.70 +0.35 +5.44\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 314 -6 .00 7 86.30 1\nAll data taken from Reuters at 09:00 GMT.
