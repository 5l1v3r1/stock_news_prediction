We thank her for her invaluable contribution to JBSF and contributing to the success of Jamaica’s first female bobsled Olympic appearance.”\nThe BBC reported that the departure of Kiriasis, who owns the sled the Jamaicans are planning to compete in, came after she was asked to change her role.\n“I have never known such disappointment in this sport, in my life,” Kiriasis was reported as saying.\n“The athletes have told me they don’t understand why this has happened as they have no problem with me and we have a good relationship.”\nWomen’s bobsleigh training begins on Saturday with the opening heats on Tuesday.
