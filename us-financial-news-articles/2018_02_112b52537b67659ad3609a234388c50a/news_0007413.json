The Federal Reserve has been on a path of gradual rate increases, and if conditions continue as they have been, that process is likely to continue, and as it does we would expect long rates to move up.”\nOn Saturday she hands the reins to President Donald Trump’s pick to replace her, Governor Jerome Powell. She will stay in Washington as a fellow at the Brookings Institution, the think tank where former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke also works.\nReporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by James Dalgleish\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T03:33:20.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
