Bloomberg earlier cited sources saying that Deutsche is trimming senior and mid-level investment banking positions. Deutsche’s Corporate and Investment Bank had 17,251 full-time employees at the end of 2017. It is in the process of cutting 9,000 jobs group-wide from 2015 levels, or around one in 10 staff, with 4,000 jobs expected to go in Germany.
