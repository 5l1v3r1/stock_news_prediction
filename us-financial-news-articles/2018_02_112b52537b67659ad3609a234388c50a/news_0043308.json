By reversing the Obama administration policies, the report argues, the economy will be able to grow 3% per year over the next decade.\n“In recent years, the pursuit of alternative policy aspirations at the expense of growth has imposed real economic costs on the American people, in the form of diminished opportunity, security, equity, and even health,” the report said.\nIn chapters on taxes, regulation, labor market policies, infrastructure, trade, health and cybersecurity, the administration argued that its policies would provide modest boosts to gross domestic product that when added up would be sufficient to shift output onto a significantly higher trajectory over the next decade.\nThe report repeated an estimate, disputed by Democrats, that recently passed tax legislation will increase average annual household income by $4,000.\nThe report reopens the debate on why the labor-force participation rate, defined as the share of Americans working or looking for work, had declined in recent years.\nThe CEA concluded that while the retirement of the oldest members of the baby boomer generation is reducing the labor-force participation rate, half the decline since the fourth quarter of 2007 has been accounted for by nondemographic factors. The report singled out government transfer payments, such as unemployment insurance, food stamps and disability insurance, as programs that contributed to people remaining out of the labor-force.\nPresident Barack Obama’s CEA released a report in 2014 arguing that only one-sixth of the decline in labor force participation could be attributed to factors other than demographics and recovering from a deep recession.\nMr. Hassett said the report is also critical of administrations beside Mr. Obama, noting that Mr. Obama hadn’t changed the corporate tax rate and that trade deals of recent decades that are “filled with concessions that relatively feckless negotiators of the past made to our trading partners,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T19:49:30.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
