Its shares are down 4.9 percent Friday. \nDevitt maintained his $1,150 price target for Alphabet shares, representing 3 percent downside to Thursday's close. \nThe analyst said Amazon is a threat to Google's ad business. He noted more than half of US consumers use Amazon to search for products over the company's search engine. \n\"Amazon has grown its position as the first destination for consumer product searches,\" he wrote. \"This has the potential to cannibalize Google's revenue from retail advertisers.\" \nDevitt said Google has \"high single digit\" market share in the global cloud computing market compared to Amazon Web Services' more than 35 percent share. \nGoogle's cloud computing business \"is playing from behind, but there remains significant opportunity,\" he wrote. \nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nâ€” CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:10:40.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
