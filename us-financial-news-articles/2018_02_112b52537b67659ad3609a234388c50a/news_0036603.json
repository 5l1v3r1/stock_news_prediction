It plans to increase capacity by 3-4 percent overall on its main passenger network this year.\n“We have been helped by the good environment,” Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey said, adding Air France-KLM’s increase in profit was also helped by stable unit costs.\nThe group had set an initial target early last year to reduce unit costs by 1-1.5 percent, but added caveats to that at its third-quarter results. It said it was aiming for a reduction of 1-1.5 percent this year, excluding the impact of currency, fuel and pension charges.\nGagey said forward-bookings on long-haul flights were up 1 percentage point in February, up 4 percentage points in March, down 1 percentage point in April because of Easter, and up 2 percent for May.\nAnalysts expect Air France-KLM to come under pressure from rising fuel costs this year, and expansion of low-cost rivals in Paris and Amsterdam. It will also have to negotiate increased pressure on labour costs, with unions having called for a strike on Feb 22 to support demands for a 6 percent pay increase.\nGagey said unit revenues in the domestic market in France had come under pressure from new high-speed train routes to Bordeaux and that the group was closely watching the development of new low-cost players.\n“But it seems that launching low-cost long-haul flights without connecting services is challenging,” Gagey said, pointing to Norwegian Air Shuttle, which on Thursday reported a bigger than expected loss for the last quarter of 2017.\nTraditional rivals IAG and Lufthansa are due to report over the next few weeks.\n$1 = 0.7972 euros Reporting by Victoria Bryan and Dominique Rodriguez Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta/Bate Felix\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:42:12.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
