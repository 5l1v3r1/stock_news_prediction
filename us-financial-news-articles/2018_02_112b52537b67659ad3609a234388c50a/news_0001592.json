(“FBM” or the “Company”) (NYSE:FBM), one of the largest specialty distributors of wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and mechanical insulation in North America, announced today that it has completed the acquisitions of two specialty building product distributors in the Midwest to enhance its growth strategy and expand its product offerings. The terms of the transactions were not disclosed.\nFor over 30 years, R M Supply, Inc. (“R M Supply”) has been an independent distributor of wallboard, steel framing, insulation, and wallboard accessories. R M Supply operates two branches in Wentzville and Herculaneum, Missouri. For almost 70 years, ArmCom Distributing Company (\"ArmCom\"), a division of the St. Paul Linoleum and Carpet Company, has been an independent distributor of ceiling products. ArmCom operates five branches: St. Louis Park, Minnesota; Rochester, Minnesota; Fargo, North Dakota; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Omaha, Nebraska.\n“A fundamental component of our successful growth strategy is to secure highly-complementary acquisitions with compelling track records of success,” said Ruben Mendoza, FBM’s Chief Executive Officer. “R M Supply and ArmCom are ideal strategic and financial fits for our company and represent uniquely positive and durable attributes. They are, first and foremost, well-run companies and have longstanding customer relationships in the residential and commercial markets of the Midwest.”\nThe Company expects the performance of the two acquired companies to be consistent with prior years, with an estimated $27 million to $29 million in collective net sales for the remainder of fiscal year 2018. These transactions are expected to be immediately accretive to the Company with financial benefits driven by increased scale and expected cost savings.\nAbout Foundation Building Materials\nFoundation Building Materials is a specialty distributor of wallboard, suspended ceiling systems, and mechanical insulation throughout North America. Based in Tustin, California, the Company employs more than 3,700 people and operates more than 220 branches across the U.S. and Canada.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
