The bans were reduced to six years by FIFA’s appeals committee in February 2016.\nBlatter, who has denied all charges against him, had compared the FIFA Ethics Committee investigation to “the inquisition”.\nIn 2015 Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Blatter on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation but no charges have yet been brought.\nThe man who headed FIFA from 1998 to 2015 says he intends to attend June’s World Cup in Russia after a personal invitation from Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAdditional reporting by Brian Homewood in Zurich, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:53:07.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
