Erdogan blames the attempted coup on Fethullah Gulen, an exiled cleric and former ally based in the United States. Gulen has denied any role in the plot.\nReporting by David Alexander; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:13:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
