Santa Monica, California-based Ring is Amazon’s latest move in expanding into the heated “smart-homes” market, where gadgets are powered by easy-to-use technology to control homes with a few spoken words. Amazon has positioned its Echo smart speaker, powered by its Alexa voice assistant, as a smart homes device. Amazon confirmed it would buy Santa Monica, California-based Ring, but declined to comment on the deal terms. “Ring’s home security products and services have delighted customers since day one.
