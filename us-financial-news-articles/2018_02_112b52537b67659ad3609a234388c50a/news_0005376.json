The shares traded at 427.1 pence by 1235 GMT.\nMELROSE METHOD Melrose specializes in buying companies that it can improve through investment and cost cuts with the aim of selling them at a profit later.\nLater on Thursday morning it issued a trading update Miller said offered “clear proof” of the change in fortune it could bring to GKN.\nOne of its recent acquisitions, U.S. ventilation and home security products maker Nortek, had seen underlying profit rise by 50 percent compared to 2016 and an improved operating margin of 15 percent, Melrose said. This compares to 9.3 percent prior to the acquisition.\nHowever another of its businesses, gas and steam turbine firm Brush Turbogenerator, is to be restructured at an expected cost of 40 million pounds after sales fell by more than half. Melrose blamed shifts in global environmental policy.\nThe offer document said Melrose would consider a variety of options for GKN’s businesses once they had been improved, which could include sale or floatation.\nThe FTSE 100 company GKN now has 14 days to publish its detailed defense against the bid, and Stevens said this would include its own transformation plan.\n“We remain committed to separation at the right time,” she added, arguing that Melrose lacked relevant experience in high technology business and investing for the long term.\nOne hedge fund manager said the investment community believes Melrose would ultimately be the better manager for GKN and that a 5-10 percent bump to the current terms would likely be enough to secure a GKN recommendation.\n“Unless of course someone else enters the fray with a bid for aero or auto, then we have ourselves a bidding war.”\nMelrose’s offer for GKN consists of 1.49 new Melrose shares and 81 pence per GKN share and represented a value of 418.3 pence per GKN share, based on Wednesday’s close. Melrose shares added 0.3 percent to 227.1 pence on Thursday.Elliott, a hedge fund with 0.48 percent stake in GKN and a 0.2 percent short position in Melrose, declined to comment.($1 = 0.7034 pounds)\nReporting by Emma Rumney.
