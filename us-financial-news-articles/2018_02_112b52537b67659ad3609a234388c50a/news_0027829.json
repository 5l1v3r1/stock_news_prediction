In New York, Wall Street's main indexes fell for the first time in three sessions on Tuesday as caution crept in ahead of crucial data on inflation, a root cause of the recent sell-off. A strong reading on U.S. consumer price and retail sales data on Wednesday could fan concerns of faster interest rate hikes. Higher interest rates would dampen interest in high-yield emerging market assets. Mexico's IPC index edged up slightly, lifted by shares in Mexican miner and infrastructure firm Grupo Mexico . Shares in Mexican conglomerate Alfa, which competes in industries from food packaging to car parts to petrochemicals, were up 1.79 percent, the day after the company reported a narrower net loss in the fourth quarter. Telecoms giant America Movil, which is controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, is set to report fourth-quarter earnings later on Tuesday. Its shares were up 0.12 percent in late-morning trading. Mexico's peso weakened 0.3 percent to 18.655 pesos per dollar. The markets in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, were closed for Carnival celebrations, as were Argentina's.
