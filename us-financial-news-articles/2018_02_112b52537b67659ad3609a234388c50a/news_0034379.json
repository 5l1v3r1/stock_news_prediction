Come back with a proposal. We have a lot of people that are great Republicans that want something to happen. We have to rebuild our country.”\nThe White House wants to use $200 billion in federal funding to try to encourage $1.5 trillion in improvements over 10 years by relying on state and local governments and the private sector. It also wants to eliminate environmental hurdles to projects and sell off federal assets.\nDemocratic Senator Ed Markey said the plan “expects cash-strapped states to drive most of the progress on 1/8th of a tank of gas. We need $1 trillion in direct federal spending to rebuild our infrastructure.”\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the plan would “empower decision-making at the state and the local level, because state and local officials know best the infrastructure needs of their communities.”\nU.S. President Donald Trump holds a meeting on infrastructure with members of Congress at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 14, 2018.

The plan “includes limited additional federal funding and lacks a long-term solution for the federal highway trust fund, which serves as the primary source of existing federal infrastructure funding,” Fitch said.\nDemocrats want $1 trillion in new federal spending and say the government must find new revenue sources to pay for crumbling roads. The U.S. gas tax has not been raised since 1993 and Congress has shifted more than $130 billion to shore up the highway trust fund since 2008.\nAuditors say the trust fund will need an additional $107 billion through 2026 to keep pace with current spending.\nChao said on Tuesday the administration was weighing a range of options to fund public infrastructure projects, including a higher tax on gasoline.\nRepublican Senator John Kennedy said any improvements must be paid for. “I need to know where the money’s going to come from,” adding he did not want “to borrow more money from China.”\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T00:49:51.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
