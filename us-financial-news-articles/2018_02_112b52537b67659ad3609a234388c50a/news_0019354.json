REUTERS/Regis Duvignau “The tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels are analyzed several times a year by the National Laboratory of Metrology and Testing, with the approval of the Ministry of Health, to ensure compliance with regulations.”\nImperial Tobacco’s Seita subsidiary said: “We respect European standards and our cigarettes are tested by an independent laboratory.”\nBritish American Tobacco France said it too adhered to regulations and that all its tobacco products were subjected to “rigorous, independent and transparent tests”.\nPhilip Morris France declined to comment.\nThe anti-smoking organization said real nicotine levels were five times higher than shown in the tests, while actual tar levels are two to 10 times higher.\nIt was not clear from the 34-page complaint how the CNCT arrived at its calculations.\nThe allegations echo the use of so-called “defeat devices” by car makers such as Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) to mask high pollution levels when being tested in labs.\nReporting by Emmanuel Jarry and Julie Carriat; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T19:06:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
