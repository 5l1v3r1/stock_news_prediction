Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.8 percent to a record high of $1.25 trillion in December.\nThe Atlanta Fed’s early GDP estimates, however, tend to be much higher than the official government readings and are subject to downward revisions from incoming data.\nStill, the latest forecast reinforced the view that U.S. businesses and consumers are in good shape, which would allow the Federal Reserve to further raise interest rates in 2018.
