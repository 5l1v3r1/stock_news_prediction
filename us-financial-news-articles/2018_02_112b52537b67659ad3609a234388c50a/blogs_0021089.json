The index began losing steam in afternoon trade shortly after a rise in the 10-year Treasury yield, rekindling the worry that sparked this cascading market plunge last Friday.\n\"That's probably the biggest thing happening here,\" said Dave Lutz, head of ETF trading at JonesTrading, referring to the rise in yields. He also noted the rise — which followed a lackluster auction — pressured stocks earlier in the session.\nThe 10-year yield traded at 2.853 percent as of 3:23 p.m. ET. The Dow Jones industrial average traded 137 points higher. The index rose as much as 381 points and fell as much as 127 points.\nYields also rose after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said leaders have reached a two-year budget deal which would increase current spending caps by roughly $300 billion.\n\"I think it was on the budget deal but it wasn't helped by the soft auction,\" said John Briggs of NatWest, referring to the move in yields. \"You could get a scenario where the curve steepens. And there's a flight to quality in the short end and in the long end, it would be rising, in terms of deficits and supply weighing on the long end.\"\nThe Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3 percent as some of the major tech stocks pulled back. Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet all traded down at least 1 percent. Apple also fell 1.2 percent.\nThe latest moves come after three volatile sessions in which fear of rising inflation sent interest rates higher, pressuring equities. Traders also blamed computerized trading and sharp moves in obscure volatility funds that use leverage for the market's recent swings.\n\"I think this bull market is basically in the process of forming a top,\" Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, told CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" on Wednesday . \"This is the first crack of it.\"\n\"Bull-market tops tend to be a process, not an event,\" he said. \"The reason why this is likely to play out this year is the trifecta which has been driving global stocks over the last 12-to-18 months as a big tailwind is now bound to turn into a headwind.\" The trifecta Sharma refers to is better-than-expected global growth, weaker-than-expected inflation and loose monetary policy.\nOn Friday, the Dow and S&P 500 capped off their worst weekly performance in two years after a stronger-than-expected jobs report sent interest rates higher. The decline on Wall Street picked up steam on Monday, with the Dow plummeting 1,175 points as investors rushed for the exits in the wake of higher rates. On Tuesday, the 30-stock index swung 1,167.5 points before closing 567 points higher.\n\"This was a good old correction and one that was probably needed,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, noting stocks kicked off the year trading sharply higher.\nBut despite Tuesday's sharp close higher, the Dow is down 4.4 percent since Friday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, meanwhile, are down 4.4 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively, since then.\n\"What's interesting is market volatility had been so low and the market just kept going up,\" said Cooper Abbott, chairman of Carillon Tower Advisers. He also noted the market will start to see more volatility it \"returns to normal.\"\nThe Cboe Volatility index — widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market — has also been all over the map this week. On Monday, it more than doubled from 17.34 to 37.32. It also hit 50 on Tuesday before closing at 29.98. On Wednesday, it traded at 24.2.\nA decline in stocks usually leads to a rise in volatility, but never like this. The latest spike in volatility could point to a big problem on Wall Street, some traders believe. Trading algorithms and levered fund products may have separated this market from past historical patterns, causing moves to be exaggerated.\nshow chapters Here's what you should know about the 'fear index' 52 Mins Ago | 02:05 In corporate news, earnings season remained in full swing Wednesday with Hasbro and Michael Kors reporting before the bell.
