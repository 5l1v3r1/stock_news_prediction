Programmes Chief Didier Evrard told reporters on Tuesday that the supply chain could cope with more than 10 A350 deliveries a month, the current target Airbus aims to reach by the year-end. He was speaking on the sidelines of the inaugural delivery of the largest version of the jet, the A350-1000, to launch customer Qatar Airways.
