Kevin Poulin replaced him and preserved the shutout.\nSlideshow (8 Images) “I just took him (Savinainen) out of the play and he landed awkwardly on Scrivey,” O‘Dell said. “It was obviously a tough break for our team, but Poulin came in and held his own. He played great for us.”\n“You don’t want your team mate to get hurt, but you’ve got to anticipate,” Poulin said. “I came in not expecting to play, but at the same time I’ve got to be ready to.”\nSeveral Canadian players were surprised by news that Germany had taken out Sweden, but they said it would not change how they prepare for the next game.\n“We’re ready for any team, and every team from here going forward is going to be tough,” forward Derek Roy said.\nReporting By Dan Burns; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T16:58:14.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
