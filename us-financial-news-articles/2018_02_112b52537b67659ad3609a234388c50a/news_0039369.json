(NASDAQ: ICHR), a leader in the design, engineering, and manufacturing of critical fluid and gas delivery subsystems for semiconductor capital equipment, today announced that its board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of the company’s ordinary shares.\n“Our confidence in the continued strength of the company and positive free cash flow performance led us to approve this share repurchase program,” commented Chairman and CEO Tom Rohrs. “Ichor’s management team and board of directors firmly believe in our long-term growth prospects, and we are also committed to efficient capital allocation. Given our continued outlook for strong cash generation, as well as available funds on our new revolving credit facility, we believe the company has the financial position to continue to invest for future organic and inorganic growth, while also allocating capital toward stock repurchases on an opportunistic basis.”\nConcurrent with the announcement of this program, the company has completed the refinancing of their existing term loans and revolving credit facility, with a new $175 million term loan and an expanded revolving credit facility of up to $125 million. The interest rates on both the new term loan and revolving credit facility have each been reduced by 25 basis points, with maturity extended from August 2020 to February 2023.\nThis $50 million share repurchase program is effective immediately and will be funded using the company’s available cash, as well as incremental borrowing on the new revolving credit facility. Share repurchases under this program may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions, at times and in such amounts as the board and management deem appropriate, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. The share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the company may commence, suspend or discontinue purchases of ordinary shares under this authorization at any time or periodically without prior notice.\nAs of December 29, 2017, Ichor had $69.2 million in cash and restricted cash, $189.5 million in long-term debt, and approximately 25.9 million shares outstanding.\nAbout Ichor\nIchor is a leader in the design, engineering and manufacturing of critical fluid delivery subsystems for semiconductor capital equipment. Our primary offerings include gas and chemical delivery subsystems, collectively known as fluid delivery subsystems, which are key elements of the process tools used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. Our gas delivery subsystems deliver, monitor and control precise quantities of the specialized gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes such as etch and deposition. Our chemical delivery subsystems precisely blend and dispense the reactive liquid chemistries used in semiconductor manufacturing processes such as electroplating and cleaning. We also manufacture certain components for internal use in fluid delivery systems and for direct sales to our customers. This vertically integrated portion of our business is primarily focused on metal and plastic parts that are used in gas and chemical systems, respectively.
