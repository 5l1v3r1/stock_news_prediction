A successful flight would make the rocket the most powerful in use today – at a fraction of the cost of any other comparable rocket ever built. Musk has noted before that failure is a possibility for the demonstration flight, saying there is a \"lot that can go wrong.\"\nFalcon Heavy is now in place on launch pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The company will have until 4:00 p.m. EST to attempt a launch, or the mission will be scrubbed to a later day.\nAt liftoff Falcon Heavy will create a combined 5 million pounds of thrust – or the equivalent of about 18 Boeing 747 aircraft at takeoff. Musk has called it the \"most powerful rocket in the world by a factor of two,\" and its payload is estimated to be nearly three times that of the former Space Shuttles, as well as the currently operating Delta IV Heavy and Ariane 5 ES rockets.\nSpaceX also plans to attempt a recovery of Falcon Heavy's three boosters, returning two to the ground at Cape Canaveral and the final third to the company's autonomous drone ship floating off the Florida coast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T22:28:28.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
