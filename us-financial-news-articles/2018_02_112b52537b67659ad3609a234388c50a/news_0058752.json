Bush’s administration, that exempted such transfers from a national water discharge program aimed at curbing pollution.\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T15:23:21.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
