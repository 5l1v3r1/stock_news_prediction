That is a positive sign.”\n** Aarskog: “Supply growth is still high but the market is working. When prices drop then people start buying more fish and demand is growing.”\n** Aarskog: “We have seen 20 percent demand growth in France and Germany for fresh fish, as a response to the price drop.” (Reporting by Ole Petter Skonnord, editing by Terje Solsvik)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:18:56.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
