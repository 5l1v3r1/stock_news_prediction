It wasn’t painful and it wasn’t really difficult to overcome except for the mental aspect, and there was a whole different set of challenges there.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch \n“Meeting other stroke survivors and seeing how much true grit and perseverance they’ve shown is in a whole different ball park than I’ve ever experienced in my life in sport.” \nAlthough Morrison, who will race in the 1,500m in Gangneung and is also part of Canada’s team pursuit squad, has been forced to adapt because of his injuries, he is trying to turn the modifications into an advantage. \n”We’ve been changing a lot of things, especially at the start line,“ he added. ”That’s the most difficult part for me, even to this day. Because of adapting the start, I’ve had to adapt the entire race in some way or another. \n“It’s been challenging, but it’s been kind of exciting in that I’ve changed my whole race, I’ve changed my whole training and I‘m getting results that are shockingly close to what I used to see with an entirely different strategy.” \nMorrison has fond memories of the Sochi Games, especially of his silver in the 1,000m, and is eager to rekindle the feeling of racing the perfect race in South Korea. \n“Of course I want the medals in everything I race in, but I would like to replicate the feeling that I had after my 1,000m in Sochi after my 1,500m here,” he said. \n“I was (in) an early pair in the 1,000m and I was fist-pumping, I was high-fiving my coaches, and I didn’t even care if I was on the podium. That was the best I could have done that day. That’s what I would like to do in the 1,500m especially.” Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T06:57:19.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
