They motivated me to send it on that last one,” White told reporters.\n“I knew I had it in me, I watched these young guys putting these amazing runs in and it fired me up. I just wanted to show that this is what I have been doing my entire life.”\nSnowboarding - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's Halfpipe Qualification - Phoenix Snow Park - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 13, 2018 - Shaun White of the U.S. competes. REUTERS/Issei Kato White, 31, also spoke of his pride in inspiring the younger competitors, specifically 19-year-old Hirano who claimed the silver medal in Sochi four years ago.\n“Honestly Ayumu, I have watched him since he was 13 years old. He was in a tough position... Yeah they were saying that to him (that Ayumu was going to be the next Shaun White) as a 13-year-old kid,” White added.\nSlideshow (4 Images) ”That’s a lot of pressure and a lot to live up to - and I am sitting there saying ‘What do you mean? I am still here’. I am just proud to be someone that changed the sport.\n“This is my fourth Olympics, I have never really felt like an underdog since I was a little kid.”\nThe final starts at 1000 local time (0100 GMT) on Wednesday with White chasing a record third Olympic snowboarding gold medal.\nReporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:19:31.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
