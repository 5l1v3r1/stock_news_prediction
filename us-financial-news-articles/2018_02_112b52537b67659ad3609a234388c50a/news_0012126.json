Excluding the benefit from a new U.S. tax law, it earned 64 cents a share in the quarter.\nDunkin' Brands expects its 2018 effective tax rate to be about 28 percent, against 38.5 percent in 2017, Chief Executive Nigel Travis said on a conference call with analysts.\nTotal sales climbed 5.3 percent to $227.1 million in the quarter, after all four Dunkin' Brands business segments reported same-store sales gains   three years.\nAnalysts, on average, had expected quarterly earnings of 63 cents a share on revenue of $220.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nSame-store sales at U.S. Dunkin' Donuts restaurants, which account for roughly 70 percent of overall revenue, rose 0.8 percent, matching analysts' estimate.\nMcDonald's last week reported a 4.5 percent rise in U.S. sales at established restaurants and has ramped up pressure on rivals with the launch of its $1, $2, $3 value menu, which includes breakfast items, in early January.\nDunkin' Donuts had a 2 for $5 breakfast sandwich promotion in the fourth quarter and a $2 food and drink promotion in January.\nThe chain, like Starbucks Corp, has struggled to lure more customers in the afternoon, a phenomenon that some analysts attribute to McDonald's more aggressive pricing.\nShares in Dunkin' Brands were down 1.3 percent at $60.05 amid volatile trading in the broader U.S. stock market.\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernadette Baum)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T21:14:10.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
