Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. However, management believes that, in order to properly understand our short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations. Management also uses results of operations before such items to evaluate the operating performance of athenahealth and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors.\nIn Q4 2016, management redefined “ Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Profit ” as total revenue, less cost of revenue, plus (1) stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue, (2) amortization of purchased intangible assets allocated to cost of revenue, (3) integration and transaction costs allocated to cost of revenue, and (4) exit costs, including restructuring costs allocated to cost of revenue, and “ Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin ” as Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of total revenue. Management defines “ Service Automation Profit ”, formerly referred to as Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Profit, as total revenue, less cost of revenue, plus (1) stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue, (2) amortization of purchased intangible assets allocated to cost of revenue, (3) integration and transaction costs allocated to cost of revenue, (4) exit costs, including restructuring costs allocated to cost of revenue, (5) amortization and depreciation expense allocated to cost of revenue, and (6) overhead expense allocated to cost of revenue, and “ Service Automation Rate ”, formerly referred to as Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin, as Service Automation Profit as a percentage of total revenue. Management considers these non-GAAP financial measures and metrics to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Moreover, management believes that these measures and metrics enable investors and financial analysts to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nManagement defines “ Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Income ” as the sum of GAAP net income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes; total other expense (income); stock-based compensation expense; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development; amortization of purchased intangible assets; integration and transaction costs; exit costs, including restructuring costs; and gain or loss on investments; and “ Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Income Margin ” as Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of total revenue. Management defines “ Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income ” as the sum of GAAP net income before stock-based compensation expense; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development; amortization of purchased intangible assets; integration and transaction costs; exit costs, including restructuring costs; and gain or loss on investments and any tax impact related to these preceding items; and an adjustment to the tax provision for the non-GAAP tax rate and “ Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share ” as Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Management considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Moreover, management believes that these measures enable investors and financial analysts to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nManagement excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure or metric referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to that excluded item:\nStock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development — excluded because these are non-cash expenditures that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expenditure is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price, volatility, and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expenses are incurred.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets — purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, this item is not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\nIntegration and transaction costs — Integration costs are the severance payments and retention bonuses for certain employees related to specific transactions. Transaction costs are costs related to strategic transactions. Accordingly, management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\nExit costs, including restructuring costs — represent costs incurred as a result of strategic realignments including those related to workforce reductions, termination of certain lease or other agreements, and non-cash charges related to the write down of certain assets. Management does not believe such costs accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such costs are incurred.\nGain or loss on investments — represents gains or losses on the sales, conversions, or impairments of our investments, such as marketable securities and More Disruption Please (“MDP”) Accelerator investments. Management does not believe such gains or losses accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such gains or losses are reported.\nNon-GAAP tax rate — We use a non-GAAP tax rate of 40%, which approximates our marginal statutory rate, to normalize the tax impact to our Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share based on the fact that a relatively small change in pre-tax GAAP income (loss) in any one period could result in a volatile GAAP effective tax rate.\nSource: athenahealth, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=AWAz67he5hQ34oNx_ax88oTclOLcRfZJQLSTrJbfCIpoN4ebRB3RzamvLrxYvWZuN988OzHi2TlH2Mc-K-5hwg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=X56LDvnlWn45Ioqfym_7cuN_iGiEF6VgOtOgbeHz9gTOZZ2h7XkMWff1M0Pc8beScImw6xB9rlYEhROyOZEa3w==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Fb5qtgAdggOANw3BV8vilKFns8HO_nsdMmtIZEZhc8CmUvCaLHZvqXHP1RwpLH4rHLYvqlUkERsYofnjQ1-Y4AzS3GXmR2wZvU_q6iVH6Z0=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Fb5qtgAdggOANw3BV8vilMN4i97Lb_K9eriEnZHHaWY-oQNByrgUhz9QZmijmMD05y9JMJD3J4hjOXaxGEWCmtTfD8a54hPgudfvQimIkik=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Fb5qtgAdggOANw3BV8vilIecqRVXYwmvdrdzbczS8R2_Y_rsS5hS-egqyeibuORmdjpkunh9znLyZST7KJRy2bfemF_AQPZOqqjf5mWNsrg=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d832ace5-030b-4c42-aa61-6eabb9de70f0", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=isYRrcrS1dGoRWVTUbQxN_E6y0fTlQjRA-XK2vpo123sp3XhFG0eONVGLAb2oJuDjTQW08ZZmKFQkDzgM0VxMAmwiT51ETW_37JMiFSrQrc=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=umMdCT0xJqqEXI-5oBKQs0_-dckMeSmCuK9WxUKUokVuG_192JN83ukxeUnAdhNEPHn7JigSIPl35XCIqVaqCrirsGJdJr6WewdhGLbH0hUHYjmo43Eh7kbMKfkfUN2NvznCVaFacLzl51QqF1pymA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GwjyLM-oQ18V3FOvY1M9LutWULH8CaOmXkEGNxDsMUeaOliuTk8eVm-RZZZyE5KR4kihbaVFrdsnJcbrU8Tl0yEXHhAqnTNtTsHEi8q4Ghw=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vBJGEziHPgOdNTWCj6kA6hvmqGtQl3THCH2DLyayXKLGtP9sWq8uq-E6dUhXIqUfCSfSiamBrx7AtoePCHyj-Q=="], "published": "2018-02-02T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T01:08:25.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
