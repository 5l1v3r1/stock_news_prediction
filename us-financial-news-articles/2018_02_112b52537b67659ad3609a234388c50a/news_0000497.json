But there is a clear difference, our commitment to bringing peace does not mean we will sit quietly and won’t retaliate.” \n“We will dig them out from any hiding holes.” \nAfghanistan’s government has made such vows for years but the insurgency appears ever more resilient. Peace efforts have been made in fits and starts but without progress. \nU.S.   appeared to dash any hope for peace efforts on Monday when he condemned the Taliban for the Kabul violence and rejected the idea of talks. \nTrump last year ordered an increase in U.S. troops, air strikes and other assistance to Afghan forces, to force the Taliban to negotiate. \nBut his comments on Monday suggested he saw a military victory over the Taliban, an outcome that U.S. military and diplomatic officials said could not be achieved with the resources and manpower he had authorized. \nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said in Kabul on Tuesday the U.S. strategy had not changed and the aim was still to press the Taliban militarily to convince them that they had to negotiate. \nThe Taliban are fighting to drive out foreign troops and re-establish their form of strict Islamic law. \nAfghanistan has long accused neighboring Pakistan of failing to act against Taliban plotting violence from safe havens on the Pakistani side of the border. \nOn Friday, Ghani accused Pakistan of being the “Taliban center” and said he was waiting for Pakistani action. \nPakistan denies helping the Taliban and a Pakistani delegation led by Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua visited Kabul on Saturday with the aim of fostering cooperation. Janjua called for both sides to stop the “blame game”, Pakistani media reported. \nThe United States said last month it would cut security aid to Pakistan, complaining it was not doing enough to fight militants sheltering there.
