That’s unacceptable.”\nFor the third quarter, Toyota posted 673.6 billion yen in operating profit, a 54 percent jump from a year earlier and its best quarterly operating profit in two years.\nThe result exceeded a mean estimate of 527.22 billion yen taken from 11 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and included a 291.9 billion yen reduction in income taxes, largely resulting from the impact of a cut in U.S. tax.\nNORTH AMERICA SLUMP On a consolidated basis, Toyota sold 2.29 million vehicles globally in October-December, largely flat from a year prior. Sales in Japan rose 3.3 percent but fell 1.3 percent in North America, where the automaker is struggling with heavy discounting as it tries to produce and sell larger vehicles.\nCentral and South America and other regions were a bright spot for sales, which rose 6.2 percent, while in Europe they rose 1.7 percent.\nOperating profit in North America tumbled 73.3 percent.\nToyota has had a bumpy ride in the United States, its biggest market where it trails only General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) in terms of sales, as automakers continue to angle for higher market share as overall sales retreat from a record high hit in 2016.\nProfitability in the U.S. market is key for Toyota to help generate funds as it invests heavily in new technologies including self-driving functions, electric cars and new mobility services.\nAs U.S. drivers continue to gravitate toward larger pick-up trucks and SUVs over sedans and hatchbacks, Toyota, best known for its Camry and Corolla sedans, has been scrambling to shift more production from cars to trucks.\nMeanwhile, it sold its sedans at hefty discounts for much of 2017 to bolster demand for models like the Camry, while also raising incentives on its SUVs and trucks including its popular RAV4, to remain competitive in the U.S. market.\nThis has lifted overall marketing costs per vehicle by 10 percent in 2017 from 2016, according to figures from Autodata, and making marketing costs a key drag on the company’s profits.\nReporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Christopher Cushing\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T08:32:34.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
