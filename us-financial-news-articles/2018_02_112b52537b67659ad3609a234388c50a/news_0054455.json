There is no way to avoid modifications of diesel cars at the expense of carmakers,” Luksic said.\nWriting by Andrea Shalal and Madeline Chambers; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T18:26:21.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
