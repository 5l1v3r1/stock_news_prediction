(1) Subject to the ultimate discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company's management expects to continue to recommend quarterly dividends of $0.41 per share until conditions warrant otherwise.

The declaration and amount of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\n(1) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the fourth quarter 2017 dividend will be treated as a capital distribution to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2018. In computing their 2018 U.S. federal taxable income, U.S. shareholders will generally be required to take into account their allocable share of the Company's taxable income as reported to them on their 2018 Schedules K-1.\nFor tax withholding purposes, the distribution consists of the following components:\nAmount of Dividend Interest Income (U.S.) that Qualifies for the Portfolio Interest Exception (1) $ 0.1847\nOther Interest Income (2) $ 0.0027\nU.S. Dividend Income (2) $ 0.2226\nTotal Distribution Per Unit (3) $ 0.4100 (1)\nAs described in §871 (h) of the Internal Revenue Code (“the Code”).\n(2)\nSubject to withholding under §1441 of the Code.\n(3)\nNo portion of this distribution represents income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
