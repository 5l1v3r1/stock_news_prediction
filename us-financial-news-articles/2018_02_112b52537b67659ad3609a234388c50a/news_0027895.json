Iwabuchi, one of the lightest riders on the tour, was just one example of the top riders struggling in the conditions.\nAustrian Anna Gasser, who told reporters after the event that the wind conditions made the event “a lottery”, was another favorite who struggled and failed to land either of her runs.\nANDERSON EXPERIENCE\nSnowboarding - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Slopestyle Finals - Phoenix Snow Park - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 12, 2018 - (R) Bronze medallist Enni Rukajarvi of Finland, gold medallist Jamie Anderson of the U.S. (C) and silver medallist Laurie Blouin of Canada pose with their small Soohorang Olympic mascots during flower ceremony. REUTERS/Mike Blake Anderson said her experience allowed her to handle the conditions better than some of her younger competitors, who were struggling to reign in some of the jumps that went too big for them to handle in the windy conditions.\n“It is about who can deal with their nerves best and deal with the conditions in the moment,” said 27-year-old Anderson after the final.\nShe agreed with her rivals that the events were hard but also said it was about adjusting to the conditions and putting together a run suited for the specific situation.\nSlideshow (12 Images) Anderson has spoken in the build-up to the Olympics about the youngest athletes pushing her to go harder and she reiterated that on Monday.\n“There is a lot more competition compared to in Sochi. In Sochi I knew I was one of the best,” she said.\n“For a lot of years I wasn’t progressing but now we are doing tricks I wasn’t doing before. I didn’t think a lot of those tricks were possible.”\nRelated Coverage Snowboarding: Race director defends wind-hit slopestyle final Snowboarding: Experience key in tough conditions - Anderson Snowboarding - Strong winds cause havoc in slopestyle final Blouin, who was stretchered off the course in practice on Friday, completed an incredible comeback to clinch the silver medal.\n“I caught an edge on the third jump and slammed my face. I then went to hospital to check my neck and I was cleared for practice,” said the Canadian, a big bruise clear underneath her left eye.\n“Now I have second place and I don’t believe it. It is a dream come true.”\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T06:46:05.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
