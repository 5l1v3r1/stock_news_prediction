This is one of them.” \nSeeking to minimise the fallout of the security lapse, prominent conservative lawmakers have sought to focus attention on the decision of the ABC to publish details found within the top secret files. \nThe ABC defended the publication, insisting it was in the national interest, though former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said on Twitter on Thursday that he had launched legal action against the national broadcaster. \nRudd was this week left embarrassed after the ABC ran a story that said the former leader had ignored advice around the dangers of a home insulation package in 2008. \nRudd was later cleared on any wrongdoing by an independent investigation with sweeping powers, which he said the ABC ignored in its reporting. \n“The report by the ABC alleging I ignored warnings on the risks to the safety of installers of home insulation is a lie,” Rudd said in the statement. \n“Legal proceedings against the ABC has now commenced.” Reporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; Editing by James Dalgleish", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T02:18:55.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
