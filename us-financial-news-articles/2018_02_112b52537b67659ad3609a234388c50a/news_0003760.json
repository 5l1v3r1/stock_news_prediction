The 28-year-old has made 23 league appearances this season, scoring one goal. \nGracia confirmed goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes (back) and defenders Craig Cathcart (knee) and Younes Kaboul (foot) were ruled out of the clash with injuries.

I think with the players we do have we can still do some good work,” he said. \nNew signing Didier Ndong will be unavailable as the midfielder completes the final game of a three-match ban incurred at his former club Sunderland. \nWatford are 11th in the table with 27 points from 25 games with seven wins, six draws and 12 defeats.
