Its slide made cryptocurrency investors $44.2 billion poorer in January alone. \nThe Indian finance minister pronouncement does at least clear up the government’s intentions regarding Bitcoin. It started probing illegal exchanges in December, and also established a panel to work out new policies. \nThe distributed-ledger technology known as blockchain, however, is becoming increasingly popular with policy makers as it promises great efficiency and security for things like land registries. Indian states started examining that potential last year. \nUpdate: At least one Indian bitcoin wallet provider, Unocoin, believes Jaitley’s words have been misinterpreted: Based on the #UnionBudget2018 announcement, there is no change in government's stance with respect to #cryptocurrency .
