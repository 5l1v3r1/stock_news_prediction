When three workers were trying to put out the flames, an explosion occurred, killing more people living nearby,” it said.\nThe victims consisted of workers at the facility and their families, who lived in makeshift wooden rooms on the second floor, Xinhua said.\n“The garbage burnt quickly and discharged heavy smoke. The victims were unable to escape.”\nChina has just begun a week-long holiday for the Lunar New Year, when fireworks and firecrackers are traditionally let off in celebration.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T05:41:24.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
