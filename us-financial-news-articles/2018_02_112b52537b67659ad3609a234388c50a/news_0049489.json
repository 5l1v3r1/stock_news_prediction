The agency said it believed Greece will return to self-sufficiency and market-based funding.\nGreece has also been upgraded by S&P Global and Fitch recently, but Moody’s was not due to review Greece’s rating until later.\n“It came as a surprise in terms of the timing -- but the overall rating story and economic story on Greece is on track,” said DZ Bank analyst Sebastian Fellechner.\nThe yield on Greece’s 10-year government bond fell 9 basis points to 4.34 percent before steading at around 4.38 percent in late trade. Shorter-dated Greek 5-year government bond yields briefly dropped as much as 30 basis points to 3.348 percent.
