The name change will be effective upon acceptance of the amendment by the Delaware Secretary of State. The Company also announced a strategic pivot to make and sell high quality low-cost carbon fiber using plasma oxidation technology as opposed to licensing the technology.\nRodney Grubb, Chairman and COO, said, \"We strongly believe the strategic pivot provides us the ability to take full advantage of the technology and is in line with our vision of revolutionizing the carbon fiber industry.\"\n\"The best way to extract the economic and technical value from the technology is to build carbon fiber production lines. 4M is unwavering in executing our plan for commercialization and is dedicated to providing long term shareholder value,\" added Josh Kimmel, CEO.\n4M is focused on acquiring multiple key industry executives and technical experts in preparation for commercialization of its plasma technology.\nInterest continues to grow from the carbon fiber industry as 4M prepares to deploy its proprietary plasma oxidation technology to meet the growing demand for carbon fiber. Compared to conventional oxidation, plasma oxidation is 3 times faster, uses less than one third the energy, and produces a better product. These claims have been validated by multiple international carbon fiber producers and the company is in discussions with several of the world's largest carbon fiber makers and automakers to participate as the launch partner for the production of low cost carbon fiber.\nAbout 4M Carbon Fiber Corp.\nNamed for plasma, the fourth state of matter, 4M Carbon Fiber Corp. is headquartered in Knoxville, TN as a manufacturer specializing in using plasma oxidation equipment to make carbon fiber and oxidized PAN fiber. The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, 4M Industrial Oxidation, LLC holds the exclusive rights to commercialize an atmospheric plasma oxidation process that was co-developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and RMX Technologies, LLC. With support from the U.S. Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, RMX developed a revolutionary plasma-based carbon fiber oxidation technology and is supporting 4M Carbon Fiber Corp. in commercializing this technology to make carbon fiber.
