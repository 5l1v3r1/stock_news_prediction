Sometimes they are lynched.\nChildren are also targeted with their parents and communities misled into battering, maiming, drowning, burning and abandoning them.\n“In the African context, witch branding usually leads to alienation of women from the community and this denies her rights to own land or even inherit it and reduces her ability to fend for herself,” said ActionAid Kenya’s Philip Kilonzo.\n“It is increasingly becoming a practice in some communities to lynch witches which leads to further violation of their rights by denying them the right to life.”\nActivists said it was key that films addressing these issues were seen where it mattered most.\n“The use of films can be limiting in challenging such forms of violence against women as films speak to the privileged in the society, yet issues such as witch branding happen in the very remote rural areas and informal settlements in urban areas,” said Makena Mwobobia, ActionAid Kenya’s Head of Policy.\n“However, if translated into the local languages, the same films can be used to speak to the emotions and the core of the community and hence touch on their individual character for behavioural change.”\nReporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
