But Manning said its resolution did not win the required votes of at least 50 percent plus one shareholders from the non-control group.\nHowever, she added there was a realization within the controlling shareholders and OMA that some of its points were valid, and the technical assistance fee was subsequently reduced to 4 percent and then 3 percent.\nTechnical assistance contracts are not unique to Mexico or the aviation industry, but Manning said it was unusual to keep them in place for such a long time.\nShe said Corporacion America Airports, which operates airports in Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Ecuador, Italy, Peru and Uruguay, had such a structure but decided it was not needed any longer.\nWhile shareholders get no direct benefit from the cancellation of the fee, it amounts to a hidden tariff for passengers and airlines that use the airports, which Manning said could hinder overall growth and ultimately earnings.\nActivist Insight, which tracks demands publicly presented by investors, has recorded just three campaigns across all of Latin America during 2016.\nAsset managers often say they prefer to engage privately with companies over contentious issues to maintain relations with the board. They only escalate to a more public forum if talks prove unsuccessful.\nManning said Aberdeen Standard Investments has pursued between six and ten activist-style investments across its entire emerging market portfolio.\nIn Mexico, it took on Fomento Economico Mexicano (Femsa), the world’s largest franchise bottler of Coca Cola products, as well as the country’s largest local bank Grupo Financiero Banorte.\nHowever, Manning said both of its proposals were unsuccessful.\nFemsa shareholders rejected the idea of a change in the share structure, voting to keep the preferential dividend that the current structure offers.\nMeanwhile, shareholders of Banorte voted in favor of the proposed acquisition of Grupo Financero Interacciones, which Standard Life sought to prevent.\nThe companies did not respond to requests for comment.\nAsur and Grupo Aeropuerto del Pacifico, another large airport developer, outperformed the Mexican market year to date through Feb. 9 while OMA slightly underperformed, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n“We don’t see ourselves as activist investors. There is a subtle difference in that we buy what we think are good quality companies,” Manning said.\n“So, for us, a company has to meet a minimum threshold before it is investable. Then, we would be looking on how we can improve it.”\nReporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher and Simon Jessop; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T08:28:18.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
