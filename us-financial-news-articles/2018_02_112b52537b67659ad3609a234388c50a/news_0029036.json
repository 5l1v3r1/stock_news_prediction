This compares to previous revenue guidance for the year ended December 31, 2017 of between 26.0 million and 28.0 million euros. Gross margin for 2018 is expected to be above 40%. Operating expenses for the full year 2018 are expected as follows: SG&A expenses in the range of 11.0 million and 12.0 million euros, and R&D expenses to be approximately 5.0 million to 6.0 million euros. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between 3.75 million and 4.0 million euros. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be neutral-to-positive in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of foreign exchange valuations. Capital expenditures are projected to be in the range of 5.5 million to 6.5 million euros, which primarily include ongoing investments in our global subsidiaries. Our revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2018 is in the range of 4.5 million and 5.5 million euros. This compares to revenue of 4.5 million euros in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company will release its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 after the closing of the financial markets on Thursday, March 29, 2018. Based on a preliminary assessment, the Company expects to report full year 2017 revenue in the range of 22.5 million and 23.5 million euros as the relatively strong second half of 2017 could not fully compensate the weaker first half of 2017.

With a strong balance sheet and a robust lineup of new and advanced products, we have the foundation in place to fuel voxeljet’s next phase of long-term growth.”\n(1) Estimated results reflect voxeljet’s preliminary unaudited estimates and views on market trends observed for 2017 and are based on information available as of the date hereof.
