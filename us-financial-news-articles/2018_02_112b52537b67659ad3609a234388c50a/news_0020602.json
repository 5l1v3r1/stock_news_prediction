November was upwardly revised to a decline of 7.3 percent from the initially reported 7.7 percent decline.\nResidential permits rose 8 percent nationally, as the province of Ontario saw a 15.7 percent jump in construction intentions for single-family homes.\nThe Ontario government implemented a number of measures last spring to rein in rampant price increases in Toronto and the surrounding areas. While single-family building permits declined in Toronto in December, that was offset by increases in the nearby Barrie and Kitchener regions.\nPlans for multi-family homes, which include condominiums and townhouses, also drove permits higher, with construction intentions led by British Columbia.\nNonresidential permits dipped 0.6 percent as a decline in plans for commercial and institutional buildings offset a jump in the industrial component.\nOn a non-adjusted basis, building permits rose 10.4 percent in 2017, the biggest increase since 2010, as both residential and non-residential building plans increased.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:34:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
