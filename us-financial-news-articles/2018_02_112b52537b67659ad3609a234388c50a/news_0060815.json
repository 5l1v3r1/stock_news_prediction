CEO Tim Wentworth was speaking to Wall Street analysts about the company’s interest in expanding managing pharmacy benefits under the federal Medicare program for older or disabled people a day after the company reported higher fourth-quarter profit. “If a meaningful book of business is coming to the market, we would take a look,” Wentworth said. Analysts have speculated that CVS and Aetna will need to sell some plans to please antitrust regulators. The CVS-Aetna combination would lower costs and offer more competitive Part D Medicare drug plans, CVS spokesman David Palombi said. The deal is “a complementary transaction with minimal overlap in the Medicare Part D segment and there are many large and significant competitors that offer Part D plans,” Palombi said. Aetna declined to comment. Express Scripts ( ESRX.O ) shares fell 2.3 percent to $76.64 while CVS ( CVS.N ) added 0.1 percent at $68.30, and Aetna ( AET.N ) was up 0.6 percent at $177.37 in morning trading.
