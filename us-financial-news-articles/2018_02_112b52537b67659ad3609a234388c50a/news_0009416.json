Slideshow (23 Images) \nThe Gunners’ new record signing, Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, renewed his scoring partnership with former Borussia Dortmund team mate Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the 38th minute, chipping his neatly flicked-in pass over the onrushing goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. \nEverton’s Theo Walcott was substituted off on the hour mark to a standing ovation from his former club, and was replaced by forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin who moments later headed in from close range. \nThe win leaves Arsenal unchanged in sixth place in the table, three points adrift of north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who visit Liverpool on Sunday. The Gunners travel to Spurs in a week’s time. \nEverton’s loss pushes them down one spot in the table to 10th.
