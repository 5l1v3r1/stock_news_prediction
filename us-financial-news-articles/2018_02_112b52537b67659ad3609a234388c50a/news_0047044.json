We could see a repeat of yesterday, when European stocks gradually warmed up from a weak start to end the session higher. Here's your futures snapshot: (Kit Rees) EUROPEAN EARNINGS: LLOYDS, GLENCORE, UK HOUSEBUILDERS IN FOCUS (0643 GMT) As we said earlier, it's going to be another busy day of earnings, especially for UK banks with Lloyds set to give a full-year update. A report from Sky News late yesterday said that Lloyds will unveil a 1 billion pound ($1.40 billion) share buyback plan with its annual results, but Lloyds has declined to comment on the report. We've also got miner Glencore reporting full-year figures, and a couple of UK housebuilders giving updates. More broadly, European fourth-quarter earnings are expected to have increased by 14.6 percent from the same period in 2016, or 11.6 percent excluding the energy sector, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
