They also shelled a primary school in the Maydanki village a day earlier, but the artillery caused no casualties, he said. \nThe Turkish military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nAnkara launched an air and ground offensive last month against Kurdish fighters in Syria’s Afrin region on its border, opening a new front in the multi-sided Syrian war.
