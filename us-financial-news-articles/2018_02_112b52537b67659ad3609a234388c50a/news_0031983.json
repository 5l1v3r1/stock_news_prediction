Renault currently holds 43.4 percent of Nissan, which in turn controls Mitsubishi Motors ( 7211.T ) via a 34 percent stake.\nInstead, Renault confirmed Chief Competitive Officer Thierry Bollore’s promotion to the new role of chief operating officer. Bollore, a former Michelin ( MICP.PA ) manager, joined Renault in 2012 from French supplier Faurecia ( EPED.PA ).\nBoth sides have sought to avoid a repeat of a bitter 2015 clash in which Macron - then economy minister - raised the government’s Renault stake to swing a shareholder vote and secure double voting rights.\nFrench state representatives had been pushing Ghosn since the middle of last year to hire a second-in-command with the managerial and international clout to succeed him.\nIndependent board members including former Total ( TOTF.PA ) boss Thierry Desmarest had voiced concerns about the recruitment process and its failure to identify external candidates, sources have said.\nDesmarest, 72, resigned from the board last week but said in a subsequent company statement that he fully supported the “strategy and governance of Renault”.\nRenault is scheduled to publish its 2017 financial results on Friday.\nReporting by Laurence Frost and Ingrid Melander, editing by David Evans and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T02:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:38:36.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
