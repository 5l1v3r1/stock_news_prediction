Three others have been under construction for years in Finland and China and are all over budget and schedule.\nIt could also force EDF to increase its cost estimate for the reactor, which it last updated to 10.5 billion euros in September 2015, from an original estimate of 3 billion euros.\nDelays and cost overruns at the Flamanville reactor: here (Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Dominique Vidalon and Alexander Smith)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:22:36.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
