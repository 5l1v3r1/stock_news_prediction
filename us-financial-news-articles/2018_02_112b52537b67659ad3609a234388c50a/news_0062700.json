As a result, she would get bullied until her twin sister Kaye fought the other students off.\nIn her adolescence, Maye helped her father with his chiropractor clinic, working as a receptionist and putting client newsletters together, according to Forbes . She began modeling at 15 and by 21, earned her bachelor's degree and a spot as a 1969 Miss South Africa finalist.\nSimilar to her father, Maye later had her children doing clerical work for her private practice as a dietician, a business she ran out of her home. The Musk siblings all helped out and Tosca remembers writing letters for Maye and answering the phone, according to Loder. \n\"It really helped us to get a sense of independence as well as understand work ethics,\" Tosca says.\nAt 31, Maye divorced her engineer husband of nine years and left South Africa with her children for North America.\nAs a single mother raising her kids with help from Kaye , Maye continued modeling on the side. At the time, the Musks couldn't afford small luxuries like eating out or going to the movies and Maye, to save money, gave the kids haircuts, manicures and pedicures.\nMaye tells Loder that her kids were well-behaved because \"I wouldn't allow them to be brats, I couldn't afford that.\"\n\"She wasn't, like, watching me. I was off making explosives and reading books and building rockets and doing things that could have gotten me killed,\" Elon told Rolling Stone last year. \nThanks to their mother, Kimbal says he and his siblings \"felt very independent as children,\" Loder reports.\nThe Musk siblings also have their mom to thank for teaching them at a young age the importance of creating your own opportunities.\n\"They grow up knowing you work hard, and the harder you work, the better you do and the luckier you get,\" Maye told Vanity Fair in 2015. \"They also had to be responsible for themselves, because they had to help me.\"\nMaye Musk Elon mom u r a genius tweet \n< Elon proud of mom > \n\nMaye Musk | Kimbal, Tosca, and Elon Musk (Right) pose with their mother, Maye, before school in a childhood photo. Maye continues inspiring her family as a champion of inclusion and diversity in modeling while advancing her career. In 2016, she signed with agency IMG Models, which represents runway icons like Miranda Kerr, Gisele Bündchen and Karlie Kloss.\nMaye's penchant for keeping optimistic and working hard appears to be inherited from her father, as she wrote on her Twitter and Instagram recently: \"'Keep Smiling' was my Dad's motto. #happyfamily .\"\nDon't miss: \nBillionaire Warren Buffett: Doubling your net worth won't make you happier Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella attributes his success to this one trait Like this story?
