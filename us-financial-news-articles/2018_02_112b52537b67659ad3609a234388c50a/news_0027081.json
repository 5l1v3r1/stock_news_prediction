Obviously she had just done her arm the day before and it is just so unlucky. First run, first hit and then done.”\nNicholls, who is four years older than his cousin and competing in his second Olympics, did not, however, use Ormerod’s injury as an excuse for failing to qualify.\nAll three of the British snowboarders competing in the men’s slopestyle failed to qualify for Sunday’s final.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:08:59.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
