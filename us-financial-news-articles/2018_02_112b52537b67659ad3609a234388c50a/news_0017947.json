Those rules, introduced in 2015, were lauded by tech companies and consumer groups but denounced by internet service providers as hindering investment. \nThe Internet Association, which represents Google’s parent, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ), Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ) and many others, said in a letter on Thursday to Senate leaders that it backed the Senate effort to reverse the vote, but also called for a long-term fix. \n”The internet industry urges Congress to legislate a permanent solution,” the group said in the letter made public on Thursday. “The time has come for a bipartisan effort to establish permanent net neutrality rules.” \nA public backlash against the FCC’s plan, especially among younger people, has raised concerns among some politicians about how the issue might play out in the 2018 congressional elections. \nMore than 20 U.S. state attorneys general are also mounting a legal challenge of the FCC’s vote to reverse the rules introduced in 2015 that prevent internet providers, such as AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ), from obstructing information they transmit to customers or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization. \nWhile the FCC reversal will lift those restrictions on providers, a future FCC could reimpose them and internet providers have also urged Congress to write new laws to end a decade-long dispute over the future of the internet. Democrats have shown little interest in working to write new rules. \nInternet companies say that without net neutrality protection, many Americans will have little recourse. The letter on Thursday said that “more than half of all Americans have no choice in their provider, and 87 percent of rural Americans have no choice.” \nUSTelecom, which represents AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) and other phone companies, said “we couldn’t agree more that Congress needs to engage on (net neutrality) to craft a bill that addresses the key issues, includes all players in the ecosystem and finally resolves the disruptive policy back and forth.” Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Susan Thomas", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T17:14:46.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
