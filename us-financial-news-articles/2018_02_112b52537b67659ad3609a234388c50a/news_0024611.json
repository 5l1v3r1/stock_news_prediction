The judging is out of your hands and so you just have to try your best and that is what I did and I was rewarded.” Reporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T08:23:31.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
