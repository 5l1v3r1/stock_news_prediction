In September, he said he was ending the DACA program created by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, effective in March, unless Congress came up with a new law. \nThe program protects about 700,000 people, mostly young Hispanic adults, from deportation and provides work permits. \nLawmakers have struggled to reach a deal on an immigration bill, despite broad public support for helping Dreamers. \nTrump has said any immigration deal must include billions of dollars to build a wall on the border with Mexico.
