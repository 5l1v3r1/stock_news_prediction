Suu Kyi has opened a new round of talks with some of the groups since last May.\nThe Nobel Peace Prize winner had been criticized overseas for not standing up for the largely stateless Rohingya in the western state of Rakhine, where an army crackdown forced more than 688,000 to flee to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 last year.\nThe United Nations described Myanmar’s crackdown as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, a charge Myanmar denies.\nReporting by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Alex Richardson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:26:00.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
