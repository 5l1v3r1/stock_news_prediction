It has vowed to “vigorously defend” the claims.\n“CBA accepts that the failure to issue TTRs (threshold transaction reports) and SMRs (suspicious matter reports) in accordance with the Act has deprived law enforcement of some additional intelligence,” the bank said in its amended court filing on Friday.\nCBA now admitted to 53,506 claims of late filing of transaction reports. It said however that these should be treated as one breach.\nThe maximum penalty for a single contravention is up to A$21 million ($16.5 million), leaving CBA potentially exposed to billions of dollars in fines if they are treated separately.\nIt admitted in whole or in part to 56 breaches of customer due diligence requirements, but denied a further 53 allegations.\nThe AUSTRAC allegations include attempts to wire money to Beirut by a person who was convicted in 2005 of terrorism-related activities, which was not reported within 24 hours, as required.\nCBA also admitted to an unspecified number of breaches of transaction monitoring rules between October 2012 and October 2015, but denied AUSTRAC’s claim of 14 separate contraventions.\nOf 230 claims concerning suspicious matter reporting, it said it had “made errors in 98 instances” although these also should not be treated as separate contraventions.\nAn AUSTRAC spokeswoman said the agency was unable to comment because the matter was before the courts.\nIn a separate case, CBA also said it denied all allegations regarding a shareholder class action commenced by Zonia Holdings against it in October 2017.\nCBA shares were 0.4 percent higher in morning trade, in line with the broader market\n$1 = 1.2760 Australian dollars Reporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T03:13:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
