But it illustrates the high stakes for Canada’s energy industry if new pipelines are not built and the fierce environmental opposition against them.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has approved the pipeline expansion, said last week that he would ensure the project gets built.\nExperts disagree over whether British Columbia has authority to block inter-provincial transport, which is a federal jurisdiction. However, the move by the province’s left-leaning New Democrat government adds a potential snag to a project that is already a year behind schedule.\nTight capacity moving crude by pipeline and railway from landlocked Alberta last month generated the biggest price discount on the province’s heavy oil in more than four years compared to the West Texas Intermediate CLc1 North American benchmark.\nReporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg and Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by James Dalgleish and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:53:36.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
