It ranked among the top 10 social networks, according to data from AppAnnie, which measures mobile downloads. \nIn Britain there were 655,000 unique visitors to Nextdoor in December 2017 according to SimilarWeb. \nIt also launched in Germany in mid 2017 ( reut.rs/2rTIDs5 ), but has yet to draw in many members, independent data sources show. The company does not publish its own membership data and declined to comment on user figures by country. \nThe Nextdoor service is free for users in European markets, with no sponsored advertising. It began testing sponsored advertising in the United States last year. \nThe firm has raised more than $285 million in funding from major venture investors including Benchmark, Greylock Partners, Tiger Global Management, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, according to Crunchbase data.
