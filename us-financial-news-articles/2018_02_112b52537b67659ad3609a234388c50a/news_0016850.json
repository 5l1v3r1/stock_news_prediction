That is above Booker’s closing price of 221.5 pence on Thursday and the value of Tesco’s bid when the deal was agreed in January 2017, when the cash-and-shares offer was worth 205.3 pence per share. \nSandell’s criticism of the deal with Britain’s biggest retailer comes ahead of a vote by Booker’s shareholders to approve the takeover at a meeting due to be held on February 28. Booker needs the backing of 75 percent of its shareholders for the deal to proceed. \nTesco’s acquisition of Britain’s largest wholesaler would increase the supermarket operator’s dominance of Britain’s food market. \nThe deal has attracted criticism from elsewhere, with Tesco shareholders Schroders and Artisan Partners disclosing they were against the acquisition last March. A Tesco non-executive director, the late Richard Cousins, also quit the board of the retailer because he was opposed to the takeover.
