Results are summarized below, both as an aggregation of Kyocera’s first three fiscal quarters (the “period,” i.e., nine months), and as the third quarter alone (the “quarter,” i.e., three months), ended Dec. 31, 2017.

Revenue in the document solutions business increased as well, following new product launches and related sales promotions. Additionally, merger and acquisitions made a further contribution to the company’s business expansion.\nAs a result, the company attained record nine-month sales of JPY1,145,016 (USD10,133) million, an increase of JPY130,388 (USD1,154) million, or 12.9%, over the same period of the prior year. Most profit metrics showed significant increases as well, due mainly to stronger sales and successful cost reduction measures. Profit from operations increased 62.4%, to JPY108,984 (USD964) million; and income before income taxes increased 46.8%, to JPY144,864 (USD1,282) million. Net income attributable to Kyocera Corporation's shareholders increased 27.4%, to JPY90,267 (USD799) million, despite third-quarter expenses at U.S. subsidiaries including AVX Corporation, primarily resulting from tax law revisions in the U.S., which amounted to a decrease of approximately JPY11,000 (USD97) million.\nAverage exchange rates for the nine months reflected the Japanese yen’s weakening against the U.S. dollar by approximately 4.7%, to JPY112, and against the euro by approximately 9.3%, to JPY129, as compared with the same period of the prior year. As a result, net sales and income before income taxes increased by approximately JPY39 billion (USD345 million) and JPY13 billion (USD115 million), respectively, as compared with the prior-year period.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights: Third Quarter\nUnit: Millions (except percentages) Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\n(FY17-Q3)\nin JPY\n2017\n(FY18-Q3)\nin JPY\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n2017\n(FY18-Q3)\nin USD\n2017\n(FY18-Q3)\nin EUR\nAmount\nin JPY\n% Net sales: 361,385 406,671 45,286 12.5 3,599 3,012 Profit from operations: 33,317 39,479 6,162 18.5 349 292 Income before income taxes: 50,128 57,024 6,896 13.8 505 422 Net income attributable to\nKyocera Corporation's\nshareholders:\n34,699 28,880 (5,819) (16.8) 256 214 (See note above regarding exchange rates.)\nExpectations for the Full Fiscal Year\nFor the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, Kyocera makes no change to the forecasts for net sales, profit from operations, or income before income taxes that it announced on October 30, 2017, since its business results are generally in line with those projections.
