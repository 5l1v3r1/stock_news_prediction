Separately on Monday, the European Central Bank stopped all payments by ABLV Bank, Latvia’s third biggest lender, over liquidity concerns after the U.S. Treasury accused it of money laundering. Straume said the U.S. allegations do “not relate to this criminal procedure (detention) in any way at the moment”.
