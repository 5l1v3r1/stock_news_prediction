Getty Images JP Morgan Chase's corporate headquarters in New York City. \nBy Aaron Back \nIs this as good as it gets for JPMorgan Chase JPM, -0.91% ? \nThe bank gave nothing but good news on its investor day, among other things raising its medium-term target for return on tangible common equity, a key profitability metric, to 17% from 15%, thanks largely to lower tax rates. \nJP Morganâ€™s shares did nothing.
