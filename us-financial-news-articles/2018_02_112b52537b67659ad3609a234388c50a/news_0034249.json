REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson EASING TENSIONS North and South Korea have remained in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. The poor one-party state to the North and wealthy democratic South are divided by a heavy militarized border.\nDuring the figure skating pair’s short program on Wednesday, South Korean students advocating warmer ties with the North brandished a banner that read: “Pyeongchang fairy Ryom Tae Ok, jump toward unification!”.\nRyom and Kim work with Canadian coach Bruno Marcotte, who has said they need to improve their power to be a threat on the international stage.\nFigure Skating – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Pair Skating free skating competition final – Gangneung Ice Arena - Gangneung, South Korea – February 15, 2018 - Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik of North Korea compete.

They fell a few tenths of a point short, but are on track for their longer-term goal.\n“Our goal has always been to break a record again and again, and advance step by step and not to turn back no matter what happens,” Kim said.\nNorth Korea agreed to compete in Pyeongchang after the South and the International Olympic Committee encouraged the heavily sanctioned state to take part as a peace gesture.\nNorth Korea’s participation is viewed as a sign of easing tensions over its nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\nThe country did not have any athletes at the 2014 Sochi winter Games, but has sent 22 to Pyeongchang, including 12 ice hockey players in a combined North and South Korean women’s team.\nAmerican skater Nathan Chen said it was “super awesome” to have them at the Games.\n“They just feel like any other athlete, any other competitor, and it’s really cool to see the Olympics do that,” he told a news conference.\n“Ultimately, I‘m really glad that they’re here and it’s great to see that figure skating is able to reach everyone.”\nAdditional reporting by Elaine Lies, Editing by Mark Bendeich and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T13:39:39.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
