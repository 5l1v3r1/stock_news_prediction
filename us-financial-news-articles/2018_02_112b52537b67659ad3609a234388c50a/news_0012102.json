Joint Managing Director Seshagiri Rao had previously said the company was interested in five steelmakers in bankruptcy proceedings, including Bhushan Steel. \nVijaykumar V. Iyer, the bankruptcy court-appointed administrator for Bhushan Steel, did not respond to repeated requests for a comment. Court-appointed insolvency officials rarely discuss details of cases with the media. \nA Tata Steel spokesman declined to comment when asked if the company had bid for Bhushan Steel, but said: “looking at strategic growth is an ongoing process”. \nAsked about the bid, India Resurgence Fund said it would not comment on “market speculation”. \nBhushan Steel, with an annual steelmaking capacity of 5.6 million tonnes, is one of the biggest producers of cold-rolled steel products used to make cars and consumer goods such as refrigerators and washing machines. \nArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker which industry sources had previously said was interested in bidding for Bhushan Steel, did not submit a bid, the company said in a statement to Reuters, adding: “We remain interested at looking at future opportunities in India.” \nIndian media had earlier reported that JSW Steel and Tata Steel had bid for Bhushan Steel. \nIndia, which did not have a formal bankruptcy process until mid-2016, has seen a surge in bankruptcy cases since last year, with over 500 companies currently facing bankruptcy court proceedings. \nThe surge in cases comes after the government changed the law giving greater powers to the central bank, which has so far ordered creditor banks to push nearly 40 companies with loan defaults of nearly 4 trillion rupees ($62.46 billion) into bankruptcy proceedings.
