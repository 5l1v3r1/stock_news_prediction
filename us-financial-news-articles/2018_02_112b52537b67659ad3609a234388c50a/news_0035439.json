They buy more upscale bottles, Leccia said.\nAfter a few lean years in China, LVMH, Pernod Ricard and Remy Cointreau have had a rebound in sales of cognac in the country.\nIn total, cognac exports rose by 10.8 percent to 3.07 billion euros in 2017. Wine sales increased 9.6 percent to 8.67 billion euros, including a rise of 7.4 percent to 2.82 billion euros for champagne, FEVS said.\nIn Britain, France’s second biggest export market for wine and spirits, sales rose by 2.7 percent to 1.33 billion euros. Champagne sales to Britain, though, fell about 4-5 percent, hurt by the euro’s rise against the pound after the Brexit vote.\n$1 = 0.8098 euros Reporting by Pascale Denis; writing by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Brian Love and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:30:24.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
