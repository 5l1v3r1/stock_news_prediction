Time is Up!” Kinninmont told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email.\nA big turnout in black would mirror the striking show staged by Hollywood last month, when the red carpet at the Golden Globe awards was awash with black dresses.\nThe British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards take place on Feb. 18 in London, and are the industry’s top night of accolades and self-celebration.\nTIME‘S UP\nThe letter urging solidarity with victims of sex harassment in the workplace was printed by celebrity news website Deadline.\nKinninmont confirmed its contents and the backing of top actresses, including Gemma Arterton, Emma Watson, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Daisy Ridley, Felicity Jones and Emilia Clarke.\nIt is intended as a show of support to the U.S. ‘Time’s Up’ campaign, launched by more than 300 Hollywood figures in January in response to sexual assault and harassment allegations against powerful men in entertainment, politics and beyond.\nThe campaign comes after a slew of allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein last year sparked the #MeToo campaign, with women and men using social media to share their experiences of harassment.\n“Wearing black is a strong, unifying and simple statement,” read the letter, which asked men to wear special pins or a buttonhole.\n“We hope that those of us who are privileged enough to have a platform, can use it to raise awareness of the experiences of women beyond our industry, whose experiences are often silenced and marginalized,” it added.\nGuillermo del Toro’s fantasy “The Shape of Water” is leading the field this month with 12 BAFTA nominations, including for Sally Hawkins who will face competition from Frances McDormand of “Three Billboards” to win in the Leading Actress category.\nOrganizers of the BAFTAs did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.
