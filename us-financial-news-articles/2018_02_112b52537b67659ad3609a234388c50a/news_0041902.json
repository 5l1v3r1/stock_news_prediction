(\"KMS\"), a Seattle-based independent advisory and brokerage (\"IAB\") firm supporting 350 financial advisors, today announced the appointment of Erinn Ford as the firm's President, to take effect in March. Ms. Ford will succeed Tracy \"Ace\" Forsythe, a 20-year KMS veteran who is retiring this summer. KMS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE American: LTS, LTS PrA).\nEric Westberg, Chairman and CEO of KMS, said, \"Erinn Ford has consistently been one of the most visible leaders in the retail financial advice space, especially in the Pacific Northwest region, where she and her family have been involved with our industry for decades. Her outstanding track record for supporting the business growth of independent advisors across the country speaks for itself, and her many professional accomplishments reflect her energy and enthusiasm for helping advisors succeed. We are very fortunate that a confluence of personal and professional plans for Erinn attracted her to KMS, where she will play a central role in supporting the next phase of our growth. She succeeds Ace Forsythe, who has been pivotal to the growth of KMS and an incredible partner. We wish Ace the best in his well-deserved retirement.\"\nAs President of KMS, Ms. Ford will oversee multiple core elements of the firm's forward strategy, including recruiting and retention, enhancements to the firm's client service model and refinements to the firm's open architecture product platform, to provide KMS-affiliated advisors the flexibility, autonomy and expertise to reach their business goals. Ms. Ford, who has over 25 years of industry experience, most recently served as President of Cetera Advisors, part of Cetera Financial Group.\nErinn Ford said, \"Culturally and strategically, this is a perfect fit for me. KMS combines a boutique service culture with the industry-leading resources of Ladenburg, while heavily emphasizing the accessibility of the KMS leadership team to the advisors served by the firm. I am a strong proponent of the network model as a structure that adds substantive value to the businesses of independent financial advisors, and Ladenburg is one of the leading players in our industry with this approach.\"\nMs. Ford added, \"Becoming part of the KMS team not only opens an exciting new chapter in my professional life, it also provides me with a homecoming to the Greater Seattle area, where my family and I have deep personal roots that go back for generations. The opportunity to join KMS comes at a time in my life when it makes sense for family reasons to relocate permanently to Seattle once more. I am deeply grateful to Cetera Financial Group and Cetera Advisors, and proud of all that we accomplished together. I wish my former colleagues and the firm's advisors all the best.\"\nRichard Lampen, Ladenburg's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"We thank Ace Forsythe for his many contributions to the success of KMS, and we congratulate KMS on adding a seasoned executive of Erinn Ford's caliber to its leadership team. We were pleased to support KMS in bringing aboard Erinn, as part of our broader strategy of promoting the success of our subsidiaries by providing them with the resources, contacts and intellectual capital to excel in serving financial advisors. We believe there is considerable opportunity for KMS to reinforce its leadership position throughout the West Coast states, and the hiring of Erinn Ford positions the firm to further realize its full potential.\"\nPrior to serving as President of Cetera Advisors, Erinn Ford was the firm's Senior Vice President, Advisor Relations, with oversight for enhancing the advisor experience. Ms. Ford holds Series 7, 24, 63 and 65 securities registrations, and earned a Bachelor of Arts in speech communications from the University of Washington.\nAbout KMS Financial Services, Inc.\nKMS, an independent advisory and brokerage (\"IAB\") firm founded in 1971, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. and had $16.6 billion in client assets and 350 experienced investment professionals, as of December 31, 2017.
