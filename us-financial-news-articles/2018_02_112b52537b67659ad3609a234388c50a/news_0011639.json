The Dow, after wild swings, rose 567 points Tuesday and was trending higher early Wednesday.\nSome analysts on Wall Street had claimed the stock market's gains in January and last year were in anticipation of Trump's pro-business policies, including tax cuts and deregulation. Others had said U.S. stocks were simply matching a trend seen all around the world.\n\"Did Japan experience a Trump rally? No.\" said Cramer, host of \"Mad Money.\" \"It was just an inflation worldwide of stocks. And now we're resetting.\"\nFor his part, Trump has always taken credit for the rising stock market, tweeting at least 60 times about it since winning the 2016 election. In fact, he tweeted Wednesday, questioning why it took a hit.\nIn the \"old days,\" when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy! \nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
