The organization's goal was to become the premier site to purchase retail items with stolen or counterfeit credit card information, prosecutors said.\nThe group's hierarchy included administrators who managed the operation and membership, forum moderators and vendors who sold illicit products and services to members. Members of the group would then use the forum on the dark web — part of the internet often used for illegal activity — to gather information and facilitate the sale of the stolen data, officials said.\nThe indictment unsealed Wednesday in Nevada marks the first time the Justice Department has arrested anyone in connection with Infraud, which Rybecki called one of the largest international cybercrime rings.\n\"This case reflects the alarming and increasing threat posed by cybercrime,\" Rybicki said. \"The Department of Justice refuses to allow cybercriminals to hide behind the anonymity of the web while stealing personally identifying information, emptying bank accounts, and wreaking havoc on our nation's digital infrastructure and financial system.\"\nThirteen people were taken into custody across the globe, including in California, New York and Alabama. Suspects arrested in France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Kosovo and Serbia were awaiting extradition.\nFollow Michael Balsamo on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/MikeBalsamo1 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:26:44.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
