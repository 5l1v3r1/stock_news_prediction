EXPLOSION CONTAINED \nThe spike in the VIX index has been far in excess of that seen in volatility indexes that track other assets such as currencies, gold and bonds. THE TRIGGER \nreut.rs/2Bkf1qE \nAnalysts say the huge spike in the VIX index was due to a rise in bond yields, on fears that central banks may start raising interest rates sooner as inflation picks up. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury is close to a four-year high of 2.885 percent USTY10=RR, while J.P. Morgan’s Global Bond Index has fallen to its lowest in four years. Both moves have also sparked a debate over whether a bull market in bonds is coming to an end. THE OUTLOOK \nSo is this the end of the global equity bull run? Analysts say economic fundamentals remain strong. Citi’s Economic Surprise Index for the Group of 10 countries remains in strongly positive territory. A positive reading for the index suggests that economic releases have on balance been beating consensus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T19:53:21.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
