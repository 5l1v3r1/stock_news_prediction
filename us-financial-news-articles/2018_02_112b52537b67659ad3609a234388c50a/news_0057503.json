Such measures could also be funded through reallocated infrastructure money.\nEconomists said there is less need for the government to continue to spend -- and a risk that more spending would force the central bank to hike rates faster than it otherwise would.\n“This is really the point where you should be thinking about fiscal tightening,” said senior economist Brian DePratto at TD Economics. “You wouldn’t try to rush more money out the door necessarily at this point.”\nWhile Canada could consider changing the tax rate on capital investment in light of the recent reduction in U.S. corporate taxes, Morneau is unlikely to unveil massive changes at this point, said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada.\n($1 = 1.2665 Canadian dollars)\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:50:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
