Soliris (eculizumab)- Relapsing Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD): Enrollment is complete in the PREVENT study, a single, multinational, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial of Soliris in patients with NMOSD. Alexion expects to report data in mid-2018. ALXN1210- Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH): Enrollment is complete in a Phase 3 trial comparing ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks to Soliris in complement inhibitor treatment-naive patients with PNH and in a Phase 3 PNH Switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. Alexion expects to report data from these studies in the second quarter of 2018. ALXN1210- Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS): Enrollment and dosing are ongoing in a Phase 3 trial with ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks in complement inhibitor treatment-naive adolescent and adult patients with aHUS. Enrollment is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2018 and Alexion expects to report data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2018. Enrollment and dosing are also ongoing in a Phase 3 trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with aHUS. ALXN1210- Subcutaneous: Alexion plans to initiate in late 2018 a single, PK-based Phase 3 study of ALXN1210 delivered subcutaneously once per week to support registration in PNH and aHUS. In December 2017, Alexion entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. that enables the Company to use Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug-delivery technology in the development of subcutaneous formulations for its portfolio of products, including a next-generation subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 to potentially further extend the dosing interval to once every two weeks or once per month.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nTotal revenues $3,850 to $3,950 million Soliris revenues $3,325 to $3,400 million Metabolic revenues $525 to $550 million R&D (% total revenues) GAAP 20% to 22% Non-GAAP 18% to 20% SG&A (% total revenues) GAAP 26% to 28% Non-GAAP 23% to 24% Operating margin GAAP 31% to 34% Non-GAAP 48% to 49% Earnings per share GAAP $4.35 to $4.75 Non-GAAP $6.60 to $6.80 2018 financial guidance assumes the following:\nA foreign currency benefit, net of hedging activities, of $45 million to $55 million Unfavorable Soliris revenue impact of $90 million to $110 million from ALXN1210 and other clinical trial recruitment versus prior year GAAP effective tax rate of 15 to 17 percent; non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16 to 18 percent (both inclusive of Alexion's provisional assessment of the impact of U.S. tax reform)\nAlexion’s financial guidance is based on current foreign exchange rates net of hedging activities and does not include the effect of business combinations, license and collaboration agreements, asset acquisitions, intangible asset impairments, changes in fair value of contingent consideration or restructuring and related activity outside of the previously announced activities that may occur after the day prior to the date of this press release.\nAlexion expects to incur additional restructuring and related expenses of approximately $30 million to $70 million related to the 2017 restructuring activities. As the Company continues to execute its strategic business plan and global footprint, it may incur restructuring expenses in 2018 that are materially different from the current estimate.\nConference Call/Webcast Information:\nAlexion will host a conference call/audio webcast to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
