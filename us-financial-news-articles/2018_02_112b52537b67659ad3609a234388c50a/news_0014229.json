USD 2.63B in 2015 and is projected to reach USD 4.45B by 2026. The primary drivers for this market's accelerated increase are the rise in lifestyle and standard of living and the changes in consumption habits and personal grooming habits, along with a growing awareness about beautification and personal appearance and care, especially in Asia and South America, which is generating a significant increase in the demand for cosmetics and personal care products. Another growth driver is the increased demand for cosmetics and personal grooming products for the male consumer segment. In addition, the demand for natural, green and environmentally friendly cosmetic products is constantly growing. In particular, the projected continued increase in the demand for anti-aging, skin whitening, and sun protection products is expected to drive the market in the future i .\nMr. Ori Yehudai, President and CEO of Frutarom Group , said: \"The IBR acquisition is yet another strategic acquisition of activity in Frutarom’s growing core field which will enable us to offer our customers a broader portfolio of innovative solutions, and an important step in implementing Frutarom’s strategic plan to develop worldwide business in to the growing and profitable fields of natural cosmetics.
