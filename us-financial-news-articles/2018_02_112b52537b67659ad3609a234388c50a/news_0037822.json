At least 2,000 people had been expected to attend her concert in April, she added.\n“Everyone has the right to be themselves. We can be openly gay as someone else can be Christian or Muslim,” Ho said.\nAn article by a Malaysian newspaper on how to identify LGBT people sparked outrage on social media this week.\nLast year Malaysian health authorities launched a contest on how to “prevent” homosexuality and transgenderism, though it later dropped it after pressure from LGBT groups.\nNeighboring Indonesia, the country with the world’s largest Muslim population, is on the cusp of revising its national criminal code to impose restrictions on same-sex relations and consensual sex between men and women outside marriage.\nYet elsewhere in the region, Taiwan ruled last year that same-sex couples can marry, in a huge boost for the gay rights movement in Asia, and Hong Kong will host the 2022 Gay Games, the first Asian city to hold the sports and cultural event.\nReporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Kieran Guilbert; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
