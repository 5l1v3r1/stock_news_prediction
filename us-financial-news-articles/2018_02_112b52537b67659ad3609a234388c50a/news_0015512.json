Many arrive in utter poverty, forced to sleep in doorways and under bridges while they try to scrape together enough money to feed their children. \nSantos said he would put in place stricter migratory controls along the Venezuelan border, temporarily suspending new daily entry cards for Venezuelans and deploying 2,120 more soldiers along the shared frontier. \nSpeaking in Cucuta, a border city of about 670,000 Colombian inhabitants, Santos said he would not tolerate crime committed by Venezuelan migrants and would prosecute any unlawful behaviour. \nHe will create a new registry of Venezuelans already in Colombia and open a centre with the United Nations to provide humanitarian aid. \nColombia estimates it costs $5 (Â£3.6) per day to supply each Venezuelan migrant with food and lodging. The government did not provide figures on how many migrants it was supporting.
