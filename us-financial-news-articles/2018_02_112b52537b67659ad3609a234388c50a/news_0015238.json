Shop owners and locals often know their neighborhood cats by name and will tell tales about them, as if chatting about a friend.\nSome cat-loving Istanbulites buy little feline houses to keep their furry neighbors warm on cold nights, taking advantage of the discount on cat supplies at pet stores during the winter months. Some even bring cats home on the coldest nights.\n“Money is not an issue to some people when it comes to cats,” said Ozan, a pet shop employee.\n“They take in cats with broken legs, blind ones or ones with stomach problems and bring them to the clinic. When they see that they are healed, they let them live on the street again.”\nA cat lies in a shelter made from a water bottle in Istanbul, Turkey, January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic In the hip district of Cihangir, where the streets are lined with such little cat shelters, it is not uncommon for felines to take the last available seats in crowded bars, leaving adoring customers to stand by, petting them, as they awake from yet another nap.\nHairdresser Esra sits outside the salon where she works, tending to two cats in her free time. She said that looking after local animals at a nearby park helped her through tough times.\nSlideshow (13 Images) “I started petting dogs and cats there and buying food and feeding them,” she said. “Then I saw it really helped me.”\nNor is it unusual to see cats hopping into the laps of restaurant patrons, hoping for a comfortable spot to rest - and a chance to nab a scrap of food.\nNecati, who makes his living collecting paper for recycling, steams chicken every morning that he hangs from the side of his cart. As he wends his way through Istanbul, he feeds strays.\nCats are sacred, he said, telling the story of a cat who protected the Prophet Muhammad from a deadly snake while he was praying. “One should love cats, not people,” he said. “People are ungrateful.”\nWriting by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by David Dolan/Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T16:14:28.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
