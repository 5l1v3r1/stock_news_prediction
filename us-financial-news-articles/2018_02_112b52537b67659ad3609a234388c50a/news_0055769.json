So there is this kind of insecurity among residents.”\nIn a fresh surge of violence, government air strikes on the rebel-held eastern Ghouta area near Damascus have killed more than 300 people, including children, since Sunday night.\nThe United Nations Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura called for a truce, and aid agencies have sought humanitarian access to those trapped by the bombardment.\nThe civil war has also left many Syrians across the country vulnerable to food shortages and displacement, the report said.\nAbout half of those surveyed described not having food in the house at least once in the past month, while a fifth said one or more members of their household had gone to bed hungry.\nOn average, internally displaced Syrians reported having moved almost 4 times since the start of the war.\nMore than 6 million people are uprooted within Syria.\nAlistair Burt, Britain’s Middle East minister, said the UK was providing an emergency aid package of up to 15 million pounds ($21 million) to bring clean water to 575,000 people in Idlib, where violence has also intensified in recent weeks.\n“As the brutal conflict enters its eighth year, this important report lays bare the horrific reality of daily life in Syria,” Burt said in a statement.\nReporting by Ana Ionova.
