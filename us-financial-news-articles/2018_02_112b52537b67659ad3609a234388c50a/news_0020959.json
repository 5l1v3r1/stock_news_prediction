Federal prosecutors in Brazil presented corruption and money-laundering charges last December against 11 people related to the Pasadena deal.\nBrazilian audit court TCU said the deal caused losses of more than $580 million to the company.\nThe Brazilian oil company said on Tuesday it would also sell the other companies linked to the refining complex: PRSI Trading LLC and PRSI Real Property Holdings LLC.\nReporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:16:34.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
