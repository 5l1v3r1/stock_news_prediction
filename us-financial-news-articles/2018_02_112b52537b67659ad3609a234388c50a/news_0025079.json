But the 2018 Winter Olympics still managed to present the man nicknamed “The Flying Tomato” with something new: his own $1,000 cheeseburger. \nWhite reportedly ventured out in PyeongChang to sample a burger named after the red-headed snowboarder—it’s called “The Flying Tomato” burger—that costs one million won (South Korea’s currency), which converts to roughly $920 in U.S. dollars. According to Reuters , restaurant owner Cha Gwen Sol created the burger in honor of White with the hope that the two-time Olympic gold medalist would come sample his signature sandwich. The menu even notes that the item is only available for Shaun White himself. “My wish for your gold medal,” the menu reportedly reads. \nThe burger comes with two patties, two types of cheese, and two chicken wings. \nAs it turns out, the restaurant’s plan worked. White visited the establishment, which gave him one “The Flying Tomato” burger for free. The “Is it real? This is Shaun White? It is not a dream? Shaun White tells me it is real. Oh my God, unbelievable,” Cha told Reuters. White’s coach, J.J. Thomas, even documented White enjoying his namesake burger in a video that was posted to Instagram and later deleted.
