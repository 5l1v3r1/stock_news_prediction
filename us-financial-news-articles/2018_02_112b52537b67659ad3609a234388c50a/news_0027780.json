Economists consistently describe a 15-year-old currency-control system as the principal obstacle to functioning commerce and industry.\nWhile the government has vowed to stay current on its debt, it has also deferred payments into grace periods and beyond. It says U.S. sanctions are to blame for the delays.\nBetween its sovereign bonds and the debt of PDVSA, Venezuela is behind on more than $1.6 billion in payments, with a good portion of it falling outside the grace periods, Japanese bank Nomura said in a recent note.\nFigures from last year showed Venezuela’s government debt totaled just over $140 billion. Analysts estimate that PDVSA has around $50 billion.\nLegal experts say PDVSA is vulnerable to litigation because its offshore assets could be targeted by creditors.\n“In a shooting war with creditors, immense pressure could be brought on Venezuela,” Lee Buchheit, one of world’s top sovereign debt restructuring lawyers, has said recently.\nFor a graphic on PDVSA’s problems click: tmsnrt.rs/2vc01II\nReporting by Marc Jones in London and Paul Kirby in New York, editing by Alexander Smith, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T14:59:15.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
