It’s always the manager’s job but I don’t think the events would do that.” \nHenry’s sacking followed defender Arthur Masuaku’s six-match ban for spitting at an opponent during West Ham’s FA Cup defeat at Wigan Athletic last weekend. \n“Maybe that’s just West Ham, I don’t know,” Moyes added. “In management no day is ever dull. The job brings up some difficult situations and some strange ones.” \nDefeat at Brighton left West Ham in 12th on 27 points but just three points above the relegation zone in a congested bottom half of the table. \n“When I took over we were in the bottom three so to be where we are now I’d have said ‘thanks very much’. We are still in a battle to stay up but it’s the same for other teams.” \nWest Ham host Watford in their next league game on Feb. 10.
