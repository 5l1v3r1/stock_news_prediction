From the very start it has been a key clear principle of the EU 27 that there can be no cherry-picking and no single market ‘a la carte’.”\nHe said the remaining EU states would adopt a joint stance on the post-Brexit relationship in a summit at the end of March, whether London provided input or not, and would be “extremely realistic in our assessment of possible new proposals”.\nMany businesses and investors complain that they still lack details on how trade will flow between the world’s biggest trading bloc and its sixth largest economy after Brexit.\n“SENSE OF MOMENTUM”\nFinance minister Philip Hammond, the most pro-European of May’s senior team, said he felt a “real sense of momentum” towards agreeing a transition deal with the EU at the summit.\nBut former prime minister Tony Blair said the government was not being realistic.\n“They’re basically still in ‘have cake and eat it’ mode and it won’t work,” Blair said. If Britain wanted a close trading relationship with the EU, it would have to keep in line with EU rules and standards, he added.\nOpponents of Brexit in Britain are seeking to halt the process and even trigger a rerun of the shock 2016 referendum.\nEloise Todd, the chief executive officer of ‘Best for Britain’, which is about to launch a major campaign, said the odds of stopping Brexit were now close to 50-50.\nRebel Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry is seeking to amend the government’s trade bill to oblige Britain to form a customs union with the EU after Brexit, a move that would complicate May’s attempts to keep her party behind her.\nThat chimes with the main opposition Labour Party, whose spokeswoman for foreign affairs said it would seek to join a new customs union with the EU after Brexit.\n“Technically, because we’re leaving the European Union, we can’t be in the customs union we are in now,” Emily Thornberry said. “We leave and then we have to negotiate a new agreement that, we think, is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union.”\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who says he supports leaving the EU, is due to give a speech on Brexit on Monday. His party has said it will have a strong emphasis on retaining the benefits of the EU’s single market and the customs union.\nWriting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T00:11:52.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
