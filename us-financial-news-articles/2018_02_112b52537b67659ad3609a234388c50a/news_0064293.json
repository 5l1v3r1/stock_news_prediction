The Japanese yen firmed 0.58 percent versus the greenback at 106.71 per dollar.\nWorld stocks were set to snap a record 15-month winning streak, pulled lower by Chinese conglomerate Tencent Holdings because of its large stake in Singapore-based Sea Ltd, an online gaming and e-commerce firm, and Celgene.\nSea posted a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and the departure of its president - the public face of its U.S. listing last year. Sea fell 12.9 percent.\nCelgene said on Tuesday that U.S. health regulators rejected its application seeking approval of a key multiple sclerosis drug due to insufficient data. The surprise development will likely delay the entry to market of one of Celgene’s most important pipeline assets.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.72 percent to close at 1,487.20.\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 26, 2018.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 10/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.8697 percent.\nEuro zone bond yields held near recent lows as inflation in the bloc slowed, potentially complicating the European Central Bank’s plan to remove monetary stimulus and move towards raising rates.\nU.S. oil prices fell more than 2 percent and gasoline futures tumbled after the U.S. government said crude inventories rose more than expected while gasoline stocks posted a big build instead of the draw that was forecast.\nU.S. crude inventories rose by 3 million barrels for the week ending Feb. 23, compared with analyst expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels.
