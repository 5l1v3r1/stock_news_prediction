On Feb. 22, 2018, the NextGen team will officially join their new Brown Advisory colleagues in offices across the United States.\nNextGen was founded by investment industry veterans Dan Mindus and Brett Gibson as a means to bring their Washington, D.C.-based network together to make more informed and successful venture capital investments. Today, the firm has a national network of over 900 entrepreneurs and investors that source, analyze, support and invest in startup companies.\nThe growth of their organization has been driven primarily by the confidence and trust they have nurtured with the entrepreneurs in whom they have invested. \"At the core of our model is a belief that a large, distributed group of founders, leaders and investors—participating part time—can source, evaluate and support investments in a way that adds significant value,\" Mr. Mindus said.\nBrown Advisory, founded in 1993 within Alex. Brown & Sons, began investing in private equity for clients in 1997. Twenty years later, the firm's clients have committed over $1.7 billion to private funds and investments.\nThe combination reflects the value that both Brown Advisory and NextGen place on supporting the next generation of entrepreneurialism. Together, their focus on those building new and innovative businesses should also have a positive impact on the communities across the two firms' footprints and beyond—an element core to each company's mission.\n\"NextGen Venture Partners has built a platform that helps its venture partners and entrepreneurs create value for one another. This mutually beneficial experience is one from which we can learn, and one we hope will be meaningful for a wide range of our clients,\" said Mike Hankin, chief executive officer of Brown Advisory.\nJoining Brown Advisory are:\nDan Mindus, Managing Partner Brett Gibson, Managing Partner Chris Keller, Managing Partner Jon Bassett, Managing Partner Lisa Cuesta, Principal Callum Booker, Associate Corinne Smeriglio, Director of Operations\nThere will not be any immediate change to NextGen's venture partner platform or investment process. The integration of the two firms will start with combined operations and the co-location of colleagues in Washington, D.C.; Boston; New York; and Austin. The future will be built on their shared DNA—each is passionately consumed by its clients and understands how helpful a network of people with high integrity, character and passion can be for its constituents.\n\"The entrepreneurs and venture partners we serve love the concept of co-creation. Joining Brown Advisory gives all of us the opportunity to co-create the future of investing on a more dynamic, diverse and stable foundation,\" Mr. Gibson said.\nAbout Brown Advisory\nBrown Advisory is an independent investment and strategic advisory firm committed to providing its clients with a combination of first‐class investment performance, strategic advice and the highest level of service.
