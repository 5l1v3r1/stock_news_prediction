She met Moon on Friday as part of a weekend trip leading the U.S. delegation to the closing ceremony.\nMilitary vehicles are seen at a grand military parade celebrating the 70th founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army at the Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang, in this photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) February 9, 2018. KCNA/via REUTERS/Files North Korea sent former military intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol, an official accused of being behind a deadly 2010 attack on a South Korean warship, to lead its delegation.\nThe decision enraged the families of 46 sailors killed in the torpedo attack and threatened the mood of rapprochement that Seoul sought to create at what it called the “Peace Games.”\nNorth Korea has denied its involvement in the sinking.\nMoon met Kim in Pyeongchang, where the Olympics were held, before the closing ceremony, the South Korean government said.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Earlier, about 100 conservative South Korean lawmakers and activists staged a sit-in near the border with North Korea, to protest Kim’s arrival and facing off against about 2,500 South Korean police.\nThe North’s delegation took a different route, prompting the opposition Korea Liberty Party to accuse Moon’s administration of “abuse of power and an act of treason” by rerouting the motorcade to shield it from the protest.\nTRUMP WARNING The North sent Kim Yo Jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, to the opening ceremony.\nShe was the centre of a frenzy of attention, especially when she appeared at the opening ceremony and was only a few feet from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. They did not speak.\nKim Yo Jong and the North’s nominal head of state were the most senior North Korean officials to visit the South in more than a decade. The North Korean leader later said he wanted to create a “warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue.”\nThe U.S. president, in announcing the new sanctions on Friday, warned of a “phase two” that could be “very, very unfortunate for the world” if the sanctions did not work.\nNorth Korea denounced the sanctions in a statement carried on its state media and said a blockade by the United States would be considered an act of war.\nChina also reacted angrily, saying on Saturday the unilateral targeting of Chinese firms and people risked harming cooperation on North Korea.\nMoon won election last year promising to try to improve relations with the North.\nReporting by Yuna Park and Christine Kim in Seoul; additional reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb and Roberta Rampton in Washington; Writing by Josh Smith; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T11:58:57.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
