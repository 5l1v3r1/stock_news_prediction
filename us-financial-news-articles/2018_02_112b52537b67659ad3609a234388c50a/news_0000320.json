The Company’s results include $15.8 million or $0.24 per diluted share of largely one time additional income tax expense due to the provisions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and associated withholding taxes for anticipated cash repatriation. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued rules that allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. The Company currently anticipates finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the end of the quarter ending December 31, 2018.\n“Revenues and adjusted EPS this quarter were at the top end of our guidance driven by solid performance from all three segments,” said Dr. Vincent D. Mattera, Jr. President and CEO, II-VI Incorporated. “Each of our segments saw growth in their end markets, and our newer products accounted for more than half the growth this quarter. Our growth markets as well as our core markets of industrial and communications are positioned to benefit as the end markets continue to mature. With regard to the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the tax we have recorded is to account for the various provisions and our plans for cash repatriation in due course. We expect this legislation to be a net positive for II-VI.”\nTable 1 $ Millions, except per share amounts, % and Book to Bill (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Dec 31, Sept 30, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues $ 281.5 $ 261.5 $ 231.8 $ 543.0 $ 453.3 Operating income $ 32.5 $ 29.8 $ 27.1 $ 62.3 $ 50.8 Net earnings $ 9.6 $ 21.1 $ 23.9 $ 30.7 $ 40.2 Adjusted net earnings (1) $ 25.4 $ 21.1 $ 23.9 $ 46.5 $ 40.2 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.15 $ 0.32 $ 0.37 $ 0.47 $ 0.63 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) $ 0.39 $ 0.32 $ 0.37 $ 0.71 $ 0.63 Other Selected Financial Metrics Book to Bill (2) 1.05 0.96 1.18 1.01 1.14 Gross margin 38.9 % 40.5 % 40.7 % 39.7 % 40.1 % Operating margin 11.5 % 11.4 % 11.7 % 11.5 % 11.2 % Return on sales 3.4 % 8.1 % 10.3 % 5.7 % 8.9 % Adjusted return on sales (1) 9.0 % 8.1 % 10.3 % 8.6 % 8.9 % (1) Excludes the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in fiscal year 2018.

The conference call will be broadcast live over the internet and can be accessed by all interested parties from the Company's website at www.ii-vi.com as well as at http://tinyurl.com/ya4drs4h . A replay of the webcast will be available for two weeks following the call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company has disclosed financial measurements in this press release that present financial information considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. These measurements are not a substitute for GAAP measurements, although the Company's management uses these measurements as an aid in monitoring the Company's on-going financial performance. The adjusted non-GAAP net earnings and the adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share measure the earnings of the Company, excluding non-recurring or unusual items that are considered by the management to be outside the Company’s standard operation. EBITDA is an adjusted non-GAAP financial measurement that is considered by management to be useful in measuring the profitability between companies within the industry by reflecting operating results of the Company excluding non-operating factors. There are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures, including that such measures may not be entirely comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, due to potential differences among calculation methodologies. Thus, there can be no assurance that items excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future, or that there could be cash costs associated with items excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by providing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures. Investors should consider adjusted measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout II-VI Incorporated\nII-VI Incorporated, a global leader in engineered materials and optoelectronic components, is a vertically integrated manufacturing company that develops innovative products for diversified applications in the industrial, optical communications, military, life sciences, semiconductor equipment, and consumer markets.
