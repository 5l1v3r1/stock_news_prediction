During his time there he was lead administrator in the UK to MF Global.\nHeather Sonn, acting chairperson of Steinhoff, said Heis should “bring significant benefit to the group” as it develops a plan to address its indebtedness.\nSteinhoff said in December it needed to restructure its debts after finding irregularities in its accounts.\nIn recent weeks several banks have sold their loans in the group to third parties. The latest bank to sell was Natixis. JP Morgan has also sold its exposure at around 73% of face value.\nMoelis is advising the company. FTI, PJT and Houlihan Lokey are advising various investor groups.
