It also spun off Match Group, owner of the popular Tinder dating app, in 2015.\nLevin said the company has no plans to spin off Tinder into a separate company.\nVimeo has 70 million total users, far behind YouTube’s more than 1 billion. But analysts say Vimeo is attractive to professionals and business customers mainly for its ad-free platform and online video editing tools.\nMore than half of the Vimeo’s revenue comes from business customers, Vimeo CEO Anjali Sud said. IAC does not break out revenue for Vimeo.\n“I think the company has identified an addressable market of about $15 billion (for Vimeo),” Cowen and Co analyst John Blackledge said. “It kind of sits in between a Netflix and a YouTube.”\nWith four packages ranging from a free basic service to a $50 per month business package, analysts say the service is cheaper than offerings from Brightcove Inc and Walt Disney Co’s Bamtech.\n“You’re going to see a lot of new tools coming from us that help creators distribute and monetize on multiple destinations directly from within Vimeo,” Sud said.\nReporting by Laharee Chatterjee and Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:43:26.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
