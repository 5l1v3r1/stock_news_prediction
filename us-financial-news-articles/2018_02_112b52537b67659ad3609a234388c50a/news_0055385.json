In his absence, Jahmal McMurray led SMU with a game-high 28 points and Jimmy Whitt added 16, six assists and five rebounds.\nSouthern Methodist (16-13, 6-10) returned to the loss column after last Wednesday’s 77-58 victory at East Carolina snapped the Mustangs’ season-high, five-game losing streak.\nThe win improved Wichita State’s to 48-8 in road games since the start of the 2013-14 season, a total that leads the nation.\nThe Shockers led 37-35 at halftime.\nAfter McMurray’s 3-pointer at the first-half buzzer brought SMU within two, McDuffie’s three-point play to open the second had the Wichita State lead up to five. The Shockers’ lead swelled to 11 after a 17-8 run to open the period.\nWichita State led by as many as 17 after that.\nA 3-pointer from Ben Emelogu with 19:21 to play in the opening half gave the Mustangs their largest lead at 3-1.\nA pair of Whitt free throws had SMU up 19-18 with 9:27 on the clock, but Conner Frankamp’s trey at 8:48 put Wichita State ahead for good.\nSMU faces No. 23 Houston in its final home game next Wednesday. Wichita State plays its final road game Thursday against Central Florida.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:00:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
