The company’s plan to raise about $10 billion was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. \nBlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has long pushed corporate executives to adjust their behavior to focus on generating long-term value for shareholders, rather than simply meeting short-term profit targets. \nThe person said the new effort is being chaired by Mark Wiseman, a top executive who the company hired in 2016 from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Wiseman’s first big move was to spearhead an effort to improve BlackRock’s ability to pick winning stocks in part by using technology to aid the process. \nDay-to-day management of the new effort is being led by André Bourbonnais, the former chief executive officer of Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board, the person said.
