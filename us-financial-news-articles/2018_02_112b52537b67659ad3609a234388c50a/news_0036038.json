Marr. “Fundamentals continue to be impacted by new supply in select submarkets while demand remains steady and broad-based. Looking forward to 2018, we are confident that our operating platform will continue to maximize store performance and our disciplined investment strategy will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for shareholders.”\nKey Highlights for the Fourth Quarter\nReported earnings per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company’s common shareholders of $0.22. Reported funds from operations (“FFO”) per share, as adjusted, of $0.41, representing a year-over-year increase of 7.9%. Increased same-store (432 stores) net operating income (“NOI”) 5.4% year over year, driven by 4.0% revenue growth and a 0.1% increase in property operating expenses. Same-store occupancy averaged 92.3% during the quarter, ending the quarter with same-store occupancy of 91.7%. Closed on two property acquisitions totaling $18.6 million. Closed on two properties that the Company previously had under contract to acquire upon completion of construction and issuance of certificate of occupancy (“C/O”) for $29.1 million.

These stores are located in Texas (1) and Florida (1). For the full year, the Company acquired four stores for $40.4 million, excluding three properties acquired at C/O. Subsequent to year-end, the Company acquired a store in Texas for $12.2 million and is under contract to acquire a store in Washington D.C. for $34.2 million.\nUnconsolidated Joint Venture Activity\nOn November 1, 2017, the Company formed a new joint venture (“HVP IV”) to acquire self-storage assets in which it will have a 20% ownership position. In conjunction with its formation on November 1, 2017, HVP IV acquired one store for an aggregate purchase price of $9.4 million, of which the Company contributed $1.9 million. Subsequent to year-end, HVP IV acquired two properties for $20.5 million and has two properties under contract for $32.0 million which are expected to close by the second quarter of 2018. These stores are located in Arizona (1), Maryland (1), and Texas (3).\nDevelopment Activity\nThe Company has agreements with developers for the construction of Class A self-storage properties in high-barrier-to-entry locations. These agreements are structured as either purchases at C/O or as joint venture developments. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company acquired two properties at C/O, located in Florida (1) and Illinois (1), for $29.1 million and opened for operation a joint venture development property in New York for a total cost of $49.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company acquired three stores at C/O, opened for operation two wholly-owned development properties and two joint venture development properties for a total cost of $208.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had one property located in Florida under contract to purchase at C/O for a total acquisition price of $20.8 million. The purchase of this property is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018. This acquisition is subject to due diligence and other customary closing conditions, and no assurance can be provided that this acquisition will be completed on the terms described, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had six joint venture development properties under development. The Company anticipates investing a total of $230.5 million related to these projects and had invested $74.3 million of that total as of year-end. These stores are located in Massachusetts (1), New Jersey (1), and New York (4). The six projects are expected to open at various times between the third quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2019.\nThird-Party Management\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s third-party management program included 452 stores totaling 29.6 million square feet. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company added 37 stores and 160 stores, respectively, to its third-party management platform.\nSame-Store Results\nThe Company’s same-store portfolio at December 31, 2017 included 432 stores containing approximately 29.6 million rentable square feet, or approximately 87.6% of the aggregate rentable square feet of the Company’s 484 owned stores. These same-store properties represented approximately 91.1% of property NOI for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nSame-store physical occupancy at period end for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 91.7%, compared with 91.8% for the same quarter of last year. Same-store revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 4.0%, and same-store operating expenses increased 0.1% from the same quarter in 2016. Same-store NOI increased 5.4%, as compared with the same period in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, same-store revenues increased 4.4%, same-store operating expenses increased 2.8%, and same-store NOI increased 5.1%, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating Results\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s total owned portfolio included 484 stores containing 33.8 million rentable square feet and had a physical occupancy of 89.2%.\nRevenues increased $10.9 million and property operating expenses increased $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared with the same period in 2016. Increases in revenues were primarily attributable to increased net effective rents in the same-store portfolio and revenues generated from property acquisitions and recently opened development properties. Increases in property operating expenses were primarily attributable to $0.9 million of increased expenses associated with newly acquired stores and $1.5 million of increased costs to manage our portfolio and support our growth.\nInterest expense increased from $13.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to $14.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.6 million. The increase is attributable to a higher amount of outstanding debt and higher interest rates during the 2017 period. To fund a portion of the Company’s growth, the average debt balance during the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $74 million from the same period in 2016 from $1,581 million to $1,655 million. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt increased from 3.75% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 to 3.83% for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancing Activity\nDuring the quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold 1.0 million common shares of beneficial interest through its at-the-market equity program at an average sales price of $29.13 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $29.6 million, after deducting offering costs. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 4.7 million shares available for issuance under the existing equity distribution agreements.\nQuarterly Dividend\nOn December 14, 2017, the Company declared a dividend of $0.30 per common share, an 11.1% increase compared with the Company’s previously declared quarterly dividend of $0.27 per common share. The dividend was paid on January 16, 2018 to common shareholders of record on January 2, 2018.\n2018 Financial Outlook\n“Our same-store growth expectations assume modest increases in net effective rental rates, the impact of new supply on our portfolio, and continued pressure on real estate taxes,” stated Chief Financial Officer Tim Martin. “Our lease-up properties continue to meet or exceed expectations and our FFO guidance reflects the short-term dilution from this value creation growth strategy.”\nThe Company estimates that its fully diluted FFO per share, as adjusted, for 2018 will be between $1.60 and $1.65, and that its fully diluted earnings per share for the period will be between $0.76 and $0.81. Due to uncertainty related to the timing and terms of transactions, the impact of any potential future speculative investment activity is excluded from guidance. For 2018, the same store pool will consist of 458 properties totaling 31.6 million square feet.\nCurrent Ranges for 2018 Full Year Guidance Range Summary Annual Assumptions Same-store revenue growth 2.0% to 3.0% Same-store expense growth 3.5% to 4.5% Same-store NOI growth 1.5% to 3.0% Acquisition of wholly-owned operating properties $50M to $100M Acquisition of properties at C/O $20.8M $20.8M New development openings $151.7M $151.7M Dispositions $0 to $50M Dilution from properties in lease-up ($0.06) to ($0.07) Property management fee income $19.0M to $21.0M General and administrative expenses $36.0M to $37.0M Interest and loan amortization expense $65.5M to $67.5M Weighted average shares and units 185.3M 185.3M Earnings per diluted share allocated to $0.76 to $0.81 common shareholders Plus: real estate depreciation and amortization $0.84 $0.84 FFO per diluted share, as adjusted $ 1.60 to $ 1.65 1st Quarter 2018 Guidance Range or Value Earnings per diluted share allocated to common shareholders $ 0.18 to $ 0.19 Plus: real estate depreciation and amortization 0.20 0.20 FFO per diluted share, as adjusted $ 0.38 to $ 0.39 Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET on Friday, February 16, 2018 to discuss financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nA live webcast of the conference call will be available online from the investor relations page of the Company's corporate website at www.CubeSmart.com .

The Company's self-storage properties are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. According to the 2018 Self-Storage Almanac, CubeSmart is one of the top three owners and operators of self-storage properties in the United States.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from operations (“FFO”) is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. The April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (the “White Paper”), as amended, defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and related impairment charges, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nManagement uses FFO as a key performance indicator in evaluating the operations of the Company's stores. Given the nature of its business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company believes that FFO is useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring its operational performance because FFO excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of its operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures, impairments of depreciable assets, and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. The Company’s computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company’s performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of the Company’s ability to make cash distributions. The Company believes that to further understand its performance, FFO should be compared with its reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFFO, as adjusted represents FFO as defined above, excluding the effects of acquisition related costs, gains or losses from early extinguishment of debt, and other non-recurring items, which the Company believes are not indicative of the Company’s operating results.\nThe Company defines net operating income, which it refers to as “NOI,” as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses. NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net income (loss): interest expense on loans, loan procurement amortization expense, loan procurement amortization expense – early repayment of debt, acquisition related costs, equity in losses of real estate ventures, other expense, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net income (loss): gains from sale of real estate, net, other income, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures and interest income. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement uses NOI as a measure of operating performance at each of its stores, and for all of its stores in the aggregate. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes NOI is useful to investors in evaluating operating performance because it is one of the primary measures used by management and store managers to evaluate the economic productivity of the Company’s stores, including the ability to lease stores, increase pricing and occupancy, and control property operating expenses. Additionally, NOI helps the Company’s investors meaningfully compare the results of its operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense on outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of the basis in its assets from operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation, together with other statements and information publicly disseminated by CubeSmart (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”), contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act.” Forward-looking statements include statements concerning the Company’s plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions and other information that is not historical information.
