The union denies this, saying it has sent letters to management on three occasions since then. \nIn a letter sent on Wednesday seen by Reuters, FORSA/IALPA told Ryanair that pilots at meetings had unanimously agreed to reject Ryanair’s pay offer unless Ryanair confirmed that the acceptance would not prejudice future pay talks. \nThe pilots are also demanding that Ryanair agree that FORSA/IALPA be recognised as the exclusive body for collective bargaining with Ryanair pilots based in Ireland and that the airline’s system of agreements with individual bases be terminated, the letter said. \nUnions from across Europe last week sent a letter to Ryanair demanding a joint meeting with management, a demand the airline has refused.
