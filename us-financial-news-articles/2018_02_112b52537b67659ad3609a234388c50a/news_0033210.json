REUTERS/Jorge Silva “It could have gone either way between Shaun and Ayumu. If you look back at the details it would be interesting to see,” he said. ”Shaun knows these moments and just delivers.”\nHirano admitted there was not much more he could do to score higher than 95.25 and was already looking ahead to competing with White in years to come.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “The run I laid down today was the hardest possible that I could do, so next time I just need to execute them better, that is all,” Hirano said.\n“Shaun just gets more air on his tricks, which is the main difference between us.\n“I will take a little break and then I need to focus on what I need to do in order to improve to get to the gold level.”\nAged 19 and with two Olympic medals under his belt, Hirano has the snowboarding world at his feet.\nHowever, a little part of him must be hoping that the 31-year-old White, his nemesis on the biggest stage of all, does not deliver on his promise to compete again in Beijing in four years time.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:18:36.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
