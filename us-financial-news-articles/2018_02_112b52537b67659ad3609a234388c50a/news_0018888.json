REUTERS/Ginnette Riquelme \nLopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor, has a double-digit lead over his nearest rival in opinion polls on the July 1 election. \nVasconcelos emphasized that Mexico would keep close ties to the United States if Lopez Obrador were to win, saying his government would seek an alliance for economic growth instead of a focus on police and military relations. \nHe said a Lopez Obrador government would seek a meeting with Trump “as soon as possible.” \nThe diplomat pushed back at political rivals who say that Lopez Obrador’s policies would take Mexico down a route similar to crisis-hit Venezuela, but said he did not support U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s socialist government. \n“Our emphasis will be on defending the legitimate interests of Mexico, and not on trying to intervene here and there before we put our own house in order,” Vasconcelos said. \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on a five-nation tour of Latin America and the Caribbean this week, said the United States was moving closer to a decision on imposing sanctions on Venezuelan oil. \nCanada, Mexico, and the United States agreed to form a working group to study how to mitigate any fallout from the potential sanctions.
