The benchmark was flat on Tuesday.\nThe losses among materials and the main index were largely attributable to global miner BHP, which fell as much as 5.3 percent after reporting half-year results on Tuesday.\nPeer Rio Tinto Ltd lost as much as 1.9 percent and was on track to end lower for a third straight session.\nOn the whole, the materials index was trading at the lowest in a week, losing as much as 3.1 percent. London Metal Exchange-traded copper and aluminium edged lower on Tuesday.\nThe Australian benchmark’s top loser was software solutions provider WiseTech Global Ltd, despite an 8 percent rise in its half-year net profit.\nOn the other hand, Australia-listed shares of a2 Milk Company Ltd zoomed 23.4 percent after first half profit hit a record thanks to higher demand in China.\nCMC Markets’ Spooner said positive results like a2 Milk were “helping to balance out the extent of declines we have seen.”\nEnergy stocks rose as oil prices hit their highest in nearly two weeks on Tuesday, as inventories declined.\nResources-related engineering firm WorleyParsons Ltd jumped as much as 4.9 percent, the most since October, after reporting a profit for the first half.\nMeanwhile, consumer staples stocks lifting the benchmark were the predominant theme in New Zealand trade.\nNew Zealand’s S&P/NZX 50 index rose 1.4 percent, or 113.64 points, to 8,211.91.\nShares of a2 Milk Company Ltd jumped in their home country, as well. They were up as much as 24.8 percent to an all-time high.
