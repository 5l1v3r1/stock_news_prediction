He said the bank’s focus on retail lending and other steps would lift performance in the next financial year.\n“Going forward there is a lot of optimism,” Kumar said, adding SBI aimed to limit the rise in bad loans and provisioning costs at 2 percent in 2018/19.\nSiddharth Purohit, a sector analyst at SMC Institutional Equities, described SBI’s results that were reported after trading hours as “disappointing”. He said shares were likely to fall on Monday when trading resumed.\n“Not only for SBI, for most other banks also at least the next two quarters will remain challenging because of the provisions for the bankruptcy cases,” he said.\n($1 = 64.3500 Indian rupees)\nReporting by Devidutta Tripathy in Mumbai and Krishna V Kurup in Bengaluru; Editing by Jane Merriman and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T14:48:15.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
