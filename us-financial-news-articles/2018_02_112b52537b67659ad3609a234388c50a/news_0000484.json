As a result, urine leaks during coughing, sneezing or exercise. Childbirth is a common reason for weak pelvic muscles and obesity worsens the problem. \nUrge incontinence, in contrast, doesn’t have a clear cause, although it can sometimes happen as a result of neurological problems, the authors note. \nSome women may get both types of incontinence at once or develop bladder problems from a urinary tract infection. \nIn the current study, all of the women had urge incontinence and more than half of them reported poor quality sleep, defined as a score above 5 on a sleep-quality questionnaire. The participants were 56 years old on average and the majority were white. \nAt the start of the study, women were having an average 4.6 episodes per day of all types of urinary incontinence, and 3.9 daily episodes of urge urinary incontinence in particular. \nAfter 12 weeks, women on the drug and in the placebo group experienced fewer episodes of incontinence, but for women on the drug the decrease was greater - they had about one less episode per day of urge urinary incontinence than the women receiving a placebo, the study found. \nWith medication, women also reported greater improvements in overall sleep quality, sleep duration and what’s known as sleep efficiency, or how much time people spend in bed asleep instead of awake. \nOne limitation of the study is that it included generally healthy women, and results might be different for people who were elderly, frail or suffering from a variety of chronic medical problems. \nEven so, the findings offer fresh evidence of the potential for medications for urinary incontinence to help improve sleep, said Donald Bliwise, director of the Program in Sleep, Aging and Chronobiology at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. \n“Any drug that decreases bladder activity or decreases the production of nighttime urine might improve sleep quality,” Bliwise, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. \nBeyond making people tired during the day, waking frequently during the night can lead to a variety of health problems, noted Dr. Karel Everaert of Ghent University Hospital in Belgium. When treating overactive bladder improves sleep, other benefits may follow. \n“Sleep is extremely important to our health,” Everaert, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Lacking it kills people through cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and it is bothersome, sometimes also for our partners.” \nSOURCE: bit.ly/2EuJjXe Obstetrics & Gynecology, online January 9, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T00:15:36.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
