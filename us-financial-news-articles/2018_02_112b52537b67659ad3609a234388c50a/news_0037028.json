It also faces restrictions on investments in the coal industry.\nCasino operator MGM Resorts International and Swedish online betting firm Betsson were among the fund’s holdings, E24 added.\n$1 = 7.8595 Norwegian crowns Reporting by Joachim Dagenborg and Terje Solsvik; Editing by David Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:58:29.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
