In remarks to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, newly appointed Powell added that recent data had increased his confidence that U.S. inflation will rise, fueling bets that the Fed could hike interest rates four times this year and sending the dollar higher against most major currencies. In Latin America, all major currencies except the Argentine peso fell against the dollar, and all major equities market sank along with Wall Street. Mexico, which is currently undergoing a sensitive round of North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiations, led losses. Mexico's benchmark IPC equities index was off 0.85 percent in morning trade, after falling more than 1 percent earlier, while the Mexican peso had fallen 0.67 against the dollar. Elsewhere in Latin America, Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index was off 0.68 percent in afternoon trade, while Argentina's small and volatile Merval fell 1.31 percent. \"Pretty much the market is going to be fluttering back and forth in both directions based on things (Powell) says today, so it doesn't surprise me too much,\" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. \"It's his first speech, and the market is already in a higher volatility phase.\" Mexican equities were also depressed as Mexican firms continue to report quarterly results that analysts consider sub par. Among the biggest losers on the IPC was Gentera SAB de CV , which specializes in credit products for low-income consumers, as the company missed fourth-quarter profit estimates due in part to higher-than-expected costs. Its shares fell 5.3 percent, posting their biggest intraday loss since October.
