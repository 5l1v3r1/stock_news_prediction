Its 2016 effective tax rate was around 22 percent. \nMerck has about $17 billion of cash available for repatriation, according to Davis. \nThe company said it plans to invest $12 billion in capital projects over the next five years, two-thirds of which will be in the United States, due in part to the new tax law. \nMerck’s sales rose 3.1 percent to $10.43 billion in the fourth quarter, but were slightly below the average analyst estimate of $10.49 billion. \nSales of Keytruda, which works by blocking a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from the immune system, nearly tripled to $1.30 billion in the fourth quarter. \nThe strong sales numbers for Keytruda were driven by uptake in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler said in a client note. \nLung cancer is by far the most lucrative oncology market, and Merck last month assuaged concerns about Keytruda testing delays by announcing positive early results from a lung cancer trial. \nMerck’s net loss widened to $872 million, or 32 cents per share, from $594 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier. It took a charge of $2.6 billion related to the new U.S. tax law in the quarter. \nExcluding items, Merck earned 98 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 94 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nMerck forecast 2018 adjusted profit in the range of $4.08-$4.23 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $4.11 per share.
