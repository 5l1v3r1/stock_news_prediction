If confirmed, this could severely diminish people’s exposure to the flu in public places. \nScientists are taking things slow, though. After all, broad-spectrum UVC light has all sorts of negative consequences on the human body—including the risk of skin cancer. But far-UVC “has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it’s not a human health hazard,” said study leader David J. Brenner in a media release . \nThe study, which was published in Scientific Reports , notes that because viruses and bacteria are smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach and kill them. \nThere is a price hurdle, though, with far-UVC lights— they currently cost about $1,000 each. Public places like schools, airports, convention centers, and doctors offices might balk at paying such a high price. However, Brenner notes, should production of the lights ramp up, costs will drop. And, as an added incentive, he says, the lights are likely to be notably more effective than the annual flu shot. \n“Unlike flu vaccines, far-UVC is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, even newly emerging strains,” he says.
