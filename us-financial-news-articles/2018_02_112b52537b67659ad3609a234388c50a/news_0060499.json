Bush, in a bid to boost domestic production of energy resources.\nZinke has also proposed opening up more than 90 percent of offshore waters to drilling by removing protections in the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific - an idea that has faced pushback from several U.S. coastal governors and which comes amid generally low oil industry demand for offshore leases.\nAn offshore royalty cut could tempt drillers to bid more aggressively in future lease sales. The proposal is among a number of draft recommendations written by a royalty policy subcommittee at a meeting on Feb. 2.\nThe royalty committee will also review a proposal that would let coal companies set their own value for coal in royalty calculations, something that would affect the royalty they end up paying on their production from federal lands.\nZinke last year repealed an Obama-era requirement that the royalty be based on market prices for coal.\nReporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:47:11.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
