Lamar Stevens added 13 points and seven rebounds, and Shep Garner posted 11 points.\nPenn State (19-12, 9-9) beat the Cornhuskers 76-75 in overtime on Jan. 12. The rematch wasn’t nearly as close.\nNebraska dominated the first half, racing out to a 21-10 lead on a Watson layup at the nine-minute mark. Jordy Tshimanga hit a jumper, and Evan Taylor got free for a layup, sending the Cornhuskers into halftime with a 34-17 lead over the short-handed Nittany Lions.\nThe 17 points were the fewest Penn State scored in the first half this season.\nThe Nittany Lions were without big man Mike Watkins, who sustained a left knee injury in a loss to Michigan on Wednesday. Watkins is averaging 12.1 points and 8.9 rebounds, and Penn State missed his presence on the inside.\nThe Nittany Lions scored the first five points of the second half to chip into the Nebraska lead.
