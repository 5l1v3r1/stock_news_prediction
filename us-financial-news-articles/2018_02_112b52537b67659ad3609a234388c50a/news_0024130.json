Jerian Grant recorded a double-double with 14 points and 11 assists.\nThe game marked the teamsâ€™ first meeting since a draft day trade that shipped Jimmy Butler to Minnesota for LaVine, Kris Dunn and a first-round pick (No. 7 overall) that the Bulls used to select Lauri Markkanen. Chicago sent back its first-round pick (No. 16 overall), which Minnesota used to select center Justin Patton.\nLaVine and Butler traded big baskets down the stretch to set up a dramatic finish.

Karl-Anthony Towns posted his 49th double-double in 58 games with 14 points and 10 rebounds.\nMinnesota lost its second game in a row.\nChicago trailed by five points with 1:20 to go but pulled within 111-108 on a dunk by LaVine with 1:11 remaining. Twenty seconds later, LaVine evened the score at 111 with a 3-pointer from the right wing.\nButler split a pair of defenders for a layup to put Minnesota on top 113-111 with 21.5 seconds left. On the opposite end of the court, referees ruled that Butler fouled LaVine on a 3-point attempt. LaVine sank all three free throws to put Chicago on top 114-113.\nThe Bulls erased a 17-point deficit early in the second half to grab an 89-86 lead entering the fourth quarter. Denzel Valentine capped the 33-13 run to close the third quarter with a basket at the buzzer.\nMinnesota established a 67-56 lead at halftime.
