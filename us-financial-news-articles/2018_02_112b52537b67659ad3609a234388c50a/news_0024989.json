Prices topped $70 this year for the first time since late 2014, supported by the OPEC-led cut and robust demand.\nBalancing the higher demand forecast, OPEC said the United States and other outside producers would boost supply by 1.4 million bpd this year, up 250,000 bpd from last month and the third consecutive rise from 870,000 bpd in November.\n“The steady oil price recovery since summer 2017 and renewed interest in growth opportunities have led to oil majors catching up in terms of exploration activity this year, both in the shale industry and offshore deep water,” OPEC said, referring to the U.S. outlook.\n“The market is only expected to return to balance towards the end of this year.”\nINVENTORIES, OPEC OUTPUT FALLING OPEC’s assessment of when the market would rebalance is no earlier than its previous projection, despite the outlook for higher demand, falling inventories and strong compliance with the supply-cutting deal.\nOPEC’s stated goal, through a deal starting a year ago to cut output with Russia and other outside producers, is to reduce oil inventories in developed economies to the five-year average. They have extended the pact until the end of 2018.\nIn a further sign of progress, OPEC said inventories in those economies declined by 22.9 million barrels in December to 2.888 billion barrels, 109 million above the five-year average.\nOPEC compliance remains strong. In January, OPEC output fell by 8,000 bpd to 32.302 million bpd, the report said. Adherence by the members with output targets rose to 137 percent, according to a Reuters calculation, up from December.\nThe report gave contrasting figures on production in Venezuela, where output has been dropping due to an economic crisis.\nVenezuela told OPEC its production recovered in January to 1.769 million bpd from December’s multi-decade low, while figures from secondary sources that OPEC uses to monitor its output showed a decline to 1.60 million bpd, a new low.\nOPEC uses an average of figures from six secondary sources to monitor its output rather than countries’ own due to old disputes about real production rates.\nWith outside producers expected to increase supply this year by more than the upward revision to demand, OPEC in the report cut its estimate of the global requirement for its crude in 2018 by 230,000 bpd to 32.86 million bpd.\nShould OPEC keep pumping at January’s level and other things remain equal, the market could move into a deficit of about 560,000 bpd, suggesting inventories will be drawn down further.\nLast month’s report pointed to a larger deficit of about 670,000 bpd.\nEditing by Dale Hudson and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T19:26:17.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
