(NYSE: DYN):\nSummary of Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial Results (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating Revenues $ 994 $ 1,107 $ 4,842 $ 4,318 Net Income (loss) $ (95 ) $ (182 ) $ 72 $ (1,244 ) Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 293 $ 219 $ 1,160 $ 1,007 Operating Cash Flow $ 585 $ 645 Adjusted Free Cash Flow (1) $ 374 $ 263 2017 Highlights:\nAnnounced strategic combination with Vistra Energy on October 30 Completed acquisition of ENGIE's U.S. portfolio on February 7; acquisition included more than 9,000 megawatts of predominately gas-fueled generating capacity in the ERCOT, ISO-NE, and PJM markets Completed sales of five power generation facilities for approximately $780 million in cash, which, together with cash on hand, was used to repay $900 million in debt Simplified Ohio joint operating unit structure by securing 100% ownership of Miami Fort and Zimmer facilities and divesting ownership share of Conesville facility Reduced 2019 debt maturity from $2.1 billion to $850 million through a combination of repayments and refinancing Completed Genco restructuring on February 2, eliminating $825 million of unsecured bonds in exchange for approximately $122 million in cash, $188 million of seven-year unsecured notes, and 9 million Dynegy common stock warrants Achieved $89 million and $141 million, respectively, in EBITDA and balance sheet improvements through employee-driven PRIDE program; separately, launched Earnings and Cost Improvement (ECI) initiative with a target of more than $100 million in sustainable earnings improvements Achieved top decile safety performance across the entire Company for the full year, Dynegy's top performance since 2010\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures, see \"Regulation G Reconciliations\" for further details.\nDynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) reported net income for 2017 of $72 million, compared to a net loss of $1.24 billion for 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by (i) a $228 million lower operating loss primarily attributable to lower impairments, (ii) a $590 million increase related to the extinguishment of debt associated with the Genco bankruptcy, and (iii) a $565 million increase in tax benefits, partially offset by a $79 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt.\nThe Company reported 2017 consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $1.16 billion, compared to $1.01 billion for 2016. The $153 million increase was attributable to contributions from the newly acquired ENGIE plants, higher capacity revenues across most of Dynegy's business segments, and lower O&M costs as a result of unit shutdowns and fewer planned outages. Partially offsetting this were lower energy margins, net of hedges, as a result of decreased spark spreads at the PJM and NY/NE segments, decreased dark spreads at the MISO segment, and lower retail contribution at the PJM and MISO segments, all driven by milder weather. Full-year results versus guidance reflect an approximately $70 million unfavorable impact from asset sales and M&A timing during the year.\nThe Company reported a fourth quarter 2017 net loss of $95 million, compared to a net loss of $182 million for 2016. The quarter-over-quarter change was primarily driven by an increase in our income tax benefit due to the partial release of our valuation allowance as a result of the ENGIE acquisition and recognition of the benefit of AMT credits that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance. This change was partially offset by a loss attributable to the newly acquired ENGIE plants.\nThe Company reported fourth quarter 2017 consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $293 million, compared to $219 million for the fourth quarter 2016 as the newly acquired ENGIE plants and higher capacity revenues in the NY/NE and PJM segments benefited results. Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter was negatively impacted by weaker than expected commodity prices in November and the first half of December, as well as higher accruals related to cash-settled incentive compensation tied to Dynegy's common stock price, which increased over 20% during the quarter, and approximately 40% versus the prior year.\n\"Dynegy has a long list of accomplishments during 2017, including our best safety performance since 2010. Over the course of the year, we made substantial and dramatic changes to our portfolio in addition to announcing our combination with Vistra. In addition to our portfolio activities, we simultaneously strengthened our balance sheet over the course of the year by utilizing asset sale proceeds, refinancing debt, and restructuring our Genco subsidiary. Despite the loss of financial contributions from the plants that were sold, we finished the year with Adjusted Free Cash Flow comfortably within the guidance range which was raised in May 2017 due to our disciplined focus on controlling costs and agility to adapt to the changing portfolio and market place,\" said Dynegy President and Chief Executive Officer Robert C. Flexon.\n\"In terms of our 2017 operational results, our fleet responded to the challenging market conditions by operating safely and reliably serving our customers and communities,\" Flexon continued. \"Further, we advanced our position of being the most efficient and lowest-cost platform in the industry. Our PRIDE initiative is on track to exceed our three-year EBITDA target of $250 million in 2018, with additional contributions expected to follow through the Company’s Earnings and Cost Improvement initiative, which was launched in October 2017.\"\nFull-Year Comparative Results\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in millions) Operating\nIncome (Loss)\nAdjusted EBITDA Operating\nIncome (Loss)\nAdjusted EBITDA PJM $ 192 $ 818 $ 414 $ 757 NY/NE (113 ) 293 (29 ) 171 ERCOT (147 ) 26 — — MISO (44 ) 152 (832 ) 129 CAISO (45 ) 19 (5 ) 59 Other (255 ) (148 ) (188 ) (109 ) Total $ (412 ) $ 1,160 $ (640 ) $ 1,007 Segment Review of Results Year-over-Year\nPJM - Operating income in 2017 totaled $192 million compared to operating income of $414 million in 2016. Factors that led to the decrease in operating income included a change in the mark-to-market value of derivative transactions, lower spark spreads as a result of higher gas costs and milder weather, the loss on the sale of assets, and a lower retail contribution as a result of higher supply costs and milder weather. Partially offsetting this were higher capacity revenues and income attributable to the newly acquired ENGIE plants.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $818 million during 2017 compared to $757 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the contribution from the newly acquired ENGIE plants, higher capacity revenues, and lower O&M costs, partially offset by lower generation volumes due to milder weather.\nNY/NE - The 2017 operating loss was $113 million compared to an operating loss of $29 million for 2016. Factors that led to the higher operating loss included a change in the mark-to-market value of derivative transactions and a loss on the sale of the Dighton and Milford facilities in Massachusetts, partially offset by higher capacity revenues, lower depreciation costs, and income from the newly acquired ENGIE plants.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $293 million in 2017 compared to $171 million in 2016 primarily due to the contribution from the newly acquired ENGIE plants.\nERCOT - Dynegy's ERCOT segment was initiated in February 2017 with the acquisition of ENGIE plants in Texas. The 2017 operating loss of $147 million was primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on derivative transactions and depreciation expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $26 million, with energy margin, net of hedges, partially offset by O&M costs.\nMISO - The 2017 operating loss was $44 million compared to an operating loss of $832 million in 2016. The previous year results were primarily driven by approximately $790 million in impairment charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $152 million in 2017 compared to $129 million in 2016 due to higher capacity revenues that resulted from favorable pricing and volumes.\nCAISO - The 2017 operating loss was $45 million compared to an operating loss of $5 million for 2016. The higher operating loss resulted from lower capacity revenues due to lower contracted volumes and prices and lower tolling revenue due to the expiration of a tolling contract, partially offset by higher energy margin, net of hedges, as a result of warmer weather.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $19 million in 2017 compared to $59 million in 2016 as lower volumes and prices for capacity and the expiration of tolling agreements impacted results.\nFourth Quarter Comparative Results\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in millions) Operating\nIncome (Loss)\nAdjusted EBITDA Operating\nIncome (Loss)\nAdjusted EBITDA PJM $ 14\n$ 216 $ 137 $ 181 NY/NE (41 ) 99 (7 ) 29 ERCOT (139 ) (12 ) — — MISO 6 28 (42 ) 28 CAISO (12 ) 5 (5 ) 14 Other (67 ) (43 ) (49 ) (33 ) Total $ (239 ) $ 293 $ 34 $ 219 Segment Review of Results Quarter-over-Quarter\nPJM - Operating income for the fourth quarter 2017 totaled $14 million compared to $137 million for the fourth quarter 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a change in the mark-to-market value of derivative transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $216 million in 2017 versus $181 million in 2016 as the contribution from the newly acquired ENGIE plants and higher capacity revenues were partially offset by a lower retail contribution due to higher supply costs and milder weather.\nNY/NE - The fourth quarter 2017 operating loss was $41 million compared to an operating loss of $7 million for the fourth quarter 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a change in the mark-to-market value of derivative transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $99 million in 2017 compared to $29 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the contribution from the newly acquired ENGIE plants, higher capacity revenues, and lower O&M expenses.\nERCOT - The fourth quarter 2017 operating loss of $139 million was primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on derivative transactions and depreciation expenses, which more than offset positive energy margin.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $(12) million as a result of O&M expenses associated with plant outages, which more than offset positive energy margin.\nMISO - Operating income for the fourth quarter 2017 totaled $6 million compared to an operating loss of $42 million for the fourth quarter 2016 as lower O&M and depreciation expenses benefited results.\nAdjusted EBITDA remained unchanged at $28 million in 2017 and in 2016.\nCAISO - The fourth quarter 2017 operating loss was $12 million compared to a $5 million operating loss for the fourth quarter 2016 as lower capacity and tolling revenue impacted results.\nAdjusted EBITDA in 2017 was $5 million versus $14 million in 2016 primarily due to lower capacity and tolling revenue in the most recent period.\nLiquidity\nDynegy’s total available liquidity is reflected in the table below.\nDecember 31, 2017 (amounts in millions) Dynegy Inc. Revolving facilities and LC capacity (1) $ 1,650 Less: Outstanding revolver draws — Outstanding LCs (438 ) Revolving facilities and LC availability 1,212 Cash and cash equivalents 365 Total available liquidity $ 1,577\n(1) Includes $1.545 billion in senior secured revolving credit facilities and $105 million related to letter of credit facilities (“LCs”).\nConsolidated Cash Flow\nCash provided by operations totaled $585 million for the full year of 2017. During the period, our power generation facilities and retail operations provided cash of $1.25 billion. Corporate activities, primarily related to , interest, and acquisition-related expenses, as well as other working capital changes, used cash of $669 million during the period.\nCash used in investing activities totaled $2.76 billion for the full year of 2017 as Dynegy used $3.25 billion at the ENGIE acquisition closing, $70 million, including $20 million in working capital, for the purchase of interest in Miami Fort and Zimmer from AES, and invested $224 million in capital expenditures, offset by $773 million in proceeds received from asset sales, in addition to $12 million in distributions received from our unconsolidated investments in the Bellingham NEA and Sayreville facilities.\nCash used in financing activities totaled $1.3 billion for the full year of 2017 primarily as a result of the remaining payment obligations relating to the purchase of Energy Capital Partners' (ECP) interest in Atlas Power, payments related to our Illinois Power Generating Company subsidiary's (Genco) emergence from bankruptcy, and the repayment of the outstanding revolving credit facility, as well as various other financing activities.\nCapital Structure\nDuring 2017 numerous steps were taken to streamline and strengthen Dynegy’s capital structure including:\nUsed asset sale proceeds, cash on hand, and proceeds from an $850 million bond offering to repay/refinance $1.75 billion in debt; Restructuring the Genco subsidiary, eliminated $825 million of Genco senior notes in exchange for approximately $122 million in cash, $188 million of seven-year unsecured notes, and 9 million Dynegy common stock warrants; and Added more flexibility and improved the terms of our Credit Agreement by executing amendments to increase its capacity, extend its maturity date, and reduce the interest rate margin by 125 basis points.\nCommodity Pricing and Impact of Hedges\nThroughout the fourth quarter of 2017, Dynegy continued to actively hedge its fleet for 2018 and 2019, taking advantage of a rise in forward commodity prices experienced in late 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, forward pricing for 2018 and 2019 improved in many of Dynegy’s key markets as both spark and dark spreads expanded. This improved outlook has resulted in an increase in forecasted run times as plants are now more deeply in the money. Gross margin is expected to increase as Dynegy's generation facilities are now projected to run more hours at higher prices.\nAs of February 8, 2018, Dynegy’s 2018 generation volumes hedged in the key markets of PJM, NY/NE, ERCOT, and MISO stood at 78%, 64%, 74%, and 75%, respectively. In 2019, hedging in the same markets is at 40%, 19%, 26%, and 39%, respectively.\nAs we move forward, we will continue to look for opportunities to hedge future generation at advantageous levels.\nRecent Developments\nVistra Merger\nOn October 29, 2017, Dynegy and Vistra Energy Corp. entered into a Merger Agreement that has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Dynegy will merge with and into Vistra Energy in a tax-free, all-stock transaction.\nWe expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2018 after meeting the remaining customary conditions including stockholder approval and receiving the required regulatory approvals, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, and the New York Public Service Commission.\nTax Reform Act\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), enacted on December 22, 2017, reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This resulted in a reduction to our net deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction to our valuation allowance. The TCJA also repealed the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which resulted in a $223 million tax benefit for Dynegy. As prescribed by the TCJA, and unless used to offset a cash tax liability, Dynegy will receive the cash refunds of our existing AMT credits beginning in 2019, for the 2018 tax year, through 2022. Estimated cash refunds by year: 2019 - $112 million; 2020 - $56 million; 2021 - $28 million; 2022 - $27 million.\nENGIE Acquisition\nOn February 7, 2017, Dynegy completed its acquisition of ENGIE’s US portfolio, which included more than 9,000 megawatts of generation facilities for a base purchase price of approximately $3.3 billion. The plants acquired included 15 natural gas-fueled facilities in Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia, as well as one coal-fueled facility in Texas and a waste-coal-fueled facility in Pennsylvania.\nPortfolio Changes\nDuring 2017, Dynegy sold its Armstrong (Pennsylvania), Dighton (Massachusetts), Lee (Illinois), Milford (Massachusetts), and Troy (Ohio) facilities. In addition, Dynegy sold its 40 percent ownership interest in the Conesville facility in Ohio and, through separate transactions with AEP and AES, raised its ownership in the Miami Fort and Zimmer facilities in Ohio to 100%.\nPRIDE Update and Earnings and Cost Improvement Project\nDynegy’s PRIDE (Producing Results through Innovation by Dynegy Employees) program was launched in 2011 with a focus on optimizing our cost structure, implementing company-wide process and operating improvements, and improving balance sheet efficiency. In 2017 the program exceeded its balance sheet target of $100 million by $41 million and its EBITDA target of $65 million by $24 million.\nDynegy introduced its Earnings and Cost Improvement (ECI) project in the fourth quarter 2017 to identify and implement practices that promote leading practices across key areas of our power generation fleet. The initiative is driven by employees with assistance from a third-party consultant. ECI's target is more than $100 million in sustainable earnings improvements.\nRetail Business Expansion\nThe retail business continued its effort to expand into new markets during 2017 by serving new municipal aggregation customers in Massachusetts and through commercial and industrial sales in the Pennsylvania market for 2018 delivery. Retail now serves customers in Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Retail delivered volumes in 2017 were 26,000 gigawatt-hours to its approximately 1.2 million residential and business customers.\nSafety\nDynegy's safety performance for the full-year 2017 was in the top decile for the industry. Both coal and gas facilities are focused on intensive safety initiatives that help drive safety culture. A total of seven Dynegy plants have achieved STAR Program status through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). Dynegy is committed to having all of its plants go through the VPP auditing process in the next several years.\nAbout Dynegy\nThroughout the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Texas and California, Dynegy operates nearly 28,000 megawatts (MW) of power generating facilities capable of producing enough energy to supply more than 23 million American homes. Through our retail business, we serve 1.2 million customers who depend on reliable, affordable energy to grow and thrive.\nForward-Looking Statement\nThis news release contains statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as “forward-looking statements,” particularly those statements concerning Dynegy’s beliefs and expectations regarding its platform position in the industry; execution of Dynegy’s PRIDE Energized targets and its Earnings and Cost Improvement initiative in 2018; anticipated earnings and cash flows; Dynegy’s proposed merger into Vistra Energy, including stockholder and regulatory approvals and timing of closing; and achievement of OSHAs VPP auditing process of all Dynegy plants within the next several years.
