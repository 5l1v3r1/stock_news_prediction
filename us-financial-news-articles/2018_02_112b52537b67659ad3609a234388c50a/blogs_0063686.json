REUTERS/Francois Lenoir G20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in Buenos Aires in March, with crypto-currencies set to be on the agenda. The EU will decide how to address the issue later this year or early in 2019, the financial services commissioner said.\nGermany and France said this month that, while new opportunities arose from crypto-currencies, they could also pose substantial risks for investors and be vulnerable to financial crime without safeguards.\nBut given they represent just a tiny part of the financial system, so far there appears to be no strong consensus among G20 countries to regulate them closely.\nPolicymakers worry about losing jobs and growth to other regions if they crack down hard on innovation in the sector, especially stemming from the blockchain technology that underpins crypto-currencies, which Dombrovskis said holds strong promise.\nMarkus Ferber, a center-right member of the European Parliament, said a quick EU regulatory response was needed, rather than waiting years for international rules to trickle through.\n“In order to make sure that retail investors do not fall prey to market manipulation and fraud, virtual currencies should be regulated as other financial instruments,” Ferber said in a statement.\nReporting by Huw Jones; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T16:22:28.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
