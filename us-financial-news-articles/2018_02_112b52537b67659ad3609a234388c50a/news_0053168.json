REUTERS/Jonathan Drake/Files Democrats have rushed to support the teenagers, hoping the movement can help them in the midterm elections by boosting historically-low turnout among young Democratic voters.\n“We need to embrace this movement,” said Democratic strategist Rodell Mollineau. “It very well may be that the solution to gun violence in this country is a generational solution instead of a partisan one. This might be the generation that finally breaks through on this issue.”\nRepublicans, on the other hand, warned that it was unclear whether the students would gain momentum beyond Florida, where they pushed Republican Governor Rick Scott to propose tighter gun laws on Friday.\n“I would be cautious to recognize any national trend based on one week in which passions have been high,” said Republican strategist Rory Cooper.\nSlideshow (5 Images) The NRA did not respond to a request for comment. In recent days, NRA officials have lashed out at gun control advocates, arguing that Democratic elites are politicizing the Parkland rampage to erode gun rights.\nTo gun rights groups, Hogg and his friends are being used by gun-control organizations to seek the same gun ban proposals that failed after mass shootings including the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.\nDave Workman, senior editor of The Gunmag.com, said he suspected the high schoolers had support from gun-control groups based on their increasingly polished arguments.\n“That may be more of a problem with credibility than an asset,” said Workman, whose magazine is the publication of gun rights group The Second Amendment Foundation.\nRelated Coverage Florida governor proposes new gun sale limits after school shooting The students themselves say they do not need anyone’s approval and refuse to align with any political party, pointing out that both Republicans and Democrats take NRA money.\n“Honestly both sides are pretty corrupt and I‘m not willing to take a side unless I know the person,” said Hogg. “These politicians need to be afraid.”\nEverytown for Gun Safety, the largest U.S. gun control advocacy group, formed a youth branch this week after receiving thousands of enquiries from students around the country and is opening chapters in four states.\nBrandon Wolf, a survivor of the 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, praised the Parkland students for bringing an end to years of inaction.\n“These teenagers have done the impossible,” said Wolf, a member of the Florida Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence. “And all it took was a group of angry children with the right message to slap some sense into somebody.”\nReporting By Andrew Hay; Additional reporting by Barbara Goldberg, Dan Trotta and Zach Fagenson; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T14:56:56.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
