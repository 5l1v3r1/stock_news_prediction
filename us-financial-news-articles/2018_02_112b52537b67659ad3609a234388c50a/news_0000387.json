It has asked auditors PwC to get to the bottom of the problems. \nSeparately, the company, which moved its primary share listing from Johannesburg to Frankfurt two years ago, has been under investigation for suspected accounting fraud in Germany since 2015. \nIt has previously said that investigation relates to whether revenues were booked properly and whether taxable profits were correctly declared.
