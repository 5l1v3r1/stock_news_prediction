Also on Twitter, Romney thanked Trump for the endorsement. . @MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah. He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch , and has my full support and endorsement! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2018 Thank you Mr. President for the support. I hope that over the course of the campaign I also earn the support and endorsement of the people of Utah. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) February 20, 2018 \nRomney, who was the Republic Party’s presidential candidate against incumbent Barack Obama in 2012, announced his candidacy for the Senate seat on Friday. \nTrump had been a reluctant patron of Romney, who during the 2016 campaign season called Trump a “phony” and a “fraud” while urging fellow Republicans to force a contested convention to choose a different candidate. Romney also criticized Trump’s response to events in Charlottesville, Va., last year, when the president said that both white supremacist protesters and counter-demonstrators were to blame for clashes that killed one young woman. Romney said that the president had “caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of American to mourn.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T08:49:56.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
