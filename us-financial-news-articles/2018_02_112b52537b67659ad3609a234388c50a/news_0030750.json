He blames the pact for U.S. manufacturing job losses, and his remarks about quitting have unsettled financial markets.\nAt the last round in Montreal, Canada made a number of proposals to address the U.S. insistence that the North American content of autos be raised. Washington also wants a clause that would allow any NAFTA member to pull out after five years.\nThe upcoming talks in Mexico City are scheduled to start and end one day earlier than initially planned, the economy ministry said.\nThe early March deadline for wrapping up the talks has been extended to at least early April, officials have said. But participants have said privately it could take months longer than that.\nReporting by Christine Murray, Veronica Gomez and Anthony Esposito in Mexico City, and Lesley Wroughton and Lindsay Dunsmuir in Washington; editing by Andrew Hay, Jonathan Oatis and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:42:04.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
