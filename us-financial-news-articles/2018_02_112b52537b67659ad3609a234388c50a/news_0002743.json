Fourth quarter revenue was down approximately one percent as compared to revenue in the third quarter of 2017.\n“We once again delivered solid results, driven by strong demand for our products and by outstanding operating performance. With a broad portfolio of products for the industrial and automotive end-markets, ON Semiconductor is well positioned to benefit from the fastest growing end-markets in the semiconductor industry,” said Keith Jackson, ON Semiconductor president and CEO. “We believe that we are in the early stages of realizing benefits of our investments in automotive and industrial end-markets. Increased adoption of ADAS, electric vehicles, machine vision and robotics should drive further acceleration in our revenue and margins. Customers are increasingly relying on us as a key provider of enabling technologies for newly emerging and disruptive applications in automotive and industrial end-markets.\n“Demand for our products remains strong and our design win pipeline continues to expand. Our customers are upbeat about the near to mid-term demand outlook for their businesses. Amid a strong demand environment, industry wide supply-side dynamics remain healthy.”\nFourth Quarter Results (GAAP)\n(in millions, except per share\ndata)\n4Q 2017 4Q 2016 Year-Over-\nYear Change\n3Q 2017 Sequential\nChange\nRevenues $ 1,377.5 $ 1,261.0 9 % $ 1,390.9 (1 )% Gross Profit $ 514.2 $ 384.5 34 % $ 524.2 (2 )% Operating Income $ 166.0 $ 55.7 198 % $ 177.3 (6 )% Net Income Attributable to ON Semiconductor Corporation\n$ 529.9 $ 110.9 378 % $ 108.7 387 % Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 1.22 $ 0.26 369 % $ 0.25 388 % Diluted Share Count 433.3 426.9 1 % 427.5 1 % Fourth Quarter Results (Non-GAAP)\n(in millions, except per share\ndata)\n4Q 2017 4Q 2016 Year-Over-\nYear Change\n3Q 2017 Sequential\nChange\nRevenues $ 1,377.5 $ 1,261.0 9 % $ 1,390.9 (1 )% Gross Profit $ 516.8 $ 443.3 17 % $ 526.7 (2 )% Operating Income $ 211.5 $ 162.2 30 % $ 231.0 (8 )% Net Income Attributable to ON Semiconductor Corporation\n$ 167.3 $ 123.0 36 % $ 189.4 (12 )% Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.39 $ 0.29 34 % $ 0.44 (11 )% Diluted Share Count 429.9 426.9 1 % 427.5 1 % Fourth Quarter Key Cash Flow Items\n(in millions) 4Q 2017 4Q 2016 Year-Over-\nYear Change\n3Q 2017 Sequential\nChange\nCash Taxes $ 18.9 $ 8.2 130 % $ 13.4 41 % Operating Cash Flow $ 224.3 $ 229.4 (2 )% $ 328.2 (32 )% Free Cash Flow $ 48.6 $ 179.5 (73 )% $ 238.1 (80 )% FIRST QUARTER 2018 OUTLOOK\nBased on product booking trends, backlog levels and estimated turns levels, the Company anticipates that total revenue in the first quarter of 2018 will be approximately $1,340 to $1,390 million. The outlook for the first quarter of 2018 includes anticipated stock-based compensation expense of approximately $18 million to $20 million. Net cash paid for income taxes is expected to be $18 million to $22 million.\nThe following table outlines ON Semiconductor's projected first quarter of 2018 GAAP and non-GAAP outlook.\nTotal ON Semiconductor\nGAAP\nSpecial\nItems ***\nTotal ON Semiconductor\nNon-GAAP****\nRevenue $1,340 to $1,390 million $1,340 to $1,390 million Gross Margin 36.4% to 38.4% 36.4% to 38.4% Operating Expenses $318 to $336 million $28 to $32 million $290 to $304 million Other Income and Expense (including interest expense), net $33 to $36 million $8 to $9 million* $25 to $27 million Diluted Share Count ** 445-447 million 432 million * Convertible Notes, Non-cash Interest Expense is calculated pursuant to FASB's Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 470: Debt.\n** Diluted share count can vary as a result of, among other things, the actual exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the incremental dilutive shares from the Company's convertible senior subordinated notes, and the repurchase or the issuance of stock or convertible notes or the sale of treasury shares. In periods in which the quarterly average stock price per share exceeds $18.50, the non-GAAP diluted share count and non-GAAP net income per share includes the impact of the Company’s hedge transactions issued concurrently with our 1.00% convertible notes. As such, at an average stock price per share between $18.50 and $25.96, the hedging activity offsets the potentially dilutive effect of the 1.00% convertible notes. In periods when the quarterly average stock price per share exceeds $20.72, the non-GAAP diluted share count and non-GAAP net income per share includes the anti-dilutive impact of the Company’s hedge transactions issued concurrently with the 1.625% convertible notes. As such, at an average stock price per share between $20.72 and $30.70, the hedging activity offsets the potentially dilutive effect of the 1.625% convertible notes. Both GAAP and non-GAAP diluted share counts are based on the Company’s current stock price.\n*** Special items may include: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; expensing of appraised inventory fair market value step-up; purchased in-process research and development expenses; restructuring, asset impairments and other, net; goodwill impairment charges; gains and losses on debt prepayment; non-cash interest expense; actuarial (gains) losses on pension plans and other pension benefits; and certain other special items, as necessary. These special items are out of our control and could change significantly from period to period. As a result, we are not able to reasonably estimate and separately present the individual impact of these special items, and we are similarly unable to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation that is unavailable would include a forward looking income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows in accordance with GAAP. For this reason, we use a projected range of the aggregate amount of special items in order to calculate our projected non-GAAP operating expense outlook.\n**** We believe these non-GAAP measures provide important supplemental information to investors. We use these measures, together with GAAP measures, for internal managerial purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. However, we do not, and you should not, rely on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when taken together with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures that we also provide in our releases, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures, even if they have similar names.\nTELECONFERENCE\nON Semiconductor will host a conference call for the financial community at 9 a.m. Eastern Time (EST) on Feb. 5, 2018, to discuss this announcement and ON Semiconductor’s results for the fourth quarter of 2017 and year then ended.

Management does not consider the effects of these items in evaluating the core operational activities of ON Semiconductor. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate ON Semiconductor’s current performance. In addition, we believe that most analysts covering ON Semiconductor use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate ON Semiconductor's performance. Given management’s and other relevant use of these non-GAAP measures, ON Semiconductor believes these measures are important to investors in understanding ON Semiconductor’s current and future operating results as seen through the eyes of management. In addition, management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in enabling them to better assess changes in ON Semiconductor’s core business across different time periods. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with, and should not be considered alternatives or necessarily superior to, or an alternative to GAAP financial data and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures, even if they have similar names.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income before interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense and special items. We use the adjusted EBITDA measure for internal managerial evaluation purposes, as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and as a performance metric for the vesting/releasing of certain of our performance-based equity awards. Regulation G under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and other federal securities laws regulate the use of financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We believe this measure provides important supplemental information to investors. However, we do not, and you should not, rely on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance.\nNon-GAAP Revenue\nThe use of non-GAAP Revenue allows management to evaluate, among other things, the revenue from the Company’s core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of special items such as the impact of the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales implemented in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, non-GAAP Revenue it is an important component of management’s internal performance measurement and incentive and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business and for strategic decision making, preparing budgets, obtaining targets and forecasting future results. Management presents this non-GAAP financial measure to enable investors and analysts to evaluate our revenue generation performance relative to the direct costs of operations of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses.\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nThe use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin allows management to evaluate, among other things, the gross margin and gross profit of the Company’s core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of non-cash items including, generally speaking, expensing of appraised inventory fair market value step-up and the impact from the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales. In addition, it is an important component of management’s internal performance measurement and incentive and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business and for strategic decision making, preparing budgets, obtaining targets and forecasting future results. Management presents this non-GAAP financial measure to enable investors and analysts to evaluate our revenue generation performance relative to the direct costs of revenue of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses.\nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Operating Margin\nThe use of non-GAAP operating income and operating margin allows management to evaluate, among other things, the operating margin and operating income of the company’s core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of non-cash items including, generally speaking, expensing of appraised inventory fair market value step-up, the impact from the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales, amortization and impairments of intangible assets, third party acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring charges and certain other special items as necessary. In addition, it is an important component of management’s internal performance measurement and incentive and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business and for strategic decision making, preparing budgets, obtaining targets and forecasting future results. Management presents this non-GAAP financial measure to enable investors and analysts to evaluate our revenue generation performance relative to the direct costs of operations of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses.\nNon-GAAP Net Income Attributable to ON Semiconductor and Diluted Earnings per Share\nThe use of non-GAAP net income attributable to ON Semiconductor and diluted earnings per share allows management to evaluate the operating results of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of non-cash items including, generally, the amortization and impairments of intangible assets, expensing of appraised inventory fair market value step-up, the impact from the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales, restructuring, gains and losses on debt prepayment, non-cash interest expense, actuarial (gains) losses on pension plans and other pension benefits, third party acquisition and divestiture related costs, tax impact of these items and other non-GAAP adjustments and certain other special items, as necessary. In addition, these items are important components of management’s internal performance measurement and incentive and reward process, as they are used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business and for strategic decision making, preparing budgets, setting targets and forecasting future results. Management presents these non-GAAP financial measures to enable investors and analysts to understand the results of operations of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses and, to the extent comparable, to compare our results of operations on a more consistent basis against that of other companies in our industry.\nFree Cash Flow\nThe use of free cash flow allows management to evaluate, among other things, the ability of the Company to make interest or principal payments on its debt. Free cash flow is defined as the difference between cash flow from operating activities and capital expenditures disclosed under investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Free cash flow is not an alternate to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. It is an important component of management’s internal performance measurement and incentive and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business and for strategic decision making, preparing budgets, obtaining targets and forecasting future results. Management presents this non-GAAP financial measure to enable investors and analysts to evaluate our revenue generation performance relative to the direct costs of operations of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses.\nDiluted Share Count\nIn periods when the quarterly average stock price per share exceeds $18.50, the non-GAAP diluted share count includes the anti-dilutive impact of the Company’s hedge transactions issued concurrently with the 1.00% convertible notes. As such, at an average stock price per share between $18.50 and $25.96, the hedging activity offsets the potentially dilutive effect of the 1.00% convertible notes.\nIn periods when the quarterly average stock price per share exceeds $20.72, the non-GAAP diluted share count includes the anti-dilutive impact of the Company’s hedge transactions issued concurrently with the 1.625% Notes. As such, at an average stock price per share between $20.72 and $30.70, the hedging activity offsets the potentially dilutive effect of the 1.625% notes.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180202005715/en/\nON Semiconductor\nKris Pugsley, 312-909-0661\nCorporate/Media Communications\nkris.pugsley@onsemi.com\nor\nParag Agarwal, 602-244-3437\nVice President Investor Relations and Corporate Development\ninvestor@onsemi.com\nSource: ON Semiconductor Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com%2FPowerSolutions%2Fcontent.do%3Fid%3D15067&esheet=51753208&newsitemid=20180202005715&lan=en-US&anchor=automotive%2C+communications%2C+computing%2C+consumer%2C+industrial%2C+medical%2C+aerospace+and+defense+applications&index=4&md5=638513659455626fba14ec1fe5630a55", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com%2FPowerSolutions%2Fcontent.do%3Fid%3D1116&esheet=51753208&newsitemid=20180202005715&lan=en-US&anchor=ON&index=1&md5=14e706bff9f5fbfd671e6262de468872", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180202005715/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fonsemi&esheet=51753208&newsitemid=20180202005715&lan=en-US&anchor=%40onsemi&index=6&md5=b729907fedef788f6cf1e83ae18965fa", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com&esheet=51753208&newsitemid=20180202005715&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com&index=2&md5=56c9ba18bae16fa3244505c93685bd3e", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com%2FPowerSolutions%2Fcontent.do%3Fid%3D1116&esheet=51753208&newsitemid=20180202005715&lan=en-US&anchor=ON&index=3&md5=a32522b797536297f2667d9a30000a94", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com%2F&esheet=51753208&newsitemid=20180202005715&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com&index=5&md5=75db6d04f7e8da5d761f92be148190ed"], "published": "2018-02-03T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T04:01:56.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
