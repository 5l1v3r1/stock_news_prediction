I think it will be another special race.”\nBoldon, now a television analyst, would not be surprised at another record if all goes well.\nFeb 10, 2018; Boston, Massachussetts, USA; Christian Coleman (USA) wins the 60m in 6.46 during the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix her (at Reggie Lewis Center.

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports But Coleman, who finished ahead of the now retired Bolt but behind countryman Justin Gatlin at the 2017 world championships in London could become the man to beat in the 100 this year.\nCollegiate sprint champion indoors and out last year, he took down the college 100 meters record with a blazing 9.82 seconds for the fastest time of 2017.\nAnd he is ready to run faster, Greene said.\n“You know he is in the low 9.7 (seconds) range now,” Greene said of a time only seven sprinters have run.\nBut the three-time world 100 meters champion would like to see Coleman run a few races before making any predictions.\n“I want to see if he has fixed that last 20,” Greene said of Coleman’s tendency to lose top speed faster than others at the end of a race.\n“If he fixes that last 20, it is going to be hurtful for a lot of people.”\nBoldon is already convinced.\n“Some may deny his ability to now dominate the 100, but the combo of that start, that acceleration and sub 19.7 200m ability = very few legit threats to him out there,” the analyst and coach said.\nReporting by Gene Cherry in Salvo, North Carolina; Editing by Christian Radnedge\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T19:19:00.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
