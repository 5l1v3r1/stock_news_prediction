In July, Veolia already said it expected a compromise in coming months.\n$1 = 0.8152 euros Reporting by Geert De Clercq Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:57:51.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
