However, the Ducks only could get one across the goal line, and that came with 3:54 remaining when Adam Henrique scored to cut Detroitâ€™s lead to 2-1.\nThe Red Wings opened the scoring with 6:28 remaining in the first period when Larkin took advantage of a turnover by Ducks defenseman Kevin Bieksa and scored on a backhand.\nDetroit remained on top 1-0 until there was 4:23 remaining in the second period, when Nielsen scored his 13th of the year.\nMike Green and Anthony Mantha assisted on the goal for the Red Wings.\nAnaheim continued to press for the tying goal after Henrique scored, but a costly penalty on Bieksa with 2:21 remaining in the game left the Ducks little time to play with an extra attacker once they killed off the penalty.\nThe game went as expected from an offensive standpoint, given Anaheim and Detroit entered the game among the worst offensive teams in the National Hockey League.\nAnaheim was No. 23 in the league with 2.8 goals per game, while Detroit was 24th at 2.6.\nThe teams will play again on March 16 in Anaheim.\nThe Red Wings return to action Thursday at Tampa Bay against the NHL-leading Lightning. The Ducks, who began a four-game road trip Tuesday, oppose the Blackhawks in Chicago on Thursday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:27:24.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
