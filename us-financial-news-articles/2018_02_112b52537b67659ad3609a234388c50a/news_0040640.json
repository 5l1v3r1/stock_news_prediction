Lyon came on in relief of the injured Michal Neuvirth after the first period. Neuvirth himself was starting in goal in place of Brian Elliott, who remains out following surgery for a core muscle injury.\nNew York goaltender Henrik Lundqvist was surprisingly shaky and only made 30 saves on 37 shots as the Flyers picked up their 16th road victory of the season.\nKevin Hayes, Rick Nash, Mats Zuccarello and Peter Holland scored once for the Rangers, who have dropped four in a row and 11 of their last 15.\nIt was a wild start to the contest as the Flyers-Rangers rivalry was evident from the opening drop of the puck with a very physical style and three first-period fights.\nHayes redirected a shot in front of Neuvirth from way back at the blue line for a quick 1-0 Rangers lead with 18:30 remaining in the first.\nWith 15:08 left, the Flyers equalized when MacDonald ripped the puck past a lunging Lundqvist.\nThe Rangers went back ahead 2-1 when Nash took control of a rebound in front and tapped it home with 9:06 remaining.\nPhiladelphia tied the game at 2 as Laughton tipped home a shot by Ivan Provorov less than two minutes later.\nIn this frenetic first period, Manning gave the Flyers a 3-2 lead at 14:53 with Giroux and Konecny earning the assists on the impressive goal.\nThe Rangers tied the game at 3 when Zuccarello finished a two-on-one break for a short-handed goal at 17:21.\nLyon replaced Neuvirth to open the second period.\nPatrick then registered his sixth goal of the season at 2:01 of the second for a 4-3 Flyers lead.\nIt didnâ€™t take the Rangers long to tie the game at 4 as Holland tapped the rebound past Lyon at 5:47 of the second.\nKonecny continued the high-powered offensive game with a wrist shot and a 5-4 advantage at 15:40.\nGiroux pushed the Philadelphia lead to 6-4 at 9:23 of the third for his 200th career goal in a Flyers uniform.\nLehtera later added his first goal in 40 games and a comfortable three-goal cushion.\n-- Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:54:39.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
