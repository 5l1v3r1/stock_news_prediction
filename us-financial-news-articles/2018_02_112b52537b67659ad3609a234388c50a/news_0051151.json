Our business has continued to accelerate, which is a testament to the growing strength of our brand and the appeal of our affordable, non-intimidating fitness offering, especially with casual and first-time gym users. With the addition of 1.7 million net new members and a record 210 new store openings system-wide in 2017, we've continued to build on our leading market share position through effective national and local advertising programs and expanding our geographic footprint in new and existing markets. We begin the New Year with great brand momentum and numerous opportunities to further grow our business in the near and long-term, including significant store development opportunities, increased brand and marketing investments, and using technology to enhance member experiences.\"\nOperating Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, total revenue increased $17.6 million or 15.1% to $134.0 million from $116.4 million in the prior year period. By segment:\nFranchise segment revenue, which includes commission income, increased $7.9 million or 24.6% to $40.0 million from $32.1 million in the prior year period; Corporate-owned stores segment revenue increased $2.3 million or 8.7% to $28.2 million from $26.0 million in the prior year period; and Equipment segment revenue increased $7.5 million or 12.8% to $65.8 million from $58.3 million.\nSystem-wide same store sales increased 11.6%. By segment, franchisee-owned same store sales increased 11.9% and corporate-owned same store sales increased 5.6%.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, net income was $0.8 million and net income attributable to Planet Fitness Inc. was a loss of $3.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $21.9 million and net income attributable to Planet Fitness Inc. of $10.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in the prior year period. Both amounts in 2017 include the net negative impact of approximately $17.2 million related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and tax benefit arrangements due to recent tax reform. Adjusted net income (see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\") increased 19.1% to $23.5 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, from $19.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Adjusted net income has been adjusted to reflect a normalized federal income tax rate of 39.5% for the current and comparable prior year period and excludes certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in the evaluation of ongoing operational performance (see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\").\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in the evaluation of ongoing operational performance (see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\"), increased 16.0% to $51.2 million from $44.1 million in the prior year period.\nSegment EBITDA represents our Total Segment EBITDA broken down by the Company's reportable segments. Total Segment EBITDA is equal to EBITDA, which is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\").\nFranchise segment EBITDA increased $6.1 million or 23.4% to $32.0 million driven by royalties from both new stores and higher same store sales; Corporate-owned stores segment EBITDA increased $0.7 million or 6.5% to $11.3 million driven by higher same store sales and annual fee revenue, partially offset by higher pre-opening costs associated with four corporate-owned stores opened during the fourth quarter; and Equipment segment EBITDA decreased $0.2 million or 1.0% to $15.0 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, equipment segment EBITDA included a gain of $1.8 million recorded in connection with the write-off of a previously accrued equipment discount.\nOperating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, total revenue increased $51.7 million or 13.7% to $429.9 million from $378.2 million in the prior year. By segment:\nFranchise segment revenue, which includes commission income, increased $33.7 million or 28.9% to $150.2 million from $116.5 million in the prior year; Corporate-owned stores segment revenue increased $7.4 million or 7.1% to $112.1 million from $104.7 million in the prior year; and Equipment segment revenue increased $10.6 million or 6.8% to $167.7 million from $157.0 million in the prior year.\nSystem-wide same store sales increased 10.2% from the prior year. By segment, franchisee-owned same store sales increased 10.5% and corporate-owned same store sales increased 4.9% from the prior year.\nFor full year fiscal 2017, net income was $55.6 million and net income attributable to Planet Fitness Inc. was $33.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to net income of $71.2 million and net income attributable to Planet Fitness, Inc. of $21.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share in the prior year. Both amounts in 2017 include the net negative impact of approximately $17.2 million related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and tax benefit arrangements due to recent tax reform. Adjusted net income (see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\") increased 21.8% to $82.3 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, from $67.6 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted net income has been adjusted to reflect a normalized federal income tax rate of 39.5% for the current year and comparable prior year period and excludes certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in the evaluation of ongoing operational performance (see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\").\nAdjusted EBITDA (see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\") increased $34.1 million or 22.7% to $184.7 million in 2017 from $150.6 million in the prior year.\nSegment EBITDA represents our Total Segment EBITDA broken down by the Company's reportable segments. Total Segment EBITDA is equal to EBITDA, which is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\").\nFranchise segment EBITDA increased $29.2 million or 30.0% to $126.5 million; Corporate-owned stores segment EBITDA increased $6.0 million or 14.7% to $46.9 million; and Equipment segment EBITDA increased $2.1 million or 5.8% to $38.5 million. In 2016, equipment segment EBITDA included a gain of $1.8 million recorded in connection with the write-off of a previously accrued equipment discount.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase of $80 million to its current $20 million share repurchase program, bringing the total authorized amount available for repurchase to $100 million. The timing of the purchases and the amount of stock repurchased is subject to the Company's discretion and will depend on market and business conditions, the Company's general working capital needs, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. Our ability to repurchase shares at any particular time is also subject to continued compliance with the terms of our credit agreement. Purchases may be effected through one or more open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. Planet Fitness is not obligated under the program to acquire any particular amount of stock and can suspend or terminate the program at any time.\n2018 Outlook\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018, the Company expects:\nTotal revenue increase of approximately 20%; System-wide same store sales growth in the high single digit percentage range; and Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to increase approximately 40%.\nPresentation of Financial Measures\nPlanet Fitness, Inc. (the \"Company\") was formed in March 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the initial public offering (the \"IPO\") and related recapitalization transactions that occurred in August 2015, and in order to carry on the business of Pla-Fit Holdings, LLC (\"Pla-Fit Holdings\") and its subsidiaries. As the sole managing member of Pla-Fit Holdings, the Company operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Pla-Fit Holdings, and through Pla-Fit Holdings, conducts its business. As a result, the Company consolidates Pla-Fit Holdings' financial results and reports a non-controlling interest related to the portion of Pla-Fit Holdings not owned by the Company. The financial results in periods prior to the IPO and related recapitalization transactions are of Pla-Fit Holdings, as the predecessor to the Company for accounting and reporting purposes. Accordingly, these historical results do not purport to reflect what the results of operations of the Company or Pla-Fit Holdings would have been had the IPO and related recapitalization transactions occurred prior to August 2015.\nThe financial information presented in this release includes non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA, Segment EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted to provide measures that we believe are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental measures of the Company's performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP financial measures such as net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with, GAAP. In addition, in the future, the Company may incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted. The Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar amounts or other unusual or nonrecurring items. See the tables at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in our full-year outlook will differ from net income and net income per share, diluted, determined in accordance with GAAP in ways similar to those described in the reconciliations at the end of this press release. We do not provide guidance for net income or net income per share, diluted, determined in accordance with GAAP or a reconciliation of guidance for Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because we are not able to predict with reasonable certainty the amount or nature of all items that will be included in our net income and net income per share, diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2018. These items are uncertain, depend on many factors and could have a material impact on our net income and net income per share, diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInvestor Conference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call at 4:30 pm (ET) on February 22, 2018 to discuss the news announced in this press release. A live webcast of the conference call will be accessible at www.planetfitness.com via the \"Investor Relations\" link. The webcast will be archived on the website for one year.\nAbout Planet Fitness\nFounded in 1992 in Dover, N.H., Planet Fitness is one of the largest and fastest-growing franchisors and operators of fitness centers in the United States by number of members and locations.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental measures of the Company's performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP financial measures such as net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, in the future, the Company may incur expenses or charges and recognize income or gains such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted. The Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nEBITDA, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe refer to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as we use these measures to evaluate our operating performance and we believe these measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating our performance. We have also disclosed Segment EBITDA as an important financial metric utilized by the Company to evaluate performance and allocate resources to segments in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting. We define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Segment EBITDA for each of our segments sums to Total Segment EBITDA which is equal to the Non-GAAP financial metric EBITDA. We believe that EBITDA, which eliminates the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provides useful information to investors to assess the performance of our segments as well as the business as a whole. Our Board of Directors also uses EBITDA as a key metric to assess the performance of management. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of the Company's core operations. These items include certain purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition transaction fees, stock offering-related costs, pre-opening costs, tax benefit arrangement remeasurement and certain other charges and gains. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance in addition to EBITDA because it eliminates the impact of other items that we believe reduce the comparability of our underlying core business performance from period to period and is therefore useful to our investors in comparing the core performance of our business from period to period.\nA reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below:\nFor the quarter ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss) attributable to Planet Fitness, Inc.\n$\n(3,453)\n$\n10,575\n$\n33,146\n$\n21,500\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n4,282\n11,373\n22,455\n49,747\nNet income\n$\n829\n$\n21,948\n$\n55,601\n$\n71,247\nInterest expense, net (1)\n8,572\n8,306\n35,283\n27,125\nProvision for income taxes (2)\n349,647\n7,157\n373,580\n18,661\nDepreciation and amortization\n7,779\n8,375\n31,761\n31,502\nEBITDA\n$\n366,827\n$\n45,786\n$\n496,225\n$\n148,535\nPurchase accounting adjustments-revenue (3)\n416\n29\n1,532\n487\nPurchase accounting adjustments-rent (4)\n164\n197\n725\n861\nTransaction fees (5)\n9\n3,001\n1,030\n3,001\nStock offering-related costs (6)\n-\n499\n977\n2,604\nSeverance costs (7)\n-\n-\n-\n423\nPre-opening costs (8)\n596\n-\n1,017\n-\nEarly lease termination costs (9)\n-\n-\n719\n-\nEquipment discount (10)\n-\n(1,754)\n(107)\n(1,754)\nIndemnification receivable (11)\n-\n(2,772)\n-\n(2,772)\nTax benefit arrangement remeasurement (12)\n(316,813)\n-\n(317,354)\n72\nOther (13)\n-\n(840)\n(32)\n(840)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n51,199\n$\n44,146\n$\n184,732\n$\n150,617\n(1)\nIncludes $606 of loss on extinguishment of debt in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.\n(2)\nIncludes $334,022 in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act.\n(3)\nRepresents the impact of revenue-related purchase accounting adjustments associated with the 2012 acquisition of Pla-Fit Holdings on November 8, 2012 (the \"2012 Acquisition\") by investment funds associated with TSG Consumer Partners, LLC. At the time of the 2012 Acquisition, the Company maintained a deferred revenue account, which consisted of deferred area development agreement fees, deferred franchise fees, and deferred enrollment fees that the Company billed and collected up front but recognizes for GAAP purposes at a later date. In connection with the 2012 Acquisition, it was determined that the carrying amount of deferred revenue was greater than the fair value assessed in accordance with ASC 805—Business Combinations, which resulted in a write-down of the carrying value of the deferred revenue balance upon application of acquisition push-down accounting under ASC 805. For the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, these amounted to $416, $29, $1,532 and $487, respectively, representing the amount of additional revenue that would have been recognized in those periods if the write-down to deferred revenue had not occurred in connection with the application of acquisition pushdown accounting.\n(4)\nRepresents the impact of rent related purchase accounting adjustments. In accordance with guidance in ASC 805 – Business Combinations, in connection with the 2012 Acquisition, the Company's deferred rent liability was required to be written off as of the acquisition date and rent is being recorded on a straight-line basis from the acquisition date through the end of the lease term. This resulted in higher overall rent expense each period than would have otherwise been recorded had the deferred rent liability not been written off as a result of the acquisition push down accounting applied in accordance with ASC 805. Adjustments of $89, $103, $395 and $475 in the quarters ending December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, reflect the difference between the higher rent expense recorded in accordance with GAAP since the acquisition and the rent expense that would have been recorded had the 2012 Acquisition not occurred. Adjustments of $75, $94, $329 and $386 for the quarters ending December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are due to the amortization of favorable and unfavorable lease intangible assets which were recorded in connection with the 2012 Acquisition and the acquisition of eight franchisee-owned stores on March 31, 2014. All of the rent related purchase accounting adjustments are adjustments to rent expense, which is included in store operations on our consolidated statements of operations.\n(5)\nRepresents transaction fees and expenses related to the amendment of our credit facility in the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n(6)\nRepresents legal, accounting and other costs incurred in connection with offerings of the Company's Class A common stock.\n(7)\nRepresents severance expense recorded in connection with an equity award modification.\n(8)\nRepresents costs associated with new corporate-owned stores incurred prior to the store opening, including payroll-related costs, rent and occupancy expenses, marketing and other store operating supply expenses.\n(9)\nRepresents charges and expenses incurred in connection with the early termination of the lease for our previous headquarters.\n(10)\nRepresents a gain recorded in connection with the write-off of a previously accrued equipment discount that is no longer expected to be utilized. This amount was originally recognized through purchase accounting in connection with the acquisition of eight franchisee-owned stores on March 31, 2014.\n(11)\nRepresents a receivable recorded in connection with a contractual obligation of the Company's co-founders to indemnify the Company with respect to pre-IPO tax liabilities pursuant to the 2012 Acquisition.\n(12)\nRepresents gains (losses) related to the adjustment of our tax benefit arrangements primarily due to changes in our effective tax rate. In the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, includes expense of $316,813 related to the remeasurement of the Company's tax benefit arrangement liabilities pursuant to the recent tax reform.\n(13)\nRepresents certain other charges and gains that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. In 2016, the net gain primarily related to proceeds received from an insurance settlement.\nA reconciliation of Segment EBITDA to Total Segment EBITDA is set forth below.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nSegment EBITDA\nFranchise\n$\n32,015\n$\n25,948\n$\n126,459\n$\n97,256\nCorporate-owned stores\n11,276\n10,588\n46,855\n40,847\nEquipment\n14,952\n15,109\n38,539\n36,439\nCorporate and other\n308,584\n(5,859)\n284,372\n(26,007)\nTotal Segment EBITDA (1)\n$\n366,827\n$\n45,786\n$\n496,225\n$\n148,535\n(1)\nTotal Segment EBITDA is equal to EBITDA.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share\nAs a result of the recapitalization transactions that occurred prior to our IPO, the Company was designated as the sole managing member of Pla-Fit Holdings. As the sole managing member, the Company exclusively operates and controls the business and affairs of Pla-Fit Holdings. As a result of the recapitalization transactions, the Company consolidates Pla-Fit Holdings, and Pla-Fit Holdings is considered the predecessor to the Company for accounting purposes. Our presentation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, gives effect to the consolidation of Pla-Fit Holdings with the Company resulting from the recapitalization transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016. In addition, Adjusted net income assumes that all net income is attributable to the Company, which assumes the full exchange of all outstanding common units of Pla-Fit Holdings for shares of the Company's Class A common stock, adjusted for certain non-recurring items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations. Adjusted net income per share, diluted, is calculated by dividing Adjusted net income by the total shares of Class A common stock outstanding plus any dilutive options and restricted stock units as calculated in accordance with GAAP and assuming the full exchange of all outstanding common units of Pla-Fit Holdings and corresponding Class B common stock as of the beginning of each period presented. Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent, and should not be considered, alternatives to net income and earnings per share, as calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, supplement GAAP measures and enable us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of Adjusted net income per share, diluted, are set forth below.\nFor the quarter ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss) attributable to Planet Fitness, Inc.\n$\n(3,453)\n$\n10,575\n$\n33,146\n$\n21,500\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n4,282\n11,373\n22,455\n49,747\nNet income\n$\n829\n$\n21,948\n$\n55,601\n$\n71,247\nProvision for income taxes, as reported (1)\n349,647\n7,157\n373,580\n18,661\nPurchase accounting adjustments-revenue (2)\n416\n29\n1,532\n487\nPurchase accounting adjustments-rent (3)\n164\n197\n725\n861\nTransaction fees (4)\n9\n3,001\n1,030\n3,001\nStock offering-related costs (5)\n-\n499\n977\n2,604\nSeverance costs (6)\n-\n-\n-\n423\nPre-opening costs (7)\n596\n-\n1,017\n-\nEarly lease termination costs (8)\n-\n-\n1,143\n-\nEquipment discount (9)\n-\n(1,754)\n(107)\n(1,754)\nIndemnification receivable (10)\n-\n(2,772)\n-\n(2,772)\nTax benefit arrangement remeasurement (11)\n(316,813)\n-\n(317,354)\n72\nOther (12)\n-\n(522)\n(32)\n(522)\nPurchase accounting amortization (13)\n4,009\n4,843\n17,876\n19,371\nAdjusted income before income taxes\n$\n38,857\n$\n32,626\n$\n135,988\n$\n111,679\nAdjusted income taxes (14)\n15,349\n12,887\n53,715\n44,113\nAdjusted net income\n$\n23,508\n$\n19,739\n$\n82,273\n$\n67,566\nAdjusted net income per share, diluted\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.20\n$\n0.84\n$\n0.69\nAdjusted weighted-average shares outstanding, diluted (15)\n98,570\n98,598\n98,455\n98,611\n(1)\nIncludes $334,022 in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act.\n(2)\nRepresents the impact of revenue-related purchase accounting adjustments associated with the 2012 Acquisition.
