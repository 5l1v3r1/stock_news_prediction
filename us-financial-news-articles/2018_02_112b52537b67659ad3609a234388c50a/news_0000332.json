Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net A TIMELY \"SELL\" SIGNAL (1045 GMT) In terms of timing, Bank of America Merrill-Lynch's \"Bull & Bear\" indicator comes at a time where it definitely won't be overlooked. The fact that it hit a \"Sell\" signal while European markets are deep into a fifth consecutive day in the red is food for thought. \"What is for sure is that this indicator comes at a moment where investors are asking themselves where the market is heading,\" said Pierre Martin, a senior sales trader at Saxo Bank. Martin argues that the fast-rising upward trend since the beginning of the year leaves some space for some technical correction but that at the same time, there is no reason to give up on the \"global synchronised growth\" investment case. (Julien Ponthus) DECLINE OF THE DAX (0939 GMT) One of the most impressive reversals in 2018 so far has been Germany's DAX, which started out the year as a leader among European stock markets, fuelled to a fresh record high by the cyclicals-led rally, only to reverse violently, dropping more than 5 percent in just eight sessions. It's now in the red year-to-date. The euro's relentless rise must be partly to blame for the outsize decline in the exporter-heavy index, but rising bond yields are also a pressure for the DAX's big defensive stocks in healthcare and utilities. (Helen Reid) SPANISH BANKS' RESULTS \"A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING\" (0847 GMT) It's a hefty day for European banking results, and the falls in the share prices confirm the view from Jefferies analysts that earnings from Spanish lenders Sabadell and Caixabank are somewhat underwhelming. \"4Q numbers decidedly mixed for both (-ve one-offs at CABK, weaker core trends at SAB), but the guidance towards a brighter outlook may offer partial support,\" Jefferies analysts say. Spanish banks did have a strong year in 2017 so some share price weakness was perhaps to be expected. (Kit Rees) OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES DIP AS BANKING RESULTS WEIGH (0811 GMT) It looks like day five of straight losses for European shares, with the STOXX 600 index sliding further in early dealing. Aside from oil & gas, all other sectors are in negative territory, with the disappointing results from Deutsche Bank sending its shares 5 percent lower, while Spain's Caixabank and Sabadell are also among the biggest fallers among banks following earnings. We could see some volatility ahead of U.S. payroll data. Here's your opening snapshot: (Kit Rees) WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0745 GMT) European shares are set to open flat to slightly lower at the end of a week where rising bond yields and strength in the euro have pushed the STOXX 600 benchmark down around 1.7 percent. That is already the biggest one-week loss since early November when a slowdown in earnings growth and similar bond market jitters weighed. Futures were trading between flat and a fall of 0.2 percent. Tech stocks will be in focus after U.S. internet giants released their earning updates yesterday with a record profit at Amazon possibly boosting shares in companies like Zalando, while shares in semiconductor companies like AMS, Dialog Semi, and IQE are expected to open lower after Apple issued a light guidance and reported it sold fewer iPhones over the holiday quarter than Wall Street had expected. There is a raft of results in Europe too that will keep investors busy. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for the STOXX 600 are expected to increase by 11.9 percent year on year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed. Deutsche Bank shares are indicated down 4 percent after the German lender reported a bigger than expected net loss for 2017, which could test a strong rally in banking stocks seen so far this year which was fuelled by expectations over tighter monetary policy and strong economic growth.

The STOXX 600 is down around 1.8 percent so far this week, set for its biggest weekly loss since November Here's your snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) DEUTSCHE BANK POSTS BIGGER THAN EXPECTED LOSS (0643 GMT) Banks, recently buoyed by rising bond yields and optimism about economic growth, could be in focus today after the DAX-listed heavyweight lender disappointed analyst expectations with a 2017 loss of 497 million euros in 2017.
