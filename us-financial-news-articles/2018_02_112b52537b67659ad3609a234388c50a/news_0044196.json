Sterling in January hit its highest level, at $1.4346, since the vote to leave the EU in June, 2016.\nAgainst the euro, the pound was up marginally at 88.495 pence per euro.\nTraders will be looking to an EU leaders meeting next month for progress on Britain securing itself a transition deal for when it leaves the EU.\n“Shifting opinion polls regarding the merits of Brexit keep a carrot in front of the noses of sterling bulls, because there’s no doubt that any genuine hope of a soft or non-existent Brexit would be good for the currency,” Societe Generale said.\nReporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:48:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
