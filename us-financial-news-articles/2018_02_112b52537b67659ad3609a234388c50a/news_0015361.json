Then on the last two days, Stevie Wonder came on with his band and made Paul come up and play with him — he’s good, man.” \nAllen, the owner of the Seattle Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers, has expressed his affinity for Hendrix in the past. In his memoir Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft , Allen described being obsessed with the rocker, including working on mastering his songs and unconventional fingering patterns. Allen also talked about playing “Purple Haze” during a Dallas show with his band Grown Men that had the audience “on their feet and cheering.” \n“I knew I’d never play it the way Jimi did, but I was satisfied,” he wrote. \nAllen noted that he keeps many instruments on his yachts, which he plays with his musician friends – so the jam session Jones describes isn’t such a far-fetched idea. \nBloomberg estimates Allen’s net worth at $24.4 billion.
