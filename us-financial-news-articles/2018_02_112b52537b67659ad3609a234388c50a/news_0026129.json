The executives on this annual list represent top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their organization through channel partners.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN's editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding channel partner programs.\nSteve Jow, Senior Vice President, Sales (honored five years) – In 2017, Jow worked to increase meaningful engagement with the SMB community through SYNNEX' SMB teams and the SMB Connect partner program, which helped to double growth in the SYNNEX partner community. Jow also marshaled SYNNEX resources and influence to help individual partners obtain business beyond their own capacity and fostered partnering opportunities within the SMB community to maximize their reach and potential. Rob Moyer, Vice President, Cloud, Mobility and IoT (honored two years) – Under Moyer's direction, SYNNEX CLOUDSolv launched version 2.0 of what is now its Cloud, Mobility & IoT Community, growing membership of key partners by 50 percent year-over-year.

Additionally, the VISUALSolv business saw unprecedented growth, now supporting more than 2,000 customers within the audio/visual customer segment.

Bob Stegner, Senior Vice President, Marketing, North America (honored ten consecutive years) – Stegner led outreach efforts challenging partners to take advantage of unique SYNNEX marketing tools and resources and increased collaboration in response to digital transformation in the IT industry.

Reyna Thompson, Vice President, CONVERGESolv Secure Networking Group (honored two years) – Thompson led the rapid expansion of SYNNEX' line card with key networking, security, unified communications, and wireless LAN (local access network) vendor partners.
