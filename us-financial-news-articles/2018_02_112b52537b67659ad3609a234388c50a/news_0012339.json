(NYSE:AQUA) today reported results for its first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nEvoqua reported revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $297.1 million, an increase of $17.2 million or 6.1% as compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in organic service revenues in the Industrial segment associated with account penetration in the power, hydrocarbon processing and chemical processing markets and from recently acquired businesses. Net loss for the quarter was $3.0 million, an improvement of $10.2 million or 77.2% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $40.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of $2.7 million or 7.4% year-over-year. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by an increase in revenues and related gross margin as well as a decrease in operating expenses year-over-year.\n“For the first quarter, Evoqua generated record sales and Adjusted EBITDA led by strong growth in the Industrial segment, complemented by the realization of continued operational efficiency benefits,” said Ron Keating, Evoqua CEO. “Fiscal 2018 is off to a strong start. We continue to be well positioned to capture organic and inorganic growth opportunities across our business segments.”\nFirst Quarter Segment Results\nThe Company has three reportable segments - Industrial, Municipal and Products.\nIndustrial\nThe Industrial segment combines equipment and services to improve operational reliability and environmental compliance for heavy and light industry, commercial and institutional markets. Their customers span industries including hydrocarbon processing, chemical processing, power, food and beverage, life sciences, health services and microelectronics.\nRevenues in the Industrial segment increased $19.5 million, or 13.4%, to $165.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $145.7 million in the same period in the prior year. Growth was driven by an increase in service revenue of $7.1 million primarily in the power, hydrocarbon processing and chemical processing markets as well as $2.3 million from further capital expansion, primarily in the power market and remediation projects. In addition, an increase of $10.1 million of revenue year-over-year was attributable to the acquisitions of ETS, ADI and Noble Water Technologies, which occurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\nOperating profit in the Industrial segment increased $6.9 million, or 29.9%, to $30.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $23.1 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase in operating profit was driven by the revenues from acquisitions noted above, which contributed $3.0 million, as well an increase of $2.5 million from organic revenue growth and $1.4 million of benefits resulting from lower employment costs driven by restructuring and cost improvement initiatives implemented in the current and prior fiscal year. EBITDA in the Industrial segment increased $8.1 million, or 25.4%, to $40.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $32.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nMunicipal\nThe Municipal segment helps engineers and municipalities meet new demands for plant performance through market-leading equipment, solutions and services backed by trusted brands and over 100 years of applications experience. The segment’s customers include waste water and drinking water collection and distribution systems and utility operators. The segment’s services include odor and corrosion control services.\nMunicipal revenues decreased slightly by $0.7 million, or (1.2)%, to $61.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $62.6 million for the comparable period in the prior year. Service and project revenues increased 4.3% and 1.6%, respectively, while the expected timing of aftermarket product revenues drove a decline of 16.1% as compared to the prior year period.\nOperating profit in the Municipal segment decreased $1.7 million, or (26.1)%, to $4.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $6.5 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily due to product mix and planned timing of certain recurring expenses, which accounted for approximately $3.6 million of the decline. These decreases were offset by lower employment and legal expenses of $1.3 million and $0.7 million of benefits as a result of restructuring and cost improvement initiatives implemented in the prior fiscal year. EBITDA in the Municipal segment decreased $2.0 million, or 23.0%, to $6.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $8.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nProducts\nThe Products segment has distinct business operating units, each built on well-known brands and technologies that are sold globally through multiple sales and aftermarket channels. Additionally, the Products segment also offers industrial, municipal and recreational users improved operational reliability and environmental compliance. The segment’s customers include original equipment manufacturers, regional and global distributors, engineering, procurement and contracting customers, and end users in the industrial, municipal and commercial industries.\nProducts revenues decreased $1.5 million, or (2.2)%, to $70.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $71.5 million in the comparable period of the prior year. The expected decline in revenues was primarily due to the timing of larger projects completed in the first quarter of the prior year in the Aquatics product line, offset by an increase in revenues related to the Electrocatalytic ballast water and Separation Technologies product lines, and continued strong growth in the China market.\nOperating profit in the Products segment decreased $3.7 million, or (32.3)%, to $7.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $11.4 million in the prior year period. The decline in operating profit was attributable to product mix and the timing of larger projects completed in the first quarter of the prior year in the Aquatics product line. EBITDA in the Products segment decreased $4.2 million, or 28.3%, to $10.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $14.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nSummary and Outlook\n“All three of our segments continue to deliver as planned, and we are particularly pleased by the strong growth delivered by the Industrial segment,” said Keating. “Secular trends in our key vertical markets continue to be positive and support profitable growth. For 2018, we reaffirm our expected revenues to be in the range of $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion and Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $235 million and $255 million.”\nAbout Evoqua Water Technologies\nEvoqua Water Technologies is a leading provider of mission critical water treatment solutions, offering services, systems and technologies to support its customers’ full water lifecycle needs.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including restructuring and related business transformation costs, purchase accounting adjustment costs, non cash stock based compensation, sponsor fees, transaction costs and other gains, losses and expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business. We present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under GAAP, because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because it excludes, among other things, certain results of decisions that are outside the control of management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance as follows:\nto assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance; in our management incentive compensation which is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA; in certain calculations under our senior secured credit facilities, which use components of Adjusted EBITDA; to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; to make budgeting decisions; and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nIn addition to the above, our chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. EBITDA of the reportable segments does not include certain unallocated charges that are presented within Corporate activities. These unallocated charges include certain restructuring and other business transformation charges that have been incurred to align and reposition the Company to the current reporting structure, acquisition related costs (including transaction costs, integration costs and recognition of backlog intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting) and stock-based compensation charges.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited, amounts in thousands):\nThree months ended Three months ended December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 Net loss $ (13,200 ) $ (3,005 ) Interest expense 14,753 17,243 Income tax benefit (7,095 ) (4,410 ) Depreciation and amortization 18,647 19,883 EBITDA 13,105 29,711 Restructuring and related business transformation costs (a) 13,158 8,115 Purchase accounting adjustment costs (b) 219 — Stock-based compensation (c) 466 2,612 Sponsor fees (d) 1,000 333 Transaction costs (e) 1,359 514 Other gains, losses and expenses (f) 7,932 (1,304 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 37,239 $ 39,981", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T16:45:39.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
