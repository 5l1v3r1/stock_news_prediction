It is economically inappropriate and unworkable,” the chamber said in a statement.\n“The Chamber calls for a review of this (legislation) and allow for more considered analysis of the effect on business and the national economy.”\nThe government had said it agreed the new policy with the chamber and individual mining firms, but the chamber said the industry’s position had been “ignored or rather unsatisfactory”.\nZambia’s railways currently have a market share of about five percent, with the remainder handled by road transport, Mushimba said.
