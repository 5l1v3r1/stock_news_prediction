More than 2,000 Taliban fighters have been driven out of the region, government officials say.\nThe Pakistan Army’s public relations wing said in a statement that the “suicide attack” in the Swat Valley took place at the “army unit sports area”.\n“The soldiers were playing volleyball in the evening outside the military base...when a suicide bomber managed to blow himself up,” said a security official who asked not to be identified.\nThe match was also being watched by civilians, and the casualty count could rise as a large number of people had gathered in the area, he said, adding that wounded were being shifted to a nearby military hospital.\nThe attack was claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, in a statement sent to the media.\n“God willing Tehreek-e-Taliban has started the process of revenge attacks,” Taliban spokesman Mohammad Khurasani said in the statement. “Wait for more (attacks) to follow.”\nThe military has been on alert for signs of a Taliban resurgence as it seeks to rebuild civilian institutions and win over the local population as a bulwark against radical ideology.\nSince being chased out the region, the Taliban have carried out revenge attacks against anti-militancy activists and attempted to extort money from business owners in a region where Pakistan has stationed more than 4,000 soldiers.\nPakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the attack.\n“No cowardly attack can deter us in pursuing our struggle against the menace of terrorism to its logical conclusion. We will continue our fight till the last trace is rooted out,” the prime minister said in a statement.\nAdditional reporting by Saad Sayeed and Saud Mehsud in Islamabad; Writing by Saad Sayeed\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T19:27:43.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
