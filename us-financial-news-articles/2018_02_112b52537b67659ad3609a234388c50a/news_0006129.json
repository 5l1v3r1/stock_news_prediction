The ad sparked a creative revolution among advertisers and garnered massive media attention.\nBy the 1990s, Super Bowl commercials had become a television event unto themselves. Companies sought bragging rights for making the best ad of the night -- and a “creative bowl” kicked off.\nThese days, a 30-second spot can cost more than $5 million. Companies are willing to pay millions of dollars because it’s one of the few times a year viewers actually want to watch ads, and some spend most of their annual ad budget for the one Super Bowl ad.\nAlong the way, companies have taken risks to gain attention and win over viewers, and rivalries were also spawned.\nIn today’s climate, advertisers are touching on topics like immigration, gender inequality and other social issues that can generate buzz, but risk turning off some viewers, too. Those who want to play it safe can always just go for the funny bone -- which never goes out of style.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T03:32:22.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
