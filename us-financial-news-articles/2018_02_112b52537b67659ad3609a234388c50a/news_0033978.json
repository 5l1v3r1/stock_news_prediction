Three homes have been completely destroyed and four damaged. Overall, damage to infrastructure has been minimal,” Anare Leweniqila, director of Fiji’s National Disaster Management Office, told Reuters.\nLeweniqila said crops on both islands had been damaged, but Fiji’s most populated centers escaped serious harm as Cyclone Gita passed south of Fiji’s capital, Suva.\nGita caused extensive damage in Samoa and American Samoa at the weekend, and hit Tonga hard on Monday night, causing widespread destruction and flooding.\nForecast tracking by Tropical Storm Risk had the cyclone moving westwards and then heading south, avoiding New Caledonia.\nReporting by John Mair in Wellington; Reporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; Editing by Peter Graff and Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T00:00:09.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
