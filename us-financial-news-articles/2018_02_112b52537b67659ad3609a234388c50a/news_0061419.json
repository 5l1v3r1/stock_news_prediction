The contract hit $64.24 on Monday, its highest since Feb. 6.\nLondon Brent crude had yet to start trading after settling up 19 cents at $67.50.\nSaudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih indicated on Saturday that its crude production would be well below the production cap as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies were committed to reducing output to bring balance and stability to the market.\nPrices were also supported by U.S. Energy Information Administration data on Thursday that showed domestic oil production dipped to 10.27 million barrels per day from 10.271 million bpd the week before.\nU.S. crude inventories are forecast to have risen by 2.7 million barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday.\nGasoline stocks are seen down by 600,000 barrels, while distillate inventories, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, were seen down 700,000 barrels.
