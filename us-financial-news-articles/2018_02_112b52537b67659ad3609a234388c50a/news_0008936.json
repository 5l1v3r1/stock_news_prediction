But these are the rumblings.” \nThe billionaire investor said markets will get some help from a healthy economy, including strong fundamentals for U.S. corporations that include the new tax benefits taking effect this year. \nThe volatility of recent weeks is cause for concern, Icahn said, adding that he doesn’t remember a two-week period as turbulent as this one. He said the problem is that too much money is flowing into the index funds, where investors don’t know what they’re actually investing in. \n“Passive investing is the bubble right now, and that’s a great danger,” he said. \nEventually, that will implode and could lead to a crisis bigger than in 2009, he added. \n“When you start using the market as a casino, that’s a huge mistake,” Icahn said.
