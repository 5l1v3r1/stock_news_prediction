The goal was Baertschi’s second in the past three games.\nThe Avalanche took their third consecutive loss since the end of their 10-game winning streak. Making matters worse for Colorado, Nathan MacKinnon, the NHL’s second-leading scorer, left with an upper-body injury.\nMacKinnon, hurt in a collision with Vancouver defenseman Alex Edler along the end boards, went to the dressing room favoring his shoulder with just over six minutes remaining in the second period.\nBo Horvat, Michael Del Zotto and Daniel Sedin also scored for the Canucks, while Chris Tanev had three assists. Gabriel Landeskog led the Avalanche with two goals, J.T. Compher supplied a single marker, and Mikko Rantanen had two assists.\nThe Canucks overcame a 3-2 second-period after squandering a 2-0 first-period lead.\n“The second period was tough, but we were able to bounce back and get the win,” Baertschi told Sportsnet.\nCanucks goaltender Jacob Markstrom stopped 27 of 30 shots for the victory. Colorado counterpart Jonathan Bernier took the loss while registering 22 saves on 26 shots. Both teams went 1-for-4 on the power play.\nHorvat put the Canucks on the scoreboard first, at 6:36 of the opening period, as he converted a pass from Tanev. The goal was a welcome relief for the Canucks after they had been shut out in two of their previous three games -- and a source of frustration for Colorado coach Jared Bednar, who had called on his team to have an energetic start.\nJust over five minutes later, Del Zotto gave the Canucks a 2-0 lead, sending a high wrist shot over Bernier from the blue line. However, the Avalanche responded with three unanswered goals in the second period.\nCompher reduced Colorado’s deficit 4:20 into the middle frame as he put in MacKinnon’s rebound after Markstrom took a shot on the shoulder and failed to cover the puck.\nLandeskog created a 2-2 tie just over two minutes later as Tyson Barrie’s wrist shot bounced in off him.\nBarrie earned an assist in his first game after missing 13 with a broken hand sustained Dec. 23.\nLandeskog gave Colorado a 3-2 lead on a power play at 15:05 of the second period. He tucked in a rebound after Rantanen’s shot hit his foot and bounced off Markstrom. Canucks winger Thomas Vanek observed the proceedings from the penalty box after committing a slashing infraction.\nVancouver’s Daniel Sedin forged a 3-3 deadlock on a power play at the two-minute mark of the third period as he put in a pass from his twin brother Henrik Sedin. The goal came as the first of two Colorado penalties expired.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-01-31T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:04:41.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
