It also reaffirmed a target of around 800 jetliner deliveries for 2018, subject to the performance of its engine manufacturers.\nAirbus is in the midst of a switchover on its best-selling A320 family to an upgraded model with new engines but has been beset by delays in engine supplies mainly from Pratt & Whitney.\nThe impact of a new problem discovered with those engines a week ago is \"under assessment,\" Airbus said.\n\"The A320neo ramp-up remains challenging and requires that the engine suppliers deliver in line with commitments,\" it added.\nThe planemaker, which competes with Boeing , reported \"good progress\" on the production of the new A350 wide-body jet and reiterated plans to reach an output of 10 a month by end-year.\nAirbus also said it had reached an agreement with European credit agencies that will allow Airbus to apply for export credits on a case by case basis.\nThe funding was suspended in 2016 when Airbus was reported to have made misleading applications, triggering a corruption probe.\nHowever, Airbus took a 117 million euro fourth-quarter charge following a settlement with German prosecutors over a corruption case linked to a fighter sale to Austria, including some 35 million euros of ongoing legal costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T08:14:55.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
