We would have less customer contact and we’d be less effective at selling more volumes out of Australia for higher prices,” he said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.\nAustralia’s conservative government wants to cut the company tax rate to 25 percent from 30 percent to make the country more competitive, following in the footsteps of the United States, where the rate has been cut to 21 percent.\nMackenzie said a lower tax rate would spur BHP to invest in more projects in Australia, small and large.\n“We have plenty of opportunities to invest in Australia. We will pursue many of them, but we will pursue more if the tax rate were lower,” he said.
