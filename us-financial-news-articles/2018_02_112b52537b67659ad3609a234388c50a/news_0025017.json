There have never been racism problems here. \n“If it happened, it is totally inappropriate. But I didn’t hear anything.” Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Clare Lovell", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T17:24:31.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
