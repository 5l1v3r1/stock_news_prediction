This sends a reply to people automatically if you're on vacation or not in the office. It's kind of hidden and isn't inside the Mail app, which makes it a little confusing. Yuriy Melnikov | EyeEm | Getty \nI recently took a week off and, to my surprise, found it harder than expected to set an out-of-office message from my iPhone. \nIf you're unfamiliar, an out-of-office message can be used to automatically tell people you aren't checking email. It's useful for when you're on vacation or out sick, for example. \nOne would think it would be an option under the iPhone's Mail settings, but it isn't. Instead, it's sort of buried off to the side. It took me longer than I thought it would to get it going, so I figured I can't be the only one with the issue. Here's how to set an out of office message from your iPhone. Open Settings then scroll down to \"Accounts & Passwords.\" Todd Haselton | CNBC This is the main settings menu on an iPhone Select the e-mail account that you want to set an automatic reply from. Todd Haselton | CNBC Choose the email account you want to use Scroll down to the bottom and tap \"Automatic Reply.\" Todd Haselton | CNBC Scroll down until you see this option Turn Automatic Reply on Todd Haselton | CNBC Turn on Automatic Reply Select how long you want the message to be on for, and then create your custom message. Turn on \"External Away Message\" to apply this to people e-mailing from outside of your company, too.
