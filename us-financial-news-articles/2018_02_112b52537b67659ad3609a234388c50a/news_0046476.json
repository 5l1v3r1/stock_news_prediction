You can be talented, but if you are lazy, than it is good for nothing. That must go hand in hand, the talents and hard work,” he said.\nThe 22-year-old Ledecka, who will also compete in the snowboard parallel giant slalom starting on Thursday, produced one of the biggest upsets of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics when she won the super-G on Saturday.\nThe victory sent Czech media into a frenzy with Ledecka’s image plastered over the front pages of newspapers and television repeating her run to a first gold among only three Olympic Alpine skiing medals for a country with a population of 10.6 million.\nLukas missed his former pupil’s medal-winning run and assumed she had won gold in her preferred sport of snowboarding.\n“My first thought was ‘Oh, have they’ve done the snowboard race already?',” Lukas said from the mountain resort of Spindleruv Mlyn, located about 150 kilometers from Prague.\n“We did it in a playful way with the kids, but we were also three times a week on that slope and Ester would then go for more with her parents. And she did both skis and snowboard,” Lukas said.\nThe coach stressed how Ledecka’s family was always there to support her and her dad Janek, a famous rock musician, learned to ski when his daughter started training.\nHer grandfather Jan Klapac - a member of the 1972 world champion Czechoslovak ice hockey team and Olympic silver medalist - also provided inspiration for Ledecka.\n“We did not expect such success. We are now sitting with my wife debating what a journey Ester has had to go through. And what effort it took,” he told CTK news agency.\nReporting by Robert Muller, Editing by Michael Kahn and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:15:07.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
