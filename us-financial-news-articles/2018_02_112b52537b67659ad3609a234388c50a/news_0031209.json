Sales rose fastest in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, up 18.5 percent, followed by the Americas, up 14 percent.\nPuma, which saw its shares tumble last month after French parent Kering said it would spin off the brand to its shareholders, on Friday announced plans to distribute a one-off dividend of 12.50 euros per share for 2017.\nPuma Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden said momentum built in 2017, along with positive feedback from consumers and retail partners, made the firm positive for 2018, predicting a 10 percent rise in sales in constant currencies.\nPuma expects 2018 EBIT of between 305 million and 325 million, up from 245 million in 2017.
