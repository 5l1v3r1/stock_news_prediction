Goalie Craig Anderson recorded 30 saves.\nTravis Zajac, Taylor Hall and Kyle Palmieri scored for the Devils, who had their three-game winning streak snapped and fell into third place in the Metropolitan Division. New Jersey is one point behind the Pittsburgh Penguins, who edged the Vegas Golden Knights, 5-4, Tuesday.\nGoalie Keith Kinkaid made 16 saves before being pulled after allowing the Senators’ fourth goal. Eddie Lack, making his Devils debut, recorded 11 saves in relief.\nThe Devils took the lead on Zajac’s goal just 1:57 after faceoff, but the Senators scored the next four goals, including the power-play tallies by Hoffman and DiDomenico on a man advantage created by a high sticking call on Palmieri.\nHoffman tied the game with 6:25 left in the period when his shot sailed under Kinkaid’s glove hand. The Senators took the lead when DiDomenico was credited with a goal after his shot glanced off Devils defenseman Sami Vatanen and floated past Kinkaid.\nDuchene scored off a no-look pass from Hoffman with 1:02 left in the first. White scored his first NHL goal and chased Kinkaid 8:43 into the second.\nThe Devils managed to pull within two goals twice in the final 29 minutes.\nHall’s slap shot from the right faceoff circle went past a screened Anderson with 9:06 left in the second. But another late goal -- on a breakaway by Smith moments after he exited the penalty box -- again extended the Senators lead to three goals with 47.5 seconds left in the period.\nPalmieri’s sizzling shot off the top post closed the gap to 5-3 with 14:48 left in the game.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:57:14.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
