The S&P 500 gained 1.41 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,825.22 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.39 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,405.10.\nIn Europe, the STOXX 600 closed down 0.5 percent and the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.62 percent.\nStretched valuations, a long overdue pullback in stocks and uncertainty over a potential shutdown of the U.S. federal government are driving a sense of caution in the market, said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York.\n“Rising interest rates don’t necessary mean a hard stop for equity prices moving higher but they do add a degree of moderation to the enthusiasm,” Kenny said.\nThe dollar, which fell 3.25 percent in January to mark its weakest monthly performance since March 2016, pared gains against the yen as stocks fell in Europe and treaded water on Wall Street.\nThe dollar has struggled as expected monetary policy tightening elsewhere in the world, along with stronger global economic growth, encouraged investors to go abroad, particularly the euro zone.\nThe dollar index fell 0.58 percent, with the euro up 0.75 percent to $1.2513. The Japanese yen weakened 0.19 percent versus the greenback at 109.39 per dollar.\nGermany’s 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, hit a more than two-year high of 0.738 percent.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 17/32 in price to yield 2.7840 percent, up from 2.72 percent late on Wednesday.\nOil rose after a survey showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ commitment to its supply cuts remains in place, even as U.S. production topped 10 million barrels per day for the first time since 1970.\nU.S. crude rose $1.07 to settle $65.80 per barrel and Brent settled up 76 cents at $69.65.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Nick Zieminski and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:05:15.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
