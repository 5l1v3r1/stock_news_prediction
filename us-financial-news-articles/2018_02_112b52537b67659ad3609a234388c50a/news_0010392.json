Even if the market did fall 10 percent, what would be a \"correction,\" in trader parlance, that wouldn't be a terrible thing for investors, Siegel said.\nThe S&P 500 added 32 percent from the November election through Thursday, so even a 10 percent decline \"isn't a disaster.\"\nLast week, Siegel told CNBC that investors got too bullish and \"overdid\" it, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average above 26,600 last month before the sell-off. In morning trading in New York on Monday the Dow shed about 83 points after falling 665 on Friday.\nSiegel said Monday that the markets are fully valued. \"I'd like a little correction to keep people honest,\" he said. But as he sees it there's \"no bear market in 2018.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T18:42:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
