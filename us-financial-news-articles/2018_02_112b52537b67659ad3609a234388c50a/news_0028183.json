REUTERS/John Sibley UPTOWN FUNK From the moment they entered the stadium to the tune of “Eye of the Tiger” and Darude’s “Sandstorm”, the North’s cheerleaders knew they had competition.\nWith the stadium reverberating to everything from Metallica to the 1999 hit “Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!” by the Vengaboys, some fans hadn’t even noticed the cheerleaders walk in.\n“Oh my god they’re coming in right next to us!” said one spectator as they filed in, carrying blue bags and followed by a scrum of photo journalists and excited onlookers.\nFrom inside their bags, the cheerleaders produced props that would accompany their chants: a unified Korean flag, some paper flowers and some masks.\n“That’s scary,” another spectator said to another as the cheerleaders put on a man’s mask in perfect unison.\nDuring an intermission, South Korean rappers Dynamic Duo took to a stage and worked up excited young South Koreans around them with a version of Mark Ronson’s “Uptown Funk”.\nLater, the North Korean cheerleaders responded by singing “We are one!”, swaying from side to side in a perfectly choreographed display of unity and discipline.\n“Today’s victory is ours!”\nAdditional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Grace Lee; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T17:56:09.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
