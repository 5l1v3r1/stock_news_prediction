It entered service in 1969 and is capable of generating about 608 megawatts of power.\nOne megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes.\nReporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:31:16.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
