It previously said it would launch five new projects this year.\nBP was added about 1 billion of barrels of oil equivalent to its reserves in 2017, the largest since 2004, thanks to six discoveries, including in Senegal and the North Sea. Its reserve replacement ratio was estimated at 143 percent for the year.\nBP’s refining and trading business, known as downstream, saw profits rise to $7 billion in 2017 as earnings for the marketing division rose by more than 10 percent.\nCash flow in the fourth quarter rose slightly to $6.2 billion but fell short of market expectations, raising concerns that cost cuts have run their course, echoing concerns about rivals Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron which reported last week.\nThe weakness was due mostly to lower than expected income from refining operations, BMO Capital Markets analyst Brendan Warn said.\nPayments for the Deepwater Horizon spill continued to weigh on BP, which took a $1.7 billion charge in the quarter due to higher-than-expected claims settlements, bringing the total legal and clean-up costs to $65 billion.\nBP also took a one-off charge of $900 million to adjust to new U.S. tax rules, although it expects a long-term boost from the lowered corporate tax rates.\nDespite the strong start to oil prices, which reached a three-year high in January, Gilvary said he expected prices to come down to $50-$55 a barrel by the end of this year.\nBP reported a $2.1 billion fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, topping forecasts for $1.9 billion, a company-provided survey of analysts showed.\nThat marked a jump from $400 million a year earlier and topped a third-quarter profit of $1.9 billion.\nOn an annual basis, BP’s profits soared to $6.2 billion from $2.6 billion in 2016.\nGearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s market value, rose to 27.4 percent at the end of 2017 from 26.8 percent at the end of 2016. Net debt was $37.8 billion, up from $35.5 billion a year earlier, after the company paid $5.4 billion related to the Deepwater Horizon spill.\nBP’s full-year capital spending reached $16.5 billion, within the annual range of $15-$17 billion it plans to maintain until 2021.\nReporting by Ron Bousso; editing by Jason Neely and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:45:23.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
