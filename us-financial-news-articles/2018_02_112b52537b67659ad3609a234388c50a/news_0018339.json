(NYSE:WAIR), one of the world's leading distributors and providers of comprehensive supply chain management services to the global aerospace industry, today announced results for its fiscal 2018 first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Highlights\nNet sales of $363.1 million, up 7.0 percent Net loss of $0.4 million, including additional tax expense of $9.1 million from enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Adjusted net income (1) of $14.5 million, or $0.15 per diluted share Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (1) (EBITDA) of $35.0 million, or 9.6 percent of net sales\nTodd Renehan, chief executive officer, said, “Results in the fiscal 2018 first quarter reflect improved sales and operating performance, consistent with the recovery in leading indicators that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in sales compared to the first quarter of last year was primarily due to new business and higher volumes on hardware and chemical contracts, and to a lesser extent, better ad-hoc sales performance. Expenses reflect investments made in the second half of fiscal 2017 and consulting costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to support improvement initiatives. While our fiscal 2018 first quarter results are promising, more work is needed to sustain and further improve our performance to-date.\n“The comprehensive business assessment that we initiated in the first quarter is progressing well. We’re very encouraged with the assessment’s findings, which reinforce our belief that significant opportunities exist to reduce costs and enhance margins. We are digging deeper into the next level of details to further validate our view of the scope, impact and timing of improvement plan initiatives, while at the same time initiating projects in several key areas. We plan to provide details of these broader initiatives and their expected financial impact in our fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings announcement.”\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Results\nNet sales of $363.1 million in the fiscal 2018 first quarter were 7.0 percent higher than the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in long-term contracts and growth in ad-hoc sales. The increase in contract sales primarily reflects new business revenue and higher hardware and chemical content. Ad-hoc sales growth was primarily due to improved service performance and growth at key customers.\nGross profit was $94.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $89.5 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter. Gross margin was 26.0 percent in the fiscal 2018 first quarter, compared with 26.4 percent in the same period last year. The lower gross margin primarily reflects a decline in chemical margins and a slightly negative impact from mix.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses totaled $69.9 million in the fiscal 2018 first quarter compared with $63.2 million in the same period last year. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to investments made in the second half of fiscal 2017 to stabilize the business and support growth, as well as higher consulting costs in the fiscal 2018 first quarter associated with the company’s improvement initiatives. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 19.2 percent in the fiscal 2018 first quarter, compared with 18.6 percent in the same period last year.\nIncome from operations totaled $24.6 million, or 6.8 percent of net sales, in the fiscal 2018 first quarter, compared with $26.3 million, or 7.7 percent of net sales, in the same period last year. The decline in operating income reflects higher SG&A expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit.\nThe company's effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 includes additional tax expense of $9.1 million associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the period. Excluding this expense, the company’s effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 is expected to be approximately 28-29 percent.\nNet loss was $0.4 million in the fiscal 2018 first quarter, essentially break-even on a per-share basis. This compares with net income of $13.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Adjusted net income (1) was $14.5 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared with $18.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $35.0 million, compared with $34.3 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) was 9.6 percent, compared with 10.1 percent in the same period last year.\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled $29.9 million in the fiscal 2018 first quarter compared with $28.1 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow was negative $31.2 million in the fiscal 2018 first quarter, compared with negative free cash flow of $29.4 million in the same period last year.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nThe company continues to target a low single-digit percentage increase in net sales year-over-year in fiscal 2018, as well as a low double-digit percentage increase in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year in fiscal 2018. The company also continues to expect that it will end the fiscal year at an adjusted EBITDA margin run-rate of more than 10 percent.\nConference Call Information\nWesco Aircraft will hold a conference call to discuss its fiscal 2018 first quarter results at 2:00 p.m. PST (5:00 p.m. EST) today, February 8, 2018.

Wesco Aircraft believes these metrics are used in the financial community, and the company presents these metrics to enhance understanding of its operating performance. Readers should not consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income as alternatives to net (loss) income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. See the tables following this press release for reconciliations of adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements (including within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc.
