It also had 166 million euros in legal costs. \nMonte dei Paschi, which lost 3.2 billion euros in 2016, is targetting a 570 million euro profit in 2019 under a restructuring plan agreed with the European Commission to gain a green light to the bailout. \nThe bank, which last year cut its loans to customers by one fifth, said revenues dropped 6 percent and its operating loss increased 40 percent. \nIt managed to cut operating costs by 3 percent. $1 = 0.8189 euros Reporting by Valentina Za; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T21:59:55.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
