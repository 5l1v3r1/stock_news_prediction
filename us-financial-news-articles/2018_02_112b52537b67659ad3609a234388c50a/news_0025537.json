If any wrongdoing is found we will take fast and decisive action and do everything possible to prevent future misconduct.” \nLast week, Greek prosecutors referred the case to parliament. The house will decide whether to investigate if conservative and socialist politicians are found to have been involved in alleged bribes by Novartis to doctors and public officials. \nPoliticians, who have been named in parliament, have strongly denied the allegations, calling the claims a fabrication and a witchhunt by Tsipras’ leftist-led government seeking to discredit them, a little over a year before scheduled elections in the country. \nAt least 30 Greek lawmakers need to formally ask for a parliamentary committee to take up the case. Tsipras’ Syriza party is in favour of such a probe. \n“We will do everything we can to reveal the truth,” Tsipras told his Syriza party lawmakers in parliament. “Nothing will stay secret, nothing under the carpet.” \nTsipras, in charge since the height of Greece’s financial crisis in 2015, has promised to crack down on corruption which he often blames on his predecessors. His party is trailing conservative New Democracy in opinion polls. \nGreek prosecutors have been conducting an inquiry for more than a year, in which a number of individuals testified under a witness protection scheme. According to court officials, their investigation into the role of non-politicians is ongoing. \nNovartis said in its statement that publicity surrounding the case, “appears driven in large part by the selective leaking of portions of a confidential and preliminary investigative file.” \nThe company also said there were “many sensational and unfounded claims in a politicised debate.” \nNovartis has faced other investigations in recent years. Last year, for example, it was fined $49 million (35.36 million pounds) by South Korea for offering doctors kickbacks. \nAdditionally, a separate federal U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against Novartis is ongoing.
