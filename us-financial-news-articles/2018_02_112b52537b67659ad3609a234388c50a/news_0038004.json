Let me do the necessary studies,'” said Franco.\n“This operator is coming with its investment and its taking the risk,” he added.\nPemex will not have to contribute funding for the project for at least the first three years.\nThe CNH’s governing body voted unanimously to approve the exploration plan.\nReporting by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Diane Craft and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T01:56:02.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
