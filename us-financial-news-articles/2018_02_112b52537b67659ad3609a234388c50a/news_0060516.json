Ross has said he expects countries will challenge any steel tariffs at the World Trade Organization.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Among the options before Trump is a tariff of at least 24 percent on steel products from all countries. However, Trump could decide to exempt some countries from any measures, including NAFTA trading partners like Canada and Mexico.\nCanada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in July that Trump told him that he did not expect to subject Canadian steel and aluminum to tariffs on national security grounds.\nThere are concerns that stiff U.S. tariffs could raise global steel prices, which would impact Mexico. While Mexico is a large steel importer, it also exported approximately 4.5 million tonnes in 2016.\nMeanwhile, Steve Verheul, Canada’s chief negotiator in the NAFTA talks, told reporters some headway was being made.\n“We’re making reasonably good progress so far,” he said, without elaborating.\nU.S. trade officials met with auto industry executives in Washington on Tuesday to make progress on a major sticking point around vehicle production. [nL2N1QH1W1]\nThe U.S. negotiator handling rules of origin for automobiles unexpectedly returned to Washington for consultations earlier this week. It was still not clear why.\nPeople familiar with the matter said representatives from the office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer had met separately with executives from Ford ( F.N ) and General Motors ( GM.N ) on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe GM meeting lasted less than an hour and was routine. No major breakthroughs or policy changes were discussed, according to one source briefed on the meetings.\nReporting by Lesley Wroughton, Dave Graham and Sharay Angulo; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T21:13:55.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
