A fair amount of the copper in those locations comes from local producers and a large amount is Latin America production, which would previously have gone to China.”\nLatin America is a major producer of Sx-Ew copper, which uses solvent extraction and electrowinning, and for which demand is soft as consumers in China prefer ER - electro-refined - copper. China accounts for nearly half of global demand for refined copper, estimated at around 23 million tonnes this year.\n“Players in the Chinese market have always preferred ER to Sx-Ew cathode,” said Eleni Joannides, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Certainly during 2017, the ER cathode market in China was more liquid compared with Sx-Ew cathode. That could be one factor behind the higher demand for ER over Sx-Ew now.”\nSome sources say COMEX warehouse rents for copper at around $10 a ton a month, or assuming a 30-day month about 33 U.S. cents a day, are an incentive as the average for warehouses approved by the LME is around 51 cents a day per ton.\n“That is a superficial comparison, there are so many other costs to take into account - labor costs, charges for loading, unloading and cancellation charges,” a copper trader said.\n(GRAPHIC - US copper imports vs Comex copper stocks: reut.rs/2sLC4YM )\n(GRAPHIC - US copper premiums: reut.rs/2EVeNbF )\n(GRAPHIC - Comex copper stocks: reut.rs/2sLLeVg )\n(GRAPHIC - Copper stocks in LME and COMEX warehouses: reut.rs/2EXBvjB )\nReporting by Pratima Desai, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://reut.rs/2EXBvjB", "http://reut.rs/2sLLeVg", "http://reut.rs/2sLC4YM", "http://reut.rs/2EVeNbF", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:42:09.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
