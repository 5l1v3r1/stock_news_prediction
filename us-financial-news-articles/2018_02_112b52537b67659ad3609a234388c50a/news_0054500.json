The new charges come two days after an attorney pleaded guilty to lying about his contact with Mr. Gates.\n“Paul Manafort is innocent of the allegations set out in the newly filed indictments and he is confident that he will be acquitted of all charges,” said Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Mr. Manafort. “The new allegations against Mr. Manafort, once again, have nothing to do with Russia and 2016 election interference/collusion.”\nRepresentatives for Mr. Gates couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. A new lawyer for Mr. Gates entered an appearance in court on Thursday while his old lawyers are withdrawing, a sign that he may be planning to change his legal strategy.\nThursday’s charges raise questions about whether Mr. Gates is poised to reach an imminent plea deal with Mr. Mueller, as some recent developments had suggested. They follow the basic outline of some of the earlier charges against Messrs. Manafort and Gates but add details and turn up the pressure on the pair, suggesting Mr. Mueller is pursuing them aggressively.\nMr. Manafort, a former chairman of the Trump campaign who did extensive work in Ukraine, appears to be a particular target of Mr. Mueller. Mr. Gates served as Mr. Manafort’s “right-hand man” in his business endeavors, the new indictment said, and accompanied him to the Trump campaign.\nThe new charges add to an October indictment against Messrs. Gates and Manafort, obtained in Washington, D.C., that accused the pair of laundering millions of dollars and failing to file reports on foreign bank accounts and lobbying work. It relates to their work for the Ukrainian government, which predated the campaign. The two men have pleaded not guilty in that case.\nLike the previous charges, the new indictment doesn’t allege any offenses connected to the Trump campaign but rather focuses on Mr. Manafort’s business dealings.\nRelated Video When it comes to the Russia investigation, the word ‘collusion’ gets thrown around a lot.

Newsletter Sign-up The new indictment is filed in Virginia, where Messrs. Manafort and Gates prepared their tax returns, while the earlier charges are being handled in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors said they sought a consolidated case, but the defendants refused.\nThe new indictment charges Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates of lying on their tax returns between 2010 and 2014. The two generated “tens of millions of dollars in income” through their work for the government of Ukraine and former President Viktor Yanukovych between 2006 and 2015 and didn’t properly report it, prosecutors said.\nThe October indictment described an alleged scheme to bring millions of dollars of foreign income into the U.S. to pay for a “lavish lifestyle” including pricey rugs, cars and clothing.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Mueller’s office outlined a separate alleged scheme, between 2015 through “at least January 2017”—a period that includes the pair’s time in the Trump campaign—in which the two used Mr. Manafort’s properties as collateral to “fraudulently” obtain more than $20 million in loans by falsely inflating Mr. Manafort’s and his company’s income.\nThey “submitted fabricated profit and loss statements,” the indictment said, charging both with eight new counts of bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy charges.\nThey began fabricating documents in the U.S., the indictment said, around 2015, because their Ukraine income dwindled after Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia. In order to sustain their lifestyle, they sought to take out mortgages on U.S. properties but had to fraudulently inflate Mr. Manafort’s income to secure those loans from U.S. financial institutions, according to the new charges.\nMore Capital Journal: Russia’s Real Goal Facebook Battles New Criticism After U.S. Indictment Against Russians Russians Charged With Interfering in U.S. Election Among the alleged lies, Mr. Manafort “falsely represented” to the lender that he didn’t make more than 50% of his income outside the U.S., and told another lender that he wasn’t renting out another property on which he sought a mortgage, even though he was, prosecutors said.\nMr. Manafort, with Mr. Gates’s help, also applied for loans with falsified documents, including for multiple properties in New York, the indictment said. In 2016, for example Mr. Gates allegedly provided Mr. Manafort a fake invoice for $2.4 million for “[s]ervices rendered per the consultancy agreement pertaining to the parliamentary elections.” That loan application was denied, the indictment said. The pair sought another loan by overstating their firm’s income by more than $4 million, the indictment said.\nThey did that by doctoring a statement in October 2016 showing a $600,000 loss to add more than $3.5 million in income, prosecutors said.\nThe pair used that statement to seek a loan between July 2016 and January 2017, and secured $16 million in two loans from the lender, the indictment said.\nIn March 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Manafort had received $16 million from Federal Savings Bank, a small bank in Chicago run by former Trump adviser Steve Calk. The loans equaled almost 24% of the bank’s reported $67 million equity capital, the Journal reported.\nOn Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York are examining those loans and whether they were made as part of a quid pro quo arrangement.\nIn a court filing seeking to contest a bail package proposed by Mr. Manafort, prosecutors wrote in a document unsealed last week that they had uncovered additional evidence of crimes committed by the political consultant.\n“The criminal conducts includes a series of bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies,” the prosecutors wrote, “including criminal conduct that we have learned since the Court’s initial bail determination.”\nProsecutors said they had obtained “substantial evidence” that Mr. Manafort secured a mortgage for a house in Virginia through “a series of false and fraudulent representations” to Federal Savings Bank.\n—Del Quentin Wilber and Michael Rothfeld contributed to this article.\nWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T00:10:45.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
