Last December, Previ acquired shares of state-owned oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s fuel distributor, Petrobras Distribuidora SA, when it floated on the local exchange. \nShareholders in power holding company Neoenergia SA , which include Previ, were sticking to plans to list it after it canceled its IPO in December because the shareholders considered its pricing too low, said Genso. \n“We will try to list Neoenergia in a better moment,” he said.
