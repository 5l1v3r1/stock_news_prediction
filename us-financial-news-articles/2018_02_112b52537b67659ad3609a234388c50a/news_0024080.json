A return of risk appetite hurt the U.S. currency and helped higher-yielding emerging market currencies as well as commodity-linked currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars.\nVolatility picked up, with the major indexes on Wall Street climbing more than 1 percent shortly after the open, paring about half the advance to once again rise more than 1 percent.\nMSCI’s all-country world index of stock performance in 47 countries rose 0.95 percent, led by Apple Inc and Amazon.com.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.33 percent while MSCI’s gauge of emerging market stocks rose 0.92 percent.\nA major shift in outlook is taking place that involves the reallocation across different areas and sectors of the market, said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York.\n“We’re at an inflection point in the market,” Kenny said. “It’s very significant for a lot of reasons. It involves fear of inflation, a long overdue and much-anticipated pullback, and it involves elevated equity valuations,” he said.\nMen exchange greetings in front of an electronic board displaying the Nikkei average outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan January 4, 2018.
