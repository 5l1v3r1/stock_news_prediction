We will get benefit if we buy from Iran ... We will boost oil imports from Iran compared to this fiscal year,” Pradhan told reporters, without elaborating.\nIran, which used to be the second-biggest oil supplier to India before sanctions, is gradually raising its market share in the world’s third-biggest oil consuming nation.\nIn 2017, Iraq for the first time emerged as the top supplier to India on an annual basis, while Saudi Arabia slipped to second position.\nThe freight discount offered by Iran will translate to a discount of up to $1 a barrel, one of the sources told Reuters.\nPradhan said India had also sought a stake in Iran’s South Azadegan oil field. He said Tehran had not made any commitment on India’s request, but was willing to show data on some fields to an Indian delegation next week in Tehran.\nIndia recently offered a development plan worth about $6 billion for Farzad B and sought gas pricing of about $4 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) to earn double-digit returns.\nSince local gas prices in Iran are about $2.1 per mmBtu, India has asked for a stake in a producing oil field in Iran in addition to Farzad B to improve its average return on investment.\n“I am very optimistic about the future of the relationship between the two countries and our companies, especially for developing oil and gas fields,” Zanganeh said.\nReporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by David Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T01:55:57.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
