In one nationwide contest, Scottrade allegedly offered $285,000 in incentives to win and retain clients. \n\"Scottrade failed to develop and implement policies and procedures to segregate retirement assets from the scope...of the sales contest,\" the filing stated, and thus failed to comply with the Fiduciary Rule. \nAmong other actions, Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin is calling for Scottrade to return profits it earned from the alleged activities, and is seeking an undisclosed administrative fine. \nA spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade , which acquired Scottrade in September 2017, declined to comment.
