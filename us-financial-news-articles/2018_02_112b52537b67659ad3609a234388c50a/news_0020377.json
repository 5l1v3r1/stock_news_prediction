He told lawmakers at parliament that Bompard was due to meet Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud by the end of this week.\nReporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Leigh Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T06:06:26.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
