He said he was feeling well but tired out by choosing candidates for the election.\n“HE BUILT AN EMPIRE”\nFILE PHOTO: Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is seen during the television talk show \"L'aria che tira\" in Rome, Italy, January 18, 2018. REUTERS/Remo Casilli/File Photo Berlusconi’s continued appeal to part of the electorate, borne out in poll scores of roughly 16 percent for Forza Italia, often bewilders non-Italians.\nBut for some voters, his old age and the fact he is already rich removes the suspicion that he is in politics for personal gain, a common fear in a country where corruption thrives.\n“If I were him, with all his money, I’d be lazing about,” said supporter Antonio D‘Arcangelis, 53, a now jobless former state employee. “He must be doing it because he believes in it.”\nMany of his fans are attracted by the business acumen that made him a billionaire. He made his first big money in Milan real estate development, then founded Italy’s biggest private broadcaster and owned AC Milan soccer club for more than 30 years.\n“We are putting our hope in a self-made man who built an empire,” said Giuseppe Bracciale, a 52-year-old cook from Torre del Greco in southern Italy, who plans to vote for Forza Italia.\nPromises to cut taxes and raise pensions, long the core of Berlusconi’s campaigns, still resonate with many in Italy, where a modest economic recovery has not stopped a rise in poverty or brought unemployment down to the European Union average.\n“We have hit rock-bottom,” said Bracciale. Berlusconi “is the only one who can help us get out of this situation.”\nThe center-right’s key proposal is a flat tax -- a policy Berlusconi has repeatedly floated since entering politics in 1994, but never managed to implement despite spending more than nine years in power between 1994 and 2011.\nOther concerns have taken over for some former voters, most notably the question of mass immigration which has become the predominant campaign issue for the League.\n“A good chunk of the voters Berlusconi lost have been loaned to the League because today Berlusconi voters, that fearful middle class, are more afraid for their personal security than their economic security,” said Marco Valbruzzi of the Cattaneo Institute research firm.\n“They prefer a tougher message, which they get from (League leader Matteo) Salvini,” Valbruzzi said.\nWhereas in the last parliamentary election in 2013, the League took four percent of the vote, polls predict it could win 14 percent next month, within striking distance of Forza Italia.\nBerlusconi resigned as prime minister at the height of the 2011 debt crisis -- a humiliating retreat that most commentators at the time assumed marked the end of his political career.\nThe perma-tanned leader has always accused hostile European politicians of plotting his downfall, and diehard supporters argue that he deserves another chance to secure his legacy.\nOthers say he has already had his time in the sun and believe it is time for someone else to take charge.\n“I used to love Berlusconi because he made me feel safe. I was young when he first started campaigning. He already had AC Milan, he had his own money. Then I felt unsafe when he gave up. He ran away, abandoned people,” said Alessandra Ciancolini, a 37 year-old from Rome, who works in an antiques shop.\n“He got things moving, but he didn’t see it through. If he comes back, the problems are still the ones he left behind, they’ve only got worse.”\nAdditional reporting by Gavin Jones; Editing by Phil Pullella and Philippa Fletcher\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:41:52.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
