The government, meanwhile, pushed for the vote to be as soon as March 8. \nA compromise had been reached for the election to be held on April 22, the Dominican president said, before the talks broke down and the government delegation left on Tuesday night. \n“Talks have entered a sort of indefinite recess ... No conflict in the world has been resolved without dialogue,” said Medina, who had been hosting meetings with delegations in the Caribbean nation and urged them to return to the table. \nOpponents say the government is rigging the vote in advance by barring Maduro’s strongest rivals - opposition leaders Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles - and failing to reform a compliant national election board.
