The risk of shortages increased when Canada shut a research reactor in 2016.\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said supply disruptions, and even the threat of disruptions, have pushed clinicians to shift to alternative isotopes \"that may be more expensive or may expose patients to higher doses of radiation.\"\nChip East | Reuters Scott Gottlieb NorthStar said that by late 2019 it expects to have the ability to supply around 10 percent of the U.S. market.\nThat would \"very significantly mitigate the impact of the type of shortages we have been seeing recently,\" a company official said. It plans to ramp-up production capacity over the next few years in a bid to meet two-thirds of U.S. demand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T14:49:14.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
