Farmers also benefited as some of the profits from the schemes moved upstream and so they were not willing to work with grain exporters directly.\n“The grey schemes had the competitive advantage,” another trader said.\nFirms suspected of involvement in the tax wheeze were squeezed out of the supply chain after the crackdown and lost their business as most traders now buy directly from farmers.\nPre-tax margins have risen to about $5-6 per tonne, while net margins climbed to $2-3 per tonne due to the initiative, several traders said. They were negative before the crackdown due to Russia’s large crop, one of the traders said.\nA German trader said pre-tax margins of $1 to $2 a tonne were normal on export business from Germany and other western European countries.
