The lawsuit was filed the day after ballots went out to some 8,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who vote on the Oscar winners.\nThe lawsuit, filed by Zindel’s son David, listed more than 60 resemblances between the play “Let Me Hear You Whisper,” and “The Shape of Water.”\nThey include the play and the movie’s basic story of the lonely janitor who works at a scientific laboratory during the Cold War, forms a loving bond with a captive aquatic creature and hatches a plan to liberate it.\nIn the Zindel play, the creature is a dolphin. In the movie, it is a half-man, half-river creature.\nThe lawsuit said that despite “the glaring similarities between the play and the obviously derivative picture, defendants never bothered to seek or obtain a customary license” for the rights to Zindel’s play, nor credit him.\nFox Searchlight denied the claims as “baseless (and) wholly without merit.”\nThe studio said in a statement that the lawsuit seemed timed “to coincide with the Academy Award voting cycle in order to pressure our studio to quickly settle. Instead, we will vigorously defend ourselves and, by extension, this groundbreaking and original film.”\nThe lawsuit cited interviews given by Kraus and del Toro in which they said Kraus, an American novelist, came up with the storyline about a janitor who kidnaps an amphibian.\nIt alleged that Kraus was aware of Zindel and his play, which was produced for television in 1969 and again in 1990.\nNew York-based Zindel, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1964 play “The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds,” died in 2003.\n“The Shape of Water” has already won a best picture Golden Globe and numerous acting and craft awards from film critics’ groups in the United States and elsewhere.\nReporting by Jill Serjeant, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T03:40:15.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
