The practice should be banned for defined benefit pension transfer advice, they said.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “To propose, as the Financial Conduct Authority did in July last year, abandoning the advisor presumption against transferring out of a gold-plated, stable, indexed pension scheme: it really makes you wonder whose side they’re on,” committee chair Frank Field said in a statement.\nA surge in interest in the steelworker pensions began in April last year but the FCA, which regulates advisers, did not begin acting until November, just ahead of the deadline, the report said.\nThe FCA said it has taken “detailed, extensive and robust action” to help the steelworkers.\n“We are also reviewing the rules that apply to firms advising on pension transfers, and will consider this report as part of this,” the watchdog said.\nPENSION REGULATOR CRITICIZED Lawmakers also criticized the Pensions Regulator, which oversees schemes, saying it should have seen this “rip-off coming” and should review the information given to people faced with pension decisions.\nThe Pensions Regulator said it helped to tackle unscrupulous advisers and fulfilled its primary role in evaluating and approving the complex restructuring of the British Steel pension scheme to prevent the company becoming insolvent.\n“We believe this was the best possible outcome for everyone involved in what was a very challenging situation, bringing greater certainty for thousands of scheme members,” it said.\nThe report calls on the government to change pension rules so that pots are transferred to a new company scheme by default if it offers better benefits than a pensions lifeboat.\nThe committee said it will also produce a separate report on broader pension freedom and choice issues raised by the steelworkers’ case.\nSome 50 billion pounds has been transferred from direct benefit pension schemes between the start of the pension freedom reform in April 2015 and May 2017.\nReporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Kirsten Donovan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T21:02:19.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
