They were trading down 18 percent at 269.5 pence at 0937 GMT.\nChief Executive Mark Lewis, who joined the company from retailer John Lewis in March 2017, said he wanted to make its price comparisons easier, quicker and simpler.\n“Our goal is to offer our customers ways to save that they didn’t know existed and to do so in a way that is as effortless as we can make it,” he said.\nMoneysupermarket, like its rivals Comparethemarket.com, Gocompare.com and Confused.com, spends heavily on marketing to help attract and retain customers.\nIts advertising campaigns, which use the strap line ”You’re so Moneysupermarket,“ featured 1980s children’s characters ”He-Man“ and Skeletor” last year.\nAnalyst Ian Whittaker at Liberum, who has a “hold” rating on the shares, said he expected a 10 percent downgrade to 2018 consensus estimates.\n“While the new strategy does make sense, it highlights the fundamental issue, i.e. that barriers in price comparison websites are low, although Moneysupermarket’s new strategy is looking to address that,” he said.\nHedge funds missed out on the profits to be gained from Thursday’s share fall, with just 5,617 shares out on loan, or 0.001 percent, according to data from FIS’ Astec Analytics.\nThe company reported a 5 percent rise in core earnings to 127.2 million pounds on revenue of 329.7 million pounds, up 4 percent, for 2017.\n($1 = 0.7198 pounds)\nReporting by Paul Sandle and Maiya Keidan; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T15:08:25.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
