BREXIT TARIFFS? \nWhile May has repeatedly said that Britain will leave the customs union, some ministers had hoped that Britain could remain in some sort of bespoke customs arrangement with the EU after Brexit. \nBut supporters of Brexit say one of the main benefits of leaving the bloc will be the ability to strike trade deals with other, faster-growing countries around the world. \nThe Confederation of British Industry has called for Britain to stay in a customs union and finance minister Philip Hammond last month also left open the possibility of Britain joining a new customs union. \nA customs union means that its members apply the same tariff to goods imported into their territory from elsewhere and apply no tariffs to goods from other members. It also limits checks and other bureaucracies at borders between members. \nUnless Britain negotiates a new trade deal with the EU, its exports would run into the union’s external tariffs, which average about 5 percent across all goods, including 10 percent for cars and over 200 percent on certain types of poultry. \nBut May is under pressure from eurosceptic members in her party to quit the trading arrangement because for them the key prize is chance to sign new trade deals with other nations such as the U.S., China and India. \nBritain and the EU are due to hold their first formal discussions about what their future relationship will look like after Britain leaves the EU this week. \nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will meet his opposite number, Brexit Secretary David Davis, in London on Monday for the first time since EU leaders told Barnier to negotiate a post-Brexit transition period to ease Britain’s departure. \nMay will hold two cabinet meetings on Wednesday and Thursday at which she will try to heal the deep divisions among her ministers over the best way to leave the EU. \nIf no deal is reached by October of this year, many businesses fear Britain could face a disorderly exit that would weaken the West, disrupt the peace in Northern Ireland, imperil Britain’s $2.7 trillion economy and undermine London’s position as the only financial center to rival New York. \nA disorderly Brexit as a result of Britain misjudging the “self-preservation” instincts of the European Union could lead to a further downgrade of the UK’s sovereign credit rating, S&P Global also said on Monday.
