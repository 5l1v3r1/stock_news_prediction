Quart, Pharm.D., Chief Executive Officer of Heron. “2018 should be an equally exciting year as we look forward to reporting top-line pivotal Phase 3 data and filing an NDA for HTX-011, while continuing to ramp up net product sales for our CINV franchise.”\nFinancial Results\nNet product sales of SUSTOL for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $10.1 million and $30.8 million, respectively.

By delivering sustained levels of both a potent anesthetic and a local anti-inflammatory agent directly to the site of tissue injury, HTX-011 was designed to deliver superior pain relief while reducing the need for systemically administered pain medications such as opioids, which carry the risk of harmful side effects, abuse and addiction. The Phase 2 development program for HTX-011 was designed to target the many patients undergoing a wide range of surgeries who experience significant postoperative pain. Heron completed enrollment in its two pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies in bunionectomy and hernia repair and anticipates reporting top-line results in the first half of 2018 and expects to file an NDA with the FDA in the second half of 2018.\nAbout CINVANTI (aprepitant) injectable emulsion\nCINVANTI is indicated in adults, in combination with other antiemetic agents, for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC) including high-dose cisplatin and nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC). CINVANTI is an intravenous formulation of aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK 1 ) receptor antagonist. CINVANTI is the first intravenous (IV) formulation to directly deliver aprepitant, the active ingredient in EMEND ® capsules. Aprepitant (including its prodrug, fosaprepitant) is the only single-agent NK 1 receptor antagonist to significantly reduce CINV in both the acute phase (0 – 24 hours after chemotherapy) and the delayed phase (24 – 120 hours after chemotherapy). CINVANTI does not contain polysorbate 80 or any other synthetic surfactant. Pharmaceutical formulations containing polysorbate 80 have been linked to hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and irritation of blood vessels resulting in infusion-site pain. FDA-approved dosing administration included in the United States prescribing information for CINVANTI is a 30-minute infusion.\nPlease see Full Prescribing Information at www.CINVANTI.com .\nAbout SUSTOL (granisetron) extended-release injection\nSUSTOL is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens.
