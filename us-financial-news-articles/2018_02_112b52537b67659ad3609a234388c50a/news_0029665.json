The insurers then use a group annuity to make regular payments to the retirees who are entitled to benefits under those pensions.\nChanges to the U.S. tax code resulted in a $298 million hit to adjusted earnings, the company said.\nTotal adjusted revenue rose to $15.4 million from $15.3 million.\nIn December, MetLife said it had failed to make pension payments to thousands of workers. On Jan. 29, MetLife said its group annuity reserves fell short because of a “material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.”\nThe company said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the matter and said it was delaying its quarterly results to account for the reserve build.
