No African nation has ever competed in an Olympic bobsled event.\n“Representing Nigeria and Africa is an honor, it is so humbling,” Adigun, the driver, told a news conference in the southern commercial capital, Lagos, attended by around 100 people.\nThe journey to South Korea began in a Texas garage in 2014, where Adigun, born in the United States to Nigerian parents, made her dream start to take shape by hammering together a makeshift sled out of wood and scraps that she named the “Mayflower”.\nA former sprinter who competed in 100 meters hurdles for Nigeria at the 2012 London Olympic Games, Adigun developed a love for bobsleigh as a brakewoman in the U.S. bobsled program.\nNigerian Women's Bobsled Team Ngozi Onwumere, Akuoma Omeoga and Seun Adigun gesture in a bobsled upon their arrival in Lagos, Nigeria, as part of preparations ahead of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games, February 1, 2018.

Adigun said the comparison was a compliment.\n“It is an honor because these are men who started something that was impactful and even 30 years later, to know that we can be put in that same type of legendary pedestal is amazing,” she said.\nThe team split their time between training and fund-raising. Adigun has previously estimated that the Olympic bid will cost about $150,000.\nThey covered their costs through a combination of fund-raising efforts that included boot camps, dances, a crowd-funding website and sponsorship by Team VISA, which has backed 52 athletes from 20 countries in 15 sports.\nWriting by Alexis Akwagyiram, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T00:13:15.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
