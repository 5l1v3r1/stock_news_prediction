We’re considering it.” \nPaswan said the government expects sugar production to jump to 24.9 million tonnes in the ongoing 2017/18 marketing year, which would be 23 percent higher than the 20.2 million tonnes in 2016/17. \nThe Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), whose production estimates typically differ from the government‘s, has projected output of 26.1 million tonnes this season. \nLocal consumption is expected to be around 25 million tonnes, which means around 1 million tonnes can be exported, according to the ISMA. That could further weigh on international prices, which have fallen about 8 percent in the past three months. \nThe jump in production and the resulting fall in prices have also forced states such as Maharashtra, India’s second-biggest sugar producer, to consider directly buying big chunks of its output. \nThe moves could help prop up shares of companies such as Shree Renuka Sugars, Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Simbhaoli Sugars. \nSugar production swings wildly in India, where half of the country’s farmland depends on the June to September monsoon rains for water because of a lack of irrigation. Sugar cane is very water-intensive. Writing by Krishna N.
