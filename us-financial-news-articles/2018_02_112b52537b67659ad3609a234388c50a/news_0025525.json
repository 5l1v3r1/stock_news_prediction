The billionaire, who said he had not read the current infrastructure bill in full, was particularly critical of a provision in the White House plan that would streamline the environmental permitting process to accommodate a wide range of infrastructure projects.\n\"Getting rid of environmental protections that ensure people's health and longevity. Is that a good investment?\" he asked. \"That doesn't sound like a good investment to me.\" Instead, Steyer said he would like to see a bipartisan infrastructure bill that massively upgrades the nation's power grid as well as improves broadband internet access.\nThe infrastructure bill \"has to be sustainable,\" he said. \"We've got to build a clean infrastructure that will let this country compete successfully for decades to come and be the source of innovation and job creation that we've always been.\"\nSteyer, founder and president of NextGen America, launched a digital petition in October calling for Trump's impeachment. It's been signed by nearly 4 million people, according to the petition website.\nLast month, Steyer also said he would push $30 million into an effort to boost millennial voter turnout in this year's midterm elections to help Democrats take over the House .\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
