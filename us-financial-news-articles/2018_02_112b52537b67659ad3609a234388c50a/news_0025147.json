U.S. shares come in next, followed by those in emerging markets, while European shares have suffered least. \nHere is a snapshot of global markets’ performance since Jan. 29: \nGlobal markets change since Jan 29 - reut.rs/2BkbB7k BETS ON EXTENDED CALM BURNED \nThe VIX index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, saw its biggest one-day spike higher, forcing an implosion of products that bet on an extended period of calm. \nAs the graphic that follows shows, exchange-traded products (ETPs) that bet on low volatility all took massive hits. \nVolatility seismograph - reut.rs/2BjQK3X \nCredit Suisse said on Tuesday it will shutter the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN, likely leaving holders with just pennies on the dollar. \nNomura Securities will redeem its Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed S&P 500 Vix Inverse ETN after a sharp equity selloff since late last week triggered a massive loss in the product. \nProshares says its short VIX short-term futures ETF will be open for trading on Tuesday and it expects normal operations going forward. EXPLOSION CONTAINED \nThe spike in the VIX index has been far in excess of that seen in volatility indexes that track other assets such as currencies, gold and bonds. \nExplosion contained - reut.rs/2BPKF0w THE TRIGGER \nAnalysts say the huge spike in the VIX index was due to a rise in bond yields, on fears that central banks may start raising interest rates sooner as inflation picks up. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury is close to a four-year high of 2.885 percent, while J.P. Morgan’s Global Bond Index has fallen to its lowest in four years. Both moves have also sparked a debate over whether a bull market in bonds is coming to an end. \nShort volatility products take massive hit - reut.rs/2BSNCgG THE OUTLOOK \nSo is this the end of the global equity bull run? Analysts say economic fundamentals remain strong. Citi’s Economic Surprise Index for the Group of 10 countries remains in strongly positive territory. A positive reading for the index suggests that economic releases have on balance been beating consensus. \nG10 Economic Surprises - reut.rs/2BMWFzC", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T01:55:18.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
