He dropped a shot on the 13th but gains on the 15th and 17th took him clear of the field. \n“I did well for the last two days, I only missed a couple of shots to put myself in the top position,” Meesawat said. \n”Very happy to finish first but still a lot of golf for tomorrow and I think it’s going to be good fun. \n“It (a win) means a lot. I‘m going to earn my European Tour card and it’s going to be the first win for me on the European Tour.” \nThere was a nine-man playoff for the final eight spots with Italian Andrea Pavan, South Korean Yikeun Chang, Australian Callan O‘Reilly and Thai Poom Saksansin all progressing with pars at the 18th. \nSouth African Zander Lombard, Australian Stephen Leaney and Japanese Satoshi Kodaira also secured their spots with pars before Thai Kiradech Aphibarnrat edged out Anthony Quayle of Australia in a sudden-death battle.
