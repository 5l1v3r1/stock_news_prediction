The United States, the United Nations and former colonial ruler Britain strongly criticized the government’s censorship.\nThe government ignored a court order issued on Thursday to restore the stations, prompting activist Okiya Omtatah to file a case seeking the arrest of officials for contempt of court on Monday.\nAlso on Monday, police teargassed demonstrators demanding the stations reopen as they tried to march on government offices.\nIt was unclear why the government switched back on the transmitters. A spokesman for the government was not available for comment.\n“There’s been no form of communication from the government,” said Larry Madowo of NTV, which resumed broadcasting on pay-to-view channels although its free-to-air channel, which uses different transmitters, was still off. KTN News was back on its free-to-air channel.\nMadowo noted the transmitters for Citizen TV were in a different place, which might explain the delay.\nPOLITICAL PROBLEMS Odinga’s symbolic inauguration in the heart of the capital of East Africa’s wealthiest economy was intended as a direct challenge to Kenyatta. Odinga insists he, not Kenyatta, was the true winner of a disputed presidential election last August.\nThe Supreme Court later nullified the August election on procedural grounds and Kenyatta won a repeat poll in October after Odinga boycotted it, claiming it would not be fair.\nSince the symbolic inauguration, Odinga and his supporters have repeatedly promised to outline their next step, only to postpone the unveiling of their plan.\nMost of their statements have focused on the brief detention of three opposition politicians who took part in Odinga’s ceremony, which occurred peacefully after the government withdrew police from the site.\nAround 100 people were killed during the protracted election season, most of them Odinga supporters shot by the police.\nOdinga supporters say they are angered by police impunity, persistent government corruption and the perceived neglect of large swathes of the country by the central government.\nAdditional reporting by Humphrey Malalo; Writing by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T14:53:39.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
