(NASDAQ: DLHC) (\"DLH\" or the \"Company\"), a leading provider of innovative healthcare services and solutions to federal agencies, today announced financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nFirst quarter revenue of $30.2 million, up 15.7% over the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Gross margin of 21.6% for the first quarter versus 22.3% in the prior- year period Recorded a one-time charge of $3.4 million, or $(0.28) per diluted share, for revaluation of deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act on December 22, 2017 Diluted earnings per share of $(0.24) for the quarter\nManagement Discussion\n\"First quarter results set the stage for solid performance in fiscal 2018, bolstered by strong leading indicators that support our strategic growth initiatives,\" stated DLH President and Chief Executive Officer Zach Parker. \"While bottom line results were impacted by non-cash charges related to the new federal Tax Act, revenue rose nearly 16% in the quarter, and our new business development pipeline continues to support significant opportunities within the federal markets we've targeted. In addition to our double-digit growth, we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet and deleveraging the business to better enable the Company to compete on the acquisition front.\n\"Despite ongoing continuing resolutions and federal budget uncertainties in Washington, DLH is well positioned and aligned with key agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services, Veterans Health Administration, and Defense Health Agency. Early indications are that each of these organizations enjoys strong advocacy in Congress due to their mission-critical operations. Accordingly, we expect to build upon first quarter results as we deliver value-added services and solutions going forward. In addition, we intend to invest in expanding our proprietary SPOT-m ® data analytics technology to enhance productivity optimization for our clients and accelerate top-line growth.\"\nResults for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $30.2 million, up $4.1 million, or 15.7%, over the prior-year first quarter, reflecting the expansion of services on existing contract vehicles and contribution from new contract awards.\nGross profit was $6.5 million for the quarter, an increase of $0.7 million, or 12.4%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As a percent of revenue, the Company's gross margin was 21.6% versus 22.3% in the prior-year period. General and Administrative (\"G&A\") expenses were $4.9 million for the quarter versus $4.7 million in fiscal 2017. As a percent of revenue, G&A expenses were 16.2% in the current fiscal first quarter versus 18.1% last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $0.5 million versus $0.2 million in the prior year period.\nIncome from operations was $1.1 million for the quarter versus $0.9 million in the prior-year period. This increase reflects gross profit improvement of $0.7 million, partially offset by higher expenses noted above. Income before taxes was $0.9 million for the quarter, up approximately $0.3 million over the prior-year period.\nThe Company reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2018 of approximately $2.9 million, or $(0.24) per diluted share, versus net income of $0.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. DLH recorded a $3.7 million provision for tax expense during the quarter, versus $0.2 million in fiscal 2017. Net income in the fiscal 2018 first quarter included a one-time $3.4 million charge for the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax assets due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") that was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the estimated impact of the Tax Act, net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $0.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $1.7 million versus $1.1 million in the prior-year period. Growth was attributable to increased revenue and gross profit, partially offset by additional G&A expenses as described above.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nCash as of December 31, 2017 was $3.2 million, and the Company's senior debt was $18.8 million, versus cash of $4.9 million and senior debt of $19.7 million as of September 30, 2017. Regarding cash flow, for the fiscal first quarter DLH used $0.4 million in cash from operations, based on the timing of key collections and incentive compensation payments for the prior fiscal year. It is expected that for fiscal 2018 in total, the Company will generate cash flow which will continue to be positively impacted by utilizing tax net operating losses.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") as a supplemental non-GAAP measure of our performance. DLH defines EBITDA as net income excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) provision for or benefit from income taxes, if any, and (iii) depreciation and amortization.\nBeginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company commenced reporting EBITDA, rather than adjusted EBITDA, as a key non-GAAP financial measure of our business. The Company believes that due to the growth and maturation of its business, this change will improve the transparency of its business performance and increase the comparability of its results with peers. Non-GAAP measures for prior periods have been recast to conform to this change in the Company's reporting. It is important to note that GAAP results and the presentation of GAAP metrics do not change, and the reporting of EBITDA has no effect on the Company's business nor how the business is managed.\nIn addition, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company is also reporting, for the first time, net income excluding the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 on the valuation of its deferred tax assets. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, reduced corporate tax rates and revised rules regarding the usability of net operating losses. These changes have resulted in a tax provision of $3.4 million associated with revaluing the benefit of the Company's net operating losses. DLH is reporting this non-GAAP metric beginning with this quarter since applicable guidance requires that the Company's deferred tax assets must be revalued immediately.\nThese non-GAAP measures of performance are used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods presented. Management and the Company's Board utilize these non-GAAP measures to make decisions about the use of the Company's resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure managements performance. DLH believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the Company's historical performance. By providing this non-GAAP measure as a supplement to GAAP information, DLH believes this enhances investors' understanding of its business and results of operations.\nReconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(2,851)\n$\n324\n$\n(3,175)\n(i) Interest expense\n278\n364\n(86)\n(ii) Provision for taxes\n3,719\n201\n3,518\n(iii) Depreciation, amortization, and loss on fixed assets\n506\n201\n305\nEBITDA\n$\n1,652\n$\n1,090\n$\n562\nReconciliation of GAAP net income to net income, excluding the effect of write-down, a non-GAAP measure:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet Income (Loss)\n$\n(2,851)\n$\n324\n$\n(3,175)\nWrite-down of deferred tax assets\n3,365\n—\n3,365\nNet income, excluding effect of write-down of deferred tax assets\n$\n514\n$\n324\n$\n190\nNet income (loss) per fully-diluted share\n$\n(0.24)\n$\n0.03\n$\n(0.27)\nWrite-down of deferred tax assets\n0.28\n—\n0.28\nNet income (loss) per fully-diluted share, excluding effect of write-\ndown of deferred tax assets\n$\n0.04\n$\n0.03\n$\n0.01\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nDLH management will discuss first quarter results during a conference call beginning at 11:00 AM Eastern Time on Tuesday, February 6, 2018.
