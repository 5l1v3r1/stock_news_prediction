More complex projects will be given to special review panels working with the agency.\n- The law imposes time lines for reviews. Assessments done by the agency must be completed within 300 days, at which point the environment minister has 30 days to either take a decision or refer the matter to cabinet.\n- The timeline for reviews carried out by panels is 600 days, after which the full cabinet would have 90 days to decide what to do.\nReporting by David LjunggrenEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:09:11.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
