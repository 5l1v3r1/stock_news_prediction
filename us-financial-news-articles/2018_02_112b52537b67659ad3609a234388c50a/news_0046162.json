The company on Tuesday set a three-year timeline to better production.\nThe company said it expects to spend in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for drilling and development in 2020 as part of that plan, up from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion expected in 2018.\nThe plan assumes an allocation split of 50-50 between Delaware and Midland, two of the main portions of the Permian basin, Chief Executive James McManus said on a post-earnings call with analysts.\nEnergen said it expects to produce 555,000-585,000 barrels of oil per day (bbl/d) in 2018.\nAnalysts on average were expecting the Alabama-based company to produce 626,500 bbl/d, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe company’s shares, which fell more than 3 percent after the production forecast, were marginally up at $52.36 in late morning trade.\nFor the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, Energen said it produced 974,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), up from 535,000 boe/d a year earlier.\nThe company posted a net profit of $262.4 million, or $2.68 per share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $54.5 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.\nThe latest quarter saw a tax benefit of $240.1 million from changes in the U.S. tax code.\nExcluding items, Energen earned 63 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 42 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting by Anirban Paul in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Maju Samuel\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:11:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
