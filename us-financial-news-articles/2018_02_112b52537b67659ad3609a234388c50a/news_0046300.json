Vandercook holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Building Construction from the University of Florida.\n\"We are very pleased to welcome back Fred to KB Home as head of our Tampa team, and are confident that his experience and demonstrated leadership will be a great asset to our business, as we continue to focus on growth and open several new communities in the region,” said Vince DePorre, Southeast regional president for KB Home.\nKB Home has been building in the Tampa and Southwest Florida region since 2002 and has 10 communities currently open for new home sales. Recent land acquisitions will allow KB Home to continue to expand its regional presence, with several new home communities expected to debut in 2018. These include Northgate, a 200-homesite community located in Gibsonton; West Lake Reserve, a 42-homesite community located in North Tampa; and Freedom Ridge, a 91-homesite community located in Seffner. Both the West Lake Reserve and Freedom Ridge communities are expected to open in the coming months, while the Northgate models opened earlier this month.\n“A combination of favorable economic factors and low inventory has made Tampa a strong homebuilding market,” DePorre continued. “These future communities will provide new homeownership opportunities for Tampa residents in 2018 and beyond.”\nAbout KB Home\nKB Home (NYSE: KBH) is one of the largest homebuilders in the United States, with more than 600,000 homes delivered since our founding in 1957.
