The strike was motivated by “worsening labour conditions, a lack of respect for the dignity of the cabin crew ... and threats over sales objectives”, he said.\nRyanair’s chief people officer Eddie Wilson said earlier on Monday the company had received no notice from the Portuguese union and had to “wait and see” whether the strike was going to happen.
