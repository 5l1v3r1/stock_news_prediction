REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson “This is not about sex, this is about power,” said Jayaraman. “When you shift the power balance ... sexual harassment gets cut in half.”\nSeventeen states, including New Jersey and Texas, as well as the District of Columbia pay tipped workers $2.13, a federal minimum wage that has not changed in more than two decades. New York, Florida and the remaining states pay somewhere in between.\nSlideshow (5 Images) New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is among the lawmakers already weighing a move to the higher “fair” wage.\nROC’s national day of action on Tuesday included rallies in Philadelphia, Seattle and Oakland, as well as actions in Washington, D.C., Detroit, New Orleans and Oakland, California.\nThe restaurant industry, which employs half of American women at some point in their lives, has an advantage over other industries when it comes to addressing sexual harassment because it was already advocating for a clear policy solution when the #MeToo social media movement against harassment gained momentum late last year, said Jayaraman.\nReporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T05:03:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
