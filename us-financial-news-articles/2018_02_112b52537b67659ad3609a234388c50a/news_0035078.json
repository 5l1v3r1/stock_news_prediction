Our target is the medium term program until we change it,” he said adding that the three main elements that will boost growth will be domestic consumption, foreign demand and investments.\nThe Treasury, which he oversees, was seeking to diversify borrowing both geographically and in terms of instruments, Simsek said. It was looking at the Chinese panda market and may make an issue in the Russian market.\n“The Eurobond market will be our main market but sukuk is a significant alternative,” Simsek said on foreign borrowing.\n“We had discussions regarding the Panda market when we visited China. An issue on the Russian market might be on the agenda,” Simsek said adding that sukuk and gold-backed bond issues will be evaluated as well.\nHe also said the U.S. Justice Department and Treasury had not made any requests other than to Turkish state lender Halkbank ( HALKB.IS ) after a U.S. jury found one of its executives guilty in an Iran sanctions-busting trial.\n“Until now, there hasn’t been any request or inquiry from the U.S. Justice Department or Treasury except for Halkbank. Thus, we do not foresee a risk (on the banking sector) in general,” Simsek said.\nHalkbank is a public company which communicates with its investors, Simsek said adding that the lender is also in contact and cooperation with the U.S. Justice Department and Treasury.\nWriting by Daren Butler and Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by David Dolan and Dominic Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:27:41.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
