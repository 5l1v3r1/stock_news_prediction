He is a lawyer, he knows the law, he wants to uphold the rule of law, he knows about the bill of rights,” he said.\nDemocracy and human rights in many Southeast Asian nations will remain fragile in 2018 because of autocratic tendencies, rampant corruption and cronyism, the U.S. Intelligence Community said in its Worldwide Threat Assessment report dated Feb. 13.( bit.ly/2BYIdoc )\n“In the Philippines, President Duterte will continue to wage his signature campaign against drugs, corruption, and crime,” the report read, adding that Duterte has suggested he could suspend the constitution and declare a revolutionary government.\nThis is not the first time the United States has criticised Duterte, who is notorious for his defiance of international pressure. Duterte was infuriated by expressions of concern by former President Barack Obama’s administration about drug-war killings in the Philippines.\nMore than 4,000 people have been killed in what police call legitimate operations against suspected drug dealers and users under the Duterte’s signature war on drugs since July 2016. Rights group accused police of summary executions, which authorities refute.\nInternational Criminal Court prosecutors have opened a preliminary examination into Duterte’s anti-drugs campaign.\nReporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T05:12:22.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
