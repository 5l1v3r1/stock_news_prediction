Automakers are rushing to fill dealer lots with the fast-selling vehicles, as Americans continue to turn away from sedans and compact cars. \nThe launch costs for newly refreshed crossovers, such as the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Terrain, and Buick Enclave, hurt GM's bottom line in 2017, Levy told CNBC in an interview. \nBut if they sell as expected, GM should be able to take some profits this year as it invests in launch costs for upcoming trucks GM bets will deliver similarly high margins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T21:08:27.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
