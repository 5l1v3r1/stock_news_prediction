Same-store sales were up more than 3 percent during November and December. The Minneapolis-based retailer has been remodeling its bigger stores in phases, while opening a handful of smaller-format stores in urban areas and near college campuses.\n\"We want to make Target the easiest place in America to shop\" no matter whether a shopper wants to buy online or at the store, Cornell said. That's why the company is expanding initiatives like curbside pickup, same-day delivery in metropolitan markets and two-day shipping for guests.\nRival Walmart recently saw a huge slowdown in its online sales in the latest quarter , sparking fear that the same would happen to Target. But Cornell said the company is still expecting 25 percent e-commerce growth for the year.\nTarget is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on March 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T16:11:18.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
