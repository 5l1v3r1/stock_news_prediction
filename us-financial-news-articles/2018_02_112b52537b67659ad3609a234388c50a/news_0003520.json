Adults aged 65 or older had the most hospitalizations, followed by those aged 50 to 64, and children below 5.\nThe dominant strain during this flu season is an especially nasty type called influenza A (H3N2) that in seasons past had been linked with severe disease and death, especially in the elderly and young.\n“So far this year the cumulative rate of hospitalization is the highest since we began tracking in this way,” Dr. Anne Schuchat, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on a conference call. The CDC began its current hospital flu surveillance program during the 2009-2010 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.\nSchuchat was named acting CDC director earlier this week after Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald resigned from the post because of financial conflicts of interest, including purchases of tobacco and healthcare stocks while in office.\nFlu is widespread in 48 states, down from 49 last week, with Oregon reporting less flu activity, the CDC said.\n“We are not out of the woods yet,” Schuchat said, noting that sick people should stay home to avoid transmitting the virus to others, frequently wash hands and cover their mouth while coughing or sneezing.\nThe CDC official also said it was not too late to get a flu vaccine.\nReporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:51:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
