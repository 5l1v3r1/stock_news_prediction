Losses for this sub-business alone cut 399 million euros from the group’s core operating profit in 2016.\nChief Financial Officer Herve Philippe said there was still room for further cost savings at Canal Plus, without elaborating.\nThe division was the only one to provide a target for 2018, aiming to generate 450 million euros in earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA).\nVivendi’s group performance contrasted with the downturn at its advertising unit Havas, which was absorbed last year for a total of 3.9 billion euros.\nThe division, led by Bollore’s son Yannick, suffered from a challenging market, leading to a fall in annual underlying sales of 0.8 percent. Operating profit margins fell to 11.2 percent from 14.5 percent.\nThe workforce and salaries will have to adapt to the new situation, Phillipe said.\nVivendi said it would raise its dividend by 12.5 percent to 0.45 euros per share.\nReporting by Mathieu Rosemain and Gwenaelle BarzicEditing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:59:43.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
