Firefighters on the scene cut open the bus roof to free passengers still trapped inside.\nSome victims were laid out nearby beneath sheets by emergency workers.\nPolice said at least 18 people, including 15 men, had been confirmed dead on the scene. Dozens more were hurt, some sitting hunched on the highway with blood streaming from their injuries.\nOne elderly man interviewed on television said the driver had been going extremely fast at the time of the accident, even taking bends at high speed.\nAn executive surnamed So, with The Kowloon Motor Bus Co that operated the bus, said HK$80,000 ($10,230) in financial assistance would be paid to the families of each victim. The company said it would also set up an investigation team to probe the cause of the crash.\n($1 = 7.8179 Hong Kong dollars)\nWriting by James Pomfret; Editing by Stephen Powell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T16:21:46.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
