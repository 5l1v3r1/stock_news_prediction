Right now, the team is focusing on figuring out if there is a process, a structure that might work,\" Slattery said. \nHe added that he hopes to have 'visibility' on the matter in the near to medium term, but declined to reveal the transaction value. \nNews broke earlier that Boeing was in talks with Embraer — the world's third-largest plane maker — for a 80 to 90 percent stake in   business. \nThe Brazilian government holds a so-called golden share in Embraer, giving it veto power over strategic decisions involving military programs and any change in its controlling interest. \nSlattery said that a deal with Boeing now would make Embraer more productive. \n\"It probably would end up with Embraer being more productive in the market place, and selling more aircraft. We have the ability to broaden our reach,\"he said.

I want to get that to at least 20 operators by 2020. This is a big target market,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T06:18:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
