Janus Henderson Group plc, which markets the VelocityShares notes, could not be reached immediately. \nCredit Suisse Group AG, which issued the VelocityShares notes, traded down 6 percent after-hours. \n“The XIV ETN activity is reflective of today’s market volatility. There is no material impact to Credit Suisse,” said spokeswoman Nicole Sharp. She declined to comment further. \nStocks plummeted in highly volatile trading on Monday, with the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrials suffering their biggest respective percentage drops since August 2011 as a long-awaited pullback from record highs deepened. \nFor the Dow, the fall at one point of nearly 1,600 points was the biggest intraday point loss in Wall Street history.
