This is an IOC decision, we can only offer them a technical solution from a sporting position but they have made their decision.”\nThe men’s downhill, the opening race of the 2018 Olympics, is the blue riband event in Alpine skiing and would remain a “priority” within the rescheduling if the “highly accurate” local weather forecast was born out, Waldner added.\nAn emergency committee meeting would be held once the cancellation was confirmed to reschedule the races but those calculations could be complicated by continuing high winds throughout the early part of the 11 days of competition.
