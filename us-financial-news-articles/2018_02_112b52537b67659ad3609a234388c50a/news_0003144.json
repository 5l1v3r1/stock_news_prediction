Inquiries, are, as the police like to say, ongoing,” Brazier said.\nBoE Governor Mark Carney said last week that markets are likely to be affected when central banks around the world raise interest rates, but reforms since the financial crisis mean that would have a limited impact on the real economy.\nReporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:50:36.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
