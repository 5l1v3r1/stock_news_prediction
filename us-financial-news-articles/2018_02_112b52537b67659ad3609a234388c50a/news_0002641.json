But we are fighting this problem, and today we have one of the best anti-doping systems in the world.”\n* * * Alexander Zubkov, president of the Russian bobsleigh federation, gold medallist in Sochi and one of 11 athletes confirmed to have committed a doping offence, to Reuters:\n“I‘m partly satisfied with the CAS decision because we had a large number of athletes who were exonerated - all the skeleton athletes and some of the bobsledders....We would like to see what is said about the athletes who were not fully exonerated.”\n“I have said many times that I have never doped and do not dope now.... What am I being accused of? What anti-doping rule violation do they want to slap against me?”\nInternational Olympic Committee statement:\n“The confirmation of the Anti-Doping Rule Violations for 11 athletes because of the manipulation of their samples clearly demonstrates once more the existence of the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping system at the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014.”\n“On the other hand, the IOC regrets very much that the (CAS) panels did not take this proven existence of the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping system into consideration for the other 28 cases.”\n“This may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping.”\n* * * Jim Walden, lawyer for Russia’s former anti-doping chief-turned whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, in a statement:\n”Dr. Rodchenkov testified fully and credibly at CAS. His truth has been verified by forensic evidence, other whistleblowers, and, more recently, recovery of the Moscow lab’s secret database, showing thousands of dirty tests that were covered up.\n“This panel’s unfortunate decision provides a very small measure of punishment for some athletes but a complete ‘get out of jail free card’ for most.”\n* * * Russian sports minister Pavel Kolobkov, to reporters:\n“The Russian Olympic Committee will send the IOC a letter requesting that our athletes take part in the Olympic Games We really hope that the IOC makes a decision in favour of all clean athletes who earned the right to compete at the Olympics.” (Reporting by Karolos Grohmann in Berlin, Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber, Anton Derbenev and Valery Stepchenkov in Moscow and Brian Homewood in Zurich; Editing by Peter Graff)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:04:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
