The affected areas include those near 3M’s headquarters in St. Paul, Minn. \nThe synthetic substances are considered harmful to humans and wildlife, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency says studies have shown PFCs may affect “growth and development, reproduction, and injure the liver.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T14:19:59.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
