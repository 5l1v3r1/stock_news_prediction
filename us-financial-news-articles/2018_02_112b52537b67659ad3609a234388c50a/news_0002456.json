It is set to announce the full-year results on March 9.\nCEO Meinie Oldersma took over in April to lead a turnaround of SIG’s business across Europe. His predecessor, Stuart Mitchell, stepped down after a profit warning.\n“The previous management described SIG as a loose federation and the current management is tightening things up. Inevitably as word gets round there is a new sheriff in town, cracks start to appear and weak practices are identified”, Jefferies analysts said in a client note.\n$1 = 0.7013 pounds Reporting by Justin George Varghese in Bengaluru; editing by Amrutha Gayathri and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:00:41.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
