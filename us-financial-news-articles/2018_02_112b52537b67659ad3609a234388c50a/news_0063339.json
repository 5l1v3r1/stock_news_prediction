[nL1N1JV03W]\nA U.S. sugar industry coalition, which in 2014 petitioned the government for protection from cheap, subsidized imports from Mexico, requested in late December that the Department of Commerce review the latest pact.\nThe Mexican Sugar Chamber, in documents filed with the U.S. government, has said the review is premature. Reviews are conducted regularly to ensure that restrictions on imports are being followed and that they are working as intended for the domestic industry.\nMexico made concessions to the U.S. sugar industry to reach a deal, eager to avoid a stand-off before the NAFTA talks kicked off. Negotiators from the three NAFTA countries are currently in Mexico City for a seventh round of talks. [nL2N1QF0A3]\nTime is running out to agree a new NAFTA deal before a Mexican presidential vote and U.S. mid-term congressional elections later this year. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has put forward a radical set of proposals that has complicated the progress.\nReporting by Adriana Barrera in Mexico City; Additional reporting by Chris Prentice in New York; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T02:32:05.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
