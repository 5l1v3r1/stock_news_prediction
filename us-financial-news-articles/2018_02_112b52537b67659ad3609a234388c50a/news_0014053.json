(NYSE: BMI) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet sales were a record $96,650,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, a 3.8% increase from sales of $93,098,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating earnings were a record $13,151,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, a 44.6% increase from operating earnings of $9,095,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net earnings were a record $7,233,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, a 18.3% increase from net earnings of $6,113,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share were a record $0.25 for the fourth quarter of 2017, a 19.0% increase from diluted earnings per share of $0.21 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nNet sales were a record $402,440,000 for 2017, a 2.2% increase from sales of $393,761,000 for 2016. Operating earnings were a record $55,622,000 for 2017, a 9.6% increase from operating earnings of $50,765,000 for 2016. Net earnings were a record $34,571,000 for 2017, a 7.0% increase from net earnings of $32,295,000 for 2016. Diluted earnings per share were a record $1.19 for 2017, a 7.2% increase from diluted earnings per share of $1.11 for 2016.\nOperations Review\n“Record net sales, earnings and earnings per share in the fourth quarter were the culmination of another strong year for Badger Meter,” said Richard A. Meeusen, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Badger Meter. “Ongoing acceptance of our more advanced technology products and continued operational efficiencies drove margin increases in the quarter despite continued softness in the municipal utility market. Sales, engineering and administrative expenses were in line given our continued investments in our team, product innovation and enhancements to our sales and distribution channels, most notably the asset acquisition of Carolina Meter & Supply, which closed in early November.”\nIn addition to the positive margin impact from sales of the company’s newer products, the quarter also benefited from slightly higher municipal water sales volume as well as continued improvement in key flow instrumentation markets, such as oil and gas. Gross profit margin was 40.4%, up from 36.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016, despite somewhat higher brass costs. Similar to prior years, net earnings and earnings per share were reduced by a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $640,000 or $0.015 per diluted share.\n“In addition to a record quarter, we are very pleased with our record results for the full year. Sales crossed the $400 million threshold for the first time in 2017, driven in large part by the market’s continued evolution toward our new technologies and continued improvement in our industrial markets,” said Meeusen. “This bodes well for the future, as demand for E-Series ® meters and ORION ® cellular endpoints, as well as ongoing interest in our BEACON ® Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) managed solution, continue to grow.”\nSelling, engineering and administration costs increased slightly for the year due to acquisition expenses, commissions and employee incentives, as well as higher professional services fees. Despite that, operating income increased 9.6% and net earnings increased 7.0% over what was a strong 2016. The company ended the year with a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 13.8%. The quarterly cash dividend was increased for the 25 th consecutive year.\n“We are optimistic as we head into 2018. Our industry leadership in North American water metering and improving position in global flow instrumentation technologies, combined with a more favorable domestic tax environment, position us well to capture additional sales and earnings growth over the long term,” added Meeusen.\nImpact of 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nResults for the fourth quarter included a charge of $0.8 million to record a transition tax on the company’s undistributed foreign earnings, offset by a credit of $0.8 million to recognize the Federal rate change impact on the company’s net deferred tax liabilities. These resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The company indicated the long-term impact of tax reform is expected to be significant, with future effective tax rates likely to be reduced from approximately 36% to 24%.\nConference Call and Webcast\nBadger Meter management will hold a conference call on Tuesday, February 6, 2018, at 10:00 AM Central/11:00 AM Eastern time to discuss the company’s fourth quarter 2017 results.
