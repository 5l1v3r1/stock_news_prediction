(OTC:AITB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) for the treatment of patients with serious lung infections and pulmonary hypertension, today announced the appointment of two new executive team members. Mark Rimkus joins AIT as Vice President of Clinical Affairs and will assist the company in areas such as clinical trial management, quality systems development, device design and device testing. Dr. Abdi Ghaffari joins AIT as Vice President of Research and will provide the company with pre-clinical and scientific expertise to develop the NO therapeutics platform.\n“These appointments announced today mark another significant step in AIT’s transformation into a company with approved therapies to help patients,” said Steve Lisi, Chairman and CEO of AIT. “We are pleased to add both Mark and Abdi to the AIT team, both of whom bring a wealth of experience working with NO in both hospital and commercial environments. I am confident that they will bolster and advance our efforts in making the AIT NO delivery system available to patients.”\nMark Rimkus, a professional bio-medical engineer and registered respiratory therapist, has over two decades of experience with inhaled NO systems at various companies and hospitals. He joins AIT from Stollery Children’s Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta, where since 2016, he has been the Senior Engineer evaluating and advising the respiratory therapy department on new respiratory devices. His duties there included planning and managing trials with new devices. Mr. Rimkus has also served as Director-At-Large and Treasurer on the Council of the College and Association of Respiratory Therapists of Alberta in 2016 and 2017. From 2012 to 2016 he was Respiratory Therapy Support Lead at the University of Alberta Hospital, and prior to that, OR Clinical Lead at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton. Mr. Rimkus worked in industry as a Design Engineer at CBF Systems Inc. from 2008 to 2010 and as Operations Manager/Systems Engineer at PulmoNOx Medical Inc. from 2003 to 2006. In these roles he was responsible for designing, building, and testing prototypes for industrial, consumer, and medical related devices. From 1992 to 2003 he held Respiratory Therapist positions at Royal Alexandra Hospital and Stollery Children’s Hospital.
