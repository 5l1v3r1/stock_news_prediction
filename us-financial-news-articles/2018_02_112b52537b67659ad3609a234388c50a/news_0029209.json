Dallas also picked up a second-round pick from Denver in the swap.\nThe Mavericks led by as many as 10 points in the first quarter and 12 in the second. However, Golden State rallied into a 60-all halftime tie, then took charge for good with a 17-6 burst over the final 4:23 of the third period that opened a 93-85 lead.\nDurant contributed two 3-pointers, a dunk, two free throws and an assist to the run.\nShaun Livingston scored from the interior, David West slammed home a dunk and Klay Thompson bombed in a 3-pointer as Golden State scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter to build a 15-point advantage before coasting home.\nThompson finished with 18 points on his 28th birthday, and Draymond Green registered 12 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the Warriors, who swept the four-game season series from the Mavericks with their 10th straight win over Dallas.\nGreen got nailed with his league-leading 14th technical foul in the first half. Earlier in the day, he learned he had been fined $50,000 for using inappropriate language toward a referee Tuesday in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nCurry’s four 3-pointers gave him 2,086, four more than Carter has accumulated in his ongoing NBA career.\nDwight Powell had 18 points, Wesley Matthews 17 and Dirk Nowitzki 16 for the Mavericks, who were coming off a 104-101 road loss against the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.\nNowitzki, who added a game-high 11 rebounds, was playing for the first time since surpassing the 50,000-minute mark on Monday. He added 29 minutes to his total against Golden State.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:20:18.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
