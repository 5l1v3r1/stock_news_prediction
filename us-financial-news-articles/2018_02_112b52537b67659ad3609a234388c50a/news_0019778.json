Manufacturers overbook, or sell more planes than they can produce, in the narrowbody segment in order to build in a buffer against such disruption.\nOn Tuesday, Boeing and Airbus signaled they were looking at higher production rates.\nReporting by Tim Hepher and Anshuman DagaEditing by Miral Fahmy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T06:21:37.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
