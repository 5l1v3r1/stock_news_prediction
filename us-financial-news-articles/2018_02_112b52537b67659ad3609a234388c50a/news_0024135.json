Told them to re-do and send back in proper form! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2018 \nMcGahn wrote that the Justice Department stood ready to work with the Democrats on the committee on a revised and further redacted version of their memo, given “the public interest in transparency.” \nDemocrats on the panel expressed frustration with the president’s decision but said they were willing to re-examine the memo to address the concerns raised by law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. \n“We will be reviewing the recommended redactions from the DOJ and FBI, which these agencies shared with the White House, and look forward to conferring with the agencies to determine how we can properly inform the American people about the misleading attack on law enforcement by the GOP and address any concerns over sources and methods,” said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T16:42:57.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
