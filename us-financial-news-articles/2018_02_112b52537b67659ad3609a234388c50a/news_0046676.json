She invited the South Korean president to Pyongyang for talks with her brother.\nSigns of a North-South thaw have prompted speculation about the possibility of direct U.S.-North Korea talks after months of tension and exchanges of insults between U.S. President Donald Trump and the North Korean leader fueled fears of war.\nNorth Korea has not carried out any weapons tests since late November, when it fired its largest intercontinental ballistic missile.\nThe United States has said it supports talks between the two Koreas and added it is open to talks with North Korea itself, but only to convey the U.S. stance that it must give up its nuclear weapons, a demand the North has rejected.\nReporting by Christine Kim; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T01:33:23.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
