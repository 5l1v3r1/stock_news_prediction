He has 90 days to respond. \nA U.S. administration official said the White House was “aware of the needs and concerns of stakeholders.” \n“The president has 90 days to make his decision and we will announce that decision at the appropriate time,” the official told Reuters. \nForcing a reduction of excess production in China, which now supplies half the world’s steel, is a key goal of any potential restrictions. \nThe United States, the world’s biggest steep importer, and China have long been at odds over how to combat excess capacity in the global steel sector. China has argued that it has done its bit to tackle the problem by cutting capacity. \n‘WAIT-AND-SEE APPROACH’ \nPhilip Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association, said there was optimism that Trump would come up with effective measures following his decision on Jan. 22 to slap tariffs on imported washers and solar panels. \n“I confident he will come up with a remedy that is effective and he still has 70 days to review it and make a decision,” Bell told Reuters. “We will have to take a wait-and-see approach, but it is clear the steel industry continues to be challenged and that 232 action sooner rather than later is important.” \nThe letter underscored that despite the threat of trade actions, imports continue to swamp the U.S. market. In June 2017, steel imports hit their highest monthly total in more than two years by capturing 30 percent of the U.S. market, the letter said. \nEfforts to address global excess capacity through international consultations and groups such as the G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development had failed, the letter added. \nThe European Union has warned it will retaliate if European steelmakers suffer collateral damage from import restrictions under the Section 232 investigation. \nWhile the measure would mainly target China, NATO allies like Britain have expressed concern because the two countries have traded steel for military purposes.
