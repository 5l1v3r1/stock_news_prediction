Analysts on average were expecting 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nPayPal expects revenue for the full year of $15 billion to $15.25 billion.

Venmo processed around $35 billion in payments in 2017, up 97%.\nPayPal’s net income rose to $620 million, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $390 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned 55 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 52 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet revenue climbed to $3.74 billion from $2.98 billion.\nThe results included a net tax expense of $180 million connected to the recent U.S. tax reform, the company said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T11:55:12.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
