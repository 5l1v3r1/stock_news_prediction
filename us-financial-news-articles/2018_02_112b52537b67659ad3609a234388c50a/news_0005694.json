He was busy trying to drive as fast as he could, and I was trying to drive as fast as I could. That was it. There was nothing more to it than that,” he added. \n“I don’t know why people seem to think there was a coach or a mentor thing going on. There wasn’t; it was just him doing his job and me doing mine, and whoever did it better finished ahead.” Formula One F1 - Japanese Grand Prix 2017 - Suzuka Circuit, Japan - October 5, 2017.
