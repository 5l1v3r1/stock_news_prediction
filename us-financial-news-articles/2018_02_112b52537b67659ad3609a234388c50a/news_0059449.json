If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and the build-up of fluids can drown victims.\nThe latest OPCW mission is seeking to determine whether chemical weapons were used in violation of the international weapons convention, which Syria signed in 2013 after hundreds died in a massive sarin gas attack in Ghouta.\nMan with a child are seen in hospital in the besieged town of Douma, Eastern Ghouta, Damascus, Syria February 25, 2018. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh The OPCW will not assign blame.\n“OPCW’s technical secretariat continues to examine all credible allegations of chemical weapons use, reported by media or other sources, including the most recent allegations,” it said when asked about the investigation into the Ghouta attacks.\nThe OPCW team does not plan to travel to Ghouta because of safety concerns - two visits by inspectors in 2013 and 2014 were ambushed - but will gather witness testimony, photographic and video evidence, and interview medical experts, the sources said.\nPeople inspect missile remains in the besieged town of Douma, in eastern Ghouta, in Damascus, Syria, February 23, 2018. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh A U.N.-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism, established by the United Nations to identify those behind chemical weapons attacks, concluded in 2016 that Syrian government forces had used chlorine on three occasions.\nIt also concluded last year that Syrian government forces were behind a sarin nerve agent attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed more than 80 people, many of them women and children.\nThe United States fired 59 cruise missiles at Syria’s Shayrat airbase in April, saying it had been used by Assad’s forces to carry out the sarin attack.\nSyria and its close ally Russia, which provides military support to Assad’s forces, deny using chemical weapons and blame insurgents.\nThe use of chemical weapons has become systematic in Syria’s seven-year war, but political rifts between Western powers and Russia have hamstrung the United Nations and the OPCW, leaving them unable to act against violations of international law.\nA renewal of the joint U.N.-OPCW mission’s mandate was vetoed by Moscow at the U.N. Security Council.\nReporting by Anthony Deutsch; editing by David Clarke\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T12:34:09.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
