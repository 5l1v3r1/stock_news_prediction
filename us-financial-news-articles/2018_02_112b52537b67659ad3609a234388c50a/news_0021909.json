O‘Brien & Associates in Chicago. “I don’t know if it’s over, but a market range may be established.”\nGains in industrial and consumer discretionary stocks led advances on the S&P and the Dow.\nBoeing and United Tech rose about 1.5 percent, providing the biggest boost to the Dow, while Amazon’s 1 percent rise helped lift the S&P.\nThe S&P energy index was up more than 1 percent, led by Anadarko Petroleum’s 5 percent gain and an uptick in oil prices.\nA wild session on Tuesday had seen the Dow swing more than 1,100 points from peak to trough and ended with the benchmark S&P 500 recording its best day since just before President Donald Trump’s election in 2016.\nTraders are still braced for more volatility as they try to figure out if the swings of the past week are the start of a deeper correction or just a temporary blip in the U.S. market’s nine-year bull run.\nThe pivotal gauge of S&P 500 volatility, the VIX, opened at a relatively elevated 31 points and slipped to 21.74. The VIX on Tuesday hit a more than two-and-a-half year high above 50, after trading, on average, below 20 for months.\nSome investors fear the market is over-stretched in the context of higher inflation and rising bond yields as central banks withdraw their easy money policies of recent years. The recent rout has wiped about $4 trillion off world equities.\nU.S. 10-year yields were at 2.789 percent, up from 2.766 percent on Tuesday.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly praised Wall Street gains during his first year in office, on Wednesday dismissed recent market rout, saying stocks should not be falling amid strong economic news.\n“In the ‘old days, when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!” Trump wrote on Twitter.\nSnapchat owner Snap soared 21 percent after it reported surging growth in users and revenue in its latest quarter.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,068 to 720. On the Nasdaq, 1,596 issues rose and 1,056 fell.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 2 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 13 new highs and 21 new lows.
