It expects sales to rise between 4-5 percent in the first quarter, helped by new routes and plans to fill more seats, with the load factor seen growing between 6 and 7 percent.\nGermany’s Lufthansa, British low-cost carrier easyJet and U.S. private equity fund Cerberus are among those that have expressed an interest in buying Alitalia, which controls valuable take-off and landing slots in the world’s fifth-largest tourist destination.
