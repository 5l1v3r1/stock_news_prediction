Unlike other austerity programs, the Cyprus model put most of the painful measures up front, including recapitalizing banks by seizing uninsured deposits, a so-called ‘bail-in’ - used in the euro zone for the first time.\nMalas, a geneticist who served as health minister in the former leftist administration, had also come second to Anastasiades in 2013.\nPolitical analyst Hubert Faustmann said Anastasiades had entered the race as favorite in a field of relatively uninspiring candidates, adding: “He handled the economic crisis very well, he got a lot of credit for that.”\nAs leader of the island’s Greek Cypriot community, Anastasiades also oversaw peace talks with the breakaway Turkish-Cypriot controlled north.\nCyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup, and has one of the world’s longest-serving peacekeeping forces.\nPeace talks collapsed last year over the role that Turkey could play in a post-settlement Cyprus.\nAnastasiades faced criticism from Greek Cypriots both for offering too many concessions and for missing one of the best chances in a generation to solve the logjam.\n“There are two narratives in the Greek Cypriot community: one that he bears responsibility for the failure of talks and the other - that Turkish intransigence is responsible. It’s apparently the second which prevailed,” Faustmann said.\nEditing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T21:27:49.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
