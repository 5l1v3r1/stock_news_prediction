At one stage, the worst losses of the day were cut in half before more selling happened. \n\"There's always been volatile days. It just so happens that the Dow is at a higher level so it's the biggest Dow drop off ever,\" Farley said. \nThe Dow had hit a record high on Jan. 26. \nOn a typical day, the exchange trades about 6.5 billion shares industry wide, Farley said. He said Monday the number will be closer to 11 billion shares.
