REUTERS/Eric Gaillard “There is definitely a lot happening and I did feel a little overwhelmed but I am trying to take in the whole experience.”\nKim’s extraordinary runs were greeted by huge cheers from the crowd, comfortably the biggest at Phoenix Snow Park during the Games.\nBecause of her Korean heritage, Kim has attracted swathes of support from local fans and is greeted by cheers and requests for selfies everywhere she goes.\nChloe Kim of the U.S. warms up before the Snowboarding Women's Halfpipe Finals.

She is amazing and so young.”\nKim, whose face has been splashed across magazine covers in the United States and South Korea, has had to deal with unprecedented expectations.\nShe delivered when it mattered most and all on an empty stomach.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:37:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
