The ground-based midcourse system was designed to knock down Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, which could be launched from North Korea or Russia.\n“We’re honored to support the U.S. military in protecting the homeland,” Boeing Defense tweeted in reaction to the award.\nBoeing on Wednesday forecast full-year profit well above Wall Street estimates as it looks forward to its busiest year ever for plane deliveries, sending its shares up almost 5 percent.\nReporting by Eric Beech and Mike Stone; Editing by David Alexander and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T01:28:37.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
