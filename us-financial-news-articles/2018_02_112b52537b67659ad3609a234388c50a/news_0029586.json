Analysts had expected the company to report a revenue of $977.91 million.\nThe company’s shares were up 3.2 percent at $40.25 in after-market trading on Wednesday.\nReporting by Karan Nagarkatti; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T00:32:13.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
