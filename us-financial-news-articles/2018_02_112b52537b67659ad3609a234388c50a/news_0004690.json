It slid more than 26 percent last month, in its worst monthly performance since January 2015.\nFacebook said in a post on its website this week that it was banning all adverts that “promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency”.\nA $530 million hack of Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck late last week has also weighed on the market, along with a subpoena sent by U.S. regulators to two of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency players, Bitfinex and Tether.
