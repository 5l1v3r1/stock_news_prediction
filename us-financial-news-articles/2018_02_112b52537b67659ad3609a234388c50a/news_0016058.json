This matched the S$1.2 billion average estimate of six analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters. \nFull-year net profit rose 4 percent to a record S$4.4 billion. \nGupta said he expected DBS to further improve its net interest margins and reaffirmed the bank’s 7 percent to 8 percent loan growth outlook for this year. \nThree-month Singapore dollar interest rates are currently at 1.12 percent SISGD3MD=ABSG, after rising to nearly 1.51 percent in early January, the highest since October 2008. A year earlier, the rates were about 0.96 percent. The annual performance was driven by broad-based growth in loans and fee income, which more than offset the impact of less favorable interest rates and trading income, Gupta said. \nShares in DBS, in which Singaporean state investor Temasek Holdings owns just over 29 percent, were up 3 percent on Thursday. They gained 43 percent last year. \nThe bank’s net fee income grew 23 percent in the fourth quarter, with the increase spread across most fee income streams and led by wealth management and investment banking. \nDBS announced an increase in its final dividend, and a special dividend of 50 Singapore cents per share to return the capital buffers it had built up ahead of the finalization of new capital rules. \nSince Gupta took over as the CEO in 2009, DBS has more than doubled its group profits and broken into the top-five private banks in Asia, helped by medium-sized acquisitions.
