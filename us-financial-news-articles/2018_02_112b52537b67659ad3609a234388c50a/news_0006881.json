(NASDAQ: GPAC; GPACW; GPACU), a special purpose acquisition company (\"GPAC\" or the \"Company\"), and Purple Innovation, LLC (\"Purple\"), a comfort technology company known for creating the \"World's First No Pressure™ Mattress,\" announced today that they have completed their business combination, pursuant to which Purple has become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The transaction was approved at a special meeting of the Company's stockholders held on February 2, 2018. Under the terms of the merger agreement entered into by the Company, Purple and other parties (the \"Merger Agreement\"), GPAC has changed its corporate name to Purple Innovation, Inc. The Company's common stock and warrants are expected to be listed on NASDAQ beginning on February 5, 2018 under the symbols \"PRPL\" and \"PRPLW.\"\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement and the related transactions, GPAC's common stock has been renamed \"Class A\" common stock. In addition, the Board of Directors of GPAC has been enlarged with the election of additional directors, and a new slate of officers of the Company has been appointed, including the appointment of Sam Bernards as Chief Executive Officer. Following the merger, approximately 82% of the Company's voting securities are owned by a company controlled by the founders of Purple, Tony and Terry Pearce. Upon the merger, the previously trading units of GPAC, which consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant, will no longer trade as a unit, but will trade separately as stock and warrants.\nPaul Zepf, the CEO of GPAC prior to the merger said, \"We are very pleased to have completed the merger with Purple as it embarks on this new journey as a publicly traded company.\"\nZepf continued, \"As a leading comfort technology company, we believe Purple presents a compelling opportunity for investors and is poised for success in the public markets. With a dynamic growth profile and disruptive business model, Purple is truly a unique company with key differentiators and incredible financial standing. We believe Terry, Tony, Sam and their team have done a tremendous job building Purple into an industry leader with strong vertical integration and a long runway for profitable growth.\"\nSam Bernards, the new CEO of the Company stated, \"We are beyond excited to team up with GPAC and become the first direct-to-consumer mattress player to go public in the U.S. as we continue to execute on our mission of bringing comfort and restful sleep to billions of people around the world. Today is an important milestone in the evolution of Purple and one that wouldn't have been possible without the immense talent, tireless dedication and incredible passion of our founders, Terry and Tony Pearce, and our amazing Purple team.\"\nTerry Pearce concluded, \"In just two years, Purple has developed one-of-a-kind products, improved the lives of millions, and delivered exceptional growth. We believe our partnership with GPAC and entry into the public markets will allow us greater financial flexibility to take advantage of the massive opportunity that lies before us — including continued direct-to-consumer penetration, product innovations and category extensions, brick-and mortar partnerships, and expansion beyond the U.S. We are more confident than ever in Purple's future as a public company and our ability to create shareholder value — all while making people feel better.\"\nDeutsche Bank Securities Inc., Piper Jaffray Companies, and Raymond James & Associates, Inc. acted as financial and capital markets advisors to GPAC. Capstone Headwaters LLC served as financial advisor to Purple.
