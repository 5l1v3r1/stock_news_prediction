They fought for their lives and that’s a beautiful thing.” TOO SLICK \nMartial was denied by a great save from Dubravka and had two efforts cleared off the line after the break. \nSanchez inexplicably failed to fire into an empty net after rounding Dubravka, shortly before Ritchie struck the winner. \n“We had games in the past when we conceded late. We got lucky with some shots, but we showed the character, the commitment and the desire today,” Benitez said. \nLiverpool were too slick for a feeble Southampton as they condemned the south coast side to a place in the bottom three. \nSalah punished a mistake and squared for Firmino to score in the seventh minute and the livewire Egyptian then stroked home the second before halftime after a snappy passing move. \nUnited have 56 points, Liverpool 54 and Tottenham 52 with Chelsea on 50. \nIt is equally tight at the bottom where the so-called trap door is looking more like a revolving door. \nHuddersfield escaped the bottom three on Sunday as they snapped a five-game losing sequence. \nAlex Pritchard fired Huddersfield in front after seven minutes and although Junior Stanislas leveled, the hosts were ahead again before the break thanks to Steve Mounie’s 27th-minute header from Aaron Mooy’s delivery. \nBeninese striker Mounie’s shot was deflected in by Steve Cook after 66 minutes and Rajiv van la Parra tucked away a stoppage time penalty to complete a satisfying afternoon for David Wagner’s side.
