Maxim’s goal was the first of his career, and it came in his eighth NHL game after he had been a healthy scratch the past four games. Bjugstad’s goal tied the score with just 3:42 left in the third period.\nRoberto Luongo, who fought back tears as he spoke to the BB&T Center crowd before the game, made 33 saves to earn the win.\nThis was the Panthers’ first home game since last week’s deadly shooting at nearby Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Luongo, a resident of Parkland, spoke to the crowd about his admiration for the students, who have loudly pushed for change after yet another school shooting.\n“I’ve been watching the news. I’ve been seeing what the kids from Douglas have been doing,” Luongo told the crowd. “You guys are brave. You guys are an inspiration to all of us. You guys are what is giving us hope for the future.”\nLars Eller and Andre Burakovsky scored for Washington, and Capitals goalie Braden Holtby, who made 30 saves, lost his fifth consecutive start.\nFlorida scored first. With 4:50 expired in the first period, Mamin set up on the doorstep and scored on an easy rebound. The primary assist went to Ian McCoshen, his first of the season and the second of his career.\nWashington tied the score 1-1 with just 65 seconds left in the first period. Burakovsky, skating from right to left in the high slot, whipped a shot toward goal that was deflected in by Eller. Washington kept the puck in the offensive zone for 60 seconds, scoring on its fifth shot attempt during that stretch.\nBurakovsky’s power-play goal gave Washington a 2-1 lead with 9:56 expired in the second period. After Florida’s Aaron Ekblad was sent off for interference on Alex Ovechkin, Washington took advantage.\nOvechkin, from the left boards, flicked a backhand pass to Burakovsky, who controlled the puck in the slot and then beat Luongo stick-side.\nFlorida tied the score 2-2 thanks to Aleksander Barkov. Skating along the left wing, he slipped the puck between defenseman John Carlson’s legs and also fought off Ovechkin before feeding Bjugstad on the doorstep for the goal.\nTrocheck’s game-winning goal came on a deflection off a shot by Jonathan Huberdeau.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:48:27.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
