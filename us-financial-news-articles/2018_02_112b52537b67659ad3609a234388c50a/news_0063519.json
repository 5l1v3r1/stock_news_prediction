Our first quarter 2018 (“Q1 2018”) unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended January 31, 2018 and Management’s Discussion and Analysis, are available online at www.versabank.com/investor-relations and at www.sedar.com . Supplementary Financial Information will also be available on our website at www.versabank.com/investor-relations .\nVersaBank, (“VB” or the “Bank”), (TSX:VB), today reported net income of $4.0 million for the quarter, compared to $11.9 million for the same period last year, which reflected the Bank recognizing $8.8 million in deferred income tax assets in January 2017.\nCore cash earnings for the quarter was up 26% to $5.9 million from $4.7 million for the same period last year. Core cash earnings, which reflects the Bank’s core operational performance and earnings capacity, is calculated as net income adjusted for income taxes, restructuring charges, corporate projects and other non-core operational expenses (see core cash earnings reconciliation below) (2) .\nMr. David Taylor, President & CEO commented, “Our Bank’s model of using advanced technologies to serve niche markets is continuing to demonstrate its tremendous power. This is evidenced by the Bank accomplishing quarter over quarter core cash earnings growth of 27%, building off the amazing 50% four year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) trajectory that was achieved at the end of our last fiscal year.\nDespite the two recent increases in the Bank of Canada rate our Bank was able to maintain its very low cost of funds and increase its net interest margin (“NIM”) for the quarter to an industry leading 2.87%, all while maintaining a highly disciplined approach to credit risk management as demonstrated by the Bank’s exceptionally low provision for credit losses. Further, net income for the quarter was up 41% to $4.0 million from $2.8 million last quarter driven primarily by a 7% increase in NIM, and an 8% decline in non-interest expenses over the same period.\nOur Bank was formed to explore, and if appropriate apply digital technologies to areas of traditional banking where we thought we could provide a better product or service. Early in our history, we created a new method of digitally acquiring deposits and later a new method of acquiring loan and lease receivables. Both of these ground breaking initiatives are working out very well and are now giving rise to outstanding profit margins and growth. Not content to ‘rest on our laurels’ we decided to explore the application of digital technology to another traditional service that banks have been providing for centuries, that being custodial services. Considering the tremendous growth in ‘digital valuables’ we decided to build a digital storage facility or “digital safety deposit box”. This new initiative is taking place in a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank that we have called VersaVault Inc. Since the announcement of VersaVault (“VV”), we have received considerable interest in our new product and are looking forward to having a prototype ready this coming spring. We expect incremental costs associated with the creation of VV to be minimal.”\nQ1 2018 compared to Q1 2017 (1)\nQ1 2018 compared to Q4 2017 (1)\nCore cash earnings (2) of $5.9 million (up 26%\nfrom $4.7 million) Core cash earnings per share of $0.28 (up $0.05 from $0.23) Net income of $4.0 million (down 66% from\n$11.9 million) (3) NIM of 2.87% (up 33 bps from 2.54%) Basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of\n$0.16 (down $0.40 from $0.56) (3) Common share book value of $8.64 (up 5%\nfrom $8.20) ROCE of 7.50% (down from 27.22%) (3) CET1 ratio of 10.68% (up from 10.28%) Leverage ratio of 10.34% (up from 9.45%) Core cash earnings (2) of $5.9 million (up 27%\nfrom $4.7 million) Core cash earnings per share of $0.28 (up\n$0.06 from $0.22) Net income of $4.0 million (up 41% from\n$2.8 million) NIM of 2.87% (up 19 bps from 2.68%) Basic and diluted EPS of $0.16 (up $0.05 from\n$0.11) Common share book value of $8.64 (up 2%\nfrom $8.48) ROCE of 7.50% (up from 5.06%) CET1 ratio of 10.68% (down from 10.76%) Leverage ratio of 10.34% (up from 10.06%) (1) Certain highlights include non-GAAP measures.

It operates using an “electronic branchless model” and sources its funding, along with consumer and commercial loan and lease receivables, electronically. VersaBank also makes residential development and commercial mortgages it obtains through a well-established network of brokers and through direct contact with its lending staff.\nCommercial Banking – Loans are originated through direct contact with the Bank’s clients and through mortgage brokers and syndication partners. Loans are conservatively secured by real estate primarily in Ontario and occasionally other areas of Canada. Assets at January 31, 2018, totaled $721 million, up 4.19% from last quarter and down 3.84% from a year ago.\neCommerce – Small loan and lease receivables are electronically purchased from VB’s vendor partners who originate point of sale loans and leases in various markets throughout Canada. Assets at January 31, 2018 totalled $839 million, up 3.43% from last quarter and up 1.95% from a year ago.\nFunding - VB has established three core funding channels, those being personal deposits, commercial deposits, and cash holdbacks retained from the Bank’s receivable purchase program originator partners that are classified as other liabilities. Personal deposits, consisting principally of guaranteed investment certificates, are sourced primarily through a well-established and well-diversified deposit broker network that the Bank continues to grow and expand across Canada. Commercial deposits are sourced primarily via specialized chequing accounts made available to insolvency professionals (“Trustees”) in the Canadian insolvency industry. The Bank developed customized banking software for use by Trustees that integrates banking services with the market-leading software platform used in the administration of consumer bankruptcy and proposal restructuring proceedings. VB’s cost of funds for the quarter was 1.54%, unchanged from last quarter and down 16 bps from a year ago. VB’s low cost of funds enables it to earn industry leading NIM without taking on increased credit risk typically necessary to achieve higher yields.\nCapital – As at January 31, 2018, VB’s CET1 ratio was 10.68%, down 8 bps from last quarter and up 40 bps from a year ago. VB, like most small banks, uses the Standardized Approach to calculate its risk weighted assets and because VB focuses on commercial and consumer loans with lower than average risk (as demonstrated by its long history of low provision for credit losses), it believes the Standardized Approach does not properly reflect the intrinsic risk in its lending assets. As a consequence, VB’s leverage ratio is conservative, being more than twice the average leverage ratio of the major Canadian banks, which use the AIRB approach to calculate their risk weighted assets.\nCredit Quality – For the quarter ended January 31, 2018 the Bank recorded a net provision for credit losses (“PCL”) in the amount of $65,000 compared to $116,000 last quarter and $303,000 a year ago. Further, as at January 31, 2018, total gross impaired loans were approximately 0.04% of total lending assets and the Bank’s PCL as a percentage of average loans continues to be one of the lowest in the industry at 0.02%, which is approximately one tenth of what is reported by the major Canadian banks, reflecting the very low risk profile of the Bank’s lending portfolio. VB’s business strategy involves taking lower credit risk, but achieving greater NIM by lending in niche markets that are not well served by the larger financial institutions.\nVersaVault Inc . — VersaVault Inc. (“VV”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank and was formed to create a highly secure and private digital storage facility. VV is targeting spring to have a prototype ready for testing.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n(unaudited) for the three months ended January 31 October 31 January 31 ($CDN thousands except per share amounts) 2018 2017 2017 Results of operations Net interest income $ 12,395 $ 11,508 $ 11,145 Non-interest income 12 13 287 Total revenue 12,407 11,521 11,432 Provision for credit losses 65 116 303 Non-interest expenses 6,890 7,500 6,458 Restructuring charges - - 470 Core cash earnings* 5,905 4,650 4,671 Net income 3,976 2,822 11,864 Income per common share: Basic $ 0.16 $ 0.11 $ 0.56 Diluted $ 0.16 $ 0.11 $ 0.56 Yield* 4.41% 4.22% 4.24% Cost of funds* 1.54% 1.54% 1.70% Net interest margin* 2.87% 2.68% 2.54% Return on average common equity* 7.50% 5.06% 27.22% Core cash return on average common equity* 11.75% 9.13% 9.92% Book value per common share* $ 8.64 $ 8.48 $ 8.20 Efficiency ratio* 56% 65% 56% Return on average total assets 0.81% 0.53% 2.58% Gross impaired loans to total loans 0.04% 0.04% 0.00% Provision for credit losses as a % of average loans 0.02% 0.01% 0.02% as at Balance Sheet Summary Cash and securities $ 84,658 $ 160,171 $ 135,949 Loans, net of allowance for credit losses 1,577,675 1,520,857 1,590,470 Average loans* 1,549,266 1,527,875 1,577,041 Total assets 1,706,613 1,725,049 1,773,004 Average assets* 1,715,832 1,704,786 1,738,702 Deposits 1,353,142 1,376,006 1,430,359 Subordinated notes payable 9,799 9,786 14,095 Shareholders' equity 211,752 208,541 202,583 Capital ratios* Risk-weighted assets $ 1,473,420 $ 1,420,276 $ 1,403,760 Total capital 192,639 188,126 183,514 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio 10.68% 10.76% 10.28% Tier 1 capital ratio 12.67% 12.82% 12.37% Total capital ratio 13.07% 13.25% 13.07% Leverage ratio 10.34% 10.06% 9.45% * This is a non-GAAP measure.
