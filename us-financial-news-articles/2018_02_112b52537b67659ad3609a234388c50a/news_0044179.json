With the data from the three Spanish cave sites described in the journal Science, Pike and colleagues believe they finally have rock-solid proof.\nThe early cave art at La Pasiega, Maltravieso and Ardales includes lines, dots, discs and hand stencils - and creating them would have involved specific skills, such as mixing pigments and selecting appropriate display locations.\nA colour-enhanced hand stencil from the Maltravieso Cave, made by a Neanderthal is seen in Pasiega, Spain in this photo obtained February 21, 2018. Univeristy of Southampton/Handout via REUTERS The Neanderthals living in the same land that would one day give birth to Diego Velazquez and Pablo Picasso also needed the intellectual ability to think symbolically, like modern humans.\nScientists used a precise dating system based on the radioactive decay of uranium isotopes into thorium to assess the age of the paintings. This involved scraping a few milligrams of calcium carbonate deposit from the paintings for analysis.\nSlideshow (3 Images) A second related study published in Science Advances found that dyed and decorated marine shells from a different Spanish cave also dated back to pre-human times.\nTaken together, the researchers said their work suggested that Neanderthals were “cognitively indistinguishable” from early modern humans.\nJoao Zilhao of the University of Barcelona said the new findings meant the search for the origins of human cognition needed to go back to the common ancestor of both Neanderthals and modern humans more than 500,000 years ago.\nNeanderthals died out about 40,000 years ago, soon after direct ancestors arrived in Europe. It is unclear what killed them off, although theories include an inability to adapt to climate change and increased competition from modern humans.\nIf they were still alive today, Pike believes they could well have gone on develop complex art and technology.\n“If they had been given the time, the resources and the population, then they might have ended up in some version of the world we live in today.”\nReporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T21:34:20.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
