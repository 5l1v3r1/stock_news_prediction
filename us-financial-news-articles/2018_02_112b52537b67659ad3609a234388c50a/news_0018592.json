There’s too many in summer sports,” he joked.\n“I really want to sort of be a, I guess, a role model to just encourage other people that it is possible to do these things ... I’ve shown that’s it’s not easy but it’s definitely do-able.”\nBoth Windsor’s parents have ancestry from different Aboriginal tribes, his mother Josie having grown up in a camp without power or running water in rural New South Wales.\nFigure Skating - ISU Four Continents Figure Skating Championships 2018 - Pairs Short Program - Taipei, Taiwan - January 24, 2018 - Ekaterina Alexandrovskaya and Harley Windsor of Australia compete.
