Woodside Petroleum, the operator of the North West Shelf joint venture was not immediately available for comment. \nThe arbitration relates to a difference over an agreed price renegotiation during a mid-term supply contract, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. \nSouth Korea imports most of its LNG through the country’s sole LNG wholesaler KOGAS, which brings in over 30-31 million tonnes per year of LNG, mainly from Qatar and Australia.
