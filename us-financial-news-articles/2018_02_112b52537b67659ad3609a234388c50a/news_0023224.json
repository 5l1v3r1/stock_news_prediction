I just hope I represented my team mates well. I don’t think there’s a single athlete that would turn that down.” \nHamlin, who will retire after the Games, became the first American female luger to win an Olympic medal when she won bronze in Sochi four years ago. \nDavis had tweeted that the coin toss was a “dishonorable” method to decide and added the hashtag “BlackHistoryMonth2018”, suggesting racial bias was involved. He declined to march at the opening ceremony. \nHamlin’s fellow luger Summer Britcher defended her team mate’s right to carry the flag and said Davis’s reaction was “unnecessary”. \n“It was a fair process to decide the flag-bearer. It was a process that was decided over a year ago, how it would be decided,” she told Reuters. \n“She definitely deserved that honor and she carried it with pride.” Editing by Clare Fallon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T11:30:26.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
