Competitive threats to its respiratory and HIV businesses are seen as key risks for the company’s stock.\nAstraZeneca rose 2.1 percent, boosted by a price target upgrade from Berenberg.\nTheir gains however were more than offset by broad-based weakness as markets remained nervous following a sell-off earlier this week triggered by a spike in global yields and volatility.\nThe FTSE was down 0.4 percent at 7,246.5 points by 0923 GMT, and it is down 5.8 percent in the year to date, making it the worst perfomer among top European bourses.\nMiners were the biggest weight on the FTSE, wiping 13.7 points off the index, as prices of copper and other metals fell.\nPrecious metals miner Randgold fell 2.7 percent after HSBC raised its rating on the stock but trimmed its price target. Antofagasta and BHP Billiton were also down more than 2 percent.\nWPP rose 2.4 percent following a reassuring update from French peer Publicis, while Compass, the world’s biggest catering firm, jumped 5 percent after it raised its expectations for revenue growth.\nAmong midcaps, Sophos fell as much as 18 percent after the cloud services provider reported slower growth in the amount it bills its customers, while TalkTalk slumped after flagging a dividend cut and a cash call.\nThe focus later in the session will turn to the Bank of England. The BoE is expected to say that another interest rate increase could be nearing as Britain’s economy grows faster than expected ahead of its departure from the European Union in just over a year’s time.\nInvestors also want to see what the central bank’s updated forecasts for the economy say about its rate plans.\n“We expect the MPC to remain on hold this year but risks are increasingly skewed towards an earlier hike, possibly as soon as May,” said UniCredit analysts in a note.\nDomestically exposed banks, which typically benefit from rising rates, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds fell 0.6 percent, broadly in line with the broader market.
