(\"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"TCPC\" or the \"Company\"), a business development company (\"BDC\") (NASDAQ: TCPC), today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and filed its Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nNet investment income after taxes for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $23.9 million, or $0.41 per share on a diluted basis, net of $0.10 per share in incentive compensation. Net investment income after taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $90.7 million, or $1.59 per share on a diluted basis, net of $0.40 per share in incentive compensation. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $13.6 million, or $0.23 per share. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $67.9 million, or $1.19 per share. Net asset value per share at December 31, 2017 decreased to $14.80 from $14.92 at September 30, 2017 and $14.91 at December 31, 2016. Total acquisitions during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $213.0 million and total dispositions were $221.6 million. Total acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017 were a record $865.4 million and total dispositions were a record $655.7 million. On November 3, 2017, we issued an additional $50.0 million of unsecured notes that mature on August 11, 2022 (the \"2022 Notes), bringing the total outstanding principal of the 2022 Notes to $175.0 million. The 2022 Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.125%, payable semi-annually, and all principal is due upon maturity. On February 26, 2018, we established a new $100 million revolving, multi-currency credit facility with ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent (the \"Credit Facility\"). The Credit Facility matures on February 28, 2022 and generally bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. This new credit facility replaces the previous SVCP Revolver which generally bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.5%. On February 27, 2018, our board of directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.36 per share payable on March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 16, 2018.\n\"We are pleased with results for the fourth quarter of 2017. We out-earned our dividend by $0.05, demonstrating the earnings power of our portfolio,\" said Howard Levkowitz, TCP Capital Corp. Chairman and CEO. \"Our robust direct origination platform enables us to grow our portfolio while continuing to be highly selective and disciplined in our investing. We are also pleased to have the continued support of the capital markets, as demonstrated by our follow-on issuance of unsecured notes during the quarter at an attractive price and our closing of a new revolving credit facility yesterday at an attractive rate.\"\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nAs of December 31, 2017, our investment portfolio consisted of debt and equity positions in 96 portfolio companies with a total fair value of approximately $1.51 billion. Debt positions represented approximately 95% of the portfolio at fair value, the majority of which were senior secured debt. Equity positions, including equity interests in portfolios of debt and lease assets, represented approximately 5%.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the weighted average annual effective yield of our debt portfolio was approximately 11.0%. (1) As of December 31, 2017, approximately 89% of our debt portfolio at fair value had floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had one debt investment on non-accrual status, representing zero percent of the portfolio at fair value.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, we invested approximately $213.0 million, primarily in thirteen investments, comprised of ten new and three existing portfolio companies. The investments were comprised of approximately $171.4 million in senior secured loans and $37.9 million in senior secured notes. The remaining $3.7 million was comprised of equity investments, including $3.5 million of additional equity interests in portfolios of debt and lease assets as well as warrants received in connection with a new debt investment. Additionally, we received proceeds from sales and repayments of investment principal of approximately $221.6 million. We expect to continue to invest in senior secured loans, bonds and subordinated debt, as well as select equity investments, to obtain a high level of current income and create the potential for appreciation, with an emphasis on principal protection.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $1,629.4 million, net assets applicable to common shareholders were $870.7 million and net asset value per share was $14.80, as compared to $1,642.1 million, $877.4 million, and $14.92 per share, respectively, as of September 30, 2017 and $1,387.6 million, $790.9 million, and $14.91 per share, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTotal investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $47.1 million, or $0.80 per share, including $0.09 per share from prepayment premiums and related accelerated original issue discount amortization, $0.04 per share from recurring original issue discount amortization and $0.02 per share from recurring income paid in kind. This reflects our policy of recording interest income, adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts, on an accrual basis. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment, and similar upfront fees received in connection with the outlay of capital are generally amortized into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment.\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $17.2 million, or $0.29 per share, including interest and other debt expenses of $9.0 million, or $0.15 per share. We also incurred incentive compensation from net investment income of $6.0 million, or $0.10 per share. Excluding incentive compensation, interest and other debt expenses, annualized fourth quarter expenses were 3.7% of average net assets.\nNet investment income after excise taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $29.9 million, or $0.51 per share, before incentive compensation. Net investment income after excise taxes and incentive compensation was $23.9 million, or $0.41 per share.\nNet realized and unrealized losses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 of $10.3 million, or $0.18 per share, were comprised primarily of markdowns of $2.8 million on GreenBiologics, $2.3 million on Real Mex, and $2.3 million on the sale of our Contextmedia loan. Realized losses of $9.1 million consisted primarily of $7.1 million of Globecomm, which was triggered by a recapitalization. Globecomm was previously written down and is still held by the Company.\nNet increase in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $13.6 million, or $0.23 per share.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2017, available liquidity was approximately $371.6 million, comprised of approximately $301.0 million in available capacity under our leverage program and $86.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, less approximately $16.0 million in net outstanding settlements.\nThe combined weighted-average interest rate on debt outstanding at December 31, 2017 was 4.13%, excluding non-pooled SBA Debentures which bore interest at a temporary rate of 1.79%.\nNet debt outstanding at December 31, 2017 was as follows:\nMaturity\nRate\nCarrying Value (1)\nAvailable\nTotal Capacity\nSVCP Revolver\n2018\nL+2.50% (2)\n$\n57,000,000\n$\n59,000,000\n$\n116,000,000\n2019 Convertible Notes ($108 million par)\n2019\n5.25%\n107,011,061\n—\n107,011,061\n2022 Convertible Notes ($140 million par)\n2022\n4.625%\n137,405,870\n—\n137,405,870\n2022 Notes ($175 million par)\n2022\n4.125%\n174,407,422\n—\n174,407,422\nTCPC Funding Facility\n2021\nL+2.50% (3)\n175,000,000\n175,000,000\n350,000,000\nSBA Debentures\n2024-2028\n2.57% (4)\n83,000,000\n67,000,000\n150,000,000\nTotal debt\n$ 733,824,353\n$\n301,000,000\n$\n1,034,824,353\nUnamortized issuance costs\n(8,624,072)\nDebt, net of unamortized issuance costs\n725,200,281\nCash\n(86,625,237)\nDebt, net of cash and unamortized issuance costs\n$\n638,575,044\n(1)\nExcept for the convertible notes and the 2022 Notes, all carrying values are the same as the principal amounts outstanding\n(2)\nBased on either LIBOR or the lender's cost of funds, subject to certain limitations\n(3)\nOr L+2.25% subject to certain funding requirements\n(4)\nWeighted-average interest rate on pooled loans, excluding fees of 0.36%. As of December 31, 2017, $8.0 million of the outstanding amount was not yet pooled, and bore interest at a temporary rate of 1.79% plus fees of 0.35% through March 20, 2018, the date of the next SBA pooling.\nOn February 21, 2018, our board of directors re-approved our stock repurchase plan to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There were no stock repurchases during the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn February 26, 2018, we established a new $100 million revolving, multi-currency credit facility with ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent (the \"Credit Facility\"). The Credit facility matures on February 28, 2022 and generally bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. This new credit facility replaces the previous SVCP Revolver which generally bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.5%.\nOn February 27, 2018, our board of directors declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.36 per share payable on March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nTCP Capital Corp. will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its financial results.
