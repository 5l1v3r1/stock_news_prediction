On the other hand, the impact of such easing on bank profits is cumulative,” Suzuki told a news conference after meeting business leaders in Wakayama, western Japan. \n“If it becomes clear that more time would be needed (to achieve the BOJ’s price target), there’s a chance of modifying our policy framework to make it more sustainable and allow us to continue monetary easing for a longer period of time,” he said.
