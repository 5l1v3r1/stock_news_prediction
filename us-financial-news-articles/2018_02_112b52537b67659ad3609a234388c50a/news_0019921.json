Investors typically also pay up for protection in the future, creating a gap between “implied” volatility in the future and “realized” volatility that already happened. That difference created extra profits for investors who were “short” volatility. \nCredit Suisse said on Tuesday it would terminate the second-largest publicly traded product betting on future swings in the S&P 500 after its value plunged during the global market rout.
