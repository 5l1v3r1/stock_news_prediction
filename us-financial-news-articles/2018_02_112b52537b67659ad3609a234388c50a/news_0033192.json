Bani Walid hospital manager Mohamed al-Mabrouk said the truck flipped over about 80 km (50 miles) south of Bani Walid. At least 78 people had been injured, eight of them seriously, he said. “We did not receive the driver (at the hospital), and we don’t know what has happened to him,” said Mabrouk. “Most likely he’s survived otherwise he would be brought here.” A total of 124 Somali and Eritrean migrants were brought to the hospital after the crash, officials and aid workers said. Women and children were among the casualties. One aid worker who was at the scene said around 250 people were believed to have been on the truck when it swerved off the road at about 3 a.m. He said about 50 migrants are thought to have fled.

Most of the injured who were brought there did not have beds, and medical staff used a water container to support one man’s broken leg. Some of those critically injured were transferred to the capital, Tripoli. A migrant who was injured in a truck crash, lies on a bed at a hospital in Bani Walid town, Libya, February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Hani Amara Bani Walid, located 145 km (90 miles) south of Tripoli, is a hub for smugglers who bring sub-Saharan migrants by road from neighboring countries up toward Libya’s Mediterranean coast. They are often held and transported in brutal conditions, passed between smugglers who take payments for different stages of the journey and extort money from migrants. From northern Libya, many of the migrants are put out to sea by smugglers in flimsy inflatable dinghies, hoping to be picked up by international ships and brought to Italy. More than 600,000 have made the crossing since 2014. Irregular migration is considered a crime in Libya, though authorities often collude with smugglers.
