Brent, the global benchmark, rose 76 cents, or 1.1%, to $69.65 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. \nOil prices fell earlier this week but have started to march higher again, with investors betting that strong demand and continued cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will keep the market tight. Growing crude production in the U.S. has helped to keep a lid on price increases. Photo: staff/Reuters \n“We had pullback on profit-taking on back of signs that U.S. production levels are increasing. It seems like that hasn’t lasted too long and we’re back to focusing on stronger fundamental picture and the weak dollar,” said Eugene McGillian, research manager at Tradition Energy. \nA weaker dollar makes oil less expensive for foreign buyers, so oil prices sometimes rise when the dollar falls. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently down 0.31%. \nWhile overall stockpiles of crude in the U.S. rose last week, the amount in storage at the main hub in Cushing, Okla., fell by more than 2 million barrels, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And since prices oil to be delivered months in the future are now cheaper than near term prices, it doesn’t pay for companies to sock more oil away—that could prevent more oil from building up in storage again. \n“That suggests further draws—it’s expensive to carry it from one month to the next—why hang on to it?” said Donald Morton, senior vice president of Herbert J. Sims & Co., who oversees an energy trading desk. \nThat is one reason analysts at Goldman Sachs raised their forecasts for oil prices. They are now predicting that Brent prices will rise to $75 in the next three months and to $82.50 in the next six months. \n“The rebalancing of the oil market has likely been achieved, six months sooner than we had expected,” the analysts said. “The decline in excess inventories was fast-forwarded in late 2017 by stellar demand growth, high OPEC compliance, heavy maintenance as well as collapsing Venezuela production.” \n“Gasoline should be building at this time of year, so the draw in gasoline, that was what stands out,” said Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Standard Chartered . \nMr. Horsnell added that the 300,000 barrels a day increase in gasoline demand in January, compared with the same period a year ago, was also supportive. \nGasoline futures rose 0.11% to $1.8958 a gallon. Diesel futures rose 1.16% to $2.0904 a gallon. \nKeeping prices in check was a fresh weekly record for U.S. crude output of 9.9 million barrels a day, EIA data showed. \nIn November, U.S. monthly output exceeded 10 million barrels a day for the first time since 1970, as shale producers responded to the rally in prices which began mid-2017. \nConsultancy JBC Energy said in a note that U.S. output of 11 million barrels a day toward the end of 2018 “is clearly a feasible goal.” \nWrite to Alison Sider at and Sarah McFarlane at Editors' Picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:53:16.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
