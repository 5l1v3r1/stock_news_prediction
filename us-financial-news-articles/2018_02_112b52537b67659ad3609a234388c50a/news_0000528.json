Morgan analyst Seth Seifman wrote in a note.\nThe Wichita, Kansas-based company’s shares fell as much as 5.2 percent to $97.56, posting their biggest intraday percentage loss in nine months.\nSpirit Aero forecast 2018 earnings in the range of $6.25 to $6.50 per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $5.85, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company predicted revenue of $7.1 billion to $7.2 billion, compared with analysts’ expectation of $7.13 billion.\nIn August, Spirit Aero reached an agreement with Boeing on pricing terms related to parts it supplies for aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner.\nThe deal reduced uncertainty over pricing that has long existed with Boeing and preserved the company’s ability to meet long-term cash flow goals.\nSpirit Aero, which on Friday increased its share repurchase authorization up to $1 billion, earned $1.32 per share on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, beating the average estimate of $1.21. nCNWVTPBVa]\nTotal revenue rose 9.2 percent to $1.71 billion and was above the $1.66 billion expected by analysts.\nUp to Thursday’s close, Spirit Aero’s stock had risen about 85 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 65.6 percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace index.
