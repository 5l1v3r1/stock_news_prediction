Hailing a “new dawn” a day after his inauguration almost two weeks ago, the 65-year-old promised to fight corruption, which had weakened the economy of Africa’s most industrialized nation under Zuma, and to trim a bloated cabinet.

REUTERS/Sumaya Hisham/File Photo/ Zuma fired Nene as finance minister in December 2015, replacing him with unknown parliamentary backbencher Des van Rooyen. He was then forced to sack van Rooyen and reappoint a previous finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, four days later after the rand collapsed. ANC deputy president David Mabuza was named Deputy President of South Africa. Gordhan, who was fired by Zuma last March, was also reappointed to the cabinet, handed the key public enterprises department, which oversees around 300 state-owned firms, including loss-making South African Airways and cash-strapped power utility Eskom. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who narrowly lost to Ramaphosa in an ANC leadership election in December, was named as minister in the presidency responsible for planning and monitoring. The rand firmed against the dollar in volatile trade, ahead of the announcement, and was steady after Ramaphosa spelt out the changes.
