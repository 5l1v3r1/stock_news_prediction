Both ministers are still in their jobs as caretakers but a new coalition cabinet will soon be named. \nOther agricultural policies agreed for the new government include a formalisation of the current ban on growing crops containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Germany and an expansion of organic farming, the draft deal said. \nAn animal welfare food label will also be introduced for meat produced using farming methods with high care standards. \nThe new government will oppose patents on animals or plants and will not accept cloning of animals for food production. \nEuropean Union farming support should remain at around current levels, it said. \nThe EU is considering reforms to its huge farm subsidy programme from 2020 which faces a big loss of funding following Britain's withdraw from the EU.
