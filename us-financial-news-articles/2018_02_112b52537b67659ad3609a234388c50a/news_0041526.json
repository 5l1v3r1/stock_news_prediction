It was carrying 60 passengers and six crew, he said. \nIranian carriers at times have struggled with poor safety records, hobbled by a lack of access to spare parts and new planes for aging fleets because of yearslong Western sanctions. \nThe crash Sunday also marked a setback for aviation security globally. The incident marks the second major fatal accident this month after the global airline industry avoided fatalities in commercial jetliner operations during all of 2017. A Russian plane crashed on Feb. 11, killing all 71 people aboard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T23:47:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
