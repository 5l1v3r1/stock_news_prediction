I couldn’t let myself believe that it would go this well,” Mona Brorsson told Reuters.\n“I was in getting changed and I didn’t have so much hope for the last leg, I didn’t know where she was at the exchange, and there was a gap to the top and they had good racers on the last leg too,” Anna Magnusson said.\n“Then when Hanna left the last shoot in third place, I thought we’re going to get a medal, she’s not going to let this go. I felt safe in that,” Magnusson added.\nLead-off racer Linn Persson had perhaps the worst weather conditions to contend with.\n“It was tough, it was hard. Especially on the shooting range I felt the wind was blowing a lot,” she said.\nBut Oeberg, who shot to stardom in her home country following her win in the individual race, never doubted that she could close the gap.\n“I believed that it was possible. I saw the relay earlier and I saw that there was big swings earlier in the race. When I went out I thought I’d do all I could and if I can focus on the shooting range it could take us far,” Oeberg told Reuters.\n“Maybe I didn’t believe that it would take us all the way to a medal, but when I went out after the last shoot, it was just a case of going for it” she added.\nIn doing so, she completed a comeback fit for a king.\n“It looked so difficult, it looked very hard, but we were saying in this group that I was standing with that you can never give up,” the king said after congratulating Sweden’s medal winners. “There’s always a chance in this sport.” (Reporting by Philip O‘Connor, editing by Ed Osmond)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:31:36.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
