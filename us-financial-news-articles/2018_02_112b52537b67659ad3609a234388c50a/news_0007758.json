Shareholders would also have 10 to 20 percent of the commercial activities transferred to the new company and be entitled to dividends.\nThe deal would maintain the government’s so-called golden share in Embraer, a former state enterprise, giving it veto power over certain strategic decisions, including Boeing’s current push for a tie-up.\nThe plan - if supported by the government and Embraer - could be presented to shareholders for approval as soon as the second quarter, the newspaper said. Further meetings between Boeing and the government will not occur until after the Carnival holiday, which ends next week, it reported.\nBoeing and Embraer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nReporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Kirsten Donovan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T13:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T13:43:35.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
