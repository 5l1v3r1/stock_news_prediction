A softening but still resilient property market, however, will be welcome news ahead of the annual parliament meeting in March where leaders will set economic targets for 2018.\nThe data marks the first price decline in tier one cities in more than two years, said Yan Yuejin, an analyst with Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute.\nPurchase restrictions are also trickling down into lower-tier cities, while monetary policy tightening is leading to higher mortgage rates.\n“Tier two and three cities will probably experience a similar decline,” he said.\nThose have started knocking some heat off the market. Property sales have slowed across three different tiers in January by more than 10 percent in 15 major cities monitored by China Index Academy, a private property research firm.\nOfficial property sales and investment data for January-February will be released by the Statistics Bureau on March 14.\nBut demand appeared to be more resilient than expected amid government moves to support “rigid demand” of first-time buyers and upgraders by relaxing some purchase restrictions.\nThe central Chinese city of Wuhan, for example, announced a pilot programme in February that allows first-time buyers priority in winning new home purchase bids.\nSome analysts noted that China’s housing market is becoming increasingly polarised, as prices in some smaller cities with no purchase restrictions picked up visibly but were flat or declined slightly month-on-month in most of the biggest cities.\nAdditional reporting by Yawen Chen; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T06:47:12.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
