After this period, the company plans to refinance the debt facility – and potentially raise more funds for additional capex plans – through the issue of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds.\nOne of the sources said the loan would be finalised as soon as possible this year, but that the exact timeline was not clear.\nOman Gas was established in 2000 with a 27-year concession to own, construct and operate natural gas facilities in Oman, according to its website.
