The case is \"if you want any return, it's the only place to go,\" he said. \nA decline of at least 10 percent from recent highs is definition of a correction. A plunge of at least 20 percent from recent highs is the definition of a bear market. \nThe last 5 percent pullback was about a year and a half ago; the last 10 percent correction was mid-2015 to early 2016; while the last bear market was during the 2008 financial crisis. \nThe S&P 500 was off to a roaring start to 2018 before last week's stumbles. \nHowever, the index was still up nearly 30 percent, as of Friday's close, since Donald Trump was elected president in November 2016. \nJames said the Republican tax law could indeed provide stimulus to an already strengthening economy, which could actually be a negative for stocks. \n\"I'm not sure we need stimulus right now,\" he said. \"If you're worried about interest rates and inflation, the stimulus could be the thing that tips us over into a rate spike.\" \nRates in the bond market have already been spiking. The 10-year Treasury yield Monday morning was trading around 2.8 percent, around four-year highs. \nBut James did question how much the corporate tax cut will actually boost companies' bottom lines. \"One thing the market is over-estimating is much added earning that tax cut is will bring.\" Morning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup \nSign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
