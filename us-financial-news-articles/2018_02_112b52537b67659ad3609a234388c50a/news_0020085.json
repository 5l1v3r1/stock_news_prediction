Bacon and eggs. Egg salad. Eggs on toast. Scrambled eggs, or fried. After taking receipt of 15,000 eggs instead of the 1,500 they wanted, Norway’s team at this month’s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics may have a pretty limited menu.\nNorwegian chef de mission Tore Ovrebo struggled to suggest what they will do with the delivery, but did not rule out consuming them. Their registered 121-strong delegation of athletes and officials would get plenty of protein, eating 124 eggs each.\n“The eggs was more like a misunderstanding than something that we needed, so it was an extra zero on the order, so 1,500 to 15,000,” he said with a rueful laugh.\nFILE PHOTO: Volunteers for the upcoming 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games walk in Pyeongchang, South Korea, January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch “They will probably use them I guess and I don’t know, maybe the people that supplied us with them will take them back I don’t know. It’s not a big issue.”\nOvrebo said it was important to enjoy the Games as well as scramble for medals.\n“The aim is to have fun, and be as good friends when we go back as when we came here. In the meantime we are hoping for 30 medals.”\nWhile friendship is the aim, it isn’t always possible in the fiercely competitive world of Olympic sports. After all, you can’t make an omelet without cracking eggs.\nWriting by Peter Rutherford; Editing by Ossian Shine\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T07:46:08.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
