Guzman’s lawyer, Eduardo Balarezo, has asked Cogan to reconsider that ruling.\nA motorcade believed to be transporting Joaquin Guzman the Mexican drug lord known as \"El Chapo,\" crosses the Brooklyn Bridge after departing the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse, in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., February 15, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Near the close of Thursday’s hearing, Balarezo said that Guzman wanted to address the court directly, in order to tell his family to pay his legal fees. Cogan did not allow Guzman to address the court, but did ask him whether he agreed with Balarezo’s statement.\nGuzman said he did, and also began to say that he wanted to talk about his health and jail conditions, before Cogan told him he would consider allowing him to speak at a future hearing.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Lawyers for Guzman have said in court papers that his health has deteriorated during his months in solitary confinement.\nBalarezo told reporters outside the courthouse following the hearing that he had been paid part of his fee by some “friends” of Guzman, but that Guzman had so far been unable to instruct his family about further payments.\nMexican authorities captured Guzman and an associate in January 2016 by pulling over a Ford Focus they had stolen, after Guzman had fled through tunnels and drains from a raid on a safe house in northwest Mexico.\nSix months earlier, Guzman had escaped through a tunnel from a high-security Mexican prison. Guzman was extradited to the United States in January 2017.\nReporting By Brendan Pierson; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T21:12:52.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
