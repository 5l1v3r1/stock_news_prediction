Among other changes, the Act reduces the US corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Because the Act became effective mid-way through the Company’s tax year, the Company will have a US statutory income tax rate of 27.7% for the fiscal 2018 and will have a 21% statutory income tax rate for fiscal years thereafter.\nUnder ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the enactment of the Tax Act also requires companies to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and the retroactive effects of changes in tax laws in the period in which the new legislation in enacted. The Company’s gross deferred tax assets and liabilities will be revalued from 35% to 21% with a corresponding offset to the valuation allowance and any potential other taxes arising due to the Tax Act will result in reductions to its net operating loss carryforward and valuation allowance. The Company will continue to analyze the Tax Act to assess the full effects on its financial results, including disclosures, for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.\nPresident and CEO, Timothy R. Damadian said, “We are very pleased with the Company’s second-quarter results. In fact, our income from operations was close to the highest that we have ever achieved. Also, without the reduction in the deferred tax asset, we would have had a year-over-year increase of 11% to $0.70 in Diluted Net Income per Common Share.\n“We are already seeing the positive effects the recent federal tax cuts are having on the economy,” Mr. Damadian continued. “Higher wages and more jobs mean more Americans will be able to afford high-quality healthcare, which translates to increased patient volume at HMCA-managed MRI scanning centers.”\n\"It's rewarding to me,\" said Raymond V. Damadian, M.D., Chairman of the Board of Directors of FONAR Corporation, \"how consistently profitable we are. Our UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ (aka Stand-Up®) MRI scanner, for example, is unique. Its ability to medically visualize the spine of a patient with back pain (which condition is responsible for a very significant percentage of all MRI scans performed by all MRI scanners worldwide each year) in its normal upright position is unique. Its power to visualize the spine supporting the full weight load that it normally has to sustain each day and to position the patient in the exact position (that he/she specifies to the MRI technologist who is positioning him/her in the FONAR UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI) that generates his/her pain (which the conventional recumbent MRI cannot do) is unparalleled.\"\n\"This power of the FONAR UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI to completely visualize ALL the anatomy components under their full weight load that are giving rise to the patient's pain, which the conventional recumbent MRI cannot do, assures that the surgical procedure chosen for his/her treatment will achieve the optimum outcome for the patient.\"\n\"In addition,\" continued Dr. Damadian, \"I am very proud of the fact that it has been 7 years since FONAR has had a quarterly loss. This is something we have all worked very hard to achieve.\"\nAbout FONAR\nFONAR, The Inventor of MR Scanning ™, is located in Melville, NY, was incorporated in 1978, and is the first, oldest and most experienced MRI company in the industry. FONAR introduced the world’s first commercial MRI in 1980, and went public in 1981. FONAR’s signature product is the FONAR UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI (also known as the Stand-Up® MRI), the only whole-body MRI that performs Position™ Imaging (pMRI™) and scans patients in numerous weight-bearing positions, i.e. standing, sitting, in flexion and extension, as well as the conventional lie-down position. The FONAR UPRIGHT® MRI often detects patient problems that other MRI scanners cannot because they are lie-down and “weightless” only scanners. The patient-friendly UPRIGHT® MRI has a near-zero patient claustrophobic rejection rate. As a FONAR customer states, “If the patient is claustrophobic in this scanner, they’ll be claustrophobic in my parking lot.” Approximately 85% of patients are scanned sitting while watching TV.\nFONAR has new works-in-progress technology for visualizing and quantifying the cerebral hydraulics of the central nervous system, the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) , which circulates throughout the brain and vertebral column at the rate of 32 quarts per day. This imaging and quantifying of the dynamics of this vital life-sustaining physiology of the body’s neurologic system has been made possible first by FONAR’s introduction of the MRI and now by this latest works-in-progress method for quantifying CSF in all the normal positions of the body, particularly in its upright flow against gravity. Patients with whiplash or other neck injuries are among those who will benefit from this new understanding.\nFONAR’s substantial list of patents includes recent patents for its technology enabling full weight-bearing MRI imaging of all the gravity sensitive regions of the human anatomy, especially the brain, extremities and spine. It includes its newest technology for measuring the Upright cerebral hydraulics of the central nervous system. FONAR’s UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI is the only scanner licensed under these patents.\nUPRIGHT® and STAND-UP® are registered trademarks and The Inventor of MR Scanning™ , Full Range of Motion™, Multi-Position™ , Upright Radiology™, The Proof is in the Picture™ , True Flow™, pMRI™ , Spondylography™, Dynamic™ , Spondylometry™, CSP™ , and Landscape™, are trademarks of FONAR Corporation.\nThis release may include forward-looking statements from the company that may or may not materialize.
