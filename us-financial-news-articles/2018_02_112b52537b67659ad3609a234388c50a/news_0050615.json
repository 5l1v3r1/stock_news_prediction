While weight loss was also observed for two lower doses, they did not reach statistical significance.\nImportantly, nausea was not a major problem with the new pill, as some experts had feared.\nThe company's shares rose on the news and traded 3.7 percent higher by 1230 GMT.\nThe once-daily pill belongs to a blockbuster class of treatments known as GLP-1s that stimulate insulin production, the first of which were derived from the venomous bite of North America's Gila monster lizard. So far, all have been injections.\nUBS analyst Michael Leuchten said the blood sugar reductions were as good if not better than those achieved with two successful injectable GLP-1 medicines — Lilly's Trulicity and Novo's own Victoza.\nThe fact that mild-to-moderate nausea was reported in just 5 to 16 percent of patients — less than nausea levels observed with injections — was also a positive surprise.\nNovo Nordisk said it aims to provide data from the remaining nine trials this year and expects to submit the drug for regulatory approval in 2019, ahead of the drug's potential 2020 launch.\nDoctors believe oral semaglutide will provide a new weapon to tackle diabetes earlier with a highly effective therapy, especially in patients who are reluctant to start on injections. But price will be critical in determining its uptake both among U.S. insurers and cost-conscious European health-care systems.\nRelated Securities Symbol Price Change %Change LLY --- NOVO.B --- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:00:02.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
