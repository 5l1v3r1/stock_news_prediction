If that is not possible, then resolution is the alternative,” he said, referring to a possible winding-down.\n“The business can be restructured without resolution,” Reinfelds said. He said the bank was “systemic”, meaning that it was so important for Latvia’s financial system that its problems could spill over to affect others.\nReporting By John O'Donnell; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:35:26.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
