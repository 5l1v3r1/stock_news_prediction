A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder’s investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per share.\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nFund Performance and Distribution Rate Information: Fund Average annual\ntotal return (in\nrelation to NAV) for\nthe 5-year period\nending on\n12/31/2017\nAnnualized current\ndistribution rate expressed\nas a percentage of NAV\nas of 12/31/2017\nCumulative total\nreturn (in relation\nto NAV) for the\nfiscal year through\n12/31/2017\nCumulative fiscal\nyear distributions as\na percentage of\nNAV as of\n12/31/2017\nBCX 1.84% 5.82% 15.60% 0.48% BDJ 11.24% 5.63% 15.06% 0.47% BGR 0.41% 5.89% 3.56% 0.49% BGY 4.80% 6.46% 20.88% 0.54% BME 16.85% 6.72% 22.21% 0.56% BOE 7.93% 7.08% 17.22% 0.59% BUI 9.26% 6.88% 16.62% 0.57% CII 13.17% 5.78% 21.69% 0.48% BST* 19.73% 5.63% 45.73% 0.47% * Portfolio launched within the past 5 years; the performance and distribution rate information presented for this Fund reflects data from inception to 12/31/2017.\nShareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s current distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan.\nAbout BlackRock\nBlackRock helps investors build better financial futures.
