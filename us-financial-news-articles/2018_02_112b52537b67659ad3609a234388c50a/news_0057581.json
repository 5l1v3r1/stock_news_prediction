But its 21.5-metre (64-foot) width means it is not a key waterway for ocean-going vessels.\nLocal station Korinthos TV showed chunks of rock which had peeled off the canal’s steep walls and fallen into the waterway.\n“The coastguard was notified today, went to the spot and after seeing the landslide, banned ships from sailing,” a Greek coastguard official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.\nThe canal’s operator will need about 15 days to restore it, the official said.\nFirst conceptualized in ancient times, the canal took some 11 years to be built and start operations in 1893.\nReporting by Angeliki Koutantou; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:59:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
