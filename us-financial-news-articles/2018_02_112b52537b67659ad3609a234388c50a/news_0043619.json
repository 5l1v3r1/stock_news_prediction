(NYSE: DIN), the parent company of Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar® and IHOP® restaurants, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017. Additionally, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018. The dividend will be payable on April 6, 2018 to the Company's stockholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2018. The Company also announced that it will change its name to Dine Brands Global, Inc., effective February 20, 2018, as part of its ongoing transformation strategy.\n\"We continue to make excellent progress against our plan to stabilize and grow performance at both brands. We are working on several exciting initiatives to expand our revenue channels, continually enhance the guest experience, improve operations and grow our global presence while investing in the long-term health of our two strong brands,\" said Stephen P. Joyce, Chief Executive Officer of Dine Brands Global, Inc.\nMr. Joyce continued, \"Our new company name reflects a shift in strategy and a values-based performance culture with greater autonomy and accountability at the brand level. We are focused on returning to a growth company and delivering strong returns to our shareholders. We believe the change in our quarterly dividend to a more appropriate dividend yield will result in a favorable capital allocation framework and provide us the opportunity for meaningful share repurchases, investments in our brands as well as opportunities to scale our business. I am very confident that the steps we are taking will drive sustainable results as we continue to build on the encouraging positive same-restaurant sales and traffic performance of both brands in January.\"\nFourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017 Financial Highlights\nGAAP net income available to common stockholders was $83.0 million, or earnings per diluted share of $4.67 for the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares to net income available to common stockholders of $21.1 million, or earnings per diluted share of $1.18, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in net income was primarily due to a tax benefit of $66.6 million mainly as the result of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a future reduction in our corporate tax rate following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax legislation in December 2017. This item was partially offset by a decline in gross profit. The decrease in gross profit was due to an increase in franchisor contributions to the Applebee's national advertising fund, higher bad debt expense, a reduction in revenue recognized due to the non-collectability of Applebee's franchisee royalties and the impact of restaurant closures. Adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $13.1 million, or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.74, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This compares to adjusted net income available to common stockholders of $24.5 million, or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.37, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in adjusted net income was mainly due to a decline in gross profit, as explained in the previous paragraph. The impact of lower adjusted net income on adjusted earnings per diluted share was partially offset by fewer weighted average diluted shares outstanding. (See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.) General and administrative expenses were approximately $40.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This compares to $37.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was mainly due to higher personnel costs.\nFiscal 2017 Financial Highlights\nGAAP net loss available to common stockholders was $324.0 million, or net loss per diluted share of $18.28 for fiscal 2017. This compares to net income available to common stockholders of $96.6 million, or earnings per diluted share of $5.33, for fiscal 2016. The net loss was primarily due to non-cash impairment charges in fiscal 2017 totaling $531.6 million related to the write-downs in the third quarter of Applebee's goodwill and other intangible assets as well as lower gross profit. These items were partially offset by a tax benefit of $94.8 million primarily as the result of the fourth-quarter revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a future reduction in our corporate tax rate. Adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $73.7 million, or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.15, for fiscal 2017. This compares to adjusted net income available to common stockholders of $108.9 million, or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $6.01, for fiscal 2016. The decrease in adjusted net income was mainly due to lower gross profit and an increase in general and administrative expenses. The decline in gross profit was due to higher bad debt expense, an increase in franchisor contributions to the Applebee's national advertising fund, a reduction in revenue recognized due to the non-collectability of Applebee's franchisee royalties, the impact of restaurant closures and a 5.3% decline in Applebee's domestic system-wide comparable same-restaurant sales. (See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.) General and administrative expenses were $165.7 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $148.9 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to approximately $9 million of non-recurring cash severance and equity compensation charges incurred in the first quarter of 2017 and higher costs for professional services associated with investments in Applebee's stabilization initiatives. Cash flows from operating activities were $65.7 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $118.1 million for fiscal 2016. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from franchise operations and an increase in general and administrative expenses. Adjusted free cash flow was $63.0 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $122.5 million for fiscal 2016. (See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.)\nSame-Restaurant Sales Performance\nFourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017\nApplebee's domestic system-wide comparable same-restaurant sales increased 1.3% for the fourth quarter of 2017. IHOP's domestic system-wide comparable same-restaurant sales modestly declined 0.4% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFiscal 2017\nApplebee's domestic system-wide comparable same-restaurant sales declined 5.3% for fiscal 2017. IHOP's domestic system-wide comparable same-restaurant sales declined 1.9% for fiscal 2017.\nFinancial Performance Guidance for Fiscal 2018\nThe following financial performance guidance for fiscal 2018 is based on management's expectations as of February 20, 2018. The projections are as of this date and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these estimates.\nApplebee's domestic system-wide comparable same-restaurant sales performance is expected to range between flat and positive 3.0%. IHOP's domestic system-wide comparable same-restaurant sales performance is expected to range between flat and positive 3.0%. Applebee's franchisees are expected to develop between 10 and 15 new restaurants globally, the majority of which are expected to be international openings. As part of our ongoing system-wide analysis to optimize the health of the franchisee system, we anticipate the closure of approximately 60 to 80 restaurants. The expected closures will be based on several criteria, including meeting our brand and image standards as well as operational results. IHOP franchisees and its area licensee are expected to develop between 85 and 100 restaurants globally, the majority of which are expected to be domestic openings. We expect the closure of approximately 30 to 40 restaurants. Franchise segment profit is expected to be between approximately $289 million and $307 million. Included in this amount is a one-time $30 million franchise expense that will be contributed to the Applebee's national advertising fund, continuing the 2017 contribution of $9.5 million. We expect the $30 million to be expensed ratably over the first and second quarters of 2018. Rental and Financing segments are expected to generate approximately $37 million in combined profit. General and administrative expenses are expected to range between $147 million and $156 million, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense and depreciation of approximately $21 million. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $61 million. Approximately $3 million is projected to be non-cash interest expense. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 18 million shares. The income tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%. Cash flows provided by operating activities are expected to range between $100 million and $120 million. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $16 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to range from $4.31 to $4.61. Adjusted earnings per diluted share (See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below) is expected to range from $4.95 to $5.25. Adjusted free cash flow (See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below) is expected to range between $94 million and $114 million.\n2018 Adjusted earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) Guidance Table\nGAAP earnings per diluted share\n$4.31-$4.61\nAmortization of intangible assets\n0.57\nClosure and impairment charges\n0.10\nNon-cash interest expense\n0.20\nIncome tax provision for above adjustments at 26%\n(0.23)\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP)\n$4.95-$5.25\n2018 Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) Guidance Table\n(In millions)\nCash flows from operations\n$100 – 120\nApproximate net receipts from notes and equipment contracts receivable\n10\nApproximate capital expenditures\n(16)\nAdjusted free cash flow (Non-GAAP)\n$94 - 114\nInvestor and Analyst Day on February 21, 2018\nThe Company will discuss certain long-term financial projections, business strategy and corporate rebranding during its investor and analyst day on February 21, 2018 in New York City.

You can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"goal\" and other similar expressions. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied in such statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions; our level of indebtedness; compliance with the terms of our securitized debt; our ability to refinance our current indebtedness or obtain additional financing; our dependence on information technology; potential cyber incidents; the implementation of restaurant development plans; our dependence on our franchisees; the concentration of our Applebee's franchised restaurants in a limited number of franchisees; the financial health our franchisees; our franchisees' and other licensees' compliance with our quality standards and trademark usage; general risks associated with the restaurant industry; potential harm to our brands' reputation; possible future impairment charges; the effects of tax reform; trading volatility and fluctuations in the price of our stock; our ability to achieve the financial guidance we provide to investors; successful implementation of our business strategy; the availability of suitable locations for new restaurants; shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of products from third parties or availability of utilities; the management and forecasting of appropriate inventory levels; development and implementation of innovative marketing and use of social media; changing health or dietary preference of consumers; risks associated with doing business in international markets; the results of litigation and other legal proceedings; third-party claims with respect to intellectual property assets; our ability to attract and retain management and other key employees; compliance with federal, state and local governmental regulations; risks associated with our self-insurance; natural disasters or other series incidents; our success with development initiatives outside of our core business; the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards; and other factors discussed from time to time in the Company's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not intend to, nor does it assume any obligation to, update or supplement any forward-looking statements after the date hereof to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes references to the Company's non-GAAP financial measure \"adjusted net income available to common stockholders, \"adjusted earnings per diluted share (Adjusted EPS)\" and \"Adjusted free cash flow.\" Adjusted EPS is computed for a given period by deducting from net income or loss available to common stockholders for such period the effect of any closure and impairment charges, any gain or loss related to debt extinguishment, any intangible asset amortization, any non-cash interest expense, any gain or loss related to the disposition of assets, and other items deemed not reflective of current operations. This is presented on an aggregate basis and a per share (diluted) basis. \"Adjusted free cash flow\" for a given period is defined as cash provided by operating activities, plus receipts from notes and equipment contracts receivable, less capital expenditures. Management may use certain of these non-GAAP financial measures along with the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of the business and to make certain business decisions. Management uses adjusted free cash flow in its periodic assessments of, among other things, the amount of cash dividends per share of common stock and repurchases of common stock and we believe it is important for investors to have the same measure used by management for that purpose. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes. Additionally, adjusted EPS is one of the metrics used in determining payouts under the Company's annual cash incentive plan. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional meaningful information that should be considered when assessing the business and the Company's performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. Adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nDine Brands Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Income (Loss)\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenues:\nFranchise and restaurant revenues\n$\n116,118\n$\n121,711\n$\n475,030\n$\n501,745\nRental revenues\n30,585\n30,291\n121,437\n123,037\nFinancing revenues\n2,072\n2,172\n8,352\n9,191\nTotal revenues\n148,775\n154,174\n604,819\n633,973\nCost of revenues:\nFranchise and restaurant expenses\n48,507\n40,731\n171,983\n162,860\nRental expenses\n22,927\n22,508\n90,592\n91,540\nFinancing expenses\n149\n—\n598\n155\nTotal cost of revenues\n71,583\n63,239\n263,173\n254,555\nGross profit\n77,192\n90,935\n341,646\n379,418\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n—\n—\n531,634\n—\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n39,978\n36,998\n165,679\n148,935\nInterest expense\n15,483\n15,372\n61,979\n61,479\nAmortization of intangible assets\n2,502\n2,501\n10,009\n9,981\nClosure and impairment charges\n162\n1,160\n3,968\n5,092\nLoss (gain) on disposition of assets\n138\n130\n(6,249)\n809\nIncome (loss) before income tax benefit (provision)\n18,929\n34,774\n(425,374)\n153,122\nIncome tax benefit (provision)\n66,607\n(13,427)\n94,835\n(55,130)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n85,536\n$\n21,347\n$\n(330,539)\n$\n97,992\nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders:\nNet income (loss)\n$\n85,536\n$\n21,347\n$\n(330,539)\n$\n97,992\nLess: net (income) loss allocated to unvested participating restricted stock\n(2,563)\n(288)\n6,519\n(1,387)\nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders\n$\n82,973\n$\n21,059\n$\n(324,020)\n$\n96,605\nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders per share:\nBasic\n$\n4.68\n$\n1.18\n$\n(18.28)\n$\n5.36\nDiluted\n$\n4.67\n$\n1.18\n$\n(18.28)\n$\n5.33\nWeighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic\n17,745\n17,826\n17,725\n18,030\nDiluted\n17,764\n17,916\n17,740\n18,125\nDividends declared per common share\n$\n0.97\n$\n0.97\n$\n3.88\n$\n3.73\nDividends paid per common share\n$\n0.97\n$\n0.92\n$\n3.88\n$\n3.68\nDine Brands Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n117,010\n$\n140,535\nReceivables, net\n150,174\n141,389\nRestricted cash\n31,436\n30,256\nPrepaid gift card costs\n40,725\n47,115\nPrepaid income taxes\n43,654\n2,483\nOther current assets\n12,615\n4,370\nTotal current assets\n395,614\n366,148\nLong-term receivables, net\n131,212\n141,152\nProperty and equipment, net\n199,585\n205,055\nGoodwill\n339,236\n697,470\nOther intangible assets, net\n582,787\n763,431\nDeferred rent receivable\n82,971\n86,981\nOther non-current assets, net\n18,835\n18,346\nTotal assets\n$\n1,750,240\n$\n2,278,583\nLiabilities and Stockholders' (Deficit) Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n$\n12,965\n$\n—\nAccounts payable\n55,028\n50,503\nGift card liability\n164,441\n170,812\nDividends payable\n17,748\n17,465\nCurrent maturities of capital lease and financing obligations\n14,193\n13,144\nAccrued employee compensation and benefits\n13,547\n14,609\nOther accrued expenses\n17,780\n19,779\nTotal current liabilities\n295,702\n286,312\nLong-term debt, net, less current maturities\n1,269,849\n1,282,691\nCapital lease obligations, less current maturities\n61,895\n74,665\nFinancing obligations, less current maturities\n39,200\n39,499\nDeferred income taxes, net\n138,177\n253,898\nDeferred rent payable\n69,112\n69,572\nOther non-current liabilities\n23,003\n19,174\nTotal liabilities\n1,896,938\n2,025,811\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders' (deficit) equity:\nCommon stock, $0.01 par value;

However, we believe that presentation of this information is useful in analyzing our revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and advertising fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales, and, where applicable, rental payments under leases that partially may be based on a percentage of their sales.
