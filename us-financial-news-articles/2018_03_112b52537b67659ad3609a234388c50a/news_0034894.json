Argentina's Secretary of Treasury Nicolas Dujovne is applauded as he arrives for the official photo at the G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers in Buenos Aires, Argentina, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci Finance ministers and central bankers of the world’s 20 biggest economies, the G20, have been discussing the risk to global economic growth posed by a potential trade war caused by the U.S. tariffs and looming trade sanctions on China. A draft communique seen by Reuters showed the financial leaders added a phrase that was not in their initial draft, which stresses the need for further talks on trade issues.
