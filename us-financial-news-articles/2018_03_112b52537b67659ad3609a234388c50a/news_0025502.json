Mr. Howard will be responsible for overseeing all service and deployment needs for its growing user base in the Asia-Pacific region, augmenting the firm's existing coverage group.\nMr. Howard brings nearly 20 years of experience in the trading industry. He joins from Schneider Trading Associates, a leading multi-asset brokerage facilitation firm, where he spent almost 15 years, most recently serving as Chief Operations Officer. In that role he was responsible for a wide variety of mission critical functions, including ensuring that the firm's trading technology stack met the new MiFID II compliance requirements. He also oversaw Schneider's selection and deployment of the LiquidityBook OMS. Mr. Howard began his career in the industry at UFJ Bank, where he spent four years in several roles focused on trading desk operations.\nCommenting on the news, Chief Revenue Officer Sean Sullivan said: \"While our fully SaaS-based model makes management far simpler than legacy systems, clients want to know that when they do have an issue they'll deal with a group that understands their needs intimately. There are few in the industry with deeper knowledge of the full trade lifecycle workflow better than Matt, and we're excited to bring him aboard to help round out our global support organization to meet our increasing client needs in Asia-Pacific.\"\nMr. Howard added: \"I've spent my entire career on the client side, and during that time got to know many trading platforms very well. LiquidityBook's POEMS was always hugely impressive for a host of reasons – ease of use, simplicity of management, robust functionality and low TCO to name a few – and those are ultimately why we selected it at Schneider. I'm very happy to be joining the firm at such an exciting time and look forward to working with the team to further grow the business.\"\nAbout LiquidityBook\nLiquidityBook is a leading SaaS-based provider of buy- and sell-side trading solutions, including order management, portfolio management, execution management, FIX network connectivity, compliance and pre- and post-trade processing.
