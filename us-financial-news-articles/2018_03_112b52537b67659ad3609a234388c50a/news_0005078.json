MyoKardia’s initial focus is on the treatment of heritable cardiomyopathies, a group of rare, genetically-driven forms of heart failure that result from biomechanical defects in cardiac muscle contraction. MyoKardia has used its precision medicine platform to generate a pipeline of therapeutic programs for the chronic treatment of the two most prevalent forms of heritable cardiomyopathy – hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MyoKardia’s most advanced product candidate is mavacamten (MYK-461), a novel, oral, allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin that has been shown to reduce hypercontractility in early clinical studies and is currently being studied in the Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM clinical trial. MYK-491, MyoKardia’s second product candidate, is designed to increase the overall extent of the heart’s contraction in DCM patients by increasing cardiac contractility. MyoKardia is currently evaluating MYK-491 in a Phase 1b study in DCM patients. A cornerstone of the MyoKardia platform is the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), a multi-center, international repository of clinical and laboratory data on individuals and families with genetic heart disease, which MyoKardia helped form in 2014. MyoKardia’s mission is to change the world for patients with serious cardiovascular disease through bold and innovative science.\nContacts:\nMichelle Corral\nCorporate Communications & Investor Relations\nMyoKardia, Inc.\n650-351-4690\nmcorral@myokardia.com\nBeth DelGiacco (Investors)\nStern Investor Relations, Inc.\n212-362-1200\nbeth@sternir.com\nSteven Cooper (Media)\nEdelman\n415-486-3264\nsteven.cooper@edelman.com\nSource:MyoKardia, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RBnomkH-z8fE7danYwTqG_hzhFew_3wxfd-ZyXxtBxEESh_An4NpvCg_Da3S6hxcK1gffEnrqfV-wIT9Q_brsSO7MmpE_OVLX1LkDwpFBpE=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CMw2Hv_hkF_9-QFqUNeYh_anVN7eBrMMyxXz7iVdArTC3RrwlWIT2d96yi9M8jOPv9HorxgEIIt2r_MsEuFzMw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_-LtKPm3mXOh__lgg1RnzKKeKqE6kXV1fRSBggTR5vzOIRdm8xMta8dXiT-h4gg5TnDspfqKYimnA-066bYIhEhMUFCFA9SPkb7yWa1PxS3mntfXAm9RC-p6r1JioeId", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4K_NAOtSv48OKFqekqSv39-VXhCKbJYp-K6QQO0nvb3WNz82Wh_s6cnPkWxPhfyma2Zihg7iXeTjHzDkf8qijEuKg5XOXn8_P2pWIXGwg90=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/69c7a27b-1b77-4717-878b-d2ff10d08588"], "published": "2018-03-02T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T02:30:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
