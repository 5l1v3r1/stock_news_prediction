The producers of “American Idol” may have bagged Katy Perry as a judge for the show’s revival on ABC, but was the first episode a ratings firework? As this newsletter reported earlier this month, media buyers were skeptical “Idol” could reach a 2 rating in the coveted 18-49 advertising demographic. But so far, so good. Nielsen said Sunday’s show pulled in 10.3 million viewers overall and a 2.3 rating in the 18-49 age group, the LA Times reports. The season premiere marked ABC’s largest audience for a series program on a Sunday since 2014, but overall ratings were still down 6% from “Idol”’s last season premiere on Fox in 2016.\nDubucs of Hazzard It’s been a tumultuous few months for Vice Media, which missed its 2017 revenue target, is under pressure from investors to find an exit and is looking to turn around a “boys club” culture brought to public attention after the New York Times reported on sexual-harassment allegations made against some of its executives. Now the media company has a new executive in mind to help stabilize the business. As Variety first reported, Vice is in advanced talks to replace Chief Executive Shane Smith with A+E Networks CEO Nancy Dubuc , who is stepping down from that role in April. Ms. Dubuc is an experienced programmer and led A+E’s 2014 investment in Vice, which helped launch the Viceland TV channel. A person familiar with the matter says Mr. Smith will stay heavily involved with the company but will focus more on content and strategy.\nExtra Texture Here’s some intriguing news for magazine publishers still wrapping their heads around Facebook’s latest algorithm change: Apple said Monday that it is acquiring Next Issue Media and its digital-magazine-subscription service Texture for an undisclosed sum, WSJ reports. Texture bundles together content from hundreds of magazines, from Vanity Fair to National Geographic, into one monthly $10 subscription. Now Texture has the change to leverage Apple’s scale and marketing machine to reach more consumers. For Apple, the addition of Next Issue Media will go at least a little way to helping achieve its goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion in 2020 from $30 billion in its last fiscal year. Texture is owned by a consortium of big-name publishers including Condé Nast, Hearst Magazines, Meredith and WSJ-owner News Corp. As Recode’s Peter Kafka notes , while Texture isn’t thought to have millions and millions of users, the acquisition sends a message to publishers that it’s willing to work with them to support their businesses at a time when content creators feel they’re getting a raw deal out of other tech platforms.\n—On a related note—\nBuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti explains in a Q&A with Digiday why “it’s in Facebook’s interest to share news feed revenue” with publishers and suggests the social network could pay publishers based on a time-well-spent metric.\nTime’s Up Madison Avenue has sadly been beset with harassment and discrimination issues, and women of the industry have had enough. A group of more than 180 female ad executives announced the launch of “Time’s Up/Advertising,” a partnership with the Time’s Up movement formed by women in the entertainment industry. Time’s Up/Advertising will hold community meetings May 14 in cities across the U.S. for women in advertising, launch an online forum and raise money for the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund. The plan is to address processes and policies that have failed women in the past; identify and mentor potential agency leaders who will represent diversity; and drive adoption of agency training and education to address issues such as workplace discrimination and abuse.\n—Timing—\nThese issues are still prescient. Also Monday, Hyundai ad agency Innocean placed its chief creative officer, Eric Springer, on a leave of absence , less than a week after Adweek reported on a January lawsuit that accuses him and the agency of sexual harassment, discrimination, retaliation and wrongful termination. The agency said it is investigating allegations made in the lawsuit, while Mr. Springer didn’t respond to Adweek’s request for comment. Separately, Campaign reported on the apparently-still-happening-tradition in some U.K. agencies for departing male staffers to send around emails ranking their female colleagues on their attractiveness . This week, U.K. advertising trade bodies also launched their own initiative aimed at tackling sexual harassment, dubbed “timeTo.”\nBest of the rest Short sellers at hedge funds have piled up more than $3 billion in bearish bets against major advertising holding companies.
