Adjusted EBITDAX from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $31.8 million, as compared to $40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included cash settlements on commodity derivative contracts of $0.03 million and $4.2 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, adjusted EBITDAX from continuing operations increased to $8.4 million, as compared to $7.3 million for the third quarter of 2017, and decreased from $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. 1 Diluted net loss per common share from continuing operations improved to $0.50 in 2017 from $0.51 in 2016.

For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations of $4.0 million, or $0.09 per share (basic and diluted), as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $4.4 million, or $0.09 per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended September 30, 2017, and a net loss from continuing operations of $5.7 million, or $0.12 per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017, included $0.8 million of foreign exchange loss and $0.7 million of exploration, abandonment, and impairment charges, as compared to $.05 million of foreign exchange loss and $0.1 million of exploration, abandonment, and impairment charges for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Additionally, this compares to $3.3 million of foreign exchange loss and $3.0 million of exploration, abandonment, and impairment charges for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures (including seismic, license acquisition, and other fixed assets) totaled $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and $4.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDAX from continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $8.4 million, as compared to $7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and $9.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in fourth quarter of 2017 Adjusted EBITDAX compared to the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $2.6 million in total revenues, which was partially offset by an increase in general and administration expense and production expense of $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\n2017 Annual Results for Continuing Operations\nRevenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $56.6 million, as compared to $68.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in annual revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales volumes of 467 MBOE and the sale of Thrace Basin Natural Gas (Turkiye) Corporation (“TBNG”), which contributed 165 MBOE and $6.9 million in 2016 and resulted in a $4.4 million decrease in the sale of purchased natural gas. This was partially offset by an increase in the average price per barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) received for the Company’s sales volumes of $9.81 per BOE. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations of $23.9 million, or $0.50 per share (basic and diluted), as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $22.4 million, or $0.51 per share (basic and diluted), for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 net loss from continuing operations included a $15.2 million loss on the sale of TBNG and $4.7 million of seismic and other exploration expense, as compared to $0.1 million of seismic and other exploration expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This was partially offset by a decrease in exploration, abandonment, and impairment expense of $5.0 million, general and administrative expense of $3.6 million, and cost of purchased gas of $3.9 million.\nAdjusted EBITDAX from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $31.8 million, as compared to $40.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The difference was primarily a result of a decrease in revenues of $12.0 million and a decrease in the Company’s realized cash settlements on its commodity derivative contracts of $4.2 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in exploration, abandonment, and impairment expense of $5.0 million, general and administrative expense of $3.5 million, and cost of purchased gas of $3.9 million.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, accumulated other comprehensive loss increased $6.3 million to a total of $124.8 million as of December 31, 2017, due primarily to foreign exchange rate changes in Turkey compared to the U.S. Dollar. The financial statement impact is 100% non-cash and is reflected in other comprehensive (loss) income on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive (Loss) Income and in shareholder’s equity on the Summary Consolidated Balance Sheets. This adjustment impacts the value of comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity but does not impact net income or earnings per share.\nThe Company records its foreign operations’ assets, liabilities, and transactions in the functional currency, which for Turkey is the New Turkish Lira and for Bulgaria is the Bulgarian Lev. For more information regarding the effects of foreign currency exchange on Company operations and reported financial results, please refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 21, 2018.\nLiquidity\nDuring 2017, the Company paid off and retired its 13.0% Senior Convertible Notes due 2017 (the “2017 Notes”) that matured on July 1, 2017 and closed the sale of TBNG for gross proceeds of $20.7 million and net cash proceeds of $16.1 million. In addition, the Company entered into an additional $20.4 million term loan (the “2017 Term Loan”) with DenizBank, A.S (“DenizBank”) under the Company’s general credit agreement with DenizBank. The 2017 Term Loan is in addition to the Company’s term loan currently outstanding with Denizbank (the “2016 Term Loan”), as described in the Company’s previous periodic reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity for 2017 were its cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan and the 2017 Term Loan, and the net proceeds from the sale of TBNG. At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $18.9 million, $13.0 million in long-term debt, $15.6 million in short-term debt, and a working capital surplus of $12.8 million, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $10.0 million, $3.8 million in long-term debt, $38.2 million in short-term debt, and a working capital deficit of $17.3 million (excluding assets and liabilities held for sale) at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $28.6 million of debt and $46.1 million of 12.0% Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Shares (the “Series A Preferred Shares”) outstanding.\nOperational Update\nSoutheastern Turkey\nSelmo\nIn January 2018, the Company spud the Selmo-81H2 well, which is the first of a six-well Selmo development program.

The Yamalik-1 exploration well is directly adjacent to the Company’s 120,000 net acres in the Thrace Basin of which the Company believes approximately 50,000 net acres (100% WI, 87.5% NRI) is analogous to the Valeura and Statoil acreage. The Company expects to resume production operations on its Yildurm-1 well on the Temrez license in 2018. Contingent on financing, the Company may commence a drilling program on its Temrez license in 2018.\nBulgaria. The Company continues to evaluate its position in Bulgaria with updated geologic models.

In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDAX as a financial measure to evaluate the Company’s operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income or income from continuing operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Net income or income from continuing operations may vary materially from Adjusted EBITDAX. Investors should carefully consider the specific items included in the computation of Adjusted EBITDAX.\nAbout TransAtlantic\nThe Company is an international oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas.

A BOE conversion ratio of six MCF to one BBL is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. BOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.\nContacts:\nChad D.
