As a result they lost out on earnings, promotions and benefits, they added.\nThe lawsuit followed a widely read blog post in February 2017 from another female engineer that described Uber's work environment as one that tolerated and fostered sexual harassment.\nThe settlement includes regular reporting of demographic data to Uber's workforce and to the court, as well as developing a validated promotion assessment process.
