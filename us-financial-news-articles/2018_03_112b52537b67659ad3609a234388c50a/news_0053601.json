Soccer Football - Premier League - AFC Bournemouth vs West Bromwich Albion - Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth, Britain - March 17, 2018 Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe applauds fans after the match REUTERS/Peter Nicholls \nHowe prepares Bournemouth for Saturday’s league trip to Watford, one of seven top-flight clubs to have had changed managers this season. \nJavi Gracia replaced Marco Silva at Vicarage Road in January, while West Bromwich Albion, Stoke City, Southampton, Swansea City, Everton and Leicester City have all chosen to appoint new managers in search of improved results. \n“It tells you there is a big desire to change,” Howe told the Daily Echo. \n“If things aren’t going well, the days when people will show patience and give a manager time to turn it round have gone. There is an instant need to change and that is always seen as better. \n“It doesn’t always work out that way... it’s about next week or next month, which I don’t necessarily think is good for the structure of a club in the long term. I think the best-run clubs have a plan beyond the immediate time.” \nHaving returned to Bournemouth in 2012, Howe is currently the second-longest serving manager in the top flight behind Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who took charge of the north London club in 1996. \nIn his first season in charge, Howe guided the club to safety in League Two in 2008-09 and has since never failed to improve their position in the standings across two spells. \n“We are working as hard as we can for results every day and that is maximised to try to achieve success,” he added. \n“I think if the people in charge of the club see that and they trust the people who are leading that, then why change?” \nBouremouth are currently 10th and are just four points short of the 40-point mark, a total seen as a traditional marker for survival that would guarantee a fourth consecutive season in the top division.
