Financial magazine Caixin first reported the planned CDR move on Monday.\nBaidu and Xiaomi declined to comment, while Alibaba, JD.com, and Tencent did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n“We’re seeing a shift in regulators’ attitude toward tech stocks, and that could lead to change in the investment landscape,” said Wu Kan, head of equity trading at Shanshan Finance.\nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange said on Friday it would support growth of a new generation of companies, while local media citied the Shenzhen bourse as saying over the weekend it was creating conditions for so-called unicorn companies - startup companies valued at more than $1 billion - to list.\nReporting by Sumeet Chatterjee, Shu Zhang, Yiming Shen, Julie Zhu and Kane Wu; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Jennifer Hughes and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T13:08:57.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
