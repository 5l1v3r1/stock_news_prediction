Florida has a game in hand on New Jersey.\nReimer stopped all 32 shots he faced. He also had four shutouts for the Toronto Maple Leafs during the 2012-13 season.\nThe Islanders lost their third straight and fell for the ninth time in 11 games (2-6-3). New York will miss the playoffs for the third time in the last four seasons.\nGoalie Christopher Gibson made 38 saves.\nThe Panthers scored the only goal they’d need with 8:22 left in the first when Yandle’s slap shot from just in front of the blue line sailed past Gibson, who was screened by teammate Johnny Boychuk as he battled for position with the Panthers’ Aleksander Barkov.\nBjugstad was involved on both insurance goals the Panthers scored early in the second period. He scored the first goal, a power-play tally, at the 1:47 mark when his slap shot from the middle of the left faceoff circle went past the outstretched stick of Islanders defenseman Adam Pelech and off Gibson’s glove.\nDadonov received credit for a goal 6:09 into the period when his pass across the crease to Bjugstad ticked off the skate of the Islanders’ Brandon Davidson and trickled past Gibson.\nReimer kept the shutout alive in the third period by turning back point-blank chances from Anthony Beauvillier and Brock Nelson and a last-second flurry in which Anders Lee and John Tavares each tried jabbing home a rebound of a Josh Bailey shot.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:47:48.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
