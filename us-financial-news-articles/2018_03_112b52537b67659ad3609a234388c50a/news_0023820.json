(\"CommerceHub\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CHUBA, CHUBK) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by funds affiliated with GTCR and Sycamore Partners (the \"Affiliates\"). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $22.75 in cash for each CommerceHub share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether CommerceHub's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.
