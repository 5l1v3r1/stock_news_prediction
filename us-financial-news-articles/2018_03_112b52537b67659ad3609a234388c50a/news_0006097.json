The result topped the consensus analyst estimate of 498 million reais compiled by Reuters.\nIn recent quarters, the retailer has bet on its Atacadao ‘cash-and-carry’ format, which offers a wholesale experience to retail customers. A biting recession in Brazil has forced consumers to aggressively seek discounts.\nThe strategy, which other food retailers have adopted, has been largely successful, with profit growth at the cash-and-carry stores significantly outpacing the retailer’s other more traditional formats.\nSame-store sales, a measure of sales at stores open at least 12 months, rose 2.2 percent in the quarter from the same period last year at the Atacadao formats, but contracted 0.1 percent at the group’s traditional formats.\nThe results were weaker than in previous quarters, partially due to food deflation in Brazil, which continues to weigh on grocers margins. Sales at traditional formats were also hurt by a higher proportion of electronics sales, which offer lower margins than food, the company said.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 2.8 percent in the quarter from a year ago to 1.118 billion reais.\nThe result topped the Reuters consensus estimate of 1.019 billion reais, and came despite a 6.2 percent jump in general and administrative expenses.\nIt projected overall capital expenditures of 1.8 billion reais, and said it will open 20 new cash-and-carry stores this year and continue to emphasize investing in Atacadao.\nThe company also will focus on growing its e-commerce and digital operations, and said it wanted its Atacadao rewards card to reach break-even by the end of the year.
