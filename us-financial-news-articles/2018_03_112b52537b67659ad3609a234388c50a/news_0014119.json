Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore – except your President (just kidding, of course)!” \nTrump’s critique of the Academy Awards is likely a product host Jimmy Kimmel and others on stage making negative comments about the president as well as focusing on hot-button issues such as sexual harassment, LGBT rights, and immigration reform that run counter to his administration’s policies. \nIn the end, broadcast had the lowest ratings in its history, with 26.5 million people tuning into the program, a 19% drop from 2017. Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore – except your President (just kidding, of course)! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 6, 2018 \nThe 2008 Oscars, hosted by Jon Stewart, were previously the lowest-rated Oscars with 31.8 million viewers.
