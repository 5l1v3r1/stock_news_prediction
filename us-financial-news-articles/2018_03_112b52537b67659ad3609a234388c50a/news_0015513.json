He also co-founded Tellurian Inc and continues to serve as vice chairman of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) firm.\nAccording to Moelis, Houston will work with the bank’s oil and gas clients globally as an advisory partner.\n“Martin’s sector knowledge and experience will be an invaluable resource to our clients as they seek to capture additional value in the midst of the global energy transition,” said Ken Moelis, chairman and CEO of the bank.\nAs well as working for Moelis, Houston will retain his existing executive and non-executive positions at other companies, including privately owned oil explorer CCC Energy and healthcare firm Bupa.
