REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido/File Photo The companies selected in a bidding process to develop technology focused on the lithium market were Chile’s Molymet and China’s Sichuan Fulin Industrial Group, a joint venture between Samsung SDI Co Ltd and South Korea’s POSCO.\nCorfo said that within two years the companies would be ready to produce about 58,000 tonnes of cathode per year, the main material in lithium batteries.\nThe Atacama salt flat is part of the so-called “lithium triangle” in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, a region containing a large portion of the world’s lithium reserves.\nInvestment and output have increased in recent years as demand for electric vehicles surges.\nAlso on Friday, the mining ministry said in a statement state-run miner Codelco had signed a contract to mine lithium from the Maricunga deposit, without giving details on potential partners or investments.\nIt would be the first foray into lithium for the world’s top copper producer. Corfo said in January it had struck a deal with miner SQM that would allow Codelco to begin lithium development in Maricunga.\nReporting by Fabian Cambero; Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T01:03:59.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
