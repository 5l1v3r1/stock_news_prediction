Adjusting for the Westcon-Comstor acquisition, Technology Solutions grew 12% over the prior year. Operating income was $82 million, or 2.0% of segment revenue, compared to $80 million, or 2.6% of segment revenue, in the fiscal first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating income was $97 million, or 2.4% of segment revenue, in the fiscal first quarter of 2018, compared to $81 million, or 2.7% of segment revenue, in the fiscal first quarter of 2017. Concentrix: Revenue was $508 million, an increase of 6% over the fiscal first quarter of the prior year. Operating income was $30 million, or 5.8% of segment revenue, compared to $21 million, or 4.5% of segment revenue in the prior fiscal year quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $44 million, or 8.6% of segment revenue, in the fiscal first quarter of 2018, compared to $38 million, or 7.9% of segment revenue, in the fiscal first quarter of 2017. The trailing fiscal four quarters Return on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\") was 8.5% compared to 10.5% in the prior year fiscal first quarter. The adjusted trailing fiscal four quarters ROIC was 11.0%. The debt to capitalization ratio was 43.8%, up from 33.1% in the prior fiscal year first quarter, primarily as a result of the Westcon-Comstor acquisition in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017. Depreciation and amortization were $22 million and $27 million, respectively. Cash used in operations was approximately $6 million during the quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 29%, compared to 34% in the prior year period. The tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 excludes a charge of approximately $42 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, related to repatriation tax and the remeasurement of deferred tax accounts.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook:\nThe following statements are based on SYNNEX's current expectations for the fiscal 2018 second quarter. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, the amortization of intangibles and the related tax effects thereon. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially.\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $4.58 billion to $4.78 billion. Net income is expected to be in the range of $71.9 million to $75.7 million and on a Non-GAAP basis, net income is expected to be in the range of $91.1 million to $94.9 million. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.77 to $1.87 and on a Non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35. After-tax amortization of intangibles is expected to be $19.2 million, or $0.48 per share.\nDividend Announcement\nSYNNEX announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share. The dividend is payable on April 27, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 13, 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast\nSYNNEX will be discussing its financial results and outlook on a conference call today at 2:00 p.m. (PT). A webcast of the call will be available at http://ir.synnex.com . The conference call will also be available via telephone by dialing (800) 369-1162 in North America or (415) 228-5007 outside North America. The passcode for the call is \"SNX.\" A replay of the webcast will be available at http://ir.synnex.com approximately two hours after the conference call has concluded where it will be archived for one year.\nAbout SYNNEX Corporation\nSYNNEX Corporation (NYSE:SNX) is a Fortune 500 corporation and a leading business process services company, providing a comprehensive range of distribution, logistics and integration services for the technology industry and providing outsourced services focused on customer engagement to a broad range of enterprises. SYNNEX distributes a broad range of information technology systems and products, and also provides systems design and integration solutions. Concentrix, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SYNNEX Corporation, offers a portfolio of strategic solutions and end-to-end business services focused on customer engagement, process optimization, technology innovation, front and back-office automation and business transformation to clients in ten identified industry verticals. Founded in 1980, SYNNEX Corporation operates in numerous countries throughout North and South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. Additional information about SYNNEX may be found online at www.synnex.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, SYNNEX also uses adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude acquisition-related and integration expenses, restructuring costs, the amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects thereon.\nIn the first fiscal quarter of 2018, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also exclude the impact of a provisional adjustment relating to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This adjustment includes an estimated transition tax on accumulated overseas profits and the estimated remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new U.S. tax rate. These estimates may be impacted by new guidance issued by regulators, additional information obtained related to earnings and profits in foreign jurisdictions and the impact of our financial position as of the measurement date of November 30, 2018. SYNNEX expects the accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be completed during the one-year measurement period.\nAdditionally, SYNNEX refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for the translation effect of foreign currencies so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in the transaction currency using the comparable prior year periods' currency conversion rate. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\nTrailing fiscal four quarters ROIC is defined as the last four quarters' tax effected operating income divided by the average of the last five quarterly balances of borrowings (excluding book overdraft) and equity, net of cash and cash equivalents in the United States. Adjusted ROIC is calculated by excluding the tax effected impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, restructuring costs and the amortization of intangibles from operating income and equity.\nSYNNEX management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the business, to establish operational goals, and in some cases for measuring performance for compensation purposes. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide investors with an understanding of SYNNEX' operational results and trends that more readily enable investors to analyze SYNNEX' base financial and operating performance and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and analysis of operational trends, as well as for planning and forecasting in future periods. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. As these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of SYNNEX' non-GAAP financial information to GAAP is set forth in the supplemental information section at the end of this press release.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nStatements in this news release regarding SYNNEX Corporation, which are not historical facts, are \" \" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
