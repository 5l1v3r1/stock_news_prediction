Starboard also said it would reduce its slate of nominees to a minority of the board, if it decides to contest board elections at Newell’s shareholder meeting that is typically held in May. Newell, the maker of Sharpie pens, struck a deal on Monday with billionaire investor Carl Icahn to appoint four of Icahn’s nominees to its board. Starboard said Ian Ashken, Domenico De Sole, Martin Franklin, and James Lillie, collectively withdrew their nominations.
