As of today, we have $34.8 million in availability under our revolving line of credit, and free cash flow beyond planned capex and interest costs that can be used to continue to develop our existing assets and to proactively seek additional acquisitions. Our development in 2017 added over 4,000 barrels per day of new water injection that should yield production growth in the years to come. The addition of new assets in Wyoming provides new grass roots and waterflood optimization prospects with a larger potential scale than we have had in recent years. With oil prices appearing to stabilize in a higher range than we have seen in recent years, we are looking forward to 2018 being a year of growth opportunity for the Partnership.”\nRECENT EVENTS AND FULL YEAR 2017 SUMMARY\nAcquired multiple oil and natural gas properties located in Oklahoma County and Cleveland County, Oklahoma (“Wheatland Acquisition”) in June 2017 for cash consideration of approximately $4.1 million, after customary post-closing adjustments.\nCompleted $15.0 million private offering (the “Offering”) of Class B Convertible Preferred Units (“Class B Preferred Units”) on January 31, 2018, to investors led by John Goff. The Partnership used a portion of net proceeds from this Offering to acquire assets in the Powder River Basin (\"PRB Acquisition\") and used the remaining proceeds of approximately $7.2 million to pay down debt.\nClosed the PRB Acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.6 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. These acquisitions were funded primarily by the Offering and the remainder from cash on hand.\nDuring 2017, we reduced total debt outstanding by $23 million, or 18.9%, and in January 2018 the revolving credit facility maturity was extended by 2 years to November 2020. Compliance Total Leverage, as calculated per our credit agreement, was approximately 3.54x as of December 31, 2017.\nTotal outstanding debt as of February 28, 2018 was $90.2 million.\nDivested Southern Oklahoma properties on December 22, 2017, for cash proceeds of $22.0 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. Net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nAverage daily production was 3,510 Boe/d, a decrease of 13% year-over-year.\nLease operating expenses (“LOE”) of approximately $21.6 million, a decrease of 4.8% year-over-year.\nRealized revenues, inclusive of cash settlements from matured derivatives and net premiums, were $54.5 million, a decrease of 19.5% year-over-year.\nFull year net loss of $27.3 million compared to a net loss of $24.8 million in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $23.9 million, a decrease of 48% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cash settlements from matured derivatives.\nThe following table reflects selected unaudited operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, compared to the fourth quarter and full year of 2016.

On a daily basis, this represented a 4.0% decrease sequentially and a 12.5% decrease year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily related to lower production in our Southern Oklahoma properties and the sale of these properties on December 22, 2017. Year-over-year, lower production was also impacted by steeper than expected declines in certain Permian properties and the 2016 Hugoton divestiture, partially offset by the Wheatland acquisition on June 1, 2017.\nPrice Realizations - Oil and natural gas sales were $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, or $50.71/Boe. On a per Boe basis, this represented a 16.9% increase sequentially and a 14.4% increase year-over-year. Cash settlements paid for matured derivatives, inclusive of net premiums, were $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, or $3.15/Boe. Cash settlements paid for matured derivatives, inclusive of net premiums, were $3.15/Boe in the third quarter of 2017. Cash settlements received from matured derivatives, inclusive of net premiums were $2.18/Boe in the fourth quarter of 2016. The resulting realized prices, after incorporating cash settlements from matured derivatives, inclusive of net premiums, were $47.56/Boe in the fourth quarter of 2017, $40.22/Boe in the third quarter of 2017, and $46.49/Boe in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nLease Operating Expenses- LOE was $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 19.7% decrease from the third quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 4.3% from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential decrease in aggregate LOE is primarily due to lower than anticipated ad valorem taxes. On a per Boe basis, LOE in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $15.92/Boe decreased 16.3% sequentially and increased 9.3% year-over-year due to lower production.\nProduction Taxes - Production taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.0 million, or $3.09/Boe, reflecting an effective tax rate of 6.1%. Production taxes in the third quarter of 2017 were $0.9 million, or $2.66/Boe, for an effective tax rate of 6.1%. Production taxes in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $0.8 million, or $2.31/Boe, reflecting an effective tax rate of 5.2%. The increase in effective tax rate, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, was primarily due to the elimination of the Oklahoma Enhanced Oil Recovery tax credit in July 2017.\nImpairment Expense – For the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded approximately $2.5 million of non-cash impairment expense. For the third quarter of 2017, we recorded approximately $4.9 million of non-cash impairment expense. Impairment expense for the fourth quarter 2017 was related to two Permian projects, and impairment related to a portion of our oil and natural gas properties located in Nolan Country, Texas, deemed to meet held-for-sale accounting criteria as of December 31, 2017. There was no impairment expense recorded for the fourth quarter 2016.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expenses (“DD&A”) - DD&A for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.9 million, or $12.50/Boe. On a per Boe basis, DD&A decreased 7.5% from the third quarter of 2017 and 20.1% from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential and year-over-year decrease in DD&A per Boe was largely due to increased reserves, reduced asset carrying values due to impairment in 2017 and decreased production volumes, partially offset by the net impact of the acquisitions and divestitures.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”) - G&A in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.2 million, or $3.99/Boe and was essentially flat from the third quarter of 2017 which was $1.2 million, or $3.69/Boe. G&A for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.6 million, or $4.56/Boe. The decrease year-over-year was primarily due to lower salaries expenses resulting from a reduced headcount in 2017.\nNet Interest Expense - Net interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.9 million compared to $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The average effective interest rate increased sequentially and year-over-year primarily due to an increase in the underlying market rate.\nNet Loss- For the fourth quarter of 2017, Mid-Con Energy reported a net loss of $8.7 million. Net loss per limited partner unit was $0.30 (basic and diluted) based on the weighted average limited partner units outstanding during the period of 30.1 million (basic and diluted). Net loss for the third quarter of 2017 was $7.9 million, or $0.29 (basic and diluted) per limited partner unit, based on a weighted average of 30.0 million (basic and diluted) limited partner units outstanding during the period. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $3.3 million, or $0.14 per limited partner unit (basic and diluted), based on a weighted average of 29.9 million limited partner units outstanding during the period. The negative sequential variance was primarily attributable to loss on sales of oil and natural gas properties and impairment. The negative variance year-over-year was primarily attributable to the loss on sales of oil and natural gas properties, a greater loss on derivatives, and lower production, partially offset by higher WTI prices and decreased total operating costs and impairment.\nAdjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.1 million, or $26.07/Boe. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.11/Boe in the third quarter of 2017 and $25.50/Boe in the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential increase in Adjusted EBITDA, in aggregate and per Boe, was primarily due to higher realized pricing, resulting from lower cash settlements from matured derivatives, including net premiums paid, and lower LOE, partially offset by lower production. Year-over-year, the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower cash settlements for matured derivatives, inclusive of net premiums, and lower production partially offset by lower operating costs and higher WTI oil prices.\nDistributable Cash Flow (“DCF”) - DCF, a non-GAAP measure, was $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 after subtracting $1.5 million in cash interest expense, $0.7 million in estimated maintenance capital expenditures, and $0.5 million in distributions to preferred unitholders from Adjusted EBITDA.\nYEAR END 2017 ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES\nMid-Con Energy’s year end 2017 estimated net proved reserves were 19.6 MMBoe, representing a 1.7% increase compared to year end 2016 estimated net proved reserves of 19.2 MMBoe. Reserves at year end 2017 were categorized as approximately 95% oil and approximately 73% proved developed, both on a per Boe basis.\nAt December 31, 2017, the standardized measure of the Partnership’s estimated net proved reserves was $207.2 million. The standardized measure represents the present value of estimated future net revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, without giving effect to non-property related expenses, such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and future federal income tax expense, or to depreciation, depletion and amortization, and then discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent. Given Mid-Con Energy’s status as a limited partnership, the calculation of standardized measure does not include any provision for federal income tax expense.\nThe following table shows estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, as prepared by the Partnership’s internal reserve engineers and audited by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc., independent petroleum engineers.\nCore Area Oil (Mbbl) Gas\n(MMcf) Total (1)\n(Mboe) % Total % Oil % Proved\nDeveloped Oklahoma 11,759 2,752 12,218 62 % 96 % 78 % Texas 6,751 3,530 7,339 38 % 92 % 65 % Total 18,510 6,282 19,557 100 % 95 % 73 % (1 ) Reserve volumes in Boe equivalents calculated at a rate of six Mcf per Bbl.\nLIQUIDITY AND BORROWING BASE SUMMARY\nOn January 31, 2018, the Partnership’s borrowing base was increased to $125.0 million and the maturity was extended by two years to November 2020 as part of Amendment 12 of the revolving credit agreement. The next borrowing base redetermination will be in or around April 2018.\nAt February 28, 2018, the Partnership’s total liquidity of $35.8 million, consisted of $1.0 million of cash and $34.8 million of available borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nHEDGING SUMMARY\nMid-Con Energy enters into various commodity derivative contracts intended to achieve more predictable cash flows by reducing the Partnership’s exposure to short-term fluctuations in oil prices. We believe this risk management strategy will serve to secure a portion of our revenues and, by retaining some opportunity to participate in upward price movements, may also enable us to realize higher revenues during periods when prices rise.\nAs of February 28, 2018, the following table reflects volumes of Mid-Con Energy’s production hedged by commodity derivative contracts, with the corresponding prices at which the production is hedged:\nOIL HEDGES 1Q18 2Q18 3Q18 4Q18 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 WTI Collar Volume (Bbl/d) 1,500 1,484 1,141 1,141 — — — — — — — Call Strike Price ($/Bbl) $ 57.39 $ 57.91 $ 52.42 $ 53.13 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Put Strike Price ($/Bbl) $ 45.00 $ 45.00 $ 43.57 $ 43.57 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — WTI Swap Volume (Bbl/d) 626 564 510 467 1,938 1,798 1,720 1,664 1,646 1,607 1,554 Swap Price ($/Bbl) $ 52.48 $ 51.60 $ 54.81 $ 54.19 $ 56.24 $ 56.15 $ 56.10 $ 56.05 $ 55.17 $ 55.17 $ 54.06 WTI Put Volume (Bbl/d) (1) — — 326 326 — — — — — — — Put Strike Price ($/Bbl) (1) $ — $ — $ 45.00 $ 45.00 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Total Hedged Volume (Bbl/d) 2,126 2,048 1,977 1,934 1,938 1,798 1,720 1,664 1,646 1,607 1,554 Floor Strike Price ($/Bbl) $ 47.20 $ 46.82 $ 46.70 $ 46.38 $ 56.24 $ 56.15 $ 56.10 $ 56.05 $ 55.17 $ 55.17 $ 54.06 % Hedged (2) 75 % 72 % 69 % 68 % 68 % 63 % 60 % 58 % 58 % 56 % 55 % (1) Deferred premium puts include premiums that are to be paid monthly as the contracts settle (refer to our SEC filing for additional details).\n(2) Estimated percent hedged based on the mid-point of annual 2018 Boe production guidance, multiplied by an approximate 95% oil weighting based on fourth quarter 2017 reported production volumes.\nFISCAL YEAR 2018 GUIDANCE\nThe following outlook is subject to all the cautionary statements and limitations described under the “Forward-Looking Statements” caption at the end of this press release.
