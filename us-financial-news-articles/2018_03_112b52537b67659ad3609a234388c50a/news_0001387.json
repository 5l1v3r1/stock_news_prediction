Box is adopting ASC 606 beginning with its fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method.\nFor the quarter ending April 30, 2018:\nUnder ASC 606, revenue would be expected to be in the range of $139 million to $140 million. Under ASC 605, the prior revenue recognition standard, revenue would be expected to be in the range of $142 million to $143 million. Under ASC 606, GAAP and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share would be expected to be in the range of ($0.28) to ($0.27) and ($0.09) to ($0.08), respectively, based on the expected weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 139 million. Under ASC 605, GAAP and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share would be expected to be in the range of ($0.28) to ($0.27) and ($0.09) to ($0.08), respectively, based on the expected weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 139 million.\nFor the year ending January 31, 2019:\nUnder ASC 606, revenue would be expected to be in the range of $602 million to $608 million. Under ASC 605, the prior revenue recognition standard, revenue would be expected to be in the range of $613 million to $619 million. Under ASC 606, GAAP and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share would be expected to be in the range of ($1.02) to ($0.98) and ($0.20) to ($0.16), respectively, based on the expected weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 141 million. Under ASC 605, GAAP and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share would be expected to be in the range of ($1.10) to ($1.06) and ($0.28) to ($0.24), respectively, based on the expected weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 141 million.\nAll forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures contained in this section titled “Outlook” exclude estimates for stock-based compensation expense, intangible assets amortization and certain legal settlement and related costs. Box has provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share guidance at the end of this press release.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nBox’s management team will host a conference call today beginning at 2:00 PM (PT) / 5:00 PM (ET) to discuss Box’s financial results, business highlights and future outlook.

Box also provides investor information, including news and commentary about Box’s business and financial performance, Box’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, notices of investor events and Box’s press and earnings releases, on Box’s Investor Relations website.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding Box’s expectations regarding the size of its market opportunity, the demand for its products, its ability to scale its business and drive operating efficiencies, its ability to achieve its revenue target of $1 billion in the coming years, expectations regarding its ability to achieve profitability on a quarterly or ongoing basis, the timing of recent and planned product introductions and enhancements, the short- and long-term success, market adoption, capabilities, and benefits of such product introductions and enhancements, and the success of strategic partnerships, as well as expectations regarding its revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share under both ASC Topic 605 and ASC Topic 606, the related components of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share, the expected impact of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on revenue and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share, and weighted average basic and diluted outstanding share count expectations for Box’s fiscal first quarter and full fiscal year 2019 in the section titled “Outlook” above. There are a significant number of factors that could materially from statements made , including: (1) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (2) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (3) factors related to Box’s highly competitive market, including but not limited to pricing pressures, industry consolidation, entry of new competitors and new applications and marketing initiatives by Box’s current or future competitors; (4) the development of the cloud content management market; (5) Box’s limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict future results; (6) the risk that Box’s customers do not renew their subscriptions, expand their use of Box’s services, or adopt new products offered by Box; (7) Box’s ability to provide timely and successful enhancements, new features and modifications to its platform and services; (8) actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in Box’s services or any breaches of Box’s security controls; and (9) Box’s ability to realize the expected benefits of its third-party partnerships.\nAdditional information on potential factors that could affect Box’s financial results is included in the reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and in other filings Box makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2017. These documents are available on the SEC Filings section of Box’s Investor Relations website located at www.box.com/investors . Box does not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics\nTo supplement Box’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Box provides investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures and other key metrics, including non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share, billings and free cash flow. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics, please see the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and certain key metrics to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release.\nBox uses these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Box’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Box’s performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of Box’s recurring core business operating results. Box believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics in assessing Box’s performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Box’s historical performance as well as comparisons to Box’s competitors' operating results. Box believes these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by Box’s institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of Box’s business.\nA limitation of non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics is that they do not have uniform definitions. Further, Box’s definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, Box’s non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based compensation expense, if Box did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based compensation expense, the cash salary expense included in cost of revenue and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect Box’s cash position.\nNon-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP operating margin. Box defines non-GAAP operating loss as operating loss excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation (“SBC”), intangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating loss divided by revenue. Although SBC is an important aspect of the compensation of Box’s employees and executives, determining the fair value of certain of the stock-based instruments Box utilizes involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options, which is an element of Box’s ongoing stock-based compensation expense, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond Box’s control. For restricted stock unit awards, the amount of stock-based compensation expenses is not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. Management believes it is useful to exclude SBC in order to better understand the long-term performance of Box’s core business and to facilitate comparison of Box’s results to those of peer companies. Management also views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s developed technology and trade names, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Box further excludes expenses related to certain litigation because they are considered by management to be special items outside Box’s core operating results.\nNon-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share. Box defines non-GAAP net loss as net loss excluding expenses related to SBC, intangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Box defines non-GAAP net loss per share as non-GAAP net loss divided by the weighted average outstanding shares. Box excludes expenses related to certain litigation because they are considered by management to be special items outside Box’s core operating results.\nBillings. Billings reflect, in any particular period, (1) sales to new customers, plus (2) subscription renewals and (3) expansion within existing customers, and represent amounts invoiced for all products and professional services. Box calculates billings for a period by adding changes in deferred revenue in that period to revenue. Box believes that billings help investors better understand sales activity for a particular period, which is not necessarily reflected in revenue as a result of the fact that Box recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the subscription term. Box considers billings a significant performance measure and, after adjusting for any shifts in relative payment frequencies, a leading indicator of future revenue. Box monitors billings to manage the business, make planning decisions, evaluate performance and allocate resources. Box believes that billings offers valuable supplemental information regarding the performance of the business and will help investors better understand the sales volumes and performance of the business. Although Box considers billings to be a significant performance measure, Box does not consider it to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated using exclusively revenue and deferred revenue, both of which are financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFree cash flow. Box defines free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of capital lease obligations, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of Box’s core business. Box specifically identifies adjusting items in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These items include the use and release of restricted cash to guarantee a significant letter of credit for Box's Redwood City headquarters. Box considers free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in Box's business and strengthening its balance sheet, but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nThe accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and certain key metrics to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Box\nBox (NYSE:BOX) is the cloud content management company that empowers enterprises to revolutionize how they work by securely connecting their people, information and applications.
