Rules limit interbank liabilities to no more than one-third of total liabilities.\nUnnerved by their rapid growth and potential for misuse, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) clamped down on NCDs, forcing some banks to alter their business strategies.\nThe yield on 3-month AAA-rated NCDs, the most common tenor and rating, peaked at 5.3481 percent in late December, and was at 4.2 percent on Friday.
