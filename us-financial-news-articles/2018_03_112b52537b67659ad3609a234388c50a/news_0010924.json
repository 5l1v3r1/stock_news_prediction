Jennifer Lawrence’s spy thriller“Red Sparrow” launched with $17 million at 3,056 sites for Fox and Bruce Willis’“Death Wish” debuted with $13 million at 2,847 venues for MGM.\nWarner Bros.’ second weekend of comedy thriller“Game Night” followed in fourth with $10.7 million from 3,502 sites, edging Sony’s fourth weekend of CGI-live action“Peter Rabbit” with $10 million at 3,607 locations.“Peter Rabbit” has connected with family audiences for $84 million in its first 24 days.\nParamount’s second weekend of“Annihilation” finished in sixth with $5.7 million at 2,112 venues, followed by Sony’s 11th weekend of its sturdy action comedy“Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” with $4.5 million at 2,313 sites.“Jumanji” has now grossed $393.2 million in 75 days.\nThanks to“Black Panther” and“Jumanji,” overall domestic box office for 2018 is up an impressive 10.9 percent to $2.12 billion, according to comScore.\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T23:00:05.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
