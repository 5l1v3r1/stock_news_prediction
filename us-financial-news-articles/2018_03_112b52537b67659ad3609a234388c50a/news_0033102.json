The euro zone may have more unexploited capacity, particularly in the labour market, which could mean that inflation might take longer to rise back to its near 2 percent target, the bank’s chief economist Peter Praet said on Friday. The five-year, five-year breakeven inflation forward, tracked by the ECB, fell to 1.6840 percent EUIL5YF5Y=R, its lowest level since November and well below a peak around 1.8 percent seen in January.
