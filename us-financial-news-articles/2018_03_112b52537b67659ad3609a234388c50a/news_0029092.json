Stewards imposed a 10-second penalty on Ogier for hitting a chicane in the final Power Stage, in which he had been second fastest. Neuville gained an additional bonus point as a result of Ogier’s demotion out of the top five in the stage, leaving the rally winner on 56 and his Belgian rival on 52 after three rounds. The next rally is Corsica on April 5-8.
