Do not use for the treatment of massive or brisk arterial bleeding. Do not administer to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to RECOTHROM, any components of RECOTHROM or hamster proteins.\nWarnings and precautions: RECOTHROM may cause thrombosis if it enters the circulatory system. Apply topically. DO NOT INJECT. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur.\nThe most common adverse reaction (incidence 6%) was thromboembolic events. Antibody formation to RECOTHROM occurred in < 1% of patients. None of the antibodies detected neutralized native human thrombin.\nFull prescribing information is available here .\nABOUT PREVELEAK\nPREVELEAK Surgical Sealant is indicated for use in vascular reconstructions to achieve adjunctive hemostasis by mechanically sealing areas of leakage.\nImportant Risk Information\nContraindications: PREVELEAK is not for use in patients with known allergies to materials of bovine or shellfish origin. PREVELEAK is not for intravascular use. PREVELEAK is not for cerebrovascular repair or cerebrospinal leak repair.\nWarnings: Do not use PREVELEAK as a substitute for sutures or staples. Avoid exposure of PREVELEAK to nerves. Do not use PREVELEAK in the presence of obvious infection and use it with caution in contaminated areas of the body.
