Production is expected to grow by about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), to about 5 million boe/d.\nExxon reported an adjusted profit of $15 billion in 2017.\nIn the Permian alone, Exxon plans to triple production by 2025 as it taps the low-cost acreage. The plans highlight the increasing importance of U.S. shale to the world's largest publicly traded oil producer alongside its global mega-projects in places such as Qatar and Guyana, where Exxon and partners say they have more than 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent in place.\nExxon did not announce a stock buyback program on Wednesday, something analysts had been hoping for.\nShares were down about 0.5 percent at $75.78 in premarket trading.
