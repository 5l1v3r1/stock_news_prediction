Home Builders Institute trains underserved populations for careers in the building industry. We currently place 85% of our graduates in the trades. While HBI instructors train about 5,000 students each year, we could dramatically increase that with more support from the industry.\nJohn Courson\nPresident and CEO\nHome Builders Institute\nWashington\nGiven current demographics, labor supply will have a hard time meeting labor demand.

Local, state and federal officials also must improve access to vocational training to bring workers back to core industries like construction. Housing is the tip of the spear.
