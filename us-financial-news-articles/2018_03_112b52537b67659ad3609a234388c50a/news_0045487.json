The Trent 7000 is due to enter service later this year.\n“It is, however, possible that a population of early Trent 1000 TEN and Trent 7000 engines may benefit from pro-active maintenance ...,” a spokesman for Rolls said in an emailed statement.\n($1 = 0.7075 pounds)\nReporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-24T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:34:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
