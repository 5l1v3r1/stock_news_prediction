The draft includes banning the usage of palm oil in motor fuels from 2021.\nIndia, the world’s biggest edible oil importer, last week raised import tax on crude and refined palm oil to the highest level in more than a decade, in a move designed to support local farmers.\n“India has to import, they have (supply) limitations. Sooner or later they have to import palm oil. This is only temporary,” Zakaria said.\nFGV’s production of fresh fruit bunches of palm oil are expected to rise 15 percent in 2018 from a year ago, Zakaria added.\n“We are looking at a much better crop this year,” he said. “We have new areas that are starting production and we have sorted out other issues such as labour shortages and the weather has improved.”\nTwo thirds of palm oil produced at FGV comes from small-scale farmers across Malaysia.\nReporting by Naveen Thukral Editing by Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:34:24.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
