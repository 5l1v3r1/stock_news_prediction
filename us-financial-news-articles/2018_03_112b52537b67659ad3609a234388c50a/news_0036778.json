The 26-year-old faces a late fitness test after sitting out the warm-up game against New Zealand XI due to a back injury. Stokes also missed the Ashes series in Australia which England lost 4-0. “He’s always great for the team,” Moeen told The Telegraph. “The balance of the team is pretty much sorted when he’s in the team. “It’s just having him in the side, knowing we’ve got a much stronger side when he’s playing. It gives everyone else a good lift, and obviously him being at slip for me, he’s very good in that position. “He’s ready to go and ready to perform and give back to the team, which I’m sure he wants to do for what happened earlier.” New Zealand put up a fight in the ODI series, taking a 2-1 lead before England won the last two games and Moeen is expecting another tough challenge from the hosts. “I think it’s going to be quite a tight series. I think they’ve got a very good side and some world-class players who are in good form and some very good bowlers as well,” Moeen added. “I think the difference will be how low we bat - our tail, with (Chris) Woakesy probably going to be number nine now, we bat all the way down.” Moeen, 30, will play his 50th test in New Zealand’s first home day-night test starting on Thursday in Auckland.
