Nakasone’s confirmation hearing was held two days after his predecessor, Admiral Mike Rogers, told the same panel that Trump had not granted him the authority to disrupt Russian election hacking operations. Leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies have said repeatedly that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election that brought Trump to power. And more recently, they have warned that Moscow - which denies any such efforts - is trying to disrupt the midterm elections in November. When questioned by another Republican member of the committee, Senator Ben Sasse, Nakasone said he did not think countries behind cyber attacks had seen enough of a U.S. response to deter them. “Our adversaries have not seen our response in sufficient detail to change their behavior,” Nakasone said. Nakasone is expected to be confirmed. Some committee members took time as they questioned him to praise his record and thank him for his service to the country.
