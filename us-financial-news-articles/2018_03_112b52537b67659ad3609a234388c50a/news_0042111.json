But it also marks a bit of a disappointment considering that the company had been valued at $10 billion in a private investment in 2014.\nStill, investor appetite for Dropbox’s IPO was strong. The final share price slightly exceeded the expected range of $18 to $20, which itself was increased from the original range of $16 to $18 set by the company last week before its investor road show started.\nDropbox raised $756 million in its IPO, on top of $100 million that business software firm Salesforce invested in the company in a private placement before the IPO.\nDropbox, founded in 2007 by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, caught a lot of early buzz as a service where consumers could store their files for free. But it took time for the business to attract paying customers—it has 11 million paying subscribers among its 500 million registered users—amid stiff competition from bigger rivals like Google and smaller rival Box .\nLike many tech companies to IPO, Dropbox has also struggled to turn a profit. Last year, it lost $112 million on $1.1 billion in sales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T09:51:52.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
