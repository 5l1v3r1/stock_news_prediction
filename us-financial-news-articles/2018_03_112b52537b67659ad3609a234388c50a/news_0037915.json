Tidelands' cash distribution history, current and prior year financial reports and tax information, a link to filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and more can be found on its website at http://www.tirtz-tidelands.com/ .\nThe distribution this quarter increased to $0.000124 per unit from $0.00 per unit last quarter. Royalties received this quarter increased as compared to the last quarter due to increases in the production and pricing of oil, which were offset by decreases in the production and pricing of natural gas.\nTidelands' distributions to unitholders are determined by royalties received up to the date the distribution amount is declared. In general, Tidelands receives royalties two months after oil production and three months after natural gas production.\nContact:\nRon Hooper\nSenior Vice President\nSimmons Bank\nToll Free (855) 588-7839\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tidelands-royalty-trust-b-announces-1st-quarter-cash-distribution-300615265.html\nSOURCE Tidelands Royalty Trust “B”", "external_links": ["http://www.tirtz-tidelands.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tidelands-royalty-trust-b-announces-1st-quarter-cash-distribution-300615265.html"], "published": "2018-03-19T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T19:17:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
