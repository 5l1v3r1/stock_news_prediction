Stockpiles in LME-registered warehouses at 383,975 tonnes are up 91 percent this year and the largest since December 2013. MCUSTX-TOTAL\nPOSITIONING: Bets on higher prices have fallen, with funds’ net long position in copper on the Comex exchange down more than 80 percent since the start of the year and the lowest since late 2016.\nTECHNICALS: Copper rebounded from technical support at $6,500, a key psychological level and copper’s December low, and was struggling to break above its 200-day moving average at $6,687.\nSTRIKES: Workers at Antofagasta’s Los Pelambres copper mine in Chile on Monday reached an agreement on a new labour contract.\nBut union leaders at Codelco Norte, a unit of Chile’s state-owned miner Codelco, reportedly urged members to strike after rejecting a pay offer. Norte’s Chuquicamata and Radomiro Tomice mines produced 608,000 of copper last year, according to ING.\nSUPPLY RISK: Fears that labour disputes would cause supply disruption this year helped drive copper prices to a four year high of $7,312.50 in December.\nDOLLAR: The dollar rebounded from a five-week low against a basket of currencies, making metals more expensive for users of other currencies, which can dampen demand.\nOTHER METALS: LME aluminium was down 0.3 percent at $2,045.50 a tonne, zinc was 0.4 percent higher at $3,272.50, lead had gained 0.2 percent to $2,392, nickel rose 0.1 percent to $12,970 and tin was down 0.1 percent at $20,850.\nAdditional reporting by Tom Daly in BEIJING, editing by Louise Heavens and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T16:11:42.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
