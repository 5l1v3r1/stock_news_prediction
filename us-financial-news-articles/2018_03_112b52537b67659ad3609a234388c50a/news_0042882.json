Although both teams have 89 points, the Blues own the tiebreaker by virtue of total wins.\nCam Atkinson scored for Columbus (42-29-5, 89) which also had an eight-game home win streak broken. Sergei Bobrovsky finished with 26 saves but had a personal seven-game win streak snapped.\nThe Blues, playing the second half of a back-to-back after defeating Vancouver, 4-1, at home on Friday, jumped out to 1-0 lead after three minutes when Steen, cutting toward the net from the right side, got a pass from Patrik Berglund and fired a shot past Bobrovsky’s blocker for his 15th goal of the season.\nTarasenko made it 2-0 midway through the second period when his wrist shot from the slot through traffic whistled past Bobrovsky’s glove side.\nAtkinson put the Blue Jackets on the board five minutes later with his 19th goal of the season and sixth in six games, picking up the puck in front of his own net and then going end-to-end before firing a wrist shot from the high slot past an Ian Cole screen through Allen’s pads.\nThe 10-game win streak by Columbus tied the longest in the NHL this season. It also was the second-longest in franchise history behind a 16-game streak last season that was just one off the NHL record of 17 in a row set by the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1992-93.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-25T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T17:49:40.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
