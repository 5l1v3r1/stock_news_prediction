(OTCQB: LQMT) , the leading developer of amorphous alloys and composites, reported results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement Commentary\n“We made excellent progress in 2017 toward establishing global manufacturing operations for our revolutionary technology,” said Bruce Bromage, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer. “We made significant investments to commercialize our technologies and commission scalable manufacturing facilities. At the same time, we developed our markets through customer prototypes, and streamlined operations with reduced overhead costs. We are sharpening our cost models to reflect lower costs for higher volume materials and production to ensure competitive responses to RFQs as part of our manufacturing business model.”\nDr. Bromage continued, “Our focus this year is to bring Medical and Automotive development projects into production. We are encouraged by high levels of customer interest in our newer industrial amorphous metal molding and metal injection molding operations, which typically have shorter product development timelines. Fielding production parts is likely a demand-catalyst for customers investing in new technologies. Once initial products are introduced, the Company is prepared to scale rapidly.”\n2017 Financial Summary\nIn 2017, the Company generated $321 thousand in revenue as it continued to focus on the development and manufacturing of prototype and commercial parts for its customers and partnering with licensees on the development of the Company’s technology and production processes.\nCost of sales was $696 thousand compared to $553 thousand in 2016. The increase was primarily due to non-cash write-downs of raw material inventory following a change in the Company’s pricing strategy to further grow a sales pipeline.\nSelling, marketing, general and administrative expense was $6.3 million compared to $7.5 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in overall headcount, and associated salary expense, as well as a full reduction in short-term incentive compensation.\nResearch and development expense was $2.0 million compared to $2.3 million in 2016. The decrease from the prior year was mainly due to a full reduction in short-term incentive compensation and a lower volume of development projects in 2017.\nCash and restricted cash totaled $41.3 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $58.9 million at December 31, 2016. The current year decrease was primarily due to capital investments in the build-out of the Company’s new manufacturing facility and the overall expansion of operations.\nAbout Liquidmetal Technologies\nLake Forest, California-based Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc. is the leading producer of parts made with amorphous alloys, also known scientifically as Bulk Metallic Glasses or BMGs.
