The total consideration is composed of $1.6 billion in cash proceeds to GKN plc, the assumption of approximately $1.0 billion of net pension liabilities, and 133 million new Dana plc shares issued to GKN's shareholders, valued at approximately $3.5 billion (based on Dana's share price as of March 8, 2018).\nUnder terms of the agreements, Dana shareholders will own approximately 52.75 percent of the company with GKN shareholders owning 47.25 percent. The combined company will be domiciled in the United Kingdom as Dana plc and will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DAN.\n\"This transformative and strategic transaction solidifies Dana as a world leader in vehicle drive systems and establishes a leading position in electric propulsion, which we see as the future of vehicle drivetrains,\" said James Kamsickas, president and CEO of Dana. \"We have a long history of partnering with GKN, and the companies possess similar cultures and exceptionally talented people. Our highly complementary businesses share a deep understanding of our customers' long-term requirements. We look forward to welcoming GKN Driveline into the Dana family and to delivering value and growth to our shareholders.\"\nCompelling Strategic Rationale for the Combination\nScaling the Portfolio: With pro forma sales of approximately $13.4 billion in 2017, the company will be the global leader in vehicle drive systems across all three major mobility markets – light vehicle, commercial vehicle, and off-highway. Leading Electrification: Core eDrive technology portfolio uniquely positions the company to capitalize on electrification opportunities in a rapidly changing market with significant growth potential. Completing the Platform: The combined entity will provide global coverage to all major customers with an enhanced product portfolio, balanced end markets, and a diverse geographic presence – strengthening the company's presence in key markets such as China. Delivering Value: The combined company will have a strong balance sheet, and the transaction is expected to result in $235 million of annual cost synergies within three years and be accretive to earnings in the first full year.\nKeith Wandell, non-executive chairman of the Dana Board of Directors, said, \"This combination of global leaders results in a unique platform benefiting from the key trends of electrification and global emerging market growth, underpinned by substantial synergies. We look forward to welcoming our new board members and shareholders to create true value for all of our stakeholders.\"\nHeadquartered in the United Kingdom, GKN Driveline has built market leadership positions in three light-vehicle product segments – constant-velocity jointed driveshafts, all-wheel-drive systems, and electrified driveline solutions. The business has expertise across mechanical systems, electronic and software control, and particularly vehicle integration. The transaction also includes GKN's Off-Highway Powertrain Services business, an expert in off-highway power delivery and service.\nWith approximately 35,000 employees, GKN Driveline has operations in 23 countries and has 61 manufacturing locations, including one of the largest driveline businesses in China via its joint venture, Shanghai GKN Huayu Driveline Systems (known as SDS). In 2017, the business generated consolidated sales of approximately $6.2 billion.\nFinancial Highlights\nDana has put in place committed debt financing to fund the cash consideration and will issue 133 million shares of Dana plc stock to GKN shareholders to consummate the transaction. This mix of consideration preserves the company's strong balance sheet, with an expected net debt / adjusted EBITDA ratio (including GKN's share of its China joint venture but excluding any synergies) of approximately 2.0x.\nDana expects to deliver annual run-rate cost synergies of $235 million within three years. The combination will also yield tax benefits, creating further value for shareholders. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Dana's diluted adjusted EPS in 2019.\n\"We believe this transaction will result in a much stronger Dana, both strategically and financially, by taking advantage of the combined company's global scale, technology leadership, strong balance sheet, and attractive cash flow profile,\" said Jonathan Collins, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Dana. \"In the near-term, we expect our business to achieve best-in-class returns on capital and continue on the path to an investment grade credit profile.\"\nDana expects to complete the transaction, which is subject to shareholder and customary regulatory approvals, in the second half of 2018.\nCredit Suisse and Barclays acted as M&A advisers to Dana. Credit Suisse served as lead adviser and provided a fairness opinion to Dana's Board of Directors. Credit Suisse, Barclays, and Citi provided committed financing to Dana for the transaction. Maven Global acted as capital markets adviser to Dana. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Macfarlanes LLP acted as legal advisers to Dana.\nIn addition, the Dana Board of Directors was advised by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom as legal advisers and PJT Partners as financial advisers.\nGovernance and Leadership\nEffective as of the closing of the transaction, Mr. Wandell will serve as non-executive chairman and Mr. Kamsickas will be president, chief executive officer, and a director of the new company. In addition to the Dana representatives, the board of directors of combined company will include two representatives to be designated by GKN.\nDana to Host Conference Call at 8:30 a.m. Today\nDana will host a webcast and conference call at 8:30 a.m. EST today.

Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of our ability to maintain and continue to invest in our operations and provide shareholder returns. We use adjusted EBITDA in assessing the effectiveness of our business strategies, evaluating and pricing potential acquisitions and as a factor in making incentive compensation decisions. In addition to its use by management, we also believe adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts, investors and others to evaluate financial performance of our company relative to other Tier 1 automotive suppliers. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for income before income taxes, net income or other results reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nDiluted adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we have defined as adjusted net income divided by adjusted diluted shares. We define adjusted net income as net income (loss) attributable to the parent company, excluding any nonrecurring income tax items, restructuring and impairment expense, amortization expense, and other adjustments not related to our core operations (as used in adjusted EBITDA), net of any associated income tax effects. We define adjusted diluted shares as diluted shares as determined in accordance with GAAP based on adjusted net income. This measure is considered useful for purposes of providing investors, analysts, and other interested parties with an indicator of ongoing financial performance that provides enhanced comparability to EPS reported by other companies. Diluted adjusted EPS is neither intended to represent nor be an alternative measure to diluted EPS reported under GAAP.\nPlease reference the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" accompanying our quarterly earnings conference call presentations on our website at www.dana.com/investors for reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and diluted adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We have not provided a reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA and diluted adjusted EPS outlook to the most comparable GAAP measures of net income and diluted EPS. Providing net income and diluted EPS guidance is potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event-driven transactional and other non-core operating items that are included in net income and diluted EPS, including restructuring actions, asset impairments and income tax valuation adjustments. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with the most comparable GAAP measures for the historical periods presented on our website are indicative of the reconciliations that will be prepared upon completion of the periods covered by the non-GAAP guidance.\nImportant Information for Investors and Stockholders\nThis release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval.
