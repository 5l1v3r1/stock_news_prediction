That will provide much needed water for a region that last season received only half the amount it would normally, data from Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology showed.\nRising Australian wheat production could temper the recent gains in benchmark prices. Wheat futures in Chicago have rebounded from one-year lows reached in December on concerns weather could impact supply but the higher output could renew the market’s focus on bumper global stockpiles.\nDespite possibly pressuring prices, the increased Australian output will aid the country’s largest bulk grain handler GrainCorp, which last month said it expects underlying profit to halve this financial year after poor production across the country’s east coast, where the company dominates trading.\nThe La Nina weather event will also aid Australia’s cattle industry, which has been struggling to rebuild after drought conditions in 2015 and 2016 as a result of an El Nino weather pattern left farmers unable to feed and water their livestock.\nABARES said Australian beef production will rise to 2.23 million tonnes, from 2.2 million tonnes produced last year.\nHigher production will allow local farmers to tap the lucrative export markets of China and Japan, ABARES said, as exports grow 2 percent next season.\nAustralia’s sugar industry, which is also concentrated on the country’s east coast, will also benefit from the La Nina-associated rains.\nSugar production will increase to 4.8 million tonnes next season, from 4.7 million tonnes produced last year, a crop that was also damaged by a powerful cyclone in March 2017.\nMeanwhile, Australian canola production during the 2018/19 season will total 4 million tonnes, up from 3.7 million tonnes produced last year.\nReporting by Colin Packham; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:38:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
