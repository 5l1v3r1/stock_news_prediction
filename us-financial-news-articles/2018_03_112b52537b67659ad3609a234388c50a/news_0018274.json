Wynn has previously denied the accusations.\nOkada last year lost his board position at Universal with the board accusing him of misappropriating $20 million in funds. Okada has previously denied this.\nOkada was also ousted as director of a Hong Kong investment company that controls Universal Entertainment amid a rift with family members over money and control.\nReporting by Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in Tokyo; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T07:17:34.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
