Tesla stated that its investigation founded no indication that customer privacy or vehicle safety had been violated in the breach.\n\"We're not sure what the financial impact of Tesla was,\" Badhwar said Thursday. \"We have seen in a couple of days they can rack up to a quarter million dollars worth of compute bills for the customers. And, yes, they can get away with thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency.\"\nBadhwar, whose firm is made up of security experts and former entrepreneurs of successful cloud security companies, said security programs for the cloud are currently very immature.\n\"What it really takes is it getting very mature quickly on cloud security programs, getting good monitoring controls to make sure you're understanding who's getting into your environment.\"\nâ€” CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report. \nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
