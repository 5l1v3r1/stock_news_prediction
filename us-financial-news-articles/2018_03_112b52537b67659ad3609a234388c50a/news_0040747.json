Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the Merger, including future financial and operating results and the Company’s or NJCB’s future expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact, including statements containing such words as “will,” “could,” “plans,” “intends,” “expect,” “believe,” “view,” “opportunity,” “allow,” “continues,” “reflects,” “typically,” “anticipate,” “estimated,” or similar expressions, should also be considered forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.
