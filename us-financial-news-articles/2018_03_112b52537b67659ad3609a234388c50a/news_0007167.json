DFID will carefully consider whether it is right to continue their funding”.\nReporting by Ana Ionova, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.
