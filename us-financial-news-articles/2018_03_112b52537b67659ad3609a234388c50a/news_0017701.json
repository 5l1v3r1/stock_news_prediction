The pilots shut down the engine after getting a warning of a compressor failure. They made a safe emergency landing in Honolulu.\nThe preliminary report from investigators did not identify what caused the initial failure of the blade in the Pratt & Whitney engine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T13:49:46.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
