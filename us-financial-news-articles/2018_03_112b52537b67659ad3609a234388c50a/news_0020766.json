It’s absolutely really positive for the economy as a whole, definitely.”\nWriting by Michael Holden, editing by Guy Faulconbridge\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T11:11:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
