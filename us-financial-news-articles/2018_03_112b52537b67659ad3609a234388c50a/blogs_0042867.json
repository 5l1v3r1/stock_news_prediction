REUTERS/ Khalil Ashawi Turkish forces and the Syrian fighters swept into the main Afrin town last Sunday after an eight-week campaign to drive out the Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara regards as a terrorist group. A military source told Reuters the last remaining villages had been seized and control established overnight. “Control has been completely achieved in the Afrin region and search operations are continuing so that local people can return safely to their houses,” the source said. State-run Anadolu news agency carried a similar report. People walk near a damaged car in Afrin, Syria March 22, 2018.

We want our women and children to come back. They could not come back to their homeland,” said Afrin resident Abdurrahman Nahsen Suleymanoglu. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan rejected criticism of the Afrin campaign in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, according to a Turkish presidential source. Among Turkey’s Western allies, France has been one of the biggest critics of the Turkish military operation, with its foreign minister saying concerns for its border security did not justify the incursion.
