Copper exports increased by 59 percent over the same month last year, boosted by increased production and a favorable basis for comparison. A labor strike in February 2017 at BHP Billiton's Escondida copper mine, the world's largest, sharply reduced copper exports until a deal was struck with the union in March. Copper prices jumped more than 30 percent in 2017 and while drifting early this year they have remained high compared to a year ago, sharply boosting export revenues in the South American nation. State-run miner Codelco is the country's top copper producer. International giants BHP, Anglo American, Glencore and Antofagasta Minerals also mine copper in Chile.
