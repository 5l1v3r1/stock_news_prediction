Staunchly anti-nuclear Austria, which shares a border with Hungary, has said it would file a suit against the EU executive with Europe’s top court. “We are going to actively support Austria’s claim,” Luxemburg’s environment minister Carole Dieschbourg told reporters in Brussels. “It is important that no public funds be invested in nuclear power. It is definitely the wrong way.” Hungary’s plan to build two new reactors at its Paks nuclear site with the help of Russia’s Rosatom had been approved by EU state aid regulators in March. The regulators said that Hungarian authorities had agreed to several measures to ensure fair competition. The European Commission has said it will defend its decision in court. In many such complex cases, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg has found in favour of the Commission.
