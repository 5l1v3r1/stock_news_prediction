Thanks to the lower prices, occupancy rates edged up to 60 percent last year from 53 in 2016.\nThe number of foreign visitors was up 28 percent at 32.4 million in 2017 and is expected to rise further to more than 38 million this year.\nTourism Minister Numan Kurtulmus said many hotels had been too hasty in slashing their prices, and it would take until 2019 for room rates to return to normal levels.\nIn the meantime the government will maintain incentives offering charter airlines up to $9,000 per planeload of tourists they bring to Turkey until at least the end of 2018. It has also taken measures to make it easier for hotels to renew land leases.\nPalm World’s Surucuoglu said the government could do more to help hotels, such as facilitate cheap loans or lower the prohibitively high tax on alcohol.\nKurtulmus said his ministry had made a proposal to the Ministry of Finance regarding the alcohol tax, without elaborating.\nBy 2023, Turkey aims to attract 50 million holidaymakers a year and earn $50 billion in tourism revenues by diversifying beyond beach vacations to wellness and sports holidays, as well as luring more holidaymakers from Asian countries including China, India and South Korea.\nRatings agency Moody’s cut Turkey’s sovereign rating further into junk territory late on Wednesday. While the tourism sector in Turkey was recovering, it was still vulnerable to political and security risks, the agency said.\nediting by David Stamp\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T21:31:02.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
