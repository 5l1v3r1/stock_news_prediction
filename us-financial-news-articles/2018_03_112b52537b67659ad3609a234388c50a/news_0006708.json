It transforms bauxite to alumina, which is turned into aluminium at huge smelters.\nThe Brazilian court ordered that the bauxite waste pool’s integrity must first be verified before an operating licence could be issued, Hydro said, adding that it would consider continued use of an older pool it had planned to decommission.
