After the school shooting massacre in Parkland, Florida, last month, a video that theorized that one of the survivors was a crisis actor made it into YouTube's trending section. Because that conspiracy theory took off in a matter of days, it isn't clear whether a Wikipedia page disputing that theory would even be available yet. \nAlso, because Wikipedia pages are crowdsourced, a page for a given event may not necessarily be accurate. \nWojcicki was also asked about why it can place an outright ban on hateful content — like videos published by neo-Nazi groups — but not on videos that are untrue. \nWojcicki said that hatefulness is \"more clear\" than if something is true or false, and that YouTube doesn't want to be an arbiter of truth. \nTweet \nYouTube, like other tech giants Facebook and Twitter, has long made the distinction that it is not a media organization, and thus bears less responsibility for the content on its platform. \nA YouTube spokesperson told CNBC that the information cues initiative is part of broader efforts to tackle the proliferation of misinformation on the site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T02:44:06.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
