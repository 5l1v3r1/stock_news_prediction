Guo will work closely with PBOC’s new chief Yi Gang, a protege of China’s longest-serving central banker, the widely respected Zhou Xiaochuan.\n“China should quicken the pace of role adjustments for the banking and insurance regulators to strengthen their supervision capabilities,” Liu, a Harvard-trained economist, said.\nLiu said China should also keep its monetary policy prudent and neutral.\nIn Beijing’s reform of its state institutions, it has also launched a campaign to root out officials engaged in corrupt practices in the financial sector.\nXiang Junbo, former chairman of the insurance watchdog, last April became the highest-ranking finance industry official to be investigated for corruption.\n“China will also provide a strong political foundation for its financial work by upholding its anti-corruption campaign,” Liu said.\nSince his elevation into China’s 25-member Politburo, the second-highest tier in Beijing’s political power structure after the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, Liu has emerged as an assertive voice in the government on not just the economy, but also trade and finance.\nLiu is involved in China’s trade dialogue with the United States, and was the Chinese official that U.S. Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with last week as trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies flared anew.
