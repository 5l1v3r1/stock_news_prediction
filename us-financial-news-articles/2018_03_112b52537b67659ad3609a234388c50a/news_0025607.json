(OTCQB:BTCY), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company dedicated to delivering innovative, biometric remote monitoring solutions, today announced the company has appointed Mr. Casey Shattuck to serve as the Company’s Vice President of Sales. With extensive experience in building and leading sales divisions of cardiac and vascular “start-up” companies which have led to numerous successful acquisitions, Mr. Shattuck’s immediate priority will be to oversee the commercialization of Bioflux , a real-time, high-precision mobile cardiac telemetry solution for customers.\nThe appointment comes after the Company’s recent 510(k) clearance for its Bioflux device with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which occurred in December 2017. Bioflux’s advanced technology is designed to assist in the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias, enhance patient outcomes, and curb healthcare costs. The Company expects to have Bioflux in key sites in the U.S. by end of Q2 2018.\nMr. Shattuck brings vast industry expertise having helped establish Cardio Thoracic Systems as the dominant player in the southern US market, which the Company believes played a pivotal role in Guidant’s decision to acquire Cardio Thoracic Systems. At Foxhollow Technologies, Casey was responsible for 10 regional directors and 70 sales professionals with over $40 million in revenue.\n“Management believes that commercialization is one of the most important milestones that a medical technology company can achieve,” said Waqaas Al-Siddiq, Founder and CEO of Biotricity. “We are thrilled to add Mr. Shattuck to our team and are confident in his ability to oversee our near-term growth catalysts. His expertise blends seamlessly with our world-class sales force, which comprises of highly driven and visionary team members from the medical and cardiac industries. We look forward to working with him as we aggressively target commercial launch during the second quarter of 2018.”\nThe Bioflux system is designed to be a complete solution for cardiac monitoring and diagnosis, consisting of the Bioflux device, proprietary software, and a 24/7 monitoring center that merges seamlessly with physicians’ existing platforms and workflows. Unlike traditional cardiac monitoring solutions, Bioflux extends the support a patient receives at a care facility into the patient’s home. The device monitors a patient’s ECG in near real-time, constantly analyzing and collecting data on the device and periodically uploading to the cloud via embedded cellular technology.\nTo learn more, visit www.biotricity.com or follow on\nTwitter: @biotricity_inc Facebook: facebook.com/biotricity/ or\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/company/biotricity-measuring-vitals\nAbout Biotricity Inc.\nBiotricity is a modern medical technology company focused on delivering innovative, remote biometric monitoring solutions to the medical and consumer markets, including diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for chronic conditions and lifestyle improvement.
