Because plants can be grown inside, year round, and in optimal conditions, proponents of the method tout its efficiency in being able to help feed a ballooning world population, predicted to reach 10 billion people by 2050. \n“Quantity of food is important, but it’s not the full picture,” said Daniel Gruneberg, president of Sensei, at Fortune ’s Brainstorm Health conference here on Monday. \nSensei is a new company using hydroponics and precision data to create the ideal environment for plants to thrive. Interestingly, it views itself as a healthcare startup rather than a food business. Instead of focusing on a traditional metric of success like yield per acre, the company is interested in optimizing nutrition per acre. \nSays Gruneberg: “You deserve to know what you’re eating.” \nFor more coverage of Fortune’s Brainstorm Health conference, click here .
