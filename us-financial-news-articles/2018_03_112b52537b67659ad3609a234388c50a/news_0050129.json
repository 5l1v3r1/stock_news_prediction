The U.S. alone expelled 60 people, with other countries demanding the departure of more than 70 others. \nLavrov described the measures taken by the U.S. and other Western countries last week as “unacceptable actions that are taken under the toughest pressure of the U.S. and the U.K. under the pretext of the so-called ‘Skripal case,’ ” referring to the name of the poisoned former agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T21:40:39.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
