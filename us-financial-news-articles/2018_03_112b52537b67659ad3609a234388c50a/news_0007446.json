The Nasdaq declined 1.9 percent, its biggest monthly percentage fall since October 2016.\nOn Tuesday, Powell gave an upbeat view on the U.S. economy and said data had strengthened his confidence on inflation. Traders boosted bets the U.S. central bank would squeeze in a fourth rate hike this year following the remarks.\nRetailer shares were among the bright spots of the day.\nBooking Holdings, formerly known as Priceline, rose 6.8 percent after reporting upbeat quarterly profit, helped by higher hotel bookings, while off-price apparel seller TJX jumped 6.9 percent after posting upbeat same-store sales.\nAbout 76 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is above the average 72 percent recorded in the past four quarters.\nCelgene’s 9 percent drop was a drag on the healthcare sector after U.S. health regulators rejected the company’s application seeking approval of a multiple sclerosis drug.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.55-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.65-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 72 new lows.\nAbout 8.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.4 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.
