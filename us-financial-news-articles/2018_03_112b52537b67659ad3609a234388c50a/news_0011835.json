REUTERS/Thomas White The move means KTM, which already has a factory team, will have four bikes on the starting grid next year.\nThe deal will run for three years, said Tech3 boss Herve Poncharal.\n“We always tried to be the official Yamaha junior team but it was never really the case,” Poncharal told the official MotoGP website (www.motogp.com).“That will be the case where we are going.”\nThe privately-run team announced last month that they were ending their partnership with Yamaha after more than 20 years together. Their current riders are Frenchman Johann Zarco and Malaysian newcomer Hafizh Syahrin.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T17:43:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
