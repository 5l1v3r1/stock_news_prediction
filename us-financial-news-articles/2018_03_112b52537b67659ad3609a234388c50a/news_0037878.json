Riders can then hold their phones near an electronic reader at the monorail’s turnstiles as if it were a ticket.\nIn addition to letting riders on the monorail, the Google Pay app will also show their ride history as well as where the nearest monorail station is located.\nAs public transportation services go, the Las Vegas Monorail is a pretty small one. It only has seven stops, and takes 15 minutes to travel from one end of it to the other near the Las Vegas Strip.\nGoogle says it plans to roll the feature out to more cities soon, although the company did not specify where. Google Pay is already widely accepted at retailers such as McDonald’s , Walgreens, and Whole Foods.\nApple Pay does not currently work with the Las Vegas Monorail system but is available for Chicago’s Ventra system, Portland’s TriMet, and Salt Lake City’s Utah Transit Authority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T04:30:53.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
