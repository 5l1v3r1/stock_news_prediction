(NYSE:TPB), a leading provider of Other Tobacco Products (“OTP”), today announced fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.\nResults at a Glance\nFiscal Year ending December 31, 2017\n(Comparisons vs. same period year-ago)\nNet sales increased 38.6% to a record $285.8 million Gross profit increased 24.4% to a record $124.9 million Income before income taxes increased $12.0 million to a record $26.9 million Net income attributable to TPB was $20.2 million Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $1.04 and Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.08\n(see Schedule D for a reconciliation to diluted EPS) Adjusted EBITDA increased 14.4% to $60.0 million\n(see Schedule A for a reconciliation to net income)\nFourth Quarter 2017\n(Comparisons vs. same period year-ago)\nNet sales increased 36.7% to a record $73.6 million Gross profit increased 23.1% to $32.3 million Income before income taxes increased $2.5 million to $6.9 million Net income was $3.5 million Diluted EPS of $0.18 and Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.23\n(see Schedule D for a reconciliation to diluted EPS) Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.6% to $14.8 million\n(see Schedule A for a reconciliation to net income) Other highlights from the fourth quarter: Stoker’s increased retail market share in both Moist Snuff Tobacco (“MST”) and chewing tobacco, according to MSAi. Management Science Associates, Inc., (“MSAi”) administers a proprietary information system that captures sales from approximately 1,000 wholesalers to over 250,000 retailers. Zig-Zag maintained strong, industry leading shares in both Make-Your-Own (“MYO”) cigar wraps and premium cigarette papers In the promising Canadian market, Zig-Zag introduced new cigarette papers in late fourth quarter The quarter had one more shipping day to the trade versus 2016\n“2017 was a solid year with record-setting financial achievements and activities that have strengthened the Turning Point Brand’s sales, marketing and distribution platforms,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Larry Wexler. “Our focus brands, Stoker’s in Smokeless, Zig-Zag in Smoking, and VaporBeast in NewGen, remain the driving forces behind our organic growth story. At the same time, we continue to evaluate acquisitions to further augment our growth.”\nRecent Events\nOn March 7, 2018, TPB amended and extended its $250 million credit facility arranged by Fifth Third Bank, Capital One, National Association and Regions Capital Markets. The amended $250 million facility consists of a $160 million first lien term loan, a $40 million second lien term loan and a $50 million cash flow revolver. The existing $40 million accordion feature was retained. The amendment reduces our blended interest rate and is expected to reduce annual interest expense by approximately $2.0 million on an interest rate risk adjusted basis.\nThe credit structure amendment eliminates the $35 million first lien second out tranche, reduces the second lien term loan by $15 million and extends maturities of the first lien and revolver by one year and the second lien by one and a half years.\nPresident and CEO Larry Wexler said, “This amended credit facility is another step that further simplifies our credit facility, reduces our interest expense and provides greater flexibility in the execution of our growth and acquisition strategies.”\nOn March 7, 2018, the TPB board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share which will be paid on April 13, 2018, to shareholders of record on the close of business on March 26, 2018.\nManagement Observations on the Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2017\nSmokeless Products Segment (29% of total net sales in the quarter)\nFor the full year 2017, Smokeless products net sales increased 8.5% to a record $84.6 million, with gross profit up 10.3% to a record $42.6 million.\nFor the fourth quarter, Smokeless products net sales increased 10.7% to $21.0 million on the continuing growth of Stoker’s MST. In the quarter, total Smokeless segment volume increased 2.9% and price/mix increased 7.8%.\nOn the strength of Stoker’s, TPB outpaced the smokeless industry in the quarter, growing its MSAi share in both chewing tobacco and MST. Stoker’s MST cases shipped in the quarter rose by greater than 10%, despite a highly competitive MST environment and flat MSAi industry volumes. (TPB measures industry MST volumes excluding pouch and snus products.) TPB MSAi chewing tobacco volumes held steady to year-ago levels while industry chewing tobacco volumes declined by approximately 6%.\nFor the quarter, gross profit for the Smokeless segment increased 13.1% to $10.3 million. Segment gross margin expanded 100 basis points to 49.2% due to product mix and price increases, offset to some degree by LIFO expense of $0.5 million. Absent the LIFO expense in both years, gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 51.8% versus 50.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016 (see Schedule B for reconciliation).\nSmoking Products Segment (39% of total net sales in the quarter)\nFor the full year 2017, Smoking products net sales decreased by 0.9% to $110.0 million with gross profit decreasing 0.8% to $57.1 million.\nFor the fourth quarter, net sales of Smoking products increased 4.8% to $28.9 million. In the quarter, Smoking products volume increased 0.4%, while price/mix increased 4.4%.\nThe increase in 2017 fourth quarter net sales in the Smoking segment was a result of a strong performance in sales of Zig-Zag cigarette papers in Canada and year-over-year advances on Zig-Zag MYO cigar wraps, partially offset by continued weakness in cigars.\nAccording to MSAi, fourth quarter industry volumes for cigarette papers increased by mid-single-digits, largely driven by competitive promotional efforts on discount cigarette papers. Industry MYO cigar wraps continued to produce double-digit category expansion. Zig-Zag volumes in both cigarette papers and MYO cigar wraps advanced in the quarter while the Zig-Zag brand retains a leading industry share in both MYO cigar wraps and premium cigarette papers.\nSmoking products gross profit for the quarter was down $0.1 million to $15.1 million due to LIFO expense in the quarter of $0.3 million and an adverse year-over-year euro exchange rate impact of $0.2 million. Gross margin decreased to 52.3% compared with 55.1% for the year-ago quarter due to product mix, exchange rates and LIFO expense. Absent the LIFO expense in both years, gross profit was up 1.6% to $15.5 million with a gross margin of 53.5% compared to 55.2% in 2016 (see Schedule B for reconciliation).\nThe TPB core tobacco portfolio (Smokeless and Smoking) again produced strong net sales advances of 7.2% in the quarter to a record $49.9 million and a 4.6% expansion in gross profit to $25.5 million.\nNewGen (New Generation) Products Segment (32% of total net sales in the quarter)\nFor the full year 2017, net sales for NewGen products increased $74.0 million to a record $91.3 million with gross profit increasing $21.0 million to a record $25.1 million. The addition of VaporBeast and Vapor Shark results in December 2016 and April 2017, respectively, fueled exceptionally strong segment performance.\nFor the fourth quarter, NewGen segment net sales grew $16.4 million to $23.7 million on continued VaporBeast momentum. Volume increased 222% while price/mix accounted for an increase of 3.1%.\nGross profit for the NewGen segment increased by $4.9 million over the year-ago fourth quarter to $6.8 million. Gross margin for the 2017 fourth quarter expanded by 300 basis points to 28.8% compared to the year-ago fourth quarter.\nFor the quarter, VaporBeast’s key sales performance metrics indicate continued progress against our goal to grow sales in the existing store base, as evidenced by increases in both order sizes and order frequency. Additionally, operational improvements at Vapor Shark have fortified sales performance in both the company and franchise Vapor Shark branded stores.\nCoincident with the Vapor Shark acquisition earlier in 2017, the company recorded a $0.6 million liability in relation to the option granted to the former Vapor Shark owner to purchase the seven company owned Vapor Shark branded stores. Late in the fourth quarter, the company reached an agreement to purchase and cancel the option for $1.5 million. As a result of this agreement, there was a one-time charge of $0.9 million in fourth quarter. Wexler noted, “These stores have demonstrated improving sales results and provide a valuable window into trends and consumer behavior,” he continued, “We will continue to evaluate the benefits of owning these stores in the short-term compared to re-franchising the stores to existing or new franchisees”.\nTPB will also relocate the Vapor Shark distribution and e-liquid manufacturing facility from Miami, FL to Louisville, KY where it will be consolidated with other operations for improved operating synergy. The relocation and installation is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018.\n“We continue to drive innovation and operational improvements in our vapor business, while also vetting acquisition candidates in both the tobacco and vapor segments,” said Wexler. “To support our growth, I am pleased to announce the promotion of Graham Purdy to President, New Ventures. Graham is an experienced industry veteran who came to us in 2004 from Philip Morris and heretofore served as our Senior Vice President of Sales. In his new role, he will be responsible for driving NewGen integration, sales growth and operational efficiency, while also leading efforts to expand via our OTP acquisition strategy.”\nOther Performance Measures\nTotal company net sales growth of 36.7% in the fourth quarter was driven by volume gains of 34.2% with price/mix contributing another 4.4%.\nFor the full year, 2017 consolidated selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $75.4 million compared to $56.8 million in 2016 due primarily to the inclusion of the VaporBeast and Vapor Shark SG&A.\nFourth quarter 2017 consolidated SG&A expenses were $21.5 million compared to $16.2 million in 2016 due primarily to the inclusion of the VaporBeast and Vapor Shark SG&A.\nCertain components of 2017 fourth quarter SG&A were as follows:\nStrategic expenses, including $0.9 million for the Vapor Shark company stores option purchase, were $1.1 million, and flat compared to the year-ago period Legal costs, including expenses associated with our recent Zig-Zag cigarette papers anti-counterfeiting initiatives, were $0.6 million greater than the prior year fourth quarter New product launch costs of $0.5 million were $0.1 million greater than the prior year fourth quarter One-time bonuses of $0.1 million were granted as a result of the reduction in corporate tax rates SKU rationalization expenses of $0.1 million\nFourth quarter 2017 cost of goods sold included:\nNew product launch costs of $0.2 million compared to $0.5 million in the fourth quarter a year-ago SKU rationalization expenses of $0.1 million\nInterest expense for the quarter was $3.9 million, which is $1.8 million, or 32.1%, lower than the year-ago period. For the full year 2017, interest expense was $16.9 million, or $9.7 million lower than a year ago. The full year 36.6% decrease is principally attributable to lower interest rates as a result of our February 2017 refinancing and lower debt levels compared to 2016.\nFourth quarter and full year 2017 income before income taxes increased 56.5% to $6.9 million and 80.7% to $26.9 million, respectively. Income tax expense for the quarter was $3.4 million and for the full year was $7.3 million. The full year effective income tax rate was 27% and is lower than the expected income tax rate primarily as the result of permanent differences and discrete items. Net income attributable to TPB was $3.5 million for the fourth quarter and $20.2 million for the year.\nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 fully diluted weighted average shares were 19.7 million and 19.5 million, respectively.\nDiluted EPS were $0.18 for the fourth quarter and $1.04 for the full year 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.23 and $1.08 for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, respectively (see Schedule D for reconciliation).\nFourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA increased to $14.8 million from $13.5 million in 2016. For the year 2017, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $60.0 million from $52.4 million in 2016 (See Schedule A for a reconciliation).\nCapital expenditures in the fourth quarter 2017 totaled $1.0 million and for full-year 2017 were $2.0 million.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2017 was $202.0 million. Net debt at December 31, 2017 was $199.4 million, compared to $215.4 million as of December 31, 2016, a decrease of $15.9 million. Net debt at December 31, 2017 to Adjusted EBITDA was 3.3x (see Schedule C for a reconciliation).\nImpact of Excise Tax Changes\nPennsylvania implemented a $0.55 per ounce excise tax on smokeless products effective October 1, 2016. The impact of the tax increase on trade volumes was material to both the industry and TPB in the first three quarters of 2017. MST industry Pennsylvania volumes in the fourth quarter 2017 are below the year-ago quarter by a more modest 3%, while Stoker’s MST volumes in the state are up versus a year-ago by mid-single-digits.\nEffective July 1, 2017, California enacted a tax on all OTP products of 65.08%. The new excise tax on MYO cigar wraps adversely impacted category sales, as California industry sales for the fourth quarter 2017 contracted by 33% with TPB off more sharply versus year-ago. Importantly, industry and Zig-Zag volumes in the adjacent states are up versus year-ago, suggesting a level of shifting demand. The company initiated promotional strategies and new products activity in late fourth quarter to address the adverse TPB trends. We anticipate that California OTP tax will unfavorably impact trade behavior over the next two quarters, and we will continue to closely evaluate its impact on consumer behavior.\n2018 Outlook\nBased upon our current understanding of the 2018 FDA schedule, the company expects to continue its SKU rationalization efforts to sharpen focus on key growth areas while discontinuing products that do not warrant the expense required to achieve FDA compliance, including specific mid-year 2018 packaging requirements. At the present time, the company has identified products for 2018 rationalization and estimates that SKU discontinuations will unfavorably impact year-over-year net sales by approximately $3.5 million.\nAbsent any acquisitions and net of the above-mentioned SKU rationalizations, the company anticipates 2018 volume growth of 4% to 6% with price/mix contributing another 2% to 4%. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales are expected to be in the 25% to 27% range. Interest expense is currently expected to be $14 to $15 million.\nThe California state excise tax on MYO cigar wraps is anticipated to continue impacting state volume comparisons to year ago through the second quarter of 2018, offset to some degree by sales volumes in adjacent states and new product and promotional initiatives.\nThe company expects a 2018 effective income tax rate of 26% to 27%. Net operating losses, or NOLs, available to offset federal income taxes amounted to approximately $17.8 million at year end 2017. We expect to fully utilize these NOLs during 2018 when we will begin paying cash federal income taxes.\nCapital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be $2 to $3 million, which includes one-time expenditures associated with logistics efficiency and integration activities including the Vapor Shark distribution and e-liquid manufacturing facility relocation.\nEarnings Conference Call\nAs previously disclosed, a conference call with the investment community to review TPB’s financial results has been scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday, March 8, 2017.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, Net Debt and Gross Profit excluding LIFO are used by management to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes and is presented to our board of directors. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS and Gross Profit excluding LIFO are appropriate measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance.\nWe define “EBITDA” as net income before interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income before interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items and other items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define “Adjusted diluted EPS” as diluted earnings per share excluding one-time charges. We define “Net Debt” as total debt less cash. We define “Gross Profit excluding LIFO” as gross profit less LIFO charges.\nNon-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted diluted EPS exclude significant expenses that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate this non-U.S. GAAP measure differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nIn accordance with SEC rules, we have provided, in the supplemental information attached, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the next directly comparable GAAP measures.\nSchedule A Turning Point Brands, Inc.
