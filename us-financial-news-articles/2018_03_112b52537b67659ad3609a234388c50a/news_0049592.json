REUTERS/Sergio Perez The figure came down from the company’s initial plan to reduce up to 425 jobs.\nUnder the finalised plan, 283 of the positions will be cut from the company’s mainstay networks business and 70 from its Technologies unit, which includes Nokia’s licensing operations and digital health business.\nGlobally, Nokia is looking to save 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) annually following its 2016 acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent and a weak network equipment market has encouraged it to step up measures.\nNokia currently employs 6,300 people in Finland and around 102,800 globally.\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl; editing by Niklas Pollard\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T11:43:15.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
