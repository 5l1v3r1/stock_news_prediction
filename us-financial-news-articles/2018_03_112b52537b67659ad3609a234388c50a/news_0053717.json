Referee John Beaton waved away the appeals.\nStriker Andreas Cornelius also had several good efforts for Denmark. But the best chance for the home side fell to Lasse Schone, who thumped a free kick off Johnny Herreraâ€™s right-hand post 15 minutes from time.\nTough and skilful on the ball, the visitors constantly harried the Danes in the midfield and created some good chances of their own. However, neither side could break the deadlock.\nDenmark take on Sweden away and Mexico at home in the their final two friendlies in June before traveling to Russia, where they will face Peru, Australia and France in Group C.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:23:16.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
