REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/File Photo The steps will include providing tick by tick data feed to all trading members free of charge and making services for co-location, or servers that are placed at the site of exchanges, more accessible, the SEBI said in a release after a board meeting.\nIn India, algorithmic trading, like elsewhere around the world, is becoming a bigger part of daily trading, prompting regulators to question whether investors with no access to the rapid form of trading are at a disadvantage.\nThe SEBI also tightened the penalty rules by narrowing the range of algo orders to 0.75 percent of the last traded price compared to one percent earlier.\nIt also ensured strict monitoring of such trades by asking stock exchanges to allot a unique identifier to “each algorithm approved and each order generated” to establish “an audit trail”.\nIn late 2016, the SEBI proposed potential limits on so-called algo traders, including “speed bumps” to randomly delay execution of some orders, and forcing exchanges to take orders from co-located servers and other sources alternatively, removing another advantage enjoyed by high-frequency trading platforms.\nThe SEBI on Wednesday also announced a slew of measures geared towards enhancing corporate governance, including expanding the eligibility criteria for independent directors and mandating additional company disclosures, including more details on auditing firms.\nFor full SEBI statement see bit.ly/2GjugzK\nEditing by Biju Dwarakanath\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T14:23:19.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
