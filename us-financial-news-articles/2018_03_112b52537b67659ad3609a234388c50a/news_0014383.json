Bandhan counts Singapore state investor GIC among its investors and its high margins and relatively low bad loan ratio should also draw investors, bankers said.\nBandhan, formerly a microfinance company specializing in small-value loans, and IDFC Bank were the only two companies to win bank permits from the Reserve Bank of India in 2014, the first new bank licensing process in a decade.\nThe bank started operations in August 2015.\nBandhan shares are being sold in a range of 370 rupees to 375 rupees each. The bank will sell up to 97.7 million new shares, while its shareholders International Finance Corp, part of the World Bank, and IFC FIG will sell up to 21.6 million shares.\nThe Indian government, which owns Hindustan Aeronautics, is selling 34.1 million shares, or about a 10 percent stake, in its IPO which will take subscriptions from March 16 to March 20, according to the prospectus.\nThe shares will be sold in a price range of 1,215-1,240 rupees each, a source with direct knowledge told Reuters.\nThe offering will add to the government's revenues from asset sales which have already reached a record 927 billion rupees so far this fiscal year ending in March.\nIn another IPO of state-run guided weapon systems maker Bharat Dynamics that runs March 13-15, the government is seeking to raise 9.6 billion rupees.\nAxis Capital, Goldman Sachs, JM Financial, JPMorgan and Kotak Mahindra Capital are the banks managing the Bandhan Bank IPO. Axis Capital and SBI Capital Markets are the bankers for the Hindustan Aeronautics share offering. (Reporting by Devidutta Tripathy Additional reporting by Krishna V.
