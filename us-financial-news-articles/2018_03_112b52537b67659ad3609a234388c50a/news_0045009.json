Xi said last week Taiwan would face the “punishment of history” for any attempt at separatism. \nTaiwan says China has ramped up military exercises around the island in the past year or so. \nWhile China insists it has no hostile intent, its activities around Taiwan, and in the busy South China Sea waterway, have touched a nerve in the region and in the United States. \nU.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alex Wong angered Beijing during a recent visit to Taiwan by saying the U.S. commitment to the island had never been stronger. \nBeijing is already furious about a law signed two weeks ago by U.S. President Donald Trump that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet counterparts and vice versa. \n(This story has been refiled to change dateline to Taipei from Beijing) \nReporting by Fabian Hamacher; Writing be Christian Shepherd; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T10:46:17.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
