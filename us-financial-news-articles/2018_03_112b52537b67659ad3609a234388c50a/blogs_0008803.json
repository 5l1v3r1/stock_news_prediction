The shares are up 31 percent this year through Thursday.\nTanners increased her price target for U.S. Steel shares to $50 from $47, representing 9 percent upside to Thursday's close.\nThe analyst predicts the tariff plan will be \"diluted\" and include exemptions for the other NAFTA countries. She noted Korean steel exports will not be affected by any tariffs because the Asian country's product has \"limited alternative destination.\"\nOn the flip side, another Wall Street firm believes that if the tariffs are implemented U.S. Steel earnings will surge. J.P. Morgan told its clients the firm's 2019 earnings per share estimate for the company could possibly double due to tariffs.\n\"U.S. Steel â€¦ has the greatest leverage to higher steel prices,\" analyst Michael Gambardella wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \"We do think that tariffs at these levels would help reduce the downside risk to domestic steel prices from sharp increases in imports, and therefore should support higher steel stock prices.\"\nGambardella reiterated his overweight rating on United States Steel shares and his $48 price target. He said the stock could rise to as much as $85 per share under an \"optimistic scenario\" after tariffs.\nUnited States Steel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T17:04:10.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
