REUTERS/Staff/Remote Innogy soared 12 percent after parent RWE and rival E.ON said they would break up Germany’s largest energy company by market value and divide up its assets.\nThe deal would give E.ON greater economies of scale in power distribution and retail and RWE in renewables, making it easier for them to cope with Germany’s rapid shift to cleaner energy sources. RWE and E.ON, whose share prices collapsed over the past decade, rose 7.5 and 5 percent respectively.\nMorgan Stanley said the agreement could be a win-win deal, with larger networks and retail businesses for E.ON and a long term renewables strategy and a stable dividend for RWE.\nShares in utilities in other countries rose on optimism for further M&A in the sector.\nThe STOXX utility index rose 1.4 percent to lead sectoral gainers in Europe, helping the pan-European STOXX 600 index rise by 0.3 percent by 0920 GMT to its highest since Feb. 28.\nGermany’s DAX was up 0.7 percent, while the UK’s FTSE dipped 0.1 percent on weaker commodity stocks.\nAmong top gainers were GKN, up 1.2 percent after Melrose increased its hostile bid for the UK automotive engineer, appealing to investors after the company struck a rival deal of its own last week. Melrose fell 2.4 percent.\nThe autos sector index rose 0.6 percent, brushing off a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump in which he threatened to impose taxes on European autos imported into the U.S. if the EU retaliates in a row over steel tariffs.\ngoo.gl/oJ2PBs\nThe top faller on the STOXX was Just Eat , down 4.3 percent, following a downgrade to “sell” from Deutsche Bank.\n“Along with 2017 results, new CEO Peter Plumb announced an investment plan to expand into the delivery services business. While we think this move is strategic to defend Just Eat’s leadership position against increased competition, it will come\nat the expense of profitability,” Deutsche Bank said.\nShares in Aryzta’s fell 3.8 percent as the Bakery company announced another management shuffle after posting a wider first half net loss.\nMeanwhile, basic resources stocks fell 0.7 percent, tracking lower metal and crude oil prices.\nReporting by Danilo Masoni; editing by Tom Pfeiffer and Jon Boyle\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://goo.gl/oJ2PBs"], "published": "2018-03-12T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T12:59:43.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
