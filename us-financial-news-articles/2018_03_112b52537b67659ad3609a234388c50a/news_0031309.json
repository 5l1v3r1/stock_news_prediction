Meatpacking company BRF SA's logo, which is one of the biggest food companies in the world, is pictured in Lucas do Rio Verde, Mato Grosso state, Brazil, July 27, 2017. REUTERS/Nacho Doce BRF, Brazil’s largest chicken processor, said the ministry suspended production and certification “preemptively” but did not give the reason. BRF has been ensnared in a food safety scandal; it is a target in an investigation which accused it of engaging in fraud to evade food safety checks. The company said its products shipped to Europe before March 16 could still be sold and consumed without restriction. It said the Agriculture Ministry has scheduled a meeting next week in Brussels to clarify and review the measures. The Agriculture Ministry did not have an immediate comment. This week, a shareholder sued BRF in the United States, accusing the world’s largest poultry exporter of concealing its involvement in food safety fraud, culminating in the arrest of a former chief executive officer. The export suspension affects 10 out of 35 BRF plants in Brazil, the company said. Shares tumbled more than 6 percent to a session low of 23.70 reais in early morning trading, near the lowest since August 2011. They later recovered to 24.70 reais, down about 2.3 percent. The temporary suspension will affect less than 5 percent of the company’s total sales volumes, according to a bank analyst who cannot speak to the press. Still, the analyst said, the suspension is undesirable considering the company needs to improve margins and reduce debt. Brazilian chicken companies exported more than 5 million tonnes of that kind of meat to the European Union in the last 10 years, trade group ABPA said in a statement on Friday. “Brazil is a long-term partner of the European Union. We expect a solution is found to resume exports,” ABPA said. BRF said it shipped 278,000 tonnes of poultry and processed products to Europe last year. It declined to provide an exact breakdown of how much was shipped out of its plants in Brazil.
