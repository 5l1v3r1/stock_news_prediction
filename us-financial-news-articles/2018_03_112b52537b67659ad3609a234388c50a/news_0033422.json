(Nasdaq: PCTI), a leader in P erformance C ritical TEL ecom solutions, announced its results for the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights from Continuing Operations\nRevenue of $23.3 million in the quarter and $91.4 million for the year , down 1% in the quarter and up 8% for the year compared to last year. Connected Solutions revenue was down 9% in the quarter and up 4% for the year. RF Solutions was up 25% in the quarter and up 19% for the year. Gross profit margin of 44.0% in the quarter and 42.4% for the year, up 265 basis points in the quarter and up 200 basis points for the year compared to last year. Net income per diluted share of $0.19 in the fourth quarter and $0.24 for the year, an improvement of $0.47 per share in the quarter and $1.03 per share in the year. Approximately $0.03 per share of the improvement in the quarter and $0.13 per share in the year are attributed to improved operating results. The remainder is a result of non-cash changes in the Company’s deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance. Non-GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA are measures the company uses to reflect the results of its core earnings. A reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to our financial statements is provided later in the press release. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.08 in the fourth quarter and $0.28 for the year, unchanged in the quarter and up $0.07 for the year compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percent of revenue of 10% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the year, up 55 basis points in the quarter and 95 basis points for the year compared to last year. $38.1 million of cash and short-term investments and no debt at December 31, 2017. The Company generated free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) from continuing operations of approximately $2.1 million in the quarter and $7.1 million for the year.\n“We are pleased to see revenue growth in both segments. Fleet and utilities markets continue to lead the growth in antennas and we closed several large scanning receiver deals through our OEM partners in the quarter,” said David Neumann, PCTEL’s CEO. “PCTEL is well positioned to take advantage of the long-term growth opportunities in Industrial IoT and 5G, which require both performance critical antenna solutions across multiple vertical markets and RF test equipment.”\nCONFERENCE CALL / WEBCAST\nPCTEL’s management team will discuss the Company’s results today at 4:30 p.m. ET.
