Management of the fuel dump, however, has become difficult as the pace of naval operations increase, making it more difficult for the MSDF to forecast future demand.\nThe tanker is expected to cost“several tens of billions of yen” and will have a crew of up to 20 sailors, the sources said.\nA spokesman for Ministry of Defense declined to comment.\nReporting by Nobuhiro Kubo and Tim Kelly; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T05:44:35.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
