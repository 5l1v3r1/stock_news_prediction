The area is home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres and was hit hard by the recent California mudslides.\nRelated\nEarlier: Snider Estate Lists for $52 Million The roughly 9.4-acre estate has views of the ocean and mountains. The Italianate-style main house was built by Mr. Snider around 2001 and measures about 21,300 square feet, with eight bedrooms. It has a swimming pool with a cabana, a tennis court, a pavilion with a wet bar and a two-bedroom guesthouse, according to the listing.\nMr. Snider bought the property in 1994 and later added additional parcels for privacy.\nAfter his death at age 83 in 2016, his estate listed the home for $52 million.

It was taken off the market and then relisted for $45 million in October 2017.\nMauricio Umansky and Santiago Arana of the Agency represented the estate in the sale.
