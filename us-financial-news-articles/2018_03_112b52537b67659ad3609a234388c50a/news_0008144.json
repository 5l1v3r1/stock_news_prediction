From 1994-2015, he held a variety of senior positions at Scholle, including Managing Director Asia Pacific, Managing Director Europe/Middle East/Africa, before becoming President of the Scholle Packaging and Materials Group. In 2012, he was named President and CEO of the Scholle Corporation.\nMr. Gianneschi was raised in Australia, earned a doctorate in chemical engineering, and earlier in his career worked at Exxon Chemical in the Asia Pacific and Middle East Regions. He now resides in Southern California.\nAs one of the foremost global experts in BIB packaging for beverages, wine, and other liquid products, Mr. Gianneschi joins Bill Hickey (former Chairman and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation), Li Xin (former President of Sealed Air China), Bo Thorn (former Commercial Director of Tetra Pak China and Managing Director of Tetra Pak Southeast Asia), and Par Soderlund (former Managing Director of Tetra Pak Eastern Europe and Tetra Pak Pakistan) as a member of IDC's industry thought leaders.\nIDC has created, patented, and commercialized The Answer®, the world's only aseptic tap that can safely dispense UHT liquids from a large-format (3-25 liter) package while continuing to preserve the sterility of the package's remaining contents for weeks/months without refrigeration or preservatives. Although foodservice accounts for nearly 50% of the world's food and beverage dollar, in aseptic packaging foodservice accounts for less than 5% due to the size limitations of aseptic cartons. Currently, The Answer is commercial in the USA, China, Pakistan, Germany, and Mexico.\n\"I cannot think of anyone more qualified or immersed in the global BIB industry than Leon Gianneschi,\" said IDC Chairman Greg Abbott. \"He brings a new strategic dimension to our already talented team of experienced executives, a team that rivals that of any packaging company in the world.\"\n\"I am excited to be involved at the cutting edge of the BIB industry with IDC,\" said Mr. Gianneschi. \"IDC has persevered with its vision, overcoming the obstacles inherent in aseptic innovation to bring this opportunity to the inflection point. The Answer is poised to disrupt the aseptic BIB foodservice industry on a global scale.\"\nAbout IDC\nBased in New York City, IDC (IDND; www.idcinnovation.com ) is a packaging research and development company that creates and manufactures breakthrough innovations for the beverage and food packaging industries.
