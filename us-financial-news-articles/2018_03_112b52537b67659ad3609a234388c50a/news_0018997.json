Qatar denies that charge and says the four adversaries aim to curtail its sovereignty.\nQatar’s permanent representative to the United Nations informed the U.N. Secretary General and Security Council President that its marine surveillance had observed a UAE naval ship obstruct and then commandeer the Qatari fishing boat on Jan. 19, a foreign ministry statement said.\n“The incident constituted a kidnapping and is a dangerous precedent and a severe violation of international norms,” it added.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Emirati authorities.\nMediation efforts, including by the United States, have failed to resolve the dispute, though Washington hopes to make progress before hosting a Gulf Cooperation Council summit later this year.\nIn January, the UAE said Qatari air force jets had twice intercepted its civilian aircraft during routine flights to Bahrain, which Qatar denied.\nReporting by Reuters staff; Editing by London desk\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T16:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T16:32:17.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
