There's less corruption and graft that can go on,\" he said. \"And so for government benefits, that kind of thing, there's much less leakage if it can go directly from the government right into a digital wallet of the consumer. And so you're seeing leapfrogs over what were credit card infrastructure or checking.\"\nSince PayPal and its former parent company eBay parted ways in the payment processing arena in late January, PayPal has partnered with Chinese internet company Baidu to allow Chinese consumers to access merchants around the world.\nThe company also partners with e-commerce colossus Alibaba to allow PayPal users outside of China to shop on the Chinese platform.\n\"I think that's the power of a two-sided network and an open platform: you're able to do ecosystem partnerships that you never could've imagined years ago,\" Schulman told Cramer.\nWith over 50 percent of its revenues coming from outside North America, PayPal has started to leverage its international ecosystem to benefit small businesses in the United States as well, the CEO said.\n\"In North America, ... only 5 percent of small businesses export internationally. Eighty percent of small businesses on PayPal in the U.S. export internationally,\" Schulman said. \"So having a platform that's open, that's trusted, with guaranteed transactions, opens up the world to merchants, small business merchants and to consumers and that's a tremendous benefit for everybody.\"\nWatch Dan Schulman's full interview here: show chapters PayPal stands to profit from countries skipping over legacy fintech: CEO 13 Hours Ago | 09:44 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T00:44:39.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
