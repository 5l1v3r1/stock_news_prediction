REUTERS/Stephen Hird/File Photo European insurers such as Allianz and Munich Re have been offering share buybacks as they struggle to find other ways to deploy capital. Aviva, which provides general and life insurance, also said in a statement it planned to spend around 600 million pounds on “bolt-on” acquisitions, and 900 million pounds on debt reduction. “We continue to invest in our businesses and in particular on priorities such as digital,” Chief Executive Mark Wilson said. Operating profit was slightly above a forecast 3 billion pounds, according to a company-supplied consensus poll. Most divisions showed strong operating profit growth, Aviva said, but profits in Canada shrank, hurt by a rise in bodily injury claims and large commercial insurance and weather-related losses. Assets under management at Aviva Investors, the insurer’s fund arm, rose 9 percent to 490 billion pounds. Aviva said it would pay a total dividend of 27.4 pence, up 18 percent and above a forecast 26.4 pence.
