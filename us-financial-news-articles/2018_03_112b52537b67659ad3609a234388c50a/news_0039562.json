Flags of the Dogan Media Group are seen outside the Dogan Media Center in Ankara, Turkey March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Umit Bektas Long viewed as a pillar of the secular establishment, Dogan Media owns the top-selling Hurriyet daily, broadcaster CNN Turk, TV channels and radio stations. Its acquisition by unlisted Demiroren Holding, which owns two pro-government dailies, will put the media overwhelmingly in Erdogan’s corner. The Hurriyet has a circulation of 300,000, according to publicly available circulation figures, and is one of the few major Turkish newspapers that is not seen as pro-Erdogan. Most opposition papers are leftist publications that lack a mass-market readership. “This sale means the death of pluralism and independent journalism in Turkey’s mainstream media,” said Erol Onderoglu, the Turkey representative for Reporters without Borders, a media freedom advocacy group. “The government now has complete control of the media in the run-up to general elections in 2019. Amid an unprecedented crackdown on civil society and the political opposition, only a handful of low-circulation newspapers still offer an alternative to the government’s propaganda.” An official from Demiroren told Reuters on Wednesday it would buy Dogan’s media arm. Dogan Holding confirmed the talks on Thursday. Dogan Holding and its octogenarian founder, Aydin Dogan, have been accused by Erdogan of bias against the Islamist-rooted AK Party. Both the company and Aydin Dogan have denied the charges. Dogan Media was fined $2.5 billion for unpaid taxes in 2009, in what government opponents saw as an attempt to crush media criticism of Erdogan. Following the tax bill, Aydin Dogan was forced to sell the group’s Milliyet and Vatan newspapers - to Demiroren. Both papers have since become staunchly pro-government. ‘SWORD OF DAMOCLES’ In 2017, Aydin Dogan was summoned to appear in court over fuel-smuggling accusations, a day after Erdogan criticised the Hurriyet for a story suggesting discord between the government and the army. Dogan Media Center is pictured in Ankara, Turkey March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Umit Bektas Aydin Dogan has denied any wrongdoing but the fuel-smuggling case continues. It was not immediately clear whether his legal troubles had influenced the decision to sell the company. “Dogan’s fuel-smuggling case has not been concluded yet. It’s hanging over his head like the sword of Damocles,” said one person close to both the talks and Erdogan’s ruling AK Party. “I don’t know if this sale will impact the case but that could be a reason for the sale.” Rights groups and some of Turkey’s Western allies have sharply criticised the country’s record on media freedom and human rights following a widespread crackdown after a failed coup in July 2016.

The United Nations on Wednesday called on Ankara to end its 20-month-old state of emergency, imposed after the coup, and accused it of mass arrests, arbitrary sacking and other abuses. Turkey has said the U.N. report was full of unfounded allegations and compared the criticism to militant propaganda. The Turkish Journalists Association says that as of January, there were 154 journalists in jail. The crackdown has seen dozens of independent media outlets shut down for what the government says are links to terrorism. In one high-profile case last month, a court sentenced six journalists to life in jail for aiding plotters of the attempted coup, charges the journalists have denied. Dogan Media has an operating value of $1.1 billion and an equity value of $890 million after debt, Dogan said in a statement to the Istanbul stock exchange. Shares in Dogan and Hurriyet both jumped by the daily limit of 19.5 percent at the start of trade, after rising a similar amount a day earlier and were still at that level in afternoon trade.
