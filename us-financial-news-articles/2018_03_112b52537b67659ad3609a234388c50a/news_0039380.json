Dawkins, M.D., as a new JenaValve board member.\n“As JenaValve advances its clinical development programs both in the US and Europe with our next generation pericardial TAVR system, we are pleased to have the experience and skillset of Dr. Dawkins to serve on our board,” said Chairman Jan Keltjens. “His experience as both a Chief Medical Officer and as an interventional cardiologist will be key to contributing to our JenaValve clinical strategy. Our strategic intent is that JenaValve technologies become available to treat the full spectrum of aortic valve disease in patients across the world.”\nDr. Dawkins has more than 35 years’ experience as both a practicing physician and an executive within the medical device industry. He currently also serves at 4Tech Inc. as its Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Dawkins previously served as Executive Vice President and Global Chief Medical Officer at Boston Scientific for all divisions, 2012 – 2017. His responsibilities included enhancing the company’s global clinical programs and strategies. Before that, he served as Senior Vice President and CMO for the Boston Scientific Cardiology Rhythm and Vascular Group. Prior to joining Boston Scientific, Dr. Dawkins was a practicing interventional cardiologist for over 20 years in the U.K. He has earned a series of clinical, research and academic distinctions, including a post-doctoral research fellowship at Stanford University as a Fulbright Scholar. Dr. Dawkins also served as President of the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society and held numerous appointments on hospital, regional and national committees, including the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).

The structural heart market continues to evolve as it strives to develop effective minimally invasive medical technologies. Specifically, in aortic valve disease, it still requires a reliable TAVR solution in patients at low surgical risk and those with aortic insufficiency; the JenaValve technologies are uniquely positioned to address these underserved needs,” said Dr. Dawkins. “I look forward to assisting the Board in the strategic development of advancing the technology in saving or extending patient lives.”\nAbout JenaValve\nJenaValve Technology, Inc., with locations in Irvine, California, Leeds, England and Munich, Germany, develops, manufactures and markets transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) systems to treat patients suffering from aortic valve disease.
