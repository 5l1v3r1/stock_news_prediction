(NYSE:BR), a global fintech leader, has completed the acquisition of ActivePath, an Israeli-based digital technology company. ActivePath's unique technology enhances the consumer experience associated with consumer statements, bills, and regulatory communications. ActivePath extends Broadridge's ability to transform and accelerate the pace of digital adoption, further strengthening Broadridge's leading Governance and Communications businesses.\nCompanies need to convert essential communications into interactive touchpoints distributed across multiple channels. ActivePath's unique platform lets enterprises, including banks, brokers, healthcare providers and other billers, quickly compose and project HTML experiences typically found on brand websites and apps into interactive email with new levels of personalization, engagement, and security. In addition to email, ActivePath when combined with the Broadridge platform enables full omni-channel capabilities including SMS, social, audio UI, chatbots and personal cloud solutions.\n\"Despite consumers' interest for all-things digital, many brands struggle to create a compelling digital experience and convert their customers from print communications,\" said President of Broadridge Customer Communications, Doug DeSchutter. \"Broadridge continues to invest to accelerate the digital transition for our clients and their customers, leveraging technology, data, and channel partnerships to make the experience better and more convenient.
