Its clinical programs are based on two platform technologies: cell replacement and cell/drug delivery. With its cell replacement platform, BioTime is creating new cells and tissues with its proprietary pluripotent cell technologies. These cells and tissues are developed to replace those that are either rendered dysfunctional or lost due to degenerative diseases. BioTime’s cell/drug delivery programs are based upon its proprietary HyStem ® cell and drug delivery matrix technology. HyStem ® was designed to provide for the transfer, retention, engraftment and metabolic support of cellular replacement therapy. BioTime’s lead cell delivery clinical program, Renevia ® , which consists of our proprietary HyStem ® cell-transplantation delivery matrix combined with the patient's own adipose progenitor cells (Fat), met its primary endpoint in an EU pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of facial lipoatrophy in HIV patients in 2017. Submission for approval of Renevia ® in the EU is expected to be early 2018, with possible approval in 2018. There were no device related serious adverse events reported to date. Our lead cell replacement clinical program, OpRegen ® , which is a retinal pigment epithelium transplant therapy, is in a Phase I/IIa multicenter trial for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in developing countries. There were no related serious adverse events reported to date. BioTime also has significant equity holdings in two publicly traded companies, Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE American: AST) and OncoCyte Corporation (NYSE American: OCX), and a private company, AgeX Therapeutics, Inc.\nBioTime common stock is traded on the NYSE American and TASE under the symbol BTX.
