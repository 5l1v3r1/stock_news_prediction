The president wants to work with the Russians but their actions sometimes don’t allow that to happen,” Shah said. “The poisoning in the UK that has kind of led to today’s announcement was a very brazen action. It was a reckless action.”\nReporting by Roberta Rampton; Writing by David Alexander\\; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T07:26:32.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
