The federal government said it would keep Snowy Hydro Ltd in public ownership, and make no changes to employment levels or water allocation.\nReporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:48:54.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
