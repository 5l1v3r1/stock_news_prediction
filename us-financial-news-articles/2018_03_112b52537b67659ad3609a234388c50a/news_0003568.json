The latest entrant is Gimlet Media, a podcasting company that just had its first brush with the technology.\nOn Thursday, the company announced the debut of its first show for Amazon Alexa, part of a push to expand Gimlet Media’s offerings beyond podcasts and into the wider world of multiplatform audio.\nThe show, “Chompers,” is a customized Alexa application known as a “skill” that encourages children to brush their teeth with trivia questions, riddles and stories. The show is sponsored by Oral B and Crest Kids and will feature new episodes twice a day starting in March. The company plans to launch future seasons at a date to be determined.\nGimlet Media’s expansion into content for voice assistants coincides with budding demand from marketers who are experimenting with digital assistants as a way to reach consumers. According to May 2017 estimates from eMarketer , about 35.6 million Americans were expected to use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month in 2017.\n“The way I think about Gimlet is that we’re trying to build a new kind of modern media company where everything begins in audio,” said Matt Lieber, the co-founder and president of Gimlet Media. “This is our first go at it, but we’re making real investments.”\nGimlet has hired Wilson Standish, director of innovation at the marketing agency Hearts & Science, to be its first director of voice, Mr. Lieber said. The company is planning to expand its existing branded content division to include producers who will create new content for voice assistants, Mr. Lieber said.\nAlthough the adoption of voice assistants and podcasts are both growing among audiences, they still make up a small fraction of the total marketing spend from major advertisers. The majority of brand advertising dollars are still spent on other formats with mass reach, such as television. Direct-response advertising has been more common on podcasts. Such marketers can easily determine whether the investment is paying off because they offer discount codes and the like that are easy to track.\nAccording to Gimlet Media, that may be starting to change. In 2017, more than half of Gimlet Media’s ad revenue came from brand advertisers, according to Anna Sullivan, vice president of brand partnerships for the company. Ms. Sullivan added that the company’s brand advertising revenue grew 134% in 2017 compared with 2016. The company declined to disclose specific dollar amounts.\nAlexa appeals to some marketers because of the potential for it to drive sales in Amazon’s marketplace and the company’s data about consumer preferences, said Susan Schiekofer, chief digital investment officer for GroupM U.S. In her experience, marketers use podcasts and Alexa for different kinds of advertising.\n“Generally, the podcast work we have done has been relatively focused on brand, whereas we believe devices such as Alexa and Google Home have a greater potential for sale and lead generation,” Ms. Schiekofer said.\nThere are also drawbacks to advertising on Alexa. Mr. Lieber said that Amazon’s rules prevented Gimlet Media from disclosing Oral B’s and Crest Kids sponsorship during the show, which it otherwise would have done.\nShopping on Alexa poses challenges for big brands , since the voice assistant typically gives shoppers a limited range of options and the device doesn’t currently offer paid search options.", "external_links": ["https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Alexa-Say-What-Voice-Enabled-Speaker-Usage-Grow-Nearly-130-This-Year/1015812"], "published": "2018-03-01T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T04:31:07.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
