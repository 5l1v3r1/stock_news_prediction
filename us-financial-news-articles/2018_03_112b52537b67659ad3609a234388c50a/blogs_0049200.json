Although he attributed the shutdown to the fact that the company is ahead of its targets on those models, he also said during the shutdown employees from the S and X lines will be permitted to work on the Model 3.\n(A spokesperson for Tesla has since told Bloomberg the shutdown will only take place on Friday and is unrelated to Model 3 production.) Tesla did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nAt the time of Field's email, March 23, he said Tesla was making more than 200 of the Model 3 cars per day. He told staff it would be an \"incredible victory\" to exceed 300 per day, even as critics question the company's ability to mass marketing affordable, electric vehicles.\nTesla's future as a mass-market carmaker hinges on efficient, automated production of the Model 3, but the automaker has faced significant issues with production speed and quality of parts. Musk said in July 2017 that Tesla would probably be making 20,000 Model 3s per month by December, but the company then downgraded those expectations. \nRead more about Tesla Model 3 production on Bloomberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T21:52:34.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
