At that rate, the A380 program will not cover its costs.\nMeanwhile, Airbus will deliver eight A400M aircraft in 2020, compared with 15 this year and 11 in 2019, after discussions with launch customer nations.\n\"About ten sites will be impacted in Europe. Most workers will be redeployed,\" an Airbus spokesman said, without giving further details on the sites involved.\nTwo trade union sources at the Works Council meeting said Britain's Filton site, plants in Germany's Bremen and Augsburg, and Spain's factory in Sevilla would be the main ones affected.\nAirbus last month struck a draft deal with European buyer nations of the A400M to revamp delivery schedules and ease cash retention clauses but was forced to write off another 1.3 billion euros ($1.6 billion) on the already loss-making project.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T18:09:34.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
