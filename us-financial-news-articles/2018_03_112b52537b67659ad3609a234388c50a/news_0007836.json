The main concern ... has been the strategic fit of Uniper’s fossil-based production with Fortum low-carbon assets,” it said.\nThe company defended its plans, however, arguing conventional energy production was still needed to ensure affordable security of supply in Europe.\n“Fortum acknowledges that not only the use of coal but also the origin of coal is a source of concern to some stakeholders ... Uniper is much more than a coal company,” it said.\nWhile Fortum supports a phase-out of power generated from coal, this should be achieved within the European Union’s emissions trading scheme (ETS), the company added.
