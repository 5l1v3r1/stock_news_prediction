The South Korean firm’s creditor originally put the stake up for sale in 2016.\nKDB said on Friday that the sale to Doublestar would help Kumho Tire expand its supply network and provide liquidity, but the firm’s union has protested against the deal and said it will fight back against the sale.\nRyu Gwan-joong, a union spokesman, said workers were considering launching strikes, including a possible partial walkout on March 9.\nDespite the news, Kumho Tire’s shares fell nearly 10 percent on Monday while Doublestar slid 2.4 percent.\nReporting by Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Additional reporting by Ju-min Park in SEOUL; Editing by Stephen Coates and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T11:36:37.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
