Indore, India. 1989.

He also worked with the United States’ Louis Kahn, one of the world’s most revered architects.\n“Infused with lessons from Western architects, he forged his artistic vision with a deep reverence for life, Eastern culture, and forces of nature to create an architecture that was personal,” the citation for the prize said.\nBalkrishna Doshi, a champion of sustainable, low-cost housing, is the winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize for 2018.
