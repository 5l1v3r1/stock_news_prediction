(NASDAQ: SNES), a developer of proprietary technologies for managing animal pest populations through fertility control, today announced its fourth quarter and year end 2017 financial and operational results.\n\"2017 laid the base for 2018 commercial success,\" said Dr. Loretta P. Mayer, Chair, CEO and Co-Founder of SenesTech.\nSenesTech will hold a conference call today at 5:00pm ET (2:00 PT) to discuss these results and expectations for the coming year.\nKey commercial milestones and recent highlights:\nPartnered with national pest management professional (PMP), Pestmaster Services, to deploy ContraPest in January 2018; Established relationships with 5 additional regional PMPs; Appointed 20-year Orkin executive Joe Malinowski as Vice President of Sales in February 2018; Signed national distribution agreements with Univar for ContraPest ® in October 2017 and Target Specialty Products in November 2017; Supplied PMPs in two large metropolitan cities for the expansion of infrastructure projects, with additional proposals to several other key municipal markets; EPA approved label change that expands use of ContraPest ® in broader settings, including agricultural applications; and Exhibited at numerous pest trade shows showcasing the innovative ContraPest technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility control.\nManagement Discussion\n\"We spent much of 2017 focused on building an organization that has the ability to effectively market and sell our innovative ContraPest ® technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility control. We believe much of the hard work required to position the organization for success was accomplished during 2017, and now 2018 is all about sales execution,\" said Dr. Mayer.\n\"During 2017, we established key distribution agreements with Univar and Target Specialty Products to create market access to many of the leading pest management professionals (PMPs) around the United States. In conjunction with providing this expanded distribution access, we have continued to develop relationships with key PMPs, who are now expanding their deployment of ContraPest ® . These PMP relationships are just the tip of the iceberg for what we believe will be the opportunity for ContraPest ® . In addition to establishing these initial distributor and PMP relationships, we are significantly expanding our marketing campaigns to build a strong brand and to share how ContraPest ® can support Integrated Pest Management protocols, while also learning how we can best support them as they fight their toughest rodent infestations. In addition to our distributor and PMP focus, we continue to progress the science and work with municipal and government customers to support their moves from trial to commercial deployment.\"\nDr. Mayer concluded, \"While we are still early in the sales and marketing process and only a few months into 2018, the last couple of quarters have seen a doubling of customers and revenue. We expect to demonstrate the commercial potential of ContraPest ® in 2018, in terms of revenue growth and a trajectory to profitability.\"\n2017 Annual Financial Results\nRevenues from product sales during 2017 were $52,000, compared to less than $1,000 of revenue from product sales during 2016. During 2016, the company received $132,000 in NIH grants, and $186,000 in licensing fees under our former license agreement with Neogen.\nOperating expenses during 2017 were $12.3 million, compared to $10.8 million during 2016. Operating expenses during 2017 included non-cash equity compensation of $3.7 million. The increase in operating expense was attributable largely to expansion of product commercialization activities. The Company anticipates that operating cash utilization will continue at or below $750,000 per month.\nNet loss during 2017 was $12.3 million or $1.12 per share, compared to $11.0 million, or $1.71 per share, during 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure of operating performance, was $(8.2) million during 2017, compared to $(6.0) million during 2016.\nCash, cash equivalents and highly liquid investments at the end of the year were $7.1 million.\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Conference Call Details\nDate and Time : 5:00 pm ET (2:00 pm PT) on Thursday, March 29, 2018.\nCall-in Information : Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing (844) 308-3351 or (412) 317-5407.\nLive Webcast Information: Interested parties can access the conference call via a live Internet webcast, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at http://senestech.investorroom.com/ .\nTo Ask a Question : The conference call will be moderated by Lytham Partners, an investor relations firm.

However, this measure is not intended to be a substitute for those financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has been included because management believes that, when considered together with the GAAP figures, it provides meaningful information related to our operating performance and liquidity and can enhance an overall understanding of financial results and trends. See our attached financials for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the nearest GAAP measure.\nAbout SenesTech\nSenesTech is changing the paradigm of pest management by targeting the root cause of the problem: reproduction.\nContraPest ® is an innovative technology that targets the reproductive capabilities of Norway and roof rats. As a highly palatable liquid bait, the formulation promotes sustained consumption, bringing populations down and keeping them down. ContraPest® is dispensed inside tamper resistant bait stations, and our delivery system is designed to minimize handler exposure and the risks to non-target species.\nAs a versatile tool, ContraPest® can be used within your Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program to help reduce reproduction and magnify the success of your IPM protocols, or as a standalone, non-lethal solution for customers that are looking to reduce or eliminate their use of lethal methodologies.\nContraPest® is a Restricted Use Pesticide, due to applicator expertise.
