Officer John Fransen of the California Highway Patrol confirmed that shots have been fired, according to ABC affiliate KGO. He did not say whether police have confirmed any injuries. NBC Bay Area quoted a local fire captain as saying that a gunman had taken hostages inside the home. CHP and Napa County fire officials could not immediately be reached for comment. The veterans home was under lockdown and people inside were told to shelter in place, local media reported. “This in an active and fluid situation,” California Highway Patrol Sergeant Robert Nacke told reporters in Yountville, though he declined to provide any further information about the situation inside the home. A local CBC affiliate reported that at least two hostages had been taken. The California Department of Veterans Affairs said it was following reports of gunfire at the home, and that the safety of its residents, workers and the community were its top priority. “We have activated our emergency response protocol and are cooperating with law enforcement,” the department said in a Facebook post. “Further official information will be provided by law enforcement when it is confirmed.” The Yountville Veterans Home, located in Napa Valley wine country about 50 miles northeast of San Francisco, is the largest such facility in the United States and is home to about 1,000 veterans, according to the home’s website.
