Wallace struck four birdies and an eagle to card a two-under-par 70 and move to the top of the leaderboard on seven-under, where he was joined by Sharma after the Indian carded a level-par 72. Sharma, 21, has continued his strong run after last week’s performance at the WGC-Mexico Championship, posting a course record in the previous round on Friday. “I’m very happy,” Wallace said. “There are some brilliant players up there. You know there is going to be a charge tomorrow and someone is going to play well. I just have to go out there and try to execute like I did today and see how it goes. “I’m going to rock up tomorrow and do the same as I’ve done all week. It’s such a hard golf course that you have got to play well. I’ll try to get a good night of sleep tonight and go from there.” Scotland’s Stephen Gallacher is a shot below the leading duo after an impressive round that saw him hit five birdies and an eagle to card a five-under 67. Argentina’s Emiliano Grillo, who entered the weekend with a four-shot lead, had a round to forget after carding a six-over 78 to drop to joint-fourth alongside Briton Andrew Johnston and Austrian Matthias Schwab at five-under. Spaniard Pablo Larrazabal and American Kim Sihwan are joint-seventh at four-under while Paul Peterson, Portugal’s Ricardo Gouveia and Briton Aaron Rai are a further shot behind.
