The distributor’s Canadian steel supplier is already rationing shipments for customers.\nSteel prices were already on the rise in the U.S. market, with hot-rolled coil up nearly 19 percent in February 2018, on an annual basis, buoyed by demand from the construction, automotive and energy sectors, said Joe Innace, Platts’s content director, metals/Americas.\nTrump ordered a probe into whether steel imports threaten U.S. national security last April. The Commerce Department released the delayed results of the “Section 232” investigation in January and steel prices had been steadily rising in advance.\n“We feel they (steel prices) will continue to go up,” said a third source. “Canada just dodged a bullet, but the battle isn’t over.\nThe source who works at a service center that supplies the auto sector in the United States and Canada said he is purchasing more steel products from mills in both countries.\nAll three sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they didn’t want to publicly discuss industry purchasing trends.\nReporting By Allison Martell and Allison Lampert, additional reporting by Joseph White in Detroit, editing by Clive McKeef\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T23:55:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
