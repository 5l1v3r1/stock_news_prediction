(NASDAQ: STRA) today announced financial results for the period ended December 31, 2017. Financial highlights are as follows:\nThree Months Ended December 31:\nFor the fourth quarter, student enrollment at the Company’s main operating unit, Strayer University, increased 6% to 48,144 compared to 45,509 for the same period in 2016. New student enrollment for the period increased 4% and continuing student enrollment increased 6%. Revenue was $118.7 million compared to $119.3 million for the same period in 2016, as higher enrollment was offset by lower revenue per student due to higher scholarships during the fall term. Income from operations decreased to $11.7 million from $19.7 million for the same period in 2016, due to costs associated with the Company’s pending merger with Capella Education Company. Adjusted income from operations increased 10% to $20.2 million from $18.4 million in the same period in 2016 1 .\n1 For more information on adjusted results and other non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, refer to the information on pages 8 through 11. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the corporate tax rate and thus reduced the value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets by $11.4 million as of December 31, 2017. As a result, the Company recorded a net loss of $6.5 million compared to net income of $11.7 million in the same period in 2016. Adjusted net income grew 18% to $12.3 million from $10.5 million for the same period in 2016. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) was $16.7 million compared to $24.2 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $28.6 million from $26.9 million in the same period in 2016. Net loss per share was $0.61 compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.07 for the same period in 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 15% to $1.09 from $0.95 for the same period in 2016. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased 3% to 11,273,000 from 10,971,000 for the same period in 2016.\nYear Ended December 31:\nRevenues increased 3% to $454.9 million compared to $441.1 million for the same period in 2016, principally due to higher enrollment partially offset by lower revenue per student. Income from operations was $52.2 million compared to $57.5 million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted income from operations grew 4% to $56.6 million from $54.3 million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted operating income margin increased slightly to 12.4% from 12.3% for the same period in 2016. Net income was $20.6 million compared to $34.8 million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted net income grew 8% to $34.9 million from $32.3 million for the same period in 2016. EBITDA was $70.9 million in 2017 compared to $75.3 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $88.7 million from $85.1 million in the same period in 2016. Diluted earnings per share was $1.84 for 2017 compared to $3.21 for the same period in 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $3.11 from $2.98 for the same period in 2016. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased 3% to 11,199,000 from 10,845,000 for the same period in 2016.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $155.9 million and no debt. Cash flow from operations grew 26% to $56.2 million, from $44.5 million during 2016. Capital expenditures for 2017 were $18.1 million compared to $13.2 million for the same period in 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 5.8% compared to 4.6% for the same period in 2016.\nThe Company had $70.0 million of share repurchase authorization remaining at December 31, 2017. No shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nQ1 2018 Outlook\nTotal enrollments at Strayer University for the first quarter 2018 are anticipated to grow 6% to approximately 46,100 students from 43,387 students for the same period in 2016. New student enrollments and continuing student enrollments are expected to increase approximately 6% each. Revenue per student for the first quarter is expected to decrease by approximately 5% due primarily to higher continuation of students participating in new scholarship programs launched in the fall term 2017. Notwithstanding continued declines in revenue per student, the Company expects year over year revenue growth in the first quarter. Additionally, the Company expects the tax rate for the first quarter to be in the range of 21% to 22%, excluding the impact of non-deductible merger costs.\nNew Campus Openings\nThe Company announced today that it plans to open three to five new campus locations in 2018. The first new campus, located in Macon, Georgia, will open for the start of the spring academic term. The Macon campus and subsequent new campuses will incorporate a new smaller cost-efficient design intended to service a student body that values a brick-and-mortar presence, even while taking an increasing majority of their courses online.\nCommon Stock and Common Stock Equivalents\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had 11,167,425 common shares issued and outstanding, including 466,128 shares of restricted stock. The Company also had 250,000 restricted stock units outstanding and 100,000 vested stock options outstanding.\nCommon Stock Cash Dividend\nThe Company announced today that it declared a regular, quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. This dividend will be paid on March 19, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 12, 2018.\nMerger Update\nOn January 19, 2018, stockholders of both Strayer Education, Inc. and Capella Education Company approved all proposals related to the pending merger. On February 27, 2018, the U.S. Department of Education completed its pre-acquisition review of the transaction without any material conditions, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in November 2017 granted early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The merger, which is anticipated to close in the third quarter of 2018, is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by the Higher Learning Commission.\nConference Call with Management\nStrayer Education, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 earnings results at 8:30 a.m. (ET) tomorrow morning, March 2, 2018.

We discuss management’s reasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures below, and the press release schedules that follow reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP measure to each non-GAAP measure that we reference. Although management evaluates and presents these non-GAAP measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income, earnings per share or any other comparable financial measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, we may calculate and/or present these non-GAAP financial measures differently than measures with the same or similar names that other companies report, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others.\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s financial performance because those non-GAAP measures allow for period-over-period comparisons of its ongoing operations before the impact of these items. These measures are Adjusted Income from Operations, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS). We define Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS to exclude (1) fair value adjustments related to the Company’s acquisition of the New York Code + Design Academy and the related tax effects, and adjustments to the Company’s reserve for leases on facilities no longer in use and (2) charges associated with the Company’s previously announced merger with Capella Education Company and severance charges associated with a staff reduction program. We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS to also exclude adjustments to the provision for income taxes which include a reduction in the value of the Company’s deferred tax asset as a result of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We define EBITDA as net income before provision for income taxes, investment income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and from this amount in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA we also exclude the amounts in (1) and (2) above and stock-based compensation expense. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on pages 9 through 11. Non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP measures.\nSTRAYER EDUCATION, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nADJUSTED INCOME FROM OPERATIONS, ADJUSTED NET INCOME,\nAND ADJUSTED EPS\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nFor the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Non-GAAP Adjustments As Reported (GAAP)\nFair Value\nAdjustments (1)\nMerger\nCosts (2)\nDeferred Tax\nAsset (3)\nAs Adjusted (Non-GAAP)\nIncome from operations $ 11,688 $ — $ 8,465 $ — $ 20,153 Investment income 342 — — — 342 Interest expense 161 — — — 161 Income before income taxes 11,869 — 8,465 — 20,334 Provision for income taxes 18,364 802 241 (11,375 ) 8,032 Net (loss) income $ (6,495 ) $ (802 ) $ 8,224 $ 11,375 $ 12,302 (Loss) earnings per share: Basic ** $ (0.61 ) $ (0.07 ) $ 0.77 $ 1.06 $ 1.15 Diluted ** $ (0.61 ) $ (0.07 ) $ 0.73 $ 1.01 $ 1.09 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 10,701 — — — 10,701 Diluted 11,273 — — — 11,273 For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Non-GAAP Adjustments As Reported (GAAP)\nFair Value\nAdjustments (1)\nMerger\nCosts (2)\nDeferred Tax\nAsset (3)\nAs Adjusted (Non-GAAP)\nIncome from operations $ 19,654 $ (1,260 ) $ — $ — $ 18,394 Investment income 135 — — — 135 Interest expense 161 — — — 161 Income before income taxes 19,628 (1,260 ) — — 18,368 Provision for income taxes 7,910 — — — 7,910 Net income $ 11,718 $ (1,260 ) $ — $ — $ 10,458 Earnings per share: Basic ** $ 1.10 $ (0.12 ) $ — $ — $ 0.99 Diluted ** $ 1.07 $ (0.11 ) $ — $ — $ 0.95 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 10,616 — — — 10,616 Diluted 10,971 — — — 10,971 ** Earnings per share data may not foot due to rounding.
