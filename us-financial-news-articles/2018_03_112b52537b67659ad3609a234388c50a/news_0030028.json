We drove increased sales at all divisions over Q1 last year and controlled costs, allowing us to deliver improved margins and profitability.\n\"As I discussed at the end of Q4, we are building a culture of positive energy and accountability where we leverage the correct channels and invest in the necessary resources to address the needs of the market. These new go-to-market strategies and channel models are working with higher sales and bookings across all divisions in Q1. These increases helped us raise our January 31, 2018 backlog to $20.2 million, compared to $4.0 million at October 31, 2017.\n\"We continue to build momentum and while we are cautiously optimistic about the rest of year, we do expect our current backlog to power significant growth in net sales for the fiscal second quarter ending April 30, 2018, compared to the same quarter last year.\"\nFirst Quarter Results\nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, typically the Company's seasonally weakest quarter, increased 56% to $10.3 million compared to $6.6 million in the first quarter last year. Net sales at the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly (Custom Cabling) segment increased 89% to $7.7 million from $4.1 million in the first quarter last year. Custom Cabling accounted for 75% of total sales in the quarter and benefited from higher sales of various types of custom cabling, fiber optic cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies, wiring harnesses, transceivers/converters, and other data center equipment. The RF Connector and Cable Assembly (RF Connector) segment sales, which accounted for 25% of first quarter sales, increased 4% to $2.6 million from $2.5 million in the first quarter last year.\nGross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 65% to $3.1 million from $1.9 million and improved to 30% of sales from 28% of sales in the same quarter last year due primarily to the increased revenues at the Custom Cabling segment.\nEngineering expenses increased $0.1 million for the first quarter to $0.3 million, compared to $0.2 million in the same quarter last year, to support higher salaries related to the ongoing development of new products particularly at the Custom Cabling segment.\nSelling and general expenses increased by $0.2 million, or 10%, but declined to only 21% of sales compared to 30% of sales in the first quarter last year. The increase in expenses was related to higher commissions and accrued bonuses.\nFirst quarter operating income improved by $0.9 million, resulting in an operating profit of $0.5 million compared to an operating loss of $0.4 million in the first quarter last year.\nNet income for the quarter was $0.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.2 million, or $0.02 net loss per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nBalance Sheet Data\nAt January 31, 2018, the Company reported working capital of $13.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 million, a current ratio of 3.8-to-1, no outstanding debt, and stockholders' equity of $21.9 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company paid out cash dividends of $0.02 per share, or $0.2 million.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call and webcast for tomorrow, March 14, 2018, at 11:30 a.m. EDT to discuss its results for the first quarter.
