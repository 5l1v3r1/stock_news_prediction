The latest of these reduced net income in the fourth quarter to $35 million, missing an average forecast of $137 million of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. \nFull-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) totaled $645 million, well short of an annual target of at least $770 million. Including depreciation and amortization (EBIT), operating profit of $329 million also missed a minimum target of $450 million. \nEven adjusted for one-time effects such as the writedowns - $54 million for executive jets and $9 million in defense during the quarter - EBIT and EBITDA missed 2017 targets that Embraer had reaffirmed in October. \nUnexpected additional costs for flight testing the new KC-390 military airlifter contributed to that miss, Chief Financial Officer Jose Filippo told journalists on a call. \nIn November, Embraer said it had stopped flying the first prototype of the KC-390, which is due to enter service this year, after a stall test pushed the cargo jet beyond its operating limits. Filippo said the plane has resumed testing. \nThe company narrowed its 2018 revenue outlook by $200 million to between $5.4 billion and $5.9 billion, compared to $5.84 billion last year. Embraer also lowered its estimate for maximum cash burn this year, or negative free cash flow, to $100 million from a prior forecast of $150 million, citing more certainty about estimates. \n(Reporting by Brad Haynes; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Will Dunham)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T11:30:28.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
