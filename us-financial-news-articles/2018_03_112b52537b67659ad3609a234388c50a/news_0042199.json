Sisi won nearly 97 percent of the vote in 2014, but less than half of eligible Egyptians voted even though the election was extended to three days.\nIn remarks earlier this month that suggest Sisi may see the vote as a referendum on his performance, he said: \"If (all Egyptians) vote and a third say 'No', that would be a lot better than if half that number turn out and all of them say 'Yes'.\"\nSeveral opposition figures called for a boycott of the vote after all major opposition campaigns withdrew, saying repression had cleared the field of credible challengers.\nArrests Sisi's top opponent, former military chief of staff Sami Anan, was arrested and halted his presidential bid after the army accused him of running for office without permission.\nEven before campaigning officially begun, the United Nations, rights groups and opposition figures criticized the run-up as compromised by arrests, intimidation of opponents and a nomination process stacked in favor of the incumbent.\nThe Civil Democratic Movement, an opposition political coalition, sharply criticized Sisi on Feb. 2 for a speech in which he warned off anyone seeking to challenge his rule and said the events of 2011, which toppled longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, would never happen again.\nThe movement called the speech an attempt to spread fear that undermined the integrity of electoral competition.\nIn a letter to the Donald Trump administration's foreign policy team, the Working Group on Egypt, a bipartisan group of U.S. foreign policy specialists, said the \"sham election\" would take place against a backdrop of massive human rights abuses.\n\"We urge you not to treat this election as a legitimate expression of the Egyptian people's will and to withhold praise or congratulations,\" it said.\nIt said Sisi was expected to have his supporters in parliament propose amendments to the constitution to remove presidential term limits. Sisi has said he will not seek a third term in office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T10:27:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
