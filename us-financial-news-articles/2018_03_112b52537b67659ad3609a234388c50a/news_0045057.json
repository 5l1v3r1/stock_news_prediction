REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo Ren will step down as vice chairman, though he will remain as CEO and board member under the new board, Huawei said in a statement to Reuters, confirming reports in local media.\nThe telecoms industry has been expecting the 73-year-old to eventually retire but the company has given no exact timeframe.\nHuawei said Liang Hua, who has held various positions since joining the company in 1995, will become chairman, replacing chairwoman Sun Yafang.\nRen’s daughter, Meng Wanzhou, who is CFO, was elected one of the four vice chairpersons in the board reshuffle, Huawei said.\nThe company also said its rotating CEO system, in which Guo Ping, Eric Xu and Ken Hu used to take turns as CEO, would be replaced by a rotating chairman system.\nThe chairmen will include Guo, Xu and Hu. Huawei did not provide more details.\nThe new appointments take place with immediate effect, Huawei said.\nHuawei was founded by Ren, a former People’s Liberation Army officer in 1987. The company has grown into a global player in telecom equipment and a key brand in mobile phones.\nIn December, it flagged overall and smartphone revenue figures for 2017 that represented its slowest growth in four years, and vowed to extend its global reach with more premium products next year.\nReporting by Sijia Jiang in HONG KONG and Lee Chyen Yee in SINGAPORE.
