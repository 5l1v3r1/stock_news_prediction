REUTERS/Hannah McKay It said the investigation would focus on the Cooperative Bank’s failed bid for 632 branches of Lloyds Banking Group in 2013. The PRA said it supported the call to launch an independent review of its supervision during a disruptive period for the bank, which was later found to suffer from significant funding problems and poor corporate governance. “Since it was established in 2013, the PRA has been committed to learning the lessons of the past and the findings of this review will help the PRA meet its objectives in the future”, the regulator said in a statement.
