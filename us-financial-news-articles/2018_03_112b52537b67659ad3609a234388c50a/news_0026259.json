DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen wants a “permanent fix to DACA and lasting border security,” said DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton. “The secretary has been very clear that any legislation must reflect these two tenets,” Houlton said. \nIt wasn’t clear Wednesday if Trump was changing the demands he had set previously in the immigration debate. Trump has insisted on four policy pillars, and the DHS statement notably made no mention of two of them: cuts to family-based migration, and an end to the diversity-visa lottery, which admits 50,000 people chosen at random from countries that are underrepresented.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T22:10:48.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
