Australia’s biggest lender suffered a surprise drop in its first-half 2018 profit, stemming from expenses related to an anti-money laundering lawsuit against the bank.\nCBA’s issue follows Westpac Banking Corp’s announcement last month that it would issue debt to raise a similar amount.\nThe bank’s shares ended 0.9 percent higher on Friday, compared to a broader market rise of 0.3 percent.\n$1 = 1.2830 Australian dollars Reporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru Editing by Stephen Coates & Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T20:07:39.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
