(HFF) announces the $110.5 million sale of and $76 million acquisition financing for Carlton Arms of Bradenton, a 900-unit, garden-style apartment community in Bradenton, Florida.\nThe HFF team marketed the property on behalf of the seller, a joint venture between The Mahaffey Apartment Company and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. MetLife Investment Management advised Brighthouse on this investment. FLF Holdings purchased the offering free and clear of existing debt. Additionally, HFF worked on behalf of the new owner to secure the 10-year, fixed-rate loan through Freddie Mac’s CME Program.
