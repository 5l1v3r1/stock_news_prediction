Modi, who had promised to double farmers’ income over five years, remains popular nearly four years into his term. But unrest has flared in states ruled by his party, catching regional leaders flat-footed. The farmers, wearing red caps and waving red communist party flags, chanted slogans demanding higher food grain and milk prices as they marched through south Mumbai, where many big companies and the central bank have headquarters.

The state has transferred 138 billion rupees to the accounts of 3.6 million farmers, state Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said last week. Mumbai traffic was largely unaffected as farmers reached the city at around midnight on Sunday but police said they were on alert in case of disruption later. The state government arranged a train to take farmers back home late on Monday, Fadnavis said.
