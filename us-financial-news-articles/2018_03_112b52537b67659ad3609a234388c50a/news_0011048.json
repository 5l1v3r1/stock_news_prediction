REUTERS/Nacho Doce The company expects to announce the price range in a filing with Brazilian securities industry regulator CVM this week, the sources said, requesting anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nRi Happy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe company and its controlling shareholder, Carlyle Group LP ( CG.O ), may raise up to 1 billion reais ($309 million) in the primary and secondary portions of the offering.\nRi Happy has hired banks Banco BTG Pactual SA, Goldman Sachs & Co, Itaú BBA SA, Credit Suisse Group, Bradesco BBI SA and BB Banco de Investimento SA to manage the offering. Ri Happy initially filed for the IPO with securities regulators on Jan. 23.\nIn the preliminary prospectus, Ri Happy said it planned to use the money to expand its network of 259 stores and to fund acquisitions. The toy retailer said it intends to buy specialty retailers focused on products for infants and young children, which are less subject to seasonality than toy retailers.\nRi Happy posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 141 million reais ($43.5 million) last year from net revenue of 1.278 billion reais.\nReporting by Carolina Mandl, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:40:29.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
