(3,427) in Vehicles and Services\nComments by Henrik Henriksson, President and CEO\n\"Scania's net sales rose to a record high SEK 119.7 billion, an increase of 15 percent compared to the previous year. Truck deliveries reached an all-time-high and demand for our new truck range was good. Higher vehicle and service volume impacted earnings positively, offsetting higher production costs for running double product ranges, constraints in the supply chain and an unfavourable market mix. Operating income in 2017 amounted to SEK 12.4 billion, which gave an operating margin of 10.4 percent. In 2017, vehicle orders surpassed the level of 100,000 for the first time due to the new truck generation and our global reach. Order bookings for trucks rose by 30 percent compared to the previous year. The strong demand for trucks continued in large parts of Europe. In Eurasia, Russia's strong recovery is continuing. The trend in Latin America is positive with continued good demand in Argentina and a slight improvement in Brazil. In Asia, demand mainly increased in Iran and China. Order bookings in Buses and Coaches increased by 11 percent, mainly related to Russia and Iran. In the business area Engines, order bookings were strong in all segments. Growth in service volume continued and revenue amounted to a record high SEK 23.7 billion, an increase of 10 percent (8 percent in local currencies). With more than 300,000 connected vehicles in the fleet, Scania is able to continually improve its customer offering with increasingly efficient services for improved profitability. Financial Services reported its highest ever operating income of SEK 1.3 billion and credit losses remain at low levels. The introduction of the new truck generation is continuing. With the launch of trucks for long-haulage, construction and most recently trucks for urban traffic, Scania has unveiled all the products in the new truck family. The new fuel-efficient vehicles offer enhanced drivability, improved safety, ergonomics, comfort and even better overall economy. In 2017, more than 13,000 trucks were delivered from Scania's new truck range. With an average reduction in fuel consumption of over five percent per vehicle, this will provide total estimated savings of more than 30,000 tonnes in global carbon emissions. During the fourth quarter, Scania also introduced a six-cylinder 13-litre gas engine specifically designed for long-haulage and unveiled its new Scania Citywide Low Floor bus, which is fully electrically-powered.\"\nContact persons\nSusanna Berlin\nInvestor Relations\nTel. +46-8-553-861-12\nMobile +46-70-086-05-02\nErik Ljungberg\nCorporate Relations\nTel. +46-8-553-835-57\nMobile tel. +46-73-988-35-57\nThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.com\nhttp://news.cision.com/scania/r/correction--scania-year-end-report-january-december-2017,c2475996\nThe following files are available for download:\nhttp://mb.cision.com/Main/209/2475996/808212.pdf\nScania Year-end Report 2017\nhttp://news.cision.com/scania/i/16277-019-002,c2369098\n16277-019 002\n releases/correction-scania-year-end-report-january-december-2017-300616676.html\nSOURCE Scania", "external_links": ["http://mb.cision.com/Main/209/2475996/808212.pdf", "http://news.cision.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/correction-scania-year-end-report-january-december-2017-300616676.html", "http://news.cision.com/scania/r/correction--scania-year-end-report-january-december-2017,c2475996", "http://news.cision.com/scania/i/16277-019-002,c2369098"], "published": "2018-03-20T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T18:49:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
