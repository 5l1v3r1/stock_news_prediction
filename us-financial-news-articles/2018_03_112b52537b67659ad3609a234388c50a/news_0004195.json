British judges will not be able to refer questions of interpretation to the European Court of Justice.\nThat would mean that those citizens’ right to be joined by families after the implementation period would be governed by British, rather than EU law - effectively allowing for a tighter regime than the current EU system, which grants family members entry rights automatically.\nThe policy was seen by some as a concession to Brussels, which wants those arriving during the transition to be treated the same as those already in Britain before Brexit.\n“May has climbed down on the key part, that EU citizens can stay on after the end of transition ... but they are still arguing around the edges,” said Jonathan Portes, senior fellow at think tank, UK in a Changing Europe.\n“It is a concession to the reality as to what the UK administration can deliver,” he added.\nCurbing immigration was a key reason Britons voted to leave the EU in 2016, following a large influx of EU citizens, especially from poorer countries in eastern Europe.\nReporting by William James and Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:08:19.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
