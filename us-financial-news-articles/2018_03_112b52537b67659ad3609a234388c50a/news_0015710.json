His mental and physical health are good, and he said that at the moment he does not want to see the Swedish doctor,” he added.\nChina had already informed Sweden of this, and hoped Sweden could respect this, Geng said.\n“As for the Swedish side’s unwarranted criticism, China absolutely cannot accept it.”\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T20:27:51.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
