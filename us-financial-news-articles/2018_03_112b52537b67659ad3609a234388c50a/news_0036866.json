In a confrontation with the police, the suspect detonated a device and died, he said. Shots were fired during the encounter with police. \n“We believe that this individual is responsible for all incidents that have taken place in Austin, starting on March 2nd and those that have occurred since then as well,” Chief Manley said, referring to the wave of bombings that have killed two people and wounded several more. \nOfficials said they hadn’t yet identified a motive, and they would be investigating whether any accomplices aided the suspect. Earlier reports said the suspect was 24 years old. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T15:57:56.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
