(TSX: CPH) and Cardiome Pharma Corp. (Nasdaq:CRME and TSX:COM), today announced their entry into a definitive arrangement agreement pursuant to which Cipher will acquire the Canadian business portfolio of Cardiome. The proposed transaction will be completed pursuant to the acquisition by Cipher of all of the outstanding shares of Cardiome, following a restructuring of Cardiome pursuant to a statutory plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act. Pursuant to the arrangement, Cardiome shareholders will receive common shares, on a one-for-one ratio, of a newly created Canadian entity named Correvio Pharma Corp. that will apply for a substitution listing on the Nasdaq and TSX. Correvio will acquire and hold all of Cardiome's pre-transaction assets, excluding the Canadian business portfolio being acquired by Cipher under the arrangement. The arrangement is described in further detail below.\nThe Canadian business portfolio to be acquired by Cipher includes commercial and pipeline hospital products administered in the acute care setting, including:\nBrinavess® (vernakalant IV), for the rapid conversion of recent onset atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm; Aggrastat® (tirofiban hydrochloride), for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome; Xydalba™ (dalbavancin hydrochloride), the first and only 30-minute, one-dose treatment option for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections; and Trevyent® a drug device combination that delivers treprostinil, the world's leading treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension.\nBrinavess and Aggrastat are currently on the market in Canada. Xydalba, which is approved and marketed by Allergan in the U.S. under the trade name Dalvance®, may receive a regulatory approval decision in Canada as early as the end of 2018. A Canadian regulatory filing for Trevyent is planned in 2019.\nStrategic & Financial Benefits of the Transaction for Cipher\nEstablishes attractive new vertical with expansion into Hospital Specialty business; Provides additional revenue streams, growth programs and near-term launches; Provides access to future product opportunities as Correvio's preferred partner in the Canadian territory; Demonstrates continued execution against growth strategy aimed at assembling a diversified portfolio of prescription medicines across a range of therapeutic areas; and Proposed structure preserves potential tax attributes existing within Cardiome.\nStrategic & Financial Benefits of the Transaction for Cardiome\nProvides important upfront and non-dilutive consideration of $25.5 million CAD; Reduces cash burn; Establishes a long-term collaboration with a top-tier Canadian pharmaceutical company that is expected to result in additional product licenses between the two companies; Enables Cardiome to focus internal resources on its rapidly growing European direct sales business and rest of world commercial initiatives; and Provides added financial flexibility to execute new strategic transactions and/or add new Europe-focused growth products.\n\"This acquisition accelerates the expansion of our Canadian commercial portfolio, bringing additional revenue streams and pipeline assets, while marking our entry into the Hospital Specialty vertical, which is a growing segment of the Canadian market,\" said Robert D. Tessarolo, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cipher. \"The business being acquired has products for well-defined patient populations in the acute care setting where we can leverage our commercial capabilities and the important work already completed by Cardiome. We believe this strategic transaction highlights our commitment to executing on our stated strategy of building a diversified portfolio of prescription products that will deliver robust and reliable growth for our shareholders.\"\n\"Cipher is a leading specialty pharma company with a highly-experienced commercial team in the Canadian marketplace,\" said William Hunter, MD, Chief Executive Officer and President of Cardiome. \"This transaction enables us to focus our internal resources on our rapidly growing European business and rest of world commercial initiatives, along with providing important financial flexibility for the execution of potential future business development transactions. It also allows us to secure important non-dilutive capital, while reducing our cash burn. We believe this new strategic path creates a more robust company and leaves us well positioned for long-term growth.\"\nSummary of Arrangement\nThe proposed transaction will be completed by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act. Pursuant to the arrangement, among other steps and procedures, the following transactions will occur:\nAll of the outstanding common shares of Cardiome will be assigned and transferred to Correvio in exchange for common shares of Correvio. Following the completion of the share exchange, each former shareholder of Cardiome will hold the same pro rata interest in Correvio as it held in Cardiome immediately prior to such share exchange.\nAll of the assets and liabilities of Cardiome, other than the Canadian business portfolio to be acquired by Cipher, will be transferred to and assumed by Correvio.\nCipher will subsequently acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Cardiome, which will then be 100% owned by Correvio and hold only the Canadian business portfolio, for cash consideration of $25.5 million (CAD). Cipher expects to finance this acquisition with a combination of cash and new debt.\nUnder the terms of the arrangement agreement, Cipher will also have a right of first refusal, for a limited period following closing, to license from Correvio the Canadian rights of any pharmaceutical product that it (or its affiliates) licenses in the future for additional consideration to Correvio.\nThe proposed arrangement will require the approval of at least 66⅔ percent of the votes cast in person or by proxy by shareholders of Cardiome at a special meeting expected to be held on or about May 9, 2018.\nAll of the directors and senior officers of Cardiome have entered into voting and support agreements with Cipher pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to vote in favour of the arrangement.\nIn addition to the approvals required from shareholders of Cardiome and the Supreme Court of British Columbia, the arrangement is also subject to applicable regulatory approvals, including Nasdaq and TSX approval, and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions customary for a transaction of this nature. The definitive arrangement agreement includes customary deal protections, including fiduciary-out provisions, non-solicitation covenants, and the right to match any superior proposals. Additionally, a termination fee of $2.5 million (CAD) is payable by Cardiome to Cipher in certain circumstances, and a reverse termination fee of $2.5 million (CAD) is payable by Cipher to Cardiome in certain circumstances, if the proposed arrangement is not completed.\nCardiome Board Approval\nThe Board of Directors of Cardiome, after receiving financial and legal advice, has unanimously approved the arrangement agreement and unanimously determined that the arrangement is fair to the shareholders of Cardiome and is in the best interests of Cardiome. Further, the Board of Directors of Cardiome will recommend that shareholders of Cardiome vote in favour of the arrangement.\nIn making these determinations, the Board of Directors of Cardiome considered, among other things, an opinion addressed to the Board of Directors from Evans & Evans, Inc. to the effect that, based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, and qualifications stated in such opinion, the consideration to be received by the shareholders of Cardiome pursuant to the arrangement (being comprised of common shares of Correvio) is fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of Cardiome. A complete copy of the fairness opinion of Evans & Evans, Inc., which should be read carefully and in its entirety, will be included in the management information circular to be mailed to shareholders of Cardiome in connection with the special meeting to be held to consider and approve the arrangement.\nAdditional Information\nComplete details of the terms and conditions of the arrangement are set out in the definitive arrangement agreement, which will be publicly filed by each of Cipher and Cardiome under their respective profiles on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and, in the case of Cardiome, on EDGAR at www.sec.gov .\nIn addition, further information regarding the arrangement will be contained in the management information circular to be mailed to shareholders of Cardiome in connection with the special meeting to be held to consider and approve the arrangement, which will be filed by Cardiome on SEDAR and EDGAR at the time that it is mailed to shareholders.
