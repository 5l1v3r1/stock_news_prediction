(NYSE American: NBY), a biopharmaceutical company focusing on commercializing prescription Avenova ® for the domestic eye care market, reports financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2017 and provides a business update.\n“I’m pleased to announce strong fourth quarter financial performance and full year sales of $18.2 million, which is at the high end of our guidance range,” said Mark M. Sieczkarek, NovaBay’s Chairman, President and CEO. “Avenova sales for the quarter were a record $4.9 million with 90% of sales from the high-margin retail pharmacy channel as we matched our highest quarterly gross margin on Avenova sales of 92%. This strong performance coupled with lower stock-based compensation and a gain on the change in the fair value of the warrant liability resulted in net income of $0.8 million for the quarter.\n“We expect a key priority for 2018 to be improving commercial insurance reimbursement on Avenova sales,” he added. “Earlier this year, we implemented a strategy aimed at increasing net sales per unit by focusing sales and marketing resources on a select group of high-prescribing eye care specialists in regions where we believe reimbursement is already strong. Preparations are also underway to work more closely with managed care organizations to obtain new or improved coverage.\n“Another key initiative this year is refocusing our inside sales team toward direct sales to practitioners’ offices. We believe this channel will continue to be an important component of our sales with many eye care professionals reluctant to convert to writing Avenova prescriptions,” concluded Sieczkarek.\nKey Fourth Quarter Avenova Metrics\nAvenova sales of $4.9 million increased 25% year-over-year Prescription sales into the retail pharmacy channel were $4.4 million, up 45% year-over-year Prescription sales represented 90% of Avenova sales Gross margin on Avenova sales was 92%\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $6.3 million, an increase of 55% from $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin on net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 85%, an increase from 80% for the prior-year period. Gross margin on Avenova sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 92%, up from 87% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $3.3 million, compared with $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, with the increase due primarily to a higher number of sales representatives and increased sampling and marketing programs. G&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.5 million, a decrease of 25% from $2.0 million for the prior-year period, with the decrease due primarily to lower stock-based compensation on performance-based awards, partly off-set by recording of the former CFO’s retirement package. R&D expenses were unchanged at $0.1 million for fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.4 million, a significant improvement from an operating loss of $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-cash gain on the change of fair value of warrant liability was unchanged at $0.4 million for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.8 million, or $0.05 per share on a basic basis, an improvement from a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $1.6 million, or $0.11 per share on a basic basis.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales for 2017 were $18.2 million, an increase of 53% from $11.9 million for 2016. Gross margin on net sales for 2017 was 85%, up from 79% for 2016. Gross margin on Avenova sales for 2017 was 91%, an improvement from 86% for the prior year\nSales and marketing expenses for 2017 were $13.7 million, an increase of 16% compared to 2016. G&A expenses were $8.6 million, an increase of 19% compared with 2016. R&D expenses for 2017 were $0.4 million, a decrease of 70% from 2016. Operating loss for 2017 was $7.3 million, an improvement of 33% from the operating loss of $11.0 million for 2016.\nNon-cash loss on the change of fair value of warrant liability for 2017 was $0.1 million, compared with a non-cash loss of $2.1 million for 2016.\nThe net loss for 2017 was $7.4 million, or $0.48 per share, compared with a net loss of $13.2 million, or $1.40 per share, for 2016.\nNovaBay reported cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 million as of December 31, 2017, compared with $9.5 million as of December 31, 2016. In February 2018, the company raised $6.0 million through a private placement of common stock.\nThe Company used $6.3 million in cash to fund operations in 2017, an improvement from $12.1 million used to fund operations in 2016. The decrease in cash usage was primarily due to the decrease of net loss resulting from higher sales, higher stock-based compensation and stock option modification expense, and favorable changes in working capital offset by the decrease in the gain on change of the warrant liability fair values and the decrease of warrant modification expense.\nConference Call\nNovaBay management will host an investment community conference call today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss the Company’s financial and operational results and to answer questions.
