That is in line with other market estimates, although some analysts have forecast a rise of as much as 10 percent.\nThe company posted a profit of S$186.7 million ($141 million) for the fourth quarter ended December, compared with S$243.8 million a year ago. It said year-ago results were boosted by several factors, including divestments and high-margin projects.\nThe company, which has been acquiring land for development in Singapore over the past year, said it had 2,750 residential units in the pipeline. It said on Tuesday that the company and its partner had submitted the top bid of S$509.37 million for another site.\nThe company said it would continue to look for more land acquisition opportunities.\nOn Wednesday, the company also said it aimed to become a leading fund manager in Asia, with a target to attain assets under management of $5 billion by 2023.\n$1 = 1.3242 Singapore dollars Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Vyas Mohan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:19:33.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
