The progress achieved yesterday and the day before in Ghouta by the Syrian Arab Army was made during this truce,” Assad said in broadcast comments to journalists.\n“Therefore we must continue with the operation in parallel with opening the way for civilians to leave.”\nHe was referring to a daily humanitarian ceasefire called by Russia from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. (0700 GMT to 1200 GMT), which the United States has dismissed as“a joke”.\nReporting by Ali Abdelaty and Tom Perry; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T03:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T22:48:01.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
