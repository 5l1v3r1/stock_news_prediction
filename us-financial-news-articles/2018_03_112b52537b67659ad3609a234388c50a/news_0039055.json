Much of what we achieved in 2017 laid the foundation for our new initiatives. These accomplishments include the integration of AVM, and launching our Innovation Lab, which incubated our blockchain strategy and our new live video streaming entertainment service, Camfrog Live,” said Alex Harrington, Chief Executive Officer.\n“For almost twenty years, the Company has been an innovator in delivering multimedia communication over web and mobile, amassing 26 patents in the process. We now continue that pioneering tradition with our leadership in integrating blockchain technology into real-time media delivery. With the introduction of PSP and our Business Solutions offerings, we now can commercialize this powerful technology base not only through our popular consumer applications, but via new B2B sources of revenue as well. We underscore the recent launch of Business Solutions by today announcing our first client, the blockchain innovator ProximaX, for whom we are providing technology services and integrating PSP. For all these reasons, the corporate rebranding was not only a renaming, but also a broadening of the commercial opportunities available to our strong technology platform,” added Mr. Harrington.\n2018 Business Objectives:\nPeerStream’s business objectives in 2018 include:\nAdvancing development of PSP, our multimedia delivery protocol that integrates with blockchain technology; Developing our Business Solutions offerings; Launching a beta version of Backchannel, our new secure video messaging service leveraging blockchain technology and its benefits; Growing our live video streaming entertainment business by increasing the content creator base and monetization for Camfrog Live, and extending this service to users of the Paltalk application; Exploring strategic opportunities such as business partnerships and M&A opportunities; and Continuing to defend our intellectual property.\nJason Katz, Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer added, “We have deep roots in developing applications that are enjoyed and trusted by hundreds of millions of users across the globe. Our evolution to incorporate blockchain technology was a natural one and we look forward to introducing PSP and Backchannel. It’s through our development of innovative solutions such as these, based on our expertise accrued over decades of work and significant financial investment, that we believe PeerStream will attract a growing list of partners and clients.”\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe ended the year with approximately $4.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt, with cash and cash equivalents nearly flat as compared to December 31, 2016 with a decrease of approximately $25.5 thousand; Cost reductions from merger integrations have resulted in annualized savings of $3 million; and Management believes the Company has sufficient working capital to fund operations, R&D and organic growth initiatives.\nJudy Krandel, Chief Financial Officer, commented, \"PeerStream continues to be in a solid financial position with sufficient resources to support our significant new corporate initiatives, including investment in blockchain development projects such as PSP. With the benefit of the AVM Merger integration and expense rationalization behind us, and supported by the strategic investment from Hershey Capital, we intend to continue to self-fund investments to drive internal growth initiatives.”\nQuarterly Results Conference Call\nWe will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss these results today at 4:30pm Eastern Time.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude interest income (expense), net, depreciation and amortization expense, gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivative liabilities, loss on disposal of fixed assets, income tax expense and stock-based compensation expense. The Company calculates bookings as subscription revenue recognized during the period plus the change in deferred subscription revenue recognized during the period.\nManagement uses these financial metrics internally in analyzing the Company’s financial results to assess operational performance and to determine the Company’s future capital requirements. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. The Company believes these financial metrics are useful to investors and others to understand and evaluate the Company’s operating results and it allows for a more meaningful comparison between the Company’s performance and that of competitors.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditures for assets underlying depreciation and amortization expense that may need to be replaced or for new capital expenditures; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our working capital requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; and Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider these financial metrics along with other financial performance measures, including total revenues, subscription revenue, deferred revenue, net income (loss), cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, net cash used in operating activities and our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nPEERSTREAM, INC.\n(F/K/A SNAP INTERACTIVE, INC.)\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,137,050 $ 4,162,596 Credit card holdback receivable 140,789 172,169 Accounts receivable 479,148 958,695 Prepaid expense and other current assets 228,296 1,047,483 Total current assets 4,985,283 6,340,943 Property and equipment, net 622,712 793,305 Goodwill 13,086,472 14,304,667 Intangible assets, net 3,920,443 5,605,193 Other receivables 52,267 82,435 Long term security deposits 97,270 397,608 Total assets $ 22,764,447 $ 27,524,151 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 2,374,253 $ 1,665,831 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 405,646 472,406 Deferred subscription revenue 2,553,826 2,828,827 Total current liabilities 5,333,725 4,967,064 Deferred rent, net of current portion -
