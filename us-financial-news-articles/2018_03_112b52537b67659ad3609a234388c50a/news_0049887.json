Wall Street scored its best day in 2-1/2 years and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its third-biggest point gain ever on Monday.\nThe dollar was flat against a basket of currencies at 88.991 , its weakest level since Feb. 16.\n“There is this sense in the market that the situation might not escalate into a trade war,” said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.\nAsian currencies like the Korean Won and Chinese Yuan, which hit a new 2-1/2 year high, were also big winners overnight as both were expected to fare badly if trade tensions ratcheted up.\nThe offshore yuan strengthened to a high of 6.2364, the firmest level since Aug. 11, 2015.\nThe Malaysian rinngit hit a two-month high of 3.8700 per U.S. dollar.
