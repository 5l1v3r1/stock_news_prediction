This investment has taught us a great deal about car sharing and the acquired knowledge will be most valuable to us as we continue to expand our fully owned companies such as Ubeeqo, BlueMove or Brunel in the New Mobility space.\nAs mentioned during our recent investor day, the Europcar Group will significantly expand its exposure to New Mobility segments - such as car sharing, ride hailing, multi-modal platforms and car pooling. We expect to spend between 150 to 250 million euros over 2018-2020 in New Mobility capex and M&A (including strategic partnerships). The sale of our 25% stake in car2go Europe significantly contributes to this funding.\nOur aim is to address better new customer needs and continue to leverage the Group’s key assets, namely its fleet management capabilities and its diversified customer reach, to position the Group successfully in the Mobility ecosystem in order to capture its double-digit growth prospects by 2025”.\nJörg Lamparter, Daimler’s Head of Mobility Services, stated:\n“Over the course of the last several months, we have intensified our investments in mobility services in order to create a holistic mobility system with a broad portfolio. As part of this strategy, we decided to fully acquire the remaining shares in car2go Europe.\nWe want to thank Europcar for their great support as we went from a car sharing start up to the leading car sharing company in the world”.\nAbout Europcar Group\nEuropcar Group is a major player in mobility markets and is listed on Euronext Paris.
