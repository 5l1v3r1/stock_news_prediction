Second is these are dues to overseas branches of Indian banks which are also regulated by foreign authorities. So, it will send them a wrong signal.”\nBankers have said the fraud could lead to increased scrutiny of Indian banks operating overseas, and risks undermining foreign lenders’ trust in India’s banking sector if not tackled swiftly.\nCiting an unnamed banker, the Economic Times paper reported on Monday that Union Bank would have to treat PNB as a defaulter in its books, in what could create a “peculiar” situation.\nThe source told Reuters, however, that no bank was moving to declare PNB a defaulter, and that the bank would act as directed by the government and the RBI on the payment for the LoUs.\nThe source, who asked not to be named as the discussions were private, said PNB was hoping for a resolution before March 31, when the banks’ fourth quarter ends.\nIf needed, PNB could make a conditional payment until any outstanding disputes were resolved, the source said.\nA finance ministry spokesman said he was not aware of a meeting between the bank and the government.\nAn RBI spokesman and the heads of the five banks - PNB, Union Bank, UCO Bank, State Bank of India and Allahabad Bank - did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nPNB, which in December raised 50 billion rupees ($770 million) by selling shares to institutional investors and is also in the process of receiving nearly 55 billion rupees as part of a government cash injection programme, is adequately capitalised to take the load of any provisioning burden, the source said.\nThe fraudulent LoUs, valid for one year and issued on behalf of companies owned by jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, are due between January and April this year, according to police and court documents.\nBoth Modi and Choksi are out of India and have denied any wrongdoing.
