However we are very much for the view that global solutions are needed. I will strongly argue that the European Union should wait for the OECD to complete its work before deciding on how to act,” Varadkar told parliament. “The Commission has published a set of proposals today which recommends a short term temporary levy of 3 percent on certain digital activities. I will be making clear my views that any such measure will be ill-judged for the reasons set out and also because it would likely disadvantage smaller member states.” (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T16:47:04.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
