The Lady Luck Vicksburg transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. Closing of the Presque Isle purchase, which is also conditioned on the closing of the Lady Luck Vicksburg transaction, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nPresque Isle opened its casino in February 2007 and operates approximately 1,600 slots, 32 table games and a poker room. It began live thoroughbred racing in September 2007 and conducts approximately 100 live thoroughbred race dates each year. Lady Luck Vicksburg operates approximately 620 slots, 9 table games and includes an 89-room hotel. Based on the properties’ combined operational performance, the transaction price represents an aggregate multiple of approximately 8.2 times the properties’ trailing twelve month EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), net of cash acquired. After anticipated synergies of $1.1 million, the aggregate multiple drops to 7.9 times.\nThe transactions will be funded with cash on hand and through the Company’s existing credit facility. Both acquisitions are asset purchases, which the Company expects will provide tax benefits that will effectively reduce the transaction price multiple.\nCDI Chief Executive Officer Bill Carstanjen explained why Presque Isle and Lady Luck Vicksburg are appealing investments for the Company.\n“We are excited about welcoming both of these properties to the Churchill family. Presque Isle will give us a foothold in Pennsylvania which has recently passed legislation authorizing real money online gaming. The Lady Luck Vicksburg is immediately adjacent to our Riverwalk facility and offers us operational efficiencies in a stable region. Both properties fit our investment criteria and will be immediately accretive to our shareholders.”\nBoth properties are owned by Eldorado Resorts, Inc.
