Shares initially took a hit on the news and then stabilized.\nCramer said the stock move may be \"good sign\" that the company is in good shape. \"It's kind of a cool time to go,\" Cramer said. \"Lloyd is going to do what's right for Goldman.\"\nGoldman declined comment to CNBC.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
