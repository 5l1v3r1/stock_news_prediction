He said in a statement circulated in Angolan media on Tuesday that he was cooperating with the investigation and had handed his passports in to the prosecutor general’s office.\nReuters has also been unable to reach Da Silva for comment.\nStandard Chartered said it is closely cooperating with Angola’s central bank and British law enforcement.\nA source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that HSBC had frozen a bank account in connection with the alleged fraud.\nThe Financial Times, which reported the HSBC bank freeze earlier, said documents purporting to be from Swiss bank Credit Suisse were also used in the fraud.\nThe documents were fake and Credit Suisse was not involved in the transaction, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nBritain’s National Crime Agency said the funds were frozen after the transaction raised suspicions, without naming the banks involved.\nStandard Chartered, which has operations across Asia and Africa, ended its dollar-clearing operations with commercial banks in Angola in Dec. 2015 because it deemed it too risky.\nSingapore said last week its central bank had imposed penalties of nearly $5 million on Standard Chartered Bank and Standard Chartered Trust (Singapore) for breaching money laundering rules and terrorism financing safeguards.\nHSBC’s move to freeze the accounts and work with authorities to return the funds will reinforce the lender’s assertion that its efforts to improve financial controls are bearing fruit.\nThe bank paid $1.9 billion in fines to U.S. authorities in 2012 and agreed to install an independent monitor to improve its anti-money laundering controls, after it was used to launder Mexican cartel drug money.\nA five-year period in which the bank faced criminal prosecution if it breached U.S. compliance rules again ended in December.
