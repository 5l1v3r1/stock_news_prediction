It opened the restaurant in October, 2016. Chipotle’s new Chief Executive Brian Niccol, the former Taco Bell CEO, starts his new job on March 5 and is tasked with turning around business at the burrito seller, which has struggled to fully recover from sales and reputation-battering food safety lapses in 2015.
