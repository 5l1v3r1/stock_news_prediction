Bahl, Ph.D., as Head of Protein Design. The new leadership team members join Joseph Jardine, Ph.D., Head of Antibody Discovery, who has been with IPI since its inception.\n\"Recruiting such top-caliber scientific talent has been a major achievement for IPI,\" said Timothy Springer, Ph.D., Chairman and Cofounder. \"Together, they add unparalleled expertise in high-throughput approaches and cutting-edge protein engineering that will transform IPI's ability to create open-source antibodies against all human extracellular proteins. Our efforts will drive innovation and accelerate the discovery of new protein-based research tools, diagnostics, and therapeutics. I am thrilled to have all three aboard.\"\nSteven Almo is Chair of the Department of Biochemistry, Professor of Physiology & Biophysics, and Director of the Macromolecular Therapeutics Development Facility at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He also previously led the New York-Structural GenomiX Research Consortium. He will retain his appointments at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, while serving as President of IPI.\nPrior to joining IPI, James Love was Director of Expression Technologies at ATUM (formerly DNA2.0), where he set up a state-of-the-art facility for mammalian protein production. He was also previously Director of Technology Development at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Head of Research for the New York Consortium on Membrane Protein Structures.\nChristopher D. Bahl comes on board at IPI following postdoctoral studies under David Baker at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. There, he developed computational design methods and tools to create hyperstable, constrained peptides de novo. Before that, he studied the molecular mechanisms of bacterial host-pathogen interaction at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth.\nAbout Institute for Protein Innovation (IPI).\nIPI is a non-profit research organization whose mission is to foster innovation in protein research, train the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs in protein science, forge new ties between academic and industry investigators, and bridge the missing link between genomics and therapeutics. IPI has built a high-throughput antibody discovery platform for developing open-source antibodies targeting the entire human extracellular proteome. This resource will produce critical tools, lead therapeutics, and technologies that empower academic and industry scientists, catalyze entrepreneurship, and accelerate drug discovery.\nproteininnovation.org\nMedia Contact: media@proteininnovation.org\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/institute-for-protein-innovation-ipi-expands-leadership-team-300606755.html\nSOURCE Institute for Protein Innovation", "external_links": ["http://www.proteininnovation.org/", "https://proteininnovation.org/team#leadership-banner", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/institute-for-protein-innovation-ipi-expands-leadership-team-300606755.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T19:27:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
