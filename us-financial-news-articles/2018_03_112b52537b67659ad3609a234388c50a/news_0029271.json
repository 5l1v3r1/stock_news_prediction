(NYSE:EXPR), a specialty retail apparel company, announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. These results, which cover the fourteen and fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2018, are compared to the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended January 28, 2017. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were calculated using the fourteen and fifty-three week periods ended February 3, 2018, as compared to the fourteen and fifty-three week periods ended February 4, 2017.\nDavid Kornberg, the Company's president and chief executive officer, noted that, \"While our overall 2017 full year results were below plan, our performance showed improvement over the course of the year, as our key initiatives gained traction. We were particularly pleased with the performance of our e-commerce business, which continues its significant growth and accounted for over $500 million in sales in 2017. We are confident that our strategy will continue to yield improved results and believe that Express is uniquely positioned to capture opportunities presented by the ongoing retail industry transformation. For 2018, we are focused on delivering compelling product, growing our customer base and brand awareness, and pursuing double-digit growth in our e-commerce business. In addition, we will continue to expand our omni-channel capabilities, while further optimizing our store footprint.\"\nMr. Kornberg continued, \"Our financial position remains strong with more than $235 million in cash and no debt, and we generate solid cash flow. Since our Board authorized a $150 million share repurchase program in November, we have repurchased $25 million, or 3.2 million shares, underscoring our confidence in the business and commitment to driving shareholder value.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results:\nNet sales increased 2% to $693.8 million from $678.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 net sales benefited from an extra week, which was worth $26 million. Comparable sales (including e-commerce sales) decreased 1%, compared to a 13% decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016. E-commerce sales increased 20% to $203.3 million. On a comparable sales basis, e-commerce sales increased 17%. Merchandise margin increased by 130 basis points driven by sourcing-related cost savings. Buying and occupancy as a percentage of net sales decreased by 30 basis points. In combination, this resulted in a 160 basis point increase in gross margin, representing 30.0% of net sales compared to 28.4% in last year’s fourth quarter. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $162.6 million versus $154.0 million in last year's fourth quarter, an increase principally due to the extra week in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased by 70 basis points to 23.4%. Operating income was $44.2 million, or 6.4% of net sales, compared to $38.8 million, or 5.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2016. Income tax expense was $14.6 million, at an effective tax rate of 33.2%, compared to $15.5 million, at an effective tax rate of 40.5% in last year's fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a one-time gain of approximately $3.1 million related to tax reform, specifically the re-measurement of the Company's deferred taxes, as well as a tax impact of $0.4 million related to the exit of Canada. Net income was $29.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, net income was $26.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, excluding the aforementioned tax-related items. This compares to net income of $22.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Real estate activity for the fourth quarter of 2017 is presented in Schedule 5.\nFull Year 2017 Operating Results:\nNet sales decreased 2% to $2,138.0 million from $2,192.5 million in 2016. In 2017, net sales benefited from an extra week which was worth $26 million. Comparable sales (including e-commerce sales) decreased 3%, compared to a 9% decrease in 2016. E-commerce sales increased 23% to $509.0 million from $413.4 million in 2016. On a comparable sales basis, e-commerce sales increased 22% in 2017 as compared to 2016. Operating income was $29.7 million, and on an adjusted basis was $53.9 million in 2017. This compared with $103.6 million in 2016. Net income was $19.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $57.4 million, or $0.73 per diluted share in 2016. On an adjusted basis, net income was $28.4 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $64.3 million, or $0.81 per diluted share in 2016.\nBalance Sheet And Cash Flow Highlights:\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $236.2 million at the end of 2017 versus $207.4 million at the end of 2016. During the fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2018, approximately $17.3 million was used to repurchase approximately 2.1 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. Capital expenditures totaled $57.4 million for 2017 compared to $98.7 million for 2016. Inventory was $266.3 million at the end of 2017 compared to $241.4 million at the end of 2016.\nShare Repurchase Program:\nOn November 28, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorized the Company to repurchase up to $150 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock using available cash. Under this authorization, the Company repurchased 2.1 million common shares for $17 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Subsequent to year-end, the Company has repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for $8 million and currently has $125 million remaining under its authorization. The Company’s first quarter and full year 2018 guidance reflects share repurchases made to date, however does not contemplate any future share repurchases.\nTax Legislation:\n\"H.R.1\", formerly known as the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\", was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The new tax legislation will affect the Company by reducing its corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and through a one-time re-measurement of the Company's deferred taxes using this new lower tax rate. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a one-time gain related to the value of the Company's deferred taxes of $3.1 million. Excluding the impact of discrete items, the Company estimates that its operating tax rate will be reduced to approximately 28% due primarily to the new tax legislation.\nRevenue Recognition Changes:\nThe Company adopted the new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revenue recognition standard effective in the first quarter of 2018. The new standard impacts the timing of e-commerce revenue recognition and the accounting treatment for the Company's loyalty and private label credit card programs, however it will not have a material impact on the Company's overall financial statements. The Company is utilizing the full retrospective method of adoption, and accordingly, has recast its income statements for 2017 and 2016. The Company has included the recast statements in the Form 8-K filed with the SEC as Exhibit 99.3 on March 14, 2018 and has also made them available on the Investor Relations section of its website. The Company's first quarter and full year 2018 guidance is based on the new standard.\n2018 Guidance:\nThe table below compares the Company's projected results for the thirteen week period ended May 5, 2018 to the recast results for the thirteen week period ended April 29, 2017, which reflect retrospective adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.\nFirst Quarter 2018\nGuidance\nFirst Quarter 2017\nResults\nComparable Sales -1% to 1% (10)% Effective Tax Rate NM (1) 64.5% (2,4) Interest Expense, Net $0.3 million $0.8 million Net (Loss)/Income ($3.0) to $0.0 million ($2.7) million (2,3,4) Adjusted Net (Loss)/Income N/A ($3.7) million (4,5) Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) ($0.04) to $0.00 ($0.03) (2,3,4) Adjusted Diluted EPS N/A ($0.05) (4,5) Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding 75.9 million 78.4 million (1) Not meaningful for the first quarter of 2018 due to the projected near break even pre-tax income and the expected negative impact from certain discrete tax items totaling approximately $1.5 million.

This tax impact is expected to raise the Company's effective tax rate for the full year above its operating tax rate of approximately 28%. (2) Includes a net $12.1 million tax benefit related to the exit of Canada, as well as a $3.1 million net tax benefit related to tax reform, specifically the re-measurement of the Company's deferred taxes. (3) Includes $24.2 million in restructuring costs and inventory adjustments related to the exit of Canada. (4) Retrospectively adjusted to reflect adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. For additional information regarding the adjustments see Exhibit 99.3 to the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2018.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide additional useful information to assist stockholders in understanding its financial results and assessing its prospects for future performance. Management believes adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are important indicators of the Company's business performance because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the Company's underlying operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in the business. In addition, adjusted operating income is used as a performance measure in the Company's short-term cash incentive compensation program and adjusted diluted earnings per share is used as a performance measure in the Company's long-term executive compensation program for purposes of determining the number of equity awards that are ultimately earned. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported operating income, reported net income and reported diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the below reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's business. Management strongly encourages investors and stockholders to review the Company's financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nFourteen Weeks Ended February 3, 2018 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net Income Diluted\nEarnings per\nShare\nWeighted\nAverage\nDiluted\nShares\nOutstanding\nReported GAAP Measure $ 29,429 $ 0.37 78,927 Income Tax Expense - Canadian Exit 402 0.01 Impact of Tax Reform (3,051 ) (0.04 ) Adjusted Non-GAAP Measure $ 26,780 $ 0.34 Fifty-Three Weeks Ended February 3, 2018 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Operating\nIncome\nNet Income\nDiluted\nEarnings per\nShare\nWeighted\nAverage\nDiluted\nShares\nOutstanding\nReported GAAP Measure $ 29,740 $ 19,366 $ 0.25 78,870 Impact of Canadian Exit 24,151 24,151 0.31 Income Tax Benefit - Canadian Exit — (12,067 ) (0.15 ) Impact of Tax Reform — (3,051 ) (0.04 ) Adjusted Non-GAAP Measure $ 53,891 $ 28,399 $ 0.36 Fifty-Two Weeks Ended January 28, 2017 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net Income Diluted\nEarnings per\nShare\nWeighted\nAverage\nDiluted\nShares\nOutstanding\nReported GAAP Measure $ 57,417 $ 0.73 79,049 Interest Expense (a) 11,354 0.14 Income Tax Benefit (b) (4,428 ) (0.06 ) Adjusted Non-GAAP Measure $ 64,343 $ 0.81 (a) Represents non-core items related to the amendment of the Times Square Flagship store lease.
