He's very proud because everybody else, you know, we're getting killed.\"\n\"... So, he's proud. I said, 'Wrong, Justin, you do.' I didn't even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, 'You're wrong.' You know why? Because we're so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, 'You're wrong, Justin.' He said, 'Nope, we have no trade deficit.' I said, 'Well, in that case, I feel differently,' I said, 'but I don't believe it.' I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, 'Check, because I can't believe it.'\"\nAs The Washington Post notes, the U.S. Trade Representative office says the country actually has a trade surplus with Canada, an American ally.\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's emailed request for comment.\nTrump has frequently complained about the U.S.'s trade deficits with economies such as the European Union and China . He has also accused those economies of ripping off the U.S. and hurting American workers.\nFor more on what Trump said during the fundraising speech, see The Washington Post article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T06:52:38.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
