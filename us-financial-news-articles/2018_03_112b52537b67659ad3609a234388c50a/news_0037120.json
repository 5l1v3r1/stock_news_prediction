It was up 0.69 percent, at $1.4035.\n\"That's a positive for the British pound. It has the potential to strengthen further,\" Tomes said.\nThe strength in euro and sterling put downward pressure on the dollar as traders speculated whether the Federal Reserve may signal a faster pace of rate increases in the coming months as the labor market tightens further. The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-setting group, will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nRates futures imply traders have fully priced in a rate increase which would raise the target range to 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent.\nThe dollar index , which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.43 percent, to 89.85.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T05:38:59.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
