Prosecutors are looking into allegations that Sarkozy’s 2007 election campaign was aided by millions of euros in money from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. \nAccording to Le Figaro, Sarkozy said he was the victim of a destabilization campaign that began in March 2011, based on accusations from Tripoli and a Franco-Lebanese businessman who is also at the center of a judicial inquiry that began in 2013 but snowballed this week when Sarkozy was held for questioning.
