Many are also wary of reviving an offer made before the Brexit referendum to help Britain curb EU immigration.\nBlair said Britain could do more on its own if it remained in the EU to make it harder for people to come in but said there was also a broad sentiment elsewhere in Europe that governments should be able to control EU migration somewhat.\nHe said immigration was generally good for the economy but had to be managed to avoid provoking a popular backlash.\nAs prime minister, Blair was responsible for opening British doors to eastern European immigration as soon as Poland and other ex-communist states joined the EU in 2004 when Germany, France and other big economies exercised rights to hold off on granting them free entry for several more years.\nCalling for a second referendum to consider the final deal on offer from Brussels, Blair rejected suggestions that his was a “Don Quixote exercise” and said he believed British debate was opening up as voters grappled with what he called a dilemma between losing trade or losing control of economic rules.\n“European leaders share the responsibility to lead us out of the Brexit cul-de-sac,” he said. “In Europe there is often a sorrowful shaking of heads and a shrugging of the shoulders, when what we need is strong engaged leadership to avoid a rupture which will do lasting damage to us both.”\nReporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:43:43.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
