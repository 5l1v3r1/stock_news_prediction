Various Trump-branded properties have dropped the name since the president took office last year.\nEarlier on Monday, Orestes Fintiklis, the owner of the hotel in Panama who has been fighting a legal battle to oust the Trump Organization's hotel management team, said a court had ended the fight.\n\"Today, this dispute has been settled by the judges and the authorities of this country,\" he said, without giving further information. \"Today, Panama has made us proud.\"\nPanamanian legal authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Trump Organization said that the spat will ultimately be settled by an arbitration panel under the International Chamber of Commerce.\nWhen it was completed in 2011, the 70-floor, sail-shaped building was Trump's first international hotel venture â€” a complex including apartments and a casino in a waterfront building that has earned Trump between $30 million and $50 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T08:07:09.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
