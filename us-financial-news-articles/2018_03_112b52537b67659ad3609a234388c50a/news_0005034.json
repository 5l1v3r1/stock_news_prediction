Beginning this month, Katie Bowman takes the reins as the Experience Production Director, and Rebecca Eyre has been appointed the Director of Strategy & Insights, leading the agency's new consultancy, separately branded as moreHuman.\nJoining the agency from digital media darling Refinery29, Katie Bowman will now lead the agency's award-winning production team. With a deep passion for creativity and immersive experience, Katie is charged with further defining the future of consumer engagement. Before her recent work on Refinery's \"29Rooms\", Katie held a leadership role as the Executive Producer at Rubik, a boutique experiential agency with a niche in film and television. With a hand in all aspects of program management, Katie led national marketing activations for HBO's Game of Thrones, ABC's Shark Tank and 20th Century Fox's X-Men. Aside from her commercial work, Katie is excited to leverage her experience as creative director of Brooklyn art collective Treetops, known for absurdist dance parties at Brooklyn's House of Yes as well as other immersive events at dusty warehouses throughout New York.\nAs part of the agency's ongoing effort to delve deep into the world of experience for both brands and the people they serve, Mirrorball has formed a new consultancy called moreHuman.
