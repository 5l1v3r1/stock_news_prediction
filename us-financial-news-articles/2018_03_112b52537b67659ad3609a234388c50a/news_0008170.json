He won Saturday in his third NHL start, capping the night with 15 saves in a perfect third period at Rogers Place. The Rangers have won three straight.\nChris Kreider put the Rangers on the board just 54 seconds into the game. Kreider intercepted a clearing attempt in the Edmonton zone and then completed a perfect give-and-go with Zibanejad by burying a one-timer past Oilers goalie Cam Talbot on the game’s first shot.\nConnor McDavid pulled the Oilers even at 5:43 of the second period with his 30th goal of the season. McDavid got the puck at his own blue line, raced down the left wing, and before running out of space, simply fired a sharp-angled offering that beat Georgiev on the short side for his 15th goal in his past 16 games.\nZibanejad restored New York’s lead with a power-play goal at 7:51 of the second period. With the Rangers given a man advantage because Talbot shot the puck over the glass, Zibanejad was on the spot for a loose puck and buried the rebound.\nThen Paul Carey tallied at 9:07 of the second period to give the Rangers a 3-1 lead. Carey drove to the net as linemate Cody McLeod fired the puck toward the goal, and Carey deflected the offering past Talbot.\nHowever, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins brought the Oilers within one with 3:12 remaining in the middle frame. On a delayed penalty, McDavid turnstiled Rangers defender Marc Staal before firing a pass that Nugent-Hopkins — in his first game back after missing 18 outings due to cracked ribs — promptly buried.\nTalbot stopped 31 shots for the Oilers, who have lost three straight.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T13:14:13.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
