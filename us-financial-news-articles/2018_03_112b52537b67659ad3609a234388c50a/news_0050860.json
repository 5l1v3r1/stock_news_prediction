There is no question we could do a better job with that in terms of just applying practical, private company practices to that population and I think we'd save a lot there,\" Wichmann said.\n\"I'd also have everybody kind of get focused on a similar mission and drive a culture to improve health care costs by lowering them, drive greater levels of effectiveness overall and making sure that we are driving a great deal of consumer satisfaction.\"\nWatch David Wichmann's full interview here: show chapters UnitedHealth Group CEO: In 10 years, tech will push health care to become more value-based 17 Hours Ago | 11:07 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
