REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi “The UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency, is alarmed at a further deepening of the humanitarian crisis in Syria as fierce fighting in eastern Ghouta, rural Damascus and Afrin causes massive new displacement,” UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic told a Geneva briefing. “These people left with nothing and they need esentially everything from clothes to shelter.” About 70 percent of the 50,000 evacuated from eastern Ghouta are women and children and many children are suffering diarrhoea and respiratory ailments which can be deadly, as well as scabies and lice, UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado said. UNICEF estimates that about 100,000 people are still inside Afrin district, half of whom are children, she added.
