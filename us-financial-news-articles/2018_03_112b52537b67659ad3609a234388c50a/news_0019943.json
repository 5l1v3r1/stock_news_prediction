That represents nearly half the roughly 4,000 SDF fighters who once fought Islamic State, according to the Deir Ezzour military council, an SDF-allied group. \nThe exodus is potentially risky, experts say, because Islamic State still has hundreds of fighters and is still a potent threat despite having lost 98% of the territory it had seized, according to the U.S. military.\nThe Trump administration will have to act to prevent a “jihadist resurgence,” said Jennifer Cafarella, a Syria expert at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.\n“An ISIS resurgence is not a far-off threat,” she said, referring to Islamic State. “ISIS remnants are already regrouping in Iraq and ISIS still holds terrain in Syria, from which it is attacking” U.S.-backed forces.\nRelated \nAt 12 She Joined the Kurdish Militia—Now 19, She’s Had Enough Neither Pentagon nor White House officials Wednesday had a proposal for winning back the fighters or a plan for how to retain territory recovered from Islamic State without the fighters who fled. Pentagon officials on Monday simply called the halt in fighting an “operational pause.”\nU.S. military officials said some SDF fighters, notably Arab members, are still in once-Islamic State controlled areas and American forces also remain nearby. There are roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria.\n“We are going to continue to support the SDF and local Syrian civil and military councils in liberated areas as long as they focus on the defeat-ISIS fight,” a U.S. defense official said. “The coalition will still achieve our goals, but this is a complex situation.”\nBut officials privately expressed doubt whether those forces could keep Islamic State at bay or whether the Kurdish defections would be permanent. Others conceded that the move portended the potential return of Islamic State in some areas of Syria and that other parts of the country, like Deir Ezzour, could come under the control of the Syrian regime.\nIslamic State retains control in parts of the Middle Euphrates River Valley, the site of the most intense fighting in recent weeks between Islamic State, pro-regime forces and U.S.-backed forces.\nOn Jan. 20, Turkey launched its assault on Afrin in a bid to oust the Syrian Kurdish forces known as the YPG, which it considers a terrorist group, from its border with Syria. President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman said Wednesday that the U.S. should prevent Kurdish fighters it has backed from leaving the war against Islamic State and advancing toward Afrin, Turkey media reported.\nReports of SDF fighters leaving the anti-Islamic State campaign first emerged a month ago.\nThe factors that led to the apparent collapse of the SDF were long in the making, U.S. military officials acknowledge. Where the Kurds have sought an alliance, U.S. officials sometimes regarded the relationship with the Kurds as a marriage of convenience.\nThe Kurds long had expected that their role in the of defeat of Islamic State would give them a U.S. ally willing to pressure Turkey on a range of issues, including the Kurds’ desire for an independent state. U.S. strategy, meanwhile, never answered what would be done to keep Islamic State from returning once defeated.\nThe Pentagon’s Central Command, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan, has been among the biggest proponents of supporting the SDF.\n“All of structural problems in Syria from four years ago remain there and now they are coming to the fore,” one U.S. official said.\nWrite to Nancy A.
