Pothier is joining Onapsis from Carbon Black (fka Bit9), where he recently held the position of Vice President of Finance and Operations, with the prior role of CFO, of Bit9. Pothier joined Bit9 in 2008 and helped scale the company from a 40-person startup to 1,000+ employee leader in the Endpoint Security market. During his tenure as CFO he led the company’s financial planning, strategy and sales operations efforts. He led the financing efforts for the company’s four M&A transactions, including the merger with Carbon Black in 2014.\nPothier was instrumental to Bit9’s go-to-market strategy, driving the change from a perpetual selling model to a subscription model, transitioning to a channel model and participating in deal strategy and contract negotiations for many of the company’s largest customers. During his career he has raised over $150M in equity and debt financings. His experience in strategic financial planning will help Onapsis further grow in the emerging market of Business-Critical Application Security and capitalize on an already rapidly growing revenue stream.\n\"I’ve been involved with Onapsis on the Advisory Board for years and I’m excited to be joining this fast growing and dynamic company. We are truly filling a critical blind spot in information security and enabling large organizations to sleep better at night knowing that their critical applications are protected. I look forward to further enabling the Onapsis team to achieve the company’s aggressive growth goals,” said Pothier.\n“I am very happy to welcome Gordon to Onapsis, where I know he will make an immediate impact as we continue the next phases of growth for the company. His guidance and leadership have already been proven and we look forward to having him as a member of the Executive Team,” said Mariano Nunez, CEO and Co-founder of Onapsis.\nAs Onapsis’s Chief Financial Officer, Pothier is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial strategy and future planning. He has over 25 years of experience at technology companies in a financial or operations role, ten of those years specifically in information security.
