The company's CEO has been suspended and the country's Information Commissioner is seeking a warrant to raid the office.\nTweet\nThe London Met Police put road closures in place during the evacuation, while emergency services dealt with the incident.\nAlongside social media giant Facebook , the London-based elections consultancy is at the center of an ongoing dispute over the alleged harvesting and use of personal data. The allegations have heightened concerns over whether such data was then used to try and influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Brexit vote. Both companies deny any wrongdoing.\nâ€”CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T16:39:14.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
