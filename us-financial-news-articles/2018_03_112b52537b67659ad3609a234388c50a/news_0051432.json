They accuse Facebook of designing its software to make it easier for brokers to discriminate against families with children, mothers and those with disabilities.\nThe lawsuit says the company took steps two years ago to prevent racial discrimination in housing advertising but it has not yet succeeded in eliminating other kinds.\nThe company says there is \"absolutely no place\" for discrimination on Facebook. The suit seeks a court order and damages.\n2:43 p.m.\nFair housing advocates have sued Facebook, saying it lets landlords and real estate brokers target advertising to discriminate against families with children, women and others.\nThe lawsuit was filed Tuesday in New York federal court by the National Fair Housing Alliance and other organizations. It comes as Facebook faces criticism over allegations British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used details of 50 million Facebook users to help Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe housing groups say Menlo Park, California-based Facebook has abused its power as the biggest advertising agency in the world.\nThe lawsuit alleges investigations by fair housing supporters in New York, Washington, D.C., Miami and San Antonio, Texas, prove Facebook lets advertisers discriminate.
