Someone was going to break that barrier and it turned out to be him. What a great period that must have been to be alive.”\nTo Cram and Coe, the man who now runs the sport as the IAAF president, Bannister’s run of three minutes 59.4 seconds in Oxford was the almost mythical tale which underpinned their own youthful athletics days.\n“The first book I read was (Bannister’s book) The Four-Minute Mile; my coach (Jimmy Hedley) used to get me to sit and watch that grainy film in the days before YouTube,” said Cram.\n“I got to meet him after I got selected to go to the Commonwealth Games when I was 17 and he was a big part of my early athletics career development, as the biggest hero in our sport, especially for a 1500 meters runner like me.\n“I was completely awe-struck when I met him but he was a gentleman, an engaging personality who put you at your ease.”\nIMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE Cram felt the next generation of athletes were just as inspired by Bannister’s legacy.\nMo Farah, the greatest British distance runner of all and one of the finest in the sport’s annals, tweeted on Sunday:“I’m so sorry to hear the sad news about Roger Bannister.\n“I met him several times throughout my career and he was always humble, supportive and encouraging. He was an inspiration to so many.”\nAt the world indoor championships, the news cast a shadow over the final day of events on Sunday with the sell-out crowd in Arena Birmingham breaking into long applause after a special tribute to Bannister was screened.\nCoe, who had learned the news just before the launch of a new IAAF Heritage initiative designed to showcase the sport’s former greats such as Bannister, said:“This is a day of intense sadness both for our nation and for all of us in athletics.”\nCoe told his audience:“On May 6, 1954, Roger made the impossible possible...\n“It was as much a psychological as it was a physical barrier and Bannister’s success allowed mankind to enter a new world filled with possibilities,” he added.\n“His achievement was a moment in history that lifted the hearts of a nation and boosted the morale of a world still at a low ebb after the war. We have all lost a giant and for many a deep close friendship. Thank you.”\nPaula Radcliffe, Britain’s world marathon record holder, said Bannister had broken“the most iconic barrier in the history of sport”.\n“Even if (Eliud) Kipchoge had broken the two-hour barrier in the marathon, I’m not sure it could compare. Nothing will top it; it will always be the most inspirational moment in our sport.”\nGlobally, too, Bannister’s legacy was enduring with the great U.S. sprinter Michael Johnson crediting him as the inspiration behind his ground-breaking bid to combine the 200 and 400 meters.\n“Every athlete owes a great debt of gratitude to Sir Roger Bannister,” Johnson told the BBC.“He set up the idea for athletes of pushing the limits of human achievement, like (long jumper) Bob Beamon went on to do.\n“Nobody had ever done the 200 and 400 at this level before and it was special for me too, pushing those boundaries and it was all inspired over the decades by Sir Roger Bannister.”\nAdditional reporting by Aditi Prakash; Editing by Toby Davis and Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T13:15:38.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
