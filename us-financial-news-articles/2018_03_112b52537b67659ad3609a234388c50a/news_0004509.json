(“Coeur” or the “Company”) (NYSE:CDE) today announced that it has closed the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of its wholly-owned Bolivian subsidiary, Empresa Minera Manquiri, S.A.

In addition, all refunds of pre-closing value added tax (“VAT”) that will be collected or received by Manquiri in the future for any period ending on or before the closing date, net of collection costs, will be paid to Coeur. The balance of outstanding VAT at closing was $14 million.\nAs an all-stock transaction, except as otherwise specifically provided in the Agreement, all of the current and future assets and liabilities of Manquiri are retained by the entity under the new ownership by Ag-Mining.\nCoeur’s U.S. legal advisor was Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP.
