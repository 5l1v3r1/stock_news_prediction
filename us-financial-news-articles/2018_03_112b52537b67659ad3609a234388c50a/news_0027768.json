March is the end of the fiscal year for many Japanese companies, and companies generally don’t want to make late portfolio changes.\nBut perhaps the biggest factor is the Bank of Japan.\nInvestors have had little incentive to trade JGBs since September 2016, when the central bank introduced yield-curve controls in its efforts to boost the country’s economy. The effort included setting a target to keep the 10-year yield around zero. Part of doing that has been buying as many as 80 trillion yen ($753 billion) in bonds annually by some estimates.\nThe central bank owns ¥432 trillion worth of JGBs, it says. That is 44% of the total market.\n“The BOJ’s focus on buying the 10-year leaves almost no space for other investors,” said Shuichi Ohsaki, head of strategy for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nMeanwhile, central-bank Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda is set to be reappointed to a second term along with two new deputy governors in April.\nMr. Kuroda has repeatedly said the BOJ won’t change its easy-money policy unless inflation gets to 2% . The central bank has time and again had to delay when it thinks such price growth will occur. The latest target is in two years, and the country’s most-recent inflation reading was below 1%.\nBut investors aren’t convinced that the BOJ will—or can—wait that long before starting to talk about beginning the policy tightening that is under way in locales including the U.S. and Europe.\nRelated Coverage\nWhy Trading in Japan’s Government Bonds Is a Snooze (Aug. 1) Heard on the Street: Bond Markets Have Picked Up the Wrong Signal From Japan (Jan. 12) “We cannot see the next move of the BOJ clearly,” says Takahiro Sekido, Japan strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\nOut of an overabundance of caution, “the JGB market doesn’t move,” said Naoya Oshikubo, rates strategist with Barclays in Tokyo.\nThe 10-year JGB didn’t trade on Tuesday, according to the Japan Bond Trading Co. That was the first instance of a whole day without trading since June 29, according to Quick Corp. Meanwhile, 10-year yields have finished at 0.045% for the past five trading sessions.\nLow yields are also a factor in the lack of buying. Aside from White House , there has been little to drive trading this month.\nBut average trading volume was also lower in February than in the previous two years, and January’s average was one-third below that in 2016 and 2017.\nLast month, 10-year JGB yields climbed as high as 0.095% amid a global selloff in bonds and speculation that change was coming to Japan’s monetary policy. Bond yields rise when prices fall.\nThe BOJ then stepped in to tamp down yields, muffling trading volume in the process.\nNow, investors are largely waiting until the start of the new Japanese fiscal year in April, when some new and familiar faces will be formally appointed to the central bank’s leadership.\nWrite to Suryatapa Bhattacharya at Suryatapa.Bhattacharya@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T16:38:22.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
