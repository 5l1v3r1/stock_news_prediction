Mar 16, 2018; Oakland, CA, USA; Kevin Durant (35) addresses the media regarding his incomplete rib cartilage fracture injury before the game between the Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings at Oracle Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports The team said the reigning NBA Finals MVP “will be re-evaluated in two weeks,” making it unclear exactly how long the squad will be without the sharpshooting small forward, who leads the team in scoring. The Warriors are already playing without two-time league MVP Stephen Curry, whose right ankle sprain will keep him sidelined until at least March 20, and All-Star guard Klay Thompson, who is out until at least March 22 with a fractured right thumb. The Warriors, who currently sit second in the Western Conference, host the Sacramento Kings on Friday in Oakland before taking on the Suns in Phoenix on Saturday.
