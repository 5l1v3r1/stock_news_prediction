Marketing demand from developers was significantly reduced, and our e-commerce business, which is based on discount coupons, was severely and negatively impacted. Our online advertising sector, however, benefited from the development of our targeted advertising products and achieved a stable performance.\"\n\"Looking forward to 2018, we believe that the restrictive measures will persist. Against this backdrop, we have formulated our new strategy of 'New Media, New Ecosystem, and New E-commerce', aiming to further enhance our media influence and content productivity, and provide accurate and targeted advertising services by leveraging our big data capability. Meanwhile, we have extended our existing e-commerce model by offering coupon services related to a developer's brand rather than a single project, thus expanding the scope of our e-commerce services. In addition, we will continue streamlining our cost structure to improve our bottom line.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal revenues were $106.4 million, an increase of 1% from $104.9 million for the same quarter of 2016.\nRevenues from e-commerce services were $71.2 million, a slight increase from $70.9 million for the same quarter of 2016.\nRevenues from online advertising services were $32.7 million, an increase of 16% from $28.2 million for the same quarter of 2016, primarily due to an increase in property developers' demand for online advertising.\nRevenues from listing services were $2.4 million, a decrease of 58% from $5.8 million for the same quarter of 2016, primarily due to a decrease in secondary real estate brokers' demand.\nCost of revenues was $19.6 million, an increase of 40% from $14.0 million for the same quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased cost of advertising resources purchased, partially offset by decreased staffing cost as a result of headcount change.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $112.3 million, a decrease of 15% from $131.4 million for the same quarter of 2016, primarily due to decreased marketing expenses related to the Company's e-commerce business, and decreased salary as a result of headcount change.\nLoss from operations was $25.4 million, compared to $38.2 million for the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP loss from operations was $21.7 million, compared to $33.7 million for the same quarter of 2016.\nNet loss was $22.5 million, compared to 26.4 million for the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net loss was $19.4 million, compared to $23.8 million for the same quarter of 2016.\nNet loss attributable to Leju shareholders was $22.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted ADS, compared to $25.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted ADS, for the same quarter of 2016.

Since changes in market environment continued to have a negative impact on the Company's operating conditions and business outlook, an impairment loss of goodwill of $41.2 million was recognized based on the impairment assessment review.\nLoss from operations was $183.9 million, compared to $15.2 million for 2016.

Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Leju shareholders was $105.0 million, or $0.77 per diluted ADS, compared to non-GAAP net income attributable to Leju shareholders of $10.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted ADS for 2016.\nCash Flow\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $151.0 million.\nFourth quarter 2017 net cash used in operating activities was $57.6 million, mainly attributable to non-GAAP net loss of $19.4 million, an increase of $7.4 million in accounts receivable, a decrease in other current liabilities of $24.9 million, and a decrease in advance from customers and deferred revenue of $4.7 million.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company estimates that its total revenues for the first quarter of 2018 will be approximately $75 million to $77 million, which would represent an increase of approximately 10% to 13% from $68.3 million for the same quarter in 2017. This forecast reflects the Company's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nManagement Changes\nThe Company also announced that Ms. Qiong Zuo has been appointed as Chief Operating Officer of the Company while Mr. Keyi Chen, former Chief Operating Officer of the Company, has been appointed as Leju's Chief Strategy Officer.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"target,\" \"going forward,\" \"outlook\" and similar statements. Leju may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its reports filed or furnished with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Leju's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained, either expressly or impliedly, in any of the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in China's real estate market; the highly regulated nature of, and government measures affecting, the real estate and internet industries in China; Leju's ability to compete successfully against current and future competitors; its ability to continue to develop and expand its content, service offerings and features, and to develop or incorporate the technologies that support them; its limited operating history and lack of experience as a stand-alone public company, given its carve-out from E-House and prior reliance on E-House for various corporate services; its reliance on SINA and others with which it has developed, or may develop in the future, strategic partnerships; substantial revenue contribution from a limited number of real estate markets; complexities resulting from its ongoing relationships with E-House, due to E-House's principal shareholding interest in Leju; and relevant government policies and regulations relating to the corporate structure, business and industry of Leju. Further information regarding these and other risks, uncertainties or factors is included in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All information provided in this press release is current as of the date of the press release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Leju's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), Leju uses in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: (1) income (loss) from operations, (2) net income (loss), (3) net income (loss) attributable to Leju shareholders, (4) net income (loss) attributable to Leju shareholders per basic ADS, and (5) net income (loss) attributable to Leju shareholders per diluted ADS, each of which excludes share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions and goodwill impairment. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" set forth at the end of this press release.\nLeju believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding its operating performance by excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, and goodwill impairment which may not be indicative of Leju's operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Leju's historical performance and assist its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that share-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions may continue to exist in Leju's business for the foreseeable future. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables provide more details on the reconciliation between non-GAAP financial measures and their most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nFor investor and media inquiries please
