A reconciliation of Finisar’s non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as additional related information, can be found under the heading “Finisar Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nRevenue Details for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018:\nSales of datacom products increased from $256.6 million to $266.1 million, or by $9.5 million, or 3.7%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nSales of telecom products decreased from $75.6 million to $66.3 million, or by $9.3 million, or (12.3)%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nOUTLOOK\nFinisar indicated that for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 it currently expects revenues in the range of $300 to $320 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 27%-28%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 4%, and non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share in the range of approximately $0.09 to $0.15.\nFinisar has not provided a reconciliation of its fourth quarter outlook for non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share because estimates of all of the reconciling items cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts. It is difficult to reasonably provide a forward-looking estimate of certain reconciling items between such non-GAAP forward-looking measures and the comparable forward-looking GAAP measures. Certain factors that are materially significant to Finisar’s ability to estimate these items are out of its control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, including with respect to restructuring charges, litigation settlements and resolutions and related costs, and the timing of tax related adjustments. Accordingly, a reconciliation of such non-GAAP forward-looking measures to the comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are not available within a reasonable range of predictability.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nFinisar will discuss its financial results for the third quarter and current business outlook during its regular quarterly conference call scheduled for Thursday, March 8, 2018, at 2:00 pm PT (5:00 pm ET).

These non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental information regarding Finisar’s operating performance on a non-GAAP basis that excludes certain gains, losses and charges of a non-cash nature or that occur relatively infrequently and/or that management considers to be outside of our ongoing core operating results. Management believes that tracking non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share provides management and the investment community with valuable insight into our ongoing core current operations, our ability to generate cash and the underlying business trends that are affecting our performance. These non-GAAP measures are used by both management and our Board of Directors, along with the comparable GAAP information, in evaluating our current performance and planning our future business activities. In particular, management finds it useful to exclude non-cash charges in order to better correlate our operating activities with our ability to generate cash from operations and to exclude certain cash charges as a means of more accurately predicting our liquidity requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when used in conjunction with our GAAP financial information, also allow investors to better evaluate our financial performance in comparison to other periods and to other companies in our industry.\nIn calculating non-GAAP gross profit in this release, we have excluded the following items from cost of revenues in applicable periods in this release:\nAmortization of acquired technology (non-cash charges related to technology obtained in acquisitions); Duplicate facility costs during facility move (non-core cash charges); Stock-based compensation expense (non-cash charges); Reduction in force costs (non-core cash charges); Acquisition related retention payments (non-core cash charges); and Inventory write-off related to discontinued products (non-cash charges).\nIn calculating non-GAAP operating income in this release, we have excluded the same items to the extent they are classified as operating expenses, and have also excluded the following items in applicable periods in this release:\nLitigation settlements and resolutions and related costs (non-core cash charges); Acquisition related costs (non-core cash charges); Amortization of purchased intangibles (non-cash charges); Unclaimed property tax audit accrual (non-core benefits); Impairment of long-lived assets (non-cash charges); and Start-up cash costs related to our Sherman VCSEL fab until we begin commercial production.\nIn calculating non-GAAP income and non-GAAP income per share in this release, we have also excluded the following items in applicable periods in this release:\nImputed interest expenses on convertible debt (non-cash charges); Imputed interest related to restructuring (non-cash charges); Other interest income (non-core benefits); Gains and losses on sales of assets (non-cash losses and cash gains related to the periodic disposal of assets no longer required for current activities); Loss (gain) related to minority investment (non-core charges or benefits); Dollar denominated foreign exchange transaction losses (gains) (non-cash charges or benefits); and Amortization of debt issuance costs (non-cash charges).\nIn addition, in this release we have adjusted non-GAAP income and non-GAAP income per share for the difference between GAAP income taxes and non-GAAP income.\nA reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial information to the corresponding GAAP information is set forth below:\nFinisar Corporation Reconciliation of Results of Operations under GAAP and non-GAAP (Unaudited, in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Three Mon ths Ended Jan 28, 2018 Jan 29, 2017 Jan 28, 2018 Jan 29, 2017 Oct 29, 2017 GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of gross profit: Gross profit -
