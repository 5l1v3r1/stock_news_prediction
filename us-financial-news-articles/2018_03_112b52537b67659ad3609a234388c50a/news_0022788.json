(NASDAQ:ZYNE), a clinical-stage specialty neuropsychiatric pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative pharmaceutically-produced transdermal cannabinoid treatments for rare and near-rare neurological and psychiatric disorders with high unmet medical needs, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and provided an overview of recent operational highlights.\n“We made significant corporate and clinical progress throughout 2017, and achieved our goal of utilizing data from three Phase 2 studies of ZYN002 to determine the direction and strategic focus of the Company,” said Armando Anido, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Zynerba. “We enter 2018 with strong momentum including having completed a positive meeting with the FDA to discuss our clinical path for ZYN002 in Fragile X syndrome. We have a refined development and commercialization strategy focused on rare and near-rare neuropsychiatric conditions, and the expectation of achieving numerous milestones in the coming year including initiations of the pivotal Fragile X syndrome study and Phase 2 studies in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, adult refractory focal seizures, and Tourette Syndrome.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 and Recent Highlights\nZYN002 in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS)\nAnnounced Positive Meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Plans to Conduct a Single Pivotal Study of ZYN002 in Fragile X Syndrome to Support a New Drug Application (NDA) Filing\nThe Company expects to initiate a pivotal study mid-year 2018 in approximately 200 pediatric and adolescent patients in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand to support an NDA for ZYN002 in FXS. The FDA and the Company are in agreement that the primary and key secondary endpoints for the study should assess observable behaviors in patients with FXS as reported by the caregiver using the validated Aberrant Behavior Checklist in Fragile X syndrome (ABC-FXS). If the pivotal trial meets its endpoints, approval for an indication encompassing the treatment of behavioral symptoms associated with Fragile X syndrome may be granted.\nZYN002 in Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEE)\nAnnounced Intent to Study ZYN002 in DEE; Initiation of Phase 2 Trial Expected in the First Half of 2018\nDEE is a category of rare and ultra-rare, severe brain disorders manifesting with seizures or EEG abnormalities that can directly worsen cognition or behavior. The category affects ~45,000 patients in the U.S. and includes a number of syndromes, including Doose, Dravet, Lennox-Gastaut, and West, among others. The Phase 2 open label DEE study will enroll approximately 48 pediatric and adolescent patients and will help identify new indications to take into blinded placebo-controlled studies. The primary endpoints are expected to be reduction in seizures at 12 and 24 weeks. Results from the study are expected in 2019.\nZYN002 in Focal Epilepsy\nClinical Data from the STAR 1 and STAR 2 Studies of ZYN002 in Patients with Focal Seizures Presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Epilepsy Society (AES) in Washington, D.C.\nData suggest clinically meaningful responses to ZYN002, as measured by reductions in focal seizures from the baseline period of STAR 1, are correlated with longer-term use of ZYN002.\nPatients taking ZYN002 for six months experienced a >30% median reduction in seizures from baseline; Patients taking ZYN002 for nine months experienced a >65% (195 mg in STAR 1 and 390 mg in STAR 2) and >48% (390 mg in STAR 1 and STAR 2) median reduction in seizures from baseline; In STAR 1, patients with more severe epilepsy (defined as a baseline seizure frequency of ≥15 per month) taking ZYN002 had a greater percent reduction in seizures compared to patients with severe epilepsy receiving placebo; ZYN002 was very well tolerated with an incidence of adverse events comparable to placebo and no clinically significant differences between the active treatment groups; and There were no clinically significant changes in ECGs or laboratory results in patients receiving ZYN002.\nInitiation of Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Phase 2b Clinical Trial of ZYN002 in Approximately 300 Adult Patients with Refractory Focal Epilepsy Expected in the Second Half of 2018\nLearnings from the STAR 1 and STAR 2 trials provide insight into a revised Phase 2b clinical trial design. Anticipated changes to the trial include increases in (1) baseline seizure frequency, (2) patient count and (3) trial duration. In addition, the Company will stratify randomization by baseline seizure rate and gender. Zynerba also anticipates testing a higher daily dose of ZYN002 than was used in the STAR trials. The study will be conducted in sites in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand.\nZYN001 in Tourette Syndrome\nDosing Continues in the Phase 1 Program for ZYN001 Pro-drug of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Delivered via Transdermal Patch; Initiation of Phase 2 Study in Patients with Tourette Syndrome (TS) Expected in the Second Half of 2018\nThe Company is executing on a Phase 1 program to assess ZYN001, a patent-protected, pro-drug of THC delivered via a patch. This first-in-man study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of multiple formulations of ZYN001. The Company expects to complete its Phase 1 evaluation in the first half of 2018, and then move into a Phase 2 clinical trial in Tourette Syndrome late in the second half of 2018.\nCorporate\nCorporate Strategy Focused on Rare and Near-Rare Neuropsychiatric Disorders with High Unmet Medical Needs\nZynerba believes that its strategic focus provides opportunities for an efficient development and commercialization strategies that may include (1) orphan drug designation for some indications; (2) access to other available regulatory designations, which, if granted, can accelerate commercial approval; (3) a targeted physician audience enabling modest commercial investments; and (4) consistent pricing across all indications. The Company also discontinued its development programs in the capital-intensive pain spaces.\nEnhanced Senior Management Team\nIn January 2018, Liza Squires, M.D. was named Chief Medical Officer. She has over 25 years of experience in rare and neuropsychiatric disorders with companies including Aevi Genomics Medicine, Lumos Pharma, and Shire Pharmaceuticals. She also served as the Director of Pediatric Neurology for DeVos Children’s Hospital.\nIn March 2018, Joe Apostolico joined Zynerba as Vice President, Human Resources. Mr. Apostolico brings the Company over 30 years of broad global healthcare and pharmaceutical human resource leadership experience from his tenures with companies including Adaptimmune Therapeutics and GSK.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $62.5 million, compared to $31.0 million as of December 31, 2016.
