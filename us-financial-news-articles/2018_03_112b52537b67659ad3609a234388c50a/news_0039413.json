REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo The sale includes Rio’s 82 percent interest in the Hail Creek operating mine and its 71.2 percent interest in the Valeria project, the company said in a statement. “The sale of Hail Creek and Valeria delivers compelling value for our shareholders and continues our strategy of strengthening our portfolio,” Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in the statement. Rio Tinto made a strategic decision in 2017 to exit coal and focus on growth in iron ore, copper and its aluminum division. The deal, which follows the $2.7 billion sale of its Hunter Valley coal operations in Australia to Yancoal last year, is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018, the company said. The miner also said that a separate process was underway to sell its remaining Australian coal assets.
