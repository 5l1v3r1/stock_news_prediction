The fourth quarter increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the ramp up of the ENCORE-PH and ENCORE-LF clinical trials and new compound development. The full year increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the ramp up of the ENCORE-NF, ENCORE-PH and ENCORE-LF clinical trials and new compound development.\n expenses were $2.3 million for compared with $3.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. expenses were $9.7 million for the full year 2017 compared with $10.3 million for the full year 2016.
