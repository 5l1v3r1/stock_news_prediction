IntegenX products significantly enhance Thermo Fisher's existing HID portfolio and complement its leading human identification chemistries, as well as its qPCR and capillary electrophoresis systems.\nIntegenX solutions include the RapidHIT platforms, software analysis tools and related consumables that are highly compatible with Thermo Fisher's short tandem repeat (STR) chemistries for human identification. IntegenX currently provides support to prosecutors and law enforcement in 17 countries where its technology is used in government laboratories to generate forensic DNA profiles from samples in 90 minutes as opposed to the standard processing time of three weeks.\n\"The development of rapid DNA technology provides law enforcement with the ability to generate results while a suspect is still in custody,\" said Rosy Lee, vice president of human identification, Thermo Fisher Scientific. \"Such a dramatic reduction in time from sample to result has led to an increased demand from law enforcement agencies, and aligns with our strategy to expand our leadership position in the human identification market.\"\n\"As the leader in rapid DNA technology, we are thrilled to become part of the company that pioneered the development of the human identification market,\" stated Robert Schueren, president and chief executive officer of IntegenX. \"Combining our market leading technologies with Thermo Fisher's scale and depth of capabilities will benefit both our customers and our employees.\"\nAbout Thermo Fisher Scientific\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is the world leader in serving science, with revenues of $20 billion and approximately 70,000 employees globally.
