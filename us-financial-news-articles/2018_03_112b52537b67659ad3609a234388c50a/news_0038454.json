It feels little bit premature for the Fed to guide markets towards four hikes this year. It can do that in June if they wanted to, if the data between now and then improves.\nTwo-year note yields, which are highly sensitive to interest rate policy, jumped to 2.357 percent, the highest since September 2008. Benchmark 10-year note yields increased to 2.900 percent, the highest since March 12.\nA jump in consumer prices in January increased expectations for four rate hikes this year, though Februarys consumer price index last week showed prices cooled in that month.\nThe ballooning U.S. trade deficit as the government also plans to increase budget spending is also expected to weigh on growth. Data on Wednesday showed that deficit widened to $128.2 billion in the fourth quarter.\nThe recent trade data that we got show huge deficits, which is going to feed into first-quarter GDP, Rajappa said.\nInvestors are also focused on how international countries respond to U.S. plans to impose trade tariffs.\nYields briefly dipped earlier on Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal reported that China is planning countermeasures against U.S. trade tariffs.
