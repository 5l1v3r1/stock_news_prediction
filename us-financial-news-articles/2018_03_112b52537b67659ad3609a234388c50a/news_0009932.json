(NYSE:MET) today filed the company’s 2017 Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The financial statements contained in the 10-K reflect upward revisions to the company’s full-year 2017 net income as reported on February 13, 2018, with no impact on adjusted earnings.\nThe revision relates to a release of reinsurance reserves for Japanese variable annuities following an internal review of reserving practices for this block of business reported in the MetLife Holdings segment. This reserve release had no impact on payments to customers. The release increased full-year 2017 net income by $264 million and shareholders’ equity by $708 million. Management of the company has determined that the over-reserving represents a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.\nFor 2018, the reserve release is expected to free up capital and positively impact free cash flow.\nFurther disclosure can be found in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section and other portions of MetLife’s 2017 Form 10-K , which is posted on the MetLife Investor Relations website ( investor.metlife.com ).\nAbout MetLife\nMetLife, Inc.
