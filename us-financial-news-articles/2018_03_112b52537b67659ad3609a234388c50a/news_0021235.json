The only problem with the standards is that they are not being implemented well enough,” she said.\nThe academic welcomed commitments by the British and Dutch governments in the past week at separate meetings with agencies to set up independent bodies to scrutinize aid operations and ensure standards are adhered to.\nOmbudsperson-style offices should be established on the ground where aid is being delivered and employ local people, Hilhorst said.\nThe Netherlands plans to trial this approach in a pilot country to be selected in the next two months.\nSPEAKING OUT While the voices of aid recipients abused overseas are rarely heard in the corridors of power in donor countries, a small number of women who have witnessed or experienced sexual harassment closer to home have been trying hard to speak out.\nAlexia Pepper de Caires, who worked at Save the Children from 2011 to 2015, walked into a board meeting uninvited on Tuesday.\nShe demanded those in leadership positions, including international chairman Alan Parker, take responsibility for failing to protect staff from sexual misconduct at the charity’s UK arm.\n“Women have a right not to be sexually harassed, abused or assaulted by their colleagues,” said Pepper de Caires, now co-leader of the Women’s Equality Party Hackney branch in London.\n“They also have a right to be listened to by those in power at an organization,” she said in a statement after the protest.\nPepper de Caires, who has previously given testimony on the behavior of a former senior employee, was invited back to speak with board members. Meanwhile, Save the Children UK has commissioned an independent review of its workplace culture.\nPepper de Caires said there had been “a lot of fighting back and a lot of shutting down” among aid agencies in the face of the revelations about historic cases of sexual misconduct.\n“We’re not seeing much form of sector-wide acceptance to use this as a real transformational point,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe British government’s emphasis on compelling agencies to publish the number of sexual misconduct cases they have investigated will not be enough to stop bad behavior, she said.\nOther measures agreed at a “safeguarding summit” organized by Britain last Monday include new standards for vetting and referencing of staff, ensuring support for whistleblowers and abuse survivors, and changing organizational culture to tackle power imbalances.\nPepper de Caires helped organize an open letter published on Thursday, signed by more than 1,100 female aid workers in 81 countries, demanding that the aid sector is reformed and the patriarchal norms that dominate it are “rooted out”.\n“DUDE SPACE” Linda Raftree, a New York-based consultant who has worked in the aid sector for two decades, said women employees struggle to climb the ladder, partly because they often specialize in areas that are not a route to the top jobs, and may not want to go drinking or hang out in the “dude space”.\nIn developing-country offices of international agencies, local female staff put up with a lot because they are worried about losing prized jobs in places where women’s rights may garner little respect, she added.\nUp to now, the aid sector has not been perceived as having “institutional issues” with sexism and racism, which are “manifesting themselves at every level”, Raftree said.\nThat includes advertising to raise funds, which tends to feature images of starving, hopeless-looking children and mothers, she noted.\nReporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Astrid Zweynert.
