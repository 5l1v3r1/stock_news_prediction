After an upside earnings surprise from Lululemon fueled by e-commerce and an uptick in Kohl's thanks to its partnership with Amazon , Cramer argued that investors were ignoring the tech-related benefits of retail as they bought in.\n\"As I keep telling you, this is a challenging, controversial market and we're not used to it. It's not for everyone,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said, highlighting the irony of telling long-term investors to buy the struggling stock of Facebook .\n\"Stay the course. Maybe don't even watch the minute-to-minute action if you're too squeamish,\" he recommended. \"In a difficult market, formerly beloved stocks tend to become targets. And while I think the worries about Facebook and Amazon and Twitter and Nvidia are being blown out of proportion at this point, I also recognize that the stocks, of course, can go lower.\"\n\"If you can't take the pain, you know what? Forget about [those stocks] and go buy some Clorox,\" Cramer said.\nWATCH: Cramer's take on the Trump-Amazon debacle show chapters Cramer makes the case for consumer goods stocks amid tech-led declines 17 Hours Ago | 11:15 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Amazon, Facebook and Nvidia.\nProgramming Note: For more on Nvidia, watch CEO Jensen Huang's interview on \"Mad Money\" Thursday at 6 p.m. ET.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
