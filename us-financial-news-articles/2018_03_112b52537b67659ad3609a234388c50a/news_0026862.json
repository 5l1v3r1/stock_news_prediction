The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Staff/Remote Their shares all rose more than 1 percent, pushing Europe’s insurance index to lead sectoral gainers and helping the pan-European STOXX 600 index rise 0.3 percent by 0811 GMT. Top gainer on the STOXX was British valve maker Spirax-Sarco Engineering ( SPX.L ), up 3.3 percent after it reported better-than-expected full-year revenues and profit. However Dufry ( DUFN.S ) shares fell 6.5 percent after results with traders attributing the drop to a lack of clarity on its dividend plans, while lower-than-expected quarterly sales sent the world’s No. 2 fashion retailer H&M ( HMb.ST ) down 4.3 percent. Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) was a weak spot in a positive banking sector, down 2.5 percent, after the French bank announced the unexpected departure of its deputy chief executive Didier Valet.
