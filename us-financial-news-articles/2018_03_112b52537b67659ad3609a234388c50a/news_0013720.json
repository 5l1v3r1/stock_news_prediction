REUTERS/Lamine Chikhi OPEC member Algeria and a major gas supplier to Europe, has been hit hard by a slump in world oil prices and has struggled to attract energy investment to help develop new fields and increase existing production.\nIn December, Sonatrach said it planned to work more closely with France’s Total on offshore, petrochemical, solar energy and shale exploration projects after settling disputes over profit-sharing on oil and gas contracts.\nAlgeria remains dependent on oil and gas earnings, which provide 60 percent of the state budget, and Sonatrach’s performance is key to the health of the economy.\nThe country has been working on a new energy law to provide better incentives for foreign firms, which had been deterred by current terms.\nBut there are still divergent views within Algeria over how hard to push for foreign investment and domestic economic reform to boost revenue and spur growth.\nReporting by Lamine Chikhi; Writing by Ulf Laessing, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:26:14.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
