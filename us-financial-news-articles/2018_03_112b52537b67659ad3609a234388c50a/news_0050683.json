The Zlatan goodbye was more in that direction, he’s a huge player that European Football has lost. \n“But this period with LA Galaxy will be very good for him, he will be good for American football, because of what he can do; his personality, his passion and his professionalism.” FILE PHOTO - Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho leaves Quina Awards ceremony after he received Vasco da Gama award in Lisbon Portugal, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante \nIbrahimovic sustained a bad knee injury in United’s Europa League quarter-final against Belgian side Anderlecht last April but returned to make seven appearances for the Old Trafford side this season. \n“His recovery was an example of what a professional should be,” Mourinho added. “For him (the move to U.S.) will just be a way to enjoy the last couple of years of football.” \nUnited will be without back-up goalkeeper Sergio Romero for the weekend’s game, after the Argentine international picked up a knock in his country’s 6-1 friendly defeat by Spain. \nAshley Young was also injured on international duty with England but could play against Carlos Carvalhal’s 14th-placed side. \nUnited are second in the table on 65 points from 30 games as they bid to finish as runners-up to champions-elect Manchester City.
