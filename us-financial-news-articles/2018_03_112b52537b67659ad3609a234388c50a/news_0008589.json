REUTERS/Carlos Jasso The chapter on so-called sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which addresses food standards as well as animal and plant hygiene, was agreed by the three sides late on Sunday, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe agreement came just before ministers from the three nations are due to meet in Mexico City to take stock of progress in efforts to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nThe conclusion of the chapter on sanitary and phytosanitary measures is a rare indication of concrete progress at the sluggish talks, and follows agreement between the NAFTA partners on good regulatory practices earlier in the round.\nTensions at the seventh round of NAFTA negotiations were ramped up last week by U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s plans to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of NAFTA, which underpins more than $1 trillion worth of trilateral trade in the region, if it is not recast to his liking.\nReporting by Dave Graham; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:08:36.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
