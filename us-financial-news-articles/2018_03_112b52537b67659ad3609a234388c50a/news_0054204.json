In comparison, he said the analysis for the S&P 500's performance stretches back to 1954.\nBitcoin has struggled to recover above $8,000 in the last three days and is down more than 40 percent for the year so far, after multiplying more than 13 times in price in 2017, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index.\nInvestors who didn't hold onto bitcoin in the past would have suffered. Excluding its top 10 days of performance every year, bitcoin has fallen 25 percent annually from 2013 to 2017, Lee said.\n\"We think investors should be patient buyers of BTC here,\" he said.\nLee was chief equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase before co-founding Fundstrat in 2014. He issued his first formal report on bitcoin in July and remains the only major Wall Street strategist to do so. On Wednesday, Lee maintained his midyear bitcoin price target of $20,000 and $25,000 for the year-end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T20:24:27.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
