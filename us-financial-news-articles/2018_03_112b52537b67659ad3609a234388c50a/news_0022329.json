The data is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nStrong jobs data last month fueled speculation that higher wages could lead to faster interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and make borrowing expensive, rattling global equities market.\n“Usually, the financial markets would have only one thing to focus when the US-non farm payroll data comes out, but today, it is not that day,” Aslam added.\nThe unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.0 percent, which would be the lowest since December 2000 when the jobless rate was 3.9 percent. The data is also due at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evan and Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren were scheduled to speak at separate events.\nAmong premarket movers, discount retailer Big Lots slid 7 percent after posting a surprise drop in same-store sales and forecasting a weak profit for the current quarter and the full year.\nInsys Therapeutics were down 6 percent after reporting disappointing sales for its opioid cancer painkiller Subsys.
