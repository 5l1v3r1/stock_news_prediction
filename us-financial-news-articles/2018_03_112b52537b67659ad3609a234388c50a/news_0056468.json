Januaryâ€™s drop was the first since a 0.1 percent decline in August 2017.\nIn January, the central bank forecast first-quarter annualized growth of 2.5 percent, but it looks set to cut that estimate when it issues updated numbers on April 18.\nThe output of goods-producing industries fell by 0.4 percent in January from December as unscheduled maintenance shutdowns at some oil facilities helped cut non-conventional extraction by 7.1 percent.\nReal estate and rental and leasing declined by 0.5 percent in January, when tougher mortgage lending rules, designed to damp down hot housing markets, took effect.\nThe Bank of Canada - which is worried about housing and high levels of consumer debt - has raised interest rates three times since last July and says future hikes will be heavily dependent on economic data.\nReporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:05:38.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
