Autodesk’s shares have nearly doubled in value since 2016.\nAs part of its long-term plan, the company will seek fewer but higher-value subscriptions from businesses, Anagnost added.\n“The imperative for Autodesk is to maintain their subscription base as they raise maintenance prices, while keeping competitors (e.g. Dassault) from making inroads into their manufacturing (customer) base,” Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig said via email.\nAutodesk reported a net loss of $173.5 million compared with $173.4 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Autodesk lost 9 cents per share, smaller than the 11 cents analysts on average were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose 15.7 percent to $553.8 million, higher than analysts’ expectations of $544.7 million.\nReporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:31:25.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
