The Dow recovered slightly to end down 1.7 percent, or 420.22 points, at 24,608.98. The S&P 500 also declined 1.3 percent. The worst-performing sector was industrials.\nCashin estimates that approximately 30 to 35 percent of Thursday's sell-off is from aluminum stocks.\nAlso a concern, Cashin said, was the potential for trade wars and \"poisoning relationships in major trading partners.\"\nCurrently, the Trump Administration is in its seventh round of talks with Canada and Mexico over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The accord, which came into effect in 1994 under former President Bill Clinton, establishes a free trade zone among the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nThe tariffs would be 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, Trump said. The administration will apply the tariffs broadly, without targeting specific countries, and not impose quotas.\nThe industries likely to be hit the hardest would be construction and automobiles, Matthew Miller, a steel analyst of CFRA Research, said Thursday on \" Power Lunch .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T00:10:14.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
