The exchange is also seeking an unspecified amount of compensation for what it said was IEX’s unauthorized use of its intellectual property.\nNasdaq, founded in 1971, has grown to be one of the world’s largest exchange operators and suppliers of exchange technology. It accused IEX of violating seven of its patents related to four exchange processes, which it said represented millions of dollars in investment.\nIEX was founded in 2012 and launched its first trading platform, an alternative trading system, in 2013, touting its market as a fairer place for investors to trade than the existing exchanges.\nThe New York-based company launched as a full-fledged stock exchange in August 2016 after getting regulatory approval despite opposition from Nasdaq and some other exchanges to one of the main aspects of its exchange design, which involves slowing down stock orders, similar to a speed bump.\nIEX has said that its“speed-bump” helps prevent predatory trading practices. Other exchanges initially opposed the speed bump, but some later adopted or proposed versions of their own. NYSE’s speed-bump is nearly identical to IEX’s.\nIEX now plans to compete against Nasdaq and Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s ( ICE.N ) New York Stock Exchange for corporate listings.\n“Similar to our exchange application process, this is yet another attempt by Nasdaq to obstruct an innovative new competitor,” IEX spokesman Gerald Lam said of the lawsuit.\nThe seven patents Nasdaq has accused IEX of infringing are related to the closing auction processes for stocks listed on the exchange, so-called multi-parallel order processing, matching engine performance, and data feed optimizations.\nNasdaq said that in 2012 and 2013, IEX hired at least four technology employees from Nasdaq to help build IEX’s trading platform who would have been familiar with the intellectual property that is the focus of the lawsuit.\nNasdaq also said IEX has admitted in public filings that its closing auction process was“designed based on extensive review” of Nasdaq’s process.\n“These seven patents cover important innovations that we, and our customers, rely on for reliability, scalability, and transparency,” Nasdaq’s General Counsel Edward Knight said in a statement.\nThe lawsuit, Nasdaq v. IEX Group, Inc, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nReporting by John McCrank; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T00:18:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
