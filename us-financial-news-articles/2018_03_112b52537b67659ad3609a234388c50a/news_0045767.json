She said ‘Happy Easter Meghan’ and Meghan said ‘Happy Easter’ back”.\nBritain's Prince Harry, and his fiancee Meghan Markle, leave after a visit to the Titanic tourist attraction in Belfast, Northern Ireland March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Darren Staples A fellow Californian to Markle, Susan James, had just got off the train from Dublin when she saw the crowds.\n“Oh My, this is unreal,” she said “You don’t expect to take a holiday in Belfast and stumble on a member of the Royal family. Don’t they look great?”\nSlideshow (19 Images) Earlier the couple visited a peace building initiative, which Prince Harry launched last year to encourage young people across Northern Ireland to become ambassadors for peace within their communities.\nNorthern Ireland suffered through three decades of sectarian violence that was ended by a 1998 peace accord.\nAfter the walkabout, it was on to a science park to meet some of the province’s young innovators before wrapping up the trip with a visit to Titanic Belfast, one of the leading attractions in the city’s now thriving tourist sector.\nThe interactive center - built beside the slipway from where the iconic liner was launched - charts the history of the Titanic from the laying of its keel in 1909 to its sinking on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912.\nEditing by Padraic Halpin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T06:56:12.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
