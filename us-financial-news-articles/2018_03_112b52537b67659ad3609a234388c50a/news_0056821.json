We are almost there, in almost an ideal situation but it isn’t done,” he said. \n“The Premier League is tough, you can lose two or three in a row and you are in trouble. Goodison is always a tough ground, the Manchester derby is going to be very, very difficult and we know how well Tottenham play at Wembley. \n“We will celebrate when it is done but for now we prepare as we always have done,” he added. \n($1 = 0.7118 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T18:00:11.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
