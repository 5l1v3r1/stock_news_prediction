EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) before financing costs, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. A definition of EBITDA is provided on page 3 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nOperational and Strategic Highlights\nIn 2017, Capstone made a strategic shift to focus the business as a North American independent power producer. Notable achievements this year include: the sale of Capstone's 33.3% indirect interest in Värmevärden, changes to the management team and board of directors, the completion of a major refurbishment project at Whitecourt, the acquisition of the remaining interests in the Glen Dhu and Fitzpatrick Mountain wind facilities and achieving commercial operation at Settlers Landing, resulting in an overall increase in Capstone's net capacity to 541 MW.\nIn addition, Capstone achieved the following operational and financial highlights:\nRefinanced the CPC credit facilities, providing greater flexibility and lower costs to Capstone; Received funding under Alberta's Bioenergy Producer Program at Whitecourt; Signed a new Electricity Purchase Agreement for the Sechelt Creek Hydro facility with BC Hydro on March 1, 2018, subject to regulatory approval; and Executed a 20-year power purchase agreement (\"PPA\") with SaskPower for the 10 MW Riverhurst development project.\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal 2017 Financial Highlights\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue increased by $1.5 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2016. For the year, revenue decreased by $18.7 million, or 11%. The decrease for the year reflects higher net Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation (\"OEFC\") proceeds awarded for retroactive payments to Cardinal and the Ontario hydro facilities in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset in 2017 by higher revenue from the existing wind facilities and new wind facilities added since January 1, 2016, consisting of Ganaraska, Grey Highlands ZEP, Grey Highlands Clean, Snowy Ridge and Settlers Landing, and the government grant funding at Whitecourt.\nExpenses decreased by $2.4 million, or 15%, for the fourth quarter and by $39.0 million, or 42%, for the year. The decrease for the year was primarily due to lower operating expenses relating to Cardinal's fuel expenses for commitments relating to the OEFC settlement in the third quarter of 2016, and lower corporate staff costs and professional fees associated with iCON's 2016 acquisition. This was partially offset by higher operating expenses from the new wind facilities.\nEBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by $8.1 million, or 22%, but increased by $1.9 million, or 2%, for the year. The increase for the year reflects the factors noted above, as well as the increase in the fair value of the Whitecourt embedded derivative in 2017.\nNet income decreased by $19.5 million for the quarter, but increased $133.9 million for the year. The increase for the year primarily reflects a gain of $128.1 million from the sale of Värmevärden in the first quarter, partially offset by the 2016 contributions from Bristol Water, which Capstone sold in December 2016.\nFinancial Position\nAs at December 31, 2017, the Corporation had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $64.1 million, which along with Capstone's refinanced corporate credit facilities provides greater financial flexibility. In addition, Capstone has adequate financial flexibility to continue to evaluate refinancing options for the $38.7 million of project debt maturing in August 2018, for SkyGen and Skyway 8.\nDividend Declarations\nThe board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend on the Corporation’s Cumulative Five-Year Rate Reset Preferred Shares, Series A (the “Preferred Shares”) of $0.2044 per Preferred Share to be paid on or about April 30, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 13, 2018. The dividend on the Preferred Shares covers the period from January 31 to April 29, 2018.\nThe dividends paid by the Corporation on its Preferred Shares are designated “eligible” dividends for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada). An enhanced dividend tax credit applies to eligible dividends paid to Canadian residents.\nAbout Capstone Infrastructure Corporation\nCapstone's mission is to provide investors with an attractive total return from responsibly managed long-term investments in power generation in North America.
