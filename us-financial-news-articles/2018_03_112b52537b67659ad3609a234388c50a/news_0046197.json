Following a federal clerkship in Los Angeles, she started her law career at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom in San Francisco. She later served as General Counsel at both Knight Ridder Digital and Red Herring Communications, and later ran her own law firm. Ms. Hurabiell has led fundraising efforts for organizations such as Georgetown University, San Francisco Ballet, Wender Weis Foundation for Children, The Hamlin School, and the International Museum of Women.\nHurabiell fills the seat to be vacated by outgoing vice chair Janet Reilly, who was appointed to the Board by President Barack Obama in 2015. Reilly is active in the community, serving on multiple boards such as Clinic by the Bay, San Domenico School, and the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District. As a Presidio Trust board member, she contributed to milestone projects such as the opening of the new Presidio Visitor Center in February 2017.\n“We warmly welcome Marie to the board,” says Jean Fraser, Presidio Trust CEO. “She is deeply committed to the Presidio as an eighth-generation San Franciscan who has frequented the Presidio both while it was a military post and now as a national park. I also want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Janet Reilly, who was such a champion of ensuring that the Presidio is a national park welcoming to all.”\n“I am thrilled to join the board of the Presidio Trust,” notes Marie Hurabiell. “The transformation of the Presidio from a military post to a beautiful national park used by millions of people every year has been wonderful to experience. I have such happy memories here, so it is a true honor to help the Presidio Trust move forward with its goals of being a model of environmental stewardship and actively encouraging people of all backgrounds to visit this magnificent national park.”\nMs. Hurabiell has served on numerous boards of trustees, including the Georgetown University Board of Regents, where she engaged in crafting the successful Design Curriculum initiative; Holy Family Day Home (President); San Francisco Ballet Auxiliary (President); National Charity League Golden Gate Chapter (VP); and Hamilton Family Center. Hurabiell received her B.A. with Honors from Georgetown University and her J.D. with Honors from the University of Pennsylvania. She grew up enjoying the Presidio and continues to spend time in the Presidio daily - running and playing with her fiancée and two children.\nAbout the Presidio and the Presidio Trust: The Presidio Trust is a federal agency that manages the Presidio of San Francisco, a national park at the heart of the 82,000-acre Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
