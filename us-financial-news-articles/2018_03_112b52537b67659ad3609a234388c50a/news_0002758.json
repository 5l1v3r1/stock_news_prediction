REUTERS/Omar Sobhani As part of its new regional strategy announced last year, the United States has stepped up assistance to the Afghan military and greatly increased air strikes against the Taliban, in a bid to break the stalemate and force the insurgents to the negotiating table.\nHowever Taliban fighters control large parts of the country, the Kabul government itself is deeply divided and thousands of Afghan soldiers and civilians are being killed every year.\nForeign delegation members listen as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani delivers a speech during a peace and security cooperation conference in Kabul, Afghanistan February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Omar Sobhani The Taliban have themselves twice offered to talk to the United States in recent weeks, but have ruled out talks with the Kabul government, a key sticking point that must be resolved before any talks can start.\nWhile the international community sees Ghani’s administration as the sole legitimate government of Afghanistan, the Taliban see it as an artificial, foreign-imposed regime that does not represent the Afghan people.\nThe Taliban statement said the movement was “sincerely committed” to meeting international concerns over Afghanistan being used as a base for terrorist attacks and had no wish for conflict with the United States or other powers.\n“The crux of the matter is, what is the vital concern of America, is it really terrorism?” it said.\n“Or is it extracting the mineral wealth of Afghanistan, imposing a self-styled government, preventing establishment of an Islamic system and pursuing imperial ambitions in the region from this land?”\n“In such circumstances, we do not care about America, neither do we want to talk, nor end resistance, nor will we get tired,” it said.\nReporting by James Mackenzie; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T13:12:19.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
