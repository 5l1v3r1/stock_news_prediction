We are even more encouraged about the value afforded by etailz. There is continued growth opportunity in the existing model, as well as a number of additional channels of future potential. In the fye segment, efforts to change our merchandise point of view based on unique, relevant, collaborative and exclusive merchandise have shown promise but not yet consistency. We will continue to build upon this promise as part of the ongoing reinvention of the fye brand throughout 2018,” commented Mike Feurer, Chief Executive Officer.\nOn October 17, 2016, the Company acquired etailz, Inc., a leading digital marketplace retailer. Results for etailz are included in the consolidated results for all periods presented for Fiscal 2017. For periods presented for Fiscal 2016, results for etailz are included in the consolidated results from October 17, 2016 through January 28, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Overview - Consolidated\nTotal revenue for the Fourth Quarter decreased 1% to $145.4 million compared to $146.9 million for the Fourth Quarter of 2016.\nNet loss was $32.5 million, or a loss of $0.90 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.3 million, or $0.23 per diluted share for Fourth Quarter 2016. Included in the net loss this year is a non-cash charge of $29.1 million which is the result of recording impairment against certain long-lived assets in the fye segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was a loss of $0.3 million compared to income of $10.5 million for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2016 (see note a).\nCash and cash equivalents as of February 3, 2018 was $31.3 million, compared to $28.0 million at January 28, 2017.

Excluding the impact of etailz, inventory per square foot was $60 at the end of Fiscal 2017, versus $69 per square foot at the end of Fiscal 2016.\nMr. Feurer continued, “As we work through the assortment changes needed to stabilize the fye business, we have maintained focus on the balance sheet, ending the year in a favorable cash position to last year, with $31 million on hand and no debt. Inventory levels were also reduced as we focused on positioning the stores for the newer assortments in 2018, which negatively impacted gross margin in the fourth quarter.”\nFiscal 2017 Overview - Consolidated\nTotal revenue increased 25.4% to $442.9 million compared to $353.3 million in Fiscal 2016, driven by $174.5 million in revenue from etailz.

Notes:\na) Reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA:\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: (i) income tax expense (benefit); (ii) other income, including gain on sale of investments and gain from insurance proceeds; (iii) interest expense; (iv) depreciation expense; (v) gain on sale of asset; (vi) asset impairment charges; (vii) acquisition related transaction expenses; (viii) acquisition related intangibles amortization expenses and (ix) acquisition related compensation expenses including retention bonuses, restricted stock, and (x) a contingency adjustment. Our method of calculating adjusted EBITDA may differ from other issuers and accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our own operating performance and as an integral part of our planning process. We present adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure because we believe such measure is useful to investors as a reasonable indicator of operating performance. We believe this measure is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings (losses), net earnings (loss) from continuing operations or cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA appears below.\n(in thousands) Fourteen and Thirteen Weeks\nEnded (1) Fiscal Year Ended (2) February 3, January 28, February 3, January 28, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (32,460 ) $ 8,322 $ (42,553 ) $ 3,211 Income tax expense (benefit) 160 585 201 (6,773 ) Other income (58 ) (13 ) (8,881 ) (1,081 ) Interest expense 132 252 332 775 Operating income (loss) (32,226 ) 9,146 (50,901 ) (3,868 ) Depreciation expense 2,543 2,547 9,627 7,681 Gain on sale of asset - (1,164 ) - (1,164 ) Asset impairment charges 29,107 - 29,107 - Acquisition related transaction expenses - 97 - 2,325 Acquisition related intangibles amortization expenses 966 956 3,871 1,130 Acquisition related compensation expenses 1,117 732 4,262 1,035 Contingency adjustment (1,843 ) (1,829 ) (3,280 ) (1,829 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ (336 ) $ 10,485 $ (7,314 ) $ 5,310 (1) - The fourth fiscal quarter ended February 3, 2018 contains 14 weeks.
