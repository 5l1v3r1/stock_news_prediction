He plays Tim, a hapless drug dealer whom the girls blackmail into becoming a hitman.\nThe movie, first seen at the Sundance film festival, got an 89 percent approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.\nVariety called director and writer Finley “astonishingly gifted” while the Daily Beast said the film was “terribly funny, wild as a hell and aggressively grotesque.”\nReporting by Rollo Ross; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T06:01:42.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
