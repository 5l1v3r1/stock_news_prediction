SpaceX said it did not attempt to do that this time due to \"unfavorable weather conditions.\" \nChief Executive Musk said that the Hispasat satellite is the \"largest geostationary satellite we've ever flown.\" TWEET \nA geostationary satellite orbits around the earth. It takes one day for them to complete each orbit and are typically used for communications like satellite TV or satellite navigation systems. \nSpaceX said Hispasat's satellite will allow the Spanish company to expand its broadband offering in Europe and northwest Africa. \nMusk has been pushing SpaceX to do more regular launches this year and has also expanded its offerings, after it successfully launched the Falcon Heavy last month, the world's most powerful commercial rocket.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T09:14:39.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
