Under the NCIB, the Bank may repurchase shares through the facilities of the TSX and alternative Canadian trading systems or by such other means as may be permitted by a securities regulatory authority, including private agreements or share repurchase programs under exemption orders issued by securities regulatory authorities. All repurchased shares will be cancelled. The timing and amount of purchases under the NCIB are subject to regulatory approvals and to management discretion based on factors such as market conditions.\nUnder the Bank's ASPP, the Bank's broker may purchase Common Shares at times when the Bank ordinarily would not be active in the market due to insider trading rules and its own internal trading blackout periods. Purchases will be made by the Bank's broker based upon parameters set by the Bank prior to the commencement of any such blackout period and in accordance with the terms of the automatic purchase plan. The ASPP has been approved by the TSX.\nSOURCE BMO Financial Group", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T03:41:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
