(“Netsil”). Netsil provides application discovery and operations management that enables state-of-the-art observability in modern distributed cloud environments. The closing of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThis press release features multimedia.

Today’s businesses rely on applications that interact with thousands of services, yet IT administrators and DevOps teams struggle with the insight and control they need to map dependencies or monitor real-time application behavior. As popularity in microservices and containers grow, understanding all of the dependencies and the need for visibility become more critical. Netsil’s non-disruptive and easy-to-deploy solution monitors applications, services and their dependencies in real time.\nNetsil is the San Francisco-based maker of the Netsil Application Operations Center, which helps enterprises gain complete visibility into all their applications and services and their complex interdependencies with absolutely no code changes required. Netsil’s algorithm-based and non-invasive technology helps to achieve visibility and control at scale while keeping application transparency. As a result, development and operations teams are able to ensure uptime, software quality and safer deployments, and meet their service level objectives (SLOs). The addition of Netsil’s technology to the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS software will help customers secure applications as well as identify and fix performance issues.\nAccording to Gartner, “traditional infrastructure and operations (I&O) organizations are grappling with significant changes in how their IT environments are designed and operated. Consequently, their longtime monitoring approaches and tools are becoming increasingly inadequate to meet new requirements, which often reside outside their historical control or boundaries.” Additionally, Gartner states, “Modern IT architectures continue to present significant challenges for IT operations teams that remain organizationally and culturally in silos. These silo IT organizations have relied on legacy monitoring tools that mirror the specific teams who use them. Legacy tools were also designed to work on mostly static environments and monolithic application architectures... Demand is now shifting toward offerings that provide a more holistic approach to monitoring.”\n“Netsil’s innovative technology offers an original approach to simple yet comprehensive application discovery and operations management across multiple cloud environments and will be a powerful addition to Nutanix,” said Sunil Potti, Chief Product and Development Officer, Nutanix. “Netsil, which can be consumed as a cloud-based service, and when combined with Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS software, gives both DevOps and IT teams the power to quickly deploy and operate applications with confidence, in any cloud, at any scale, while ensuring reliability, performance and security.”\n“Joining Nutanix gives Netsil's technology a great opportunity to be a force multiplier,\" said Harjot Gill, Founder and CEO of Netsil. \"Nutanix has built a very solid Enterprise Cloud OS platform, which when combined with Netsil’s real-time observability, becomes even more strategic when addressing a growing microservices market. We are really happy to be joining a company where Netsil's capabilities will be used to their fullest.”\nNetsil customers can expect further communication from Nutanix following the closing of the acquisition.\nAdditional Resources\nExecutive Blog Video – About Netsil Website - About Netsil\nAbout Nutanix\nNutanix is a global leader in cloud software and hyperconverged infrastructure solutions, making infrastructure invisible so that IT can focus on the applications and services that power their business.
