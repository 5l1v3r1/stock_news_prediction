Blockchain Capital gets 25 pitches on a variety of coin offerings per day but only 1 percent gets serious consideration, he noted.\n\"You don't give two kids out of Stanford $200 million up front with no strings attached. That's going to end poorly.\"\nIn 2017, startups raised $6.3 billion from ICOs, up from roughly more than $100 million in 2016, according to data from cryptocurrency research firm Smith + Crown.\nIn the first two months of the year, 133 projects were successfully funded, down from 212 in November and December when bitcoin hit an all-time high just below $20,000, the data showed.\nFunds raised for January and February also slipped nearly 10 to $2.1 billion, compared with $2.3 billion raised in the last two months.\nDELAYS IN NEW OFFERINGS\nSome companies are delaying offerings because of tightening regulations.\nGrain Foundation has postponed its public token sale to later this month as the company seeks to fully comply with Swiss ICO rules, Chief Executive Onno Hektor said in a post on The Medium, an online publishing platform.\nGrain aims to allow companies to process work agreements on the blockchain with an instant payment mechanism.\nThe Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority has sharpened compliance rules for ICOs and published more guidelines that complement rules laid out in April 2017, according to its website.\nInvestors have welcomed regulators' involvement.\nSteven McClurg, chief investment officer at asset management firm Blockchain Momentum, said stricter enforcement would ultimately elevate digital assets and attract new investors who are awaiting regulatory guidance.\nLONG-TERM VIEW\nInvestors and market participants have said government regulation would pave the way for high-level projects to get funded, possibly from major financial and corporate companies.\n\"The bar is going to be raised,\" said Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman of U.S. blockchain technology company Bloq in New York. \"Quality is going to matter.\"\nMore high-quality ICOs should attract more institutional investors in the long run, analysts said.\n\"It's an upward roller-coaster,\" said Sean Walsh, founder of crypto-asset investment firm Redwood City Ventures in Denver, Colorado. \"The long-term trend is still upward, but it's a volatile transformation of the world.\"\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss Graphic by Richard Leong Editing by Megan Davies and Richard Chang)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T03:11:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
