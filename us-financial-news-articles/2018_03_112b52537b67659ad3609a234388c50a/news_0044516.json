REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Katarina Barley spoke after talks to which she summoned executives of the firm ( FB.O ) including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.\n“Facebook admitted abuses and excesses in the past and gave assurances that measures since taken mean they can’t happen again,” she said. “But promises aren’t enough. In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly.”\nThe firm has faced a global outcry over allegations that data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.\nFacebook’s shares fell more than 5 percent on Wall Street on Monday after the U.S. consumer protection regulator made public the fact it is investigating the firm over the Cambridge Analytica link.\nFacebook managers were not present for Barley’s news conference, held after a meeting she called “long, intensive and controversial.”\nShe said the firm told her around 1 percent of 300,000 users of a personality quiz whose results were later fed into Cambridge Analytica’s voter-targeting algorithms were in Europe.\nFILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo are seen in front of displayed binary digits in this illustration taken, March 18, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo It was still unclear how many of them were in Germany, or how many of the further 50 million users in their friendship circles whose data the consultancy used were in Germany or Europe, she said.\nFacebook had promised to try and contact all those affected.\nMemories of two 20th-century totalitarian surveillance states make privacy issues especially sensitive in Germany, where competition authorities have since last year been probing the social network’s use of data from partner websites.\n“We need well-equipped data protection authorities and confident users who know their rights,” Barley said. “The sovereignty of users must be strengthened.”\nFederal Cartel Office President Andreas Mundt told Tagesspiegel in comments released by the newspaper on Monday that users were largely unaware how much information flowed to the social network when they visited third-party websites with Facebook integration.\nThe office was working on the basis of possible abuses stemming from “the collection and assessment of data from third-party sources outside Facebook,” he said.\nFacebook declined to comment on Mundt’s remarks.\nReporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T20:31:15.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
