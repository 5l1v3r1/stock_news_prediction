Last year the government kept both the royalties and the retail prices of GM cotton seeds unchanged.\nIn 2017/18 India’s cotton output is set to rise 9.3 percent but won’t be the record high predicted by industry analysts because boll worm caused damage in some regions.\nNew Delhi approved the first GM cotton seed trait in 2003 and an upgraded variety in 2006, helping transform the country into the world’s top producer and second-largest exporter of the fibre.
