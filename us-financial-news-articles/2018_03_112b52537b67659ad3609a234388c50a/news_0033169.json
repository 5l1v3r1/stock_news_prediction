This proposed initiative represents the Company's continued actions and ongoing commitment to serve the long-term interests of all CTG shareholders.\nThe Board of Directors voted unanimously to submit a proposal to the Company's shareholders to declassify the Board by amending its Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws at its 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, scheduled to be held on July 26, 2018. CTG's Board is currently partitioned into three classes, with each director elected for a three-year term. If shareholders approve the proposal, all directors elected on or after the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders will be subject to annual elections. The full text of the proposal will be included in the Company's proxy statement, which will be filed in advance of its 2018 annual meeting of shareholders and will require the approval of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of CTG’s common stock.\n“The CTG Board believes that a robust corporate governance program is vital to creating long-term shareholder value,\" stated CTG’s Chairman of the Board, Daniel J. Sullivan. \"The recent initiatives to refresh our Board, modify our director and executive compensation program, and the proposal made today to declassify the Board reflect our commitment to strong corporate governance and alignment with the Company's shareholders.
