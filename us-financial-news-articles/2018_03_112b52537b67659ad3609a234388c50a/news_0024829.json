Creditors with $793 million in debt will own a second company with oil reserves in California, the Rocky Mountains and the U.S. Midwest and Southeast.\nThe reorganization plan was also opposed by Breitburn equity holders, who were at risk of paying a significant tax charge because of the company's structure as a master limited partnership, which treats canceled debt as taxable income.\nIn a move to prevent a tax charge, the creditors that will own the new company have agreed not to convert it into a corporation once it emerges from bankruptcy.\n\"This goes a long way to potentially resolving what could amount to a $525 million tax liability for Breitburn common unit holders,\" Vincent Indelicato of Proskauer Rose said on behalf of the equity holders.\nBreitburn said it would file a revised reorganization plan as soon as Monday and requested a confirmation hearing to be held later this month.
