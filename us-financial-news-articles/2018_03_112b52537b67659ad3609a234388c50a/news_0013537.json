In the real world, if a landlord knew their property was being used to plan or inspire terrorist attacks, you would expect them to show responsibility by informing the authorities.”\nThe British authorities have long accused tech firms of failing to do enough to tackle the problem of extremism on the internet, saying they had too often turned a blind eye to the actions of those using their services.\nThe country’s security minister has warned Britain might impose taxes on giants like Google and Facebook unless they did more to combat online extremism and interior minister Amber Rudd travelled to Silicon Valley last year to call for action after four deadly attacks in 2017 which killed 36 people.\n“... as a police service we have yet to receive a direct referral from them when they have identified such (terrorist) behaviour,” Rowley said.\nHe said it was not right that a person could be radicalised online by viewing illegal content, could communicate with an extremist using encrypted communications, could research potential targets and download bomb-making material.\nHe said future tools and technology should be designed “with corporate social responsibility in mind” so they could not be exploited by terrorists.\nWhilst he said the financial sector had taken steps to address terrorism funding, social media firms had not done enough.\n“Despite major progress in recent months, I am not as reassured by the level of proactivity and commitment of communication service providers about tackling the terrorist threat,” he said.\nJulian King, the European Union’s security commissioner, also told the conference that unless rapid progress were made on taking down extremist material, there was a “real risk of fragmentation” leading to 28 different forms of legislation being passed across the bloc.
