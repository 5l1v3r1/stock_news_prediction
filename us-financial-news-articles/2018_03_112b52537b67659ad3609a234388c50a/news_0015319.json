It appointed Marisa Drew, former co-head of its investment banking and capital markets business in Europe, to head the department.\nGreen bonds aim to have environmental or climate-related benefits that can increase the flow of funds to environmentally beneficial projects, which can in turn reduce the projects’ costs.\nIssuance of Green bonds is rising, and set to climb from a record US$119bn last year to about US$130bn this year, according to a forecast this week by Italian bank UniCredit.\nUniCredit estimated half of last year’s issuance came from Europe, while Asia accounted for 27%, led by deals from China, and North America made up 13%.
