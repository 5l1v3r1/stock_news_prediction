Across the Pacific, shareholders of Tencent, which owns China’s most popular social network WeChat TCEHY -3.23% with nearly a billion monthly active users, remains unfazed.\nThe risk of a public backlash like what’s happening to Facebook is very low in a surveillance state like China where private firms including Tencent help to censor content . But there are other worries for Tencent’s investors detailed in its quarterly results out Wednesday.\nFor one, Tencent’s gaming business, which remains the firm’s major profit driver , seems to be slowing. Revenue last quarter from both mobile and PC games declined from a quarter ago. Its smartphone game business is coming off a very high base due to its smash hit “Honor of Kings,” which had as many as 50 million of users playing it every day. To continue its growth rate requires churning out similarly popular titles on a consistent basis .\nTencent’s advertising and mobile payments business are growing nicely , though they are not as profitable as games. And while its operating income last quarter rose 85% from a year ago, around a third of that, or 7.9 billion yuan ($1.3 billion), came from disposals. Tencent-backed companies including online auto lender Yixin and search engine Sogou had successful initial public offerings last quarter. Excluding such profits, operating profit actually came in lower than consensus estimates on S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nAfter Tencent’s shares have doubled over the past year, they trade for 43 times this year’s expected earnings, well above its five-year average of 33, and now nearly double Facebook’s. The trouble with Tencent, then, is that investors are simply expecting near perfection.\nWrite to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://djcs-olympics.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-data-charts/custom-data-chart-wsj-0.8.31.min.js"], "published": "2018-03-21T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T19:33:19.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
