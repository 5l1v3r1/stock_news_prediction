Cricket - Test Match - New Zealand v England - Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand, March 23, 2018. New Zealand's Henry Nicholls hits a shot during the second day of the first cricket test match. REUTERS/David Gray Henry Nicholls took advantage of a brief dry spell to reach his sixth test half century before rain forced the players from the field after about 10 minutes of play in the first session with New Zealand on 233 for four. Nicholls, who had resumed on 49, clipped a Jimmy Anderson delivery off his hip for two runs to bring up the mark. He then almost ran out batting partner BJ Watling while taking a quick single. The wicketkeeper, however, was fortunate that the throw from Chris Woakes was wide. Watling was on 18 and Nicholls 52 when rain, which had washed out almost the entire second day, forced the players off again.

Play was eventually abandoned at about 6:45 p.m. (0545 GMT). Slideshow (3 Images) The hosts had bowled England out for 58 on the first day.
