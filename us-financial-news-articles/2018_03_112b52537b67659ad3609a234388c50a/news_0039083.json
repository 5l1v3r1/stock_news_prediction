Those nor'easters left nine dead and more than 2 million homes and businesses without power.\nNew York state Governor Andrew Cuomo declared local emergencies for New York City, where several inches of snow had fallen by Wednesday afternoon, and some other parts of the state.\n\"The roads are very icy and the roads are dangerous and there is no reason to be on the roads unless it's an emergency,\" Cuomo told a news conference. \"The storm will get worse before it gets better.\"\nThe snowfall in the Northeast is not expected to wane until Thursday, Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Frank Pereira said in a phone interview.\nIn New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy on Tuesday declared a state of emergency, as crews cleared roadways. Transit bus service was ordered suspended statewide starting Wednesday afternoon.\nThroughout the East Coast, many other buses and trains, including some Greyhound bus and Amtrak rail routes, that millions of people rely on to commute to and from work and school also canceled service on Wednesday.\nWith many commuters staying home, New York City's normally bustling Times Square was sedate.\n\"We're not going to let the snow get in the way of our snow day,\" said Cheryl Mandelbaum, 30, an elementary school teacher who was taking pictures with a friend, another teacher who had the day off because the city had canceled school.\nSeveral inches of snowfall in Washington and its suburbs forced the closure of federal government offices, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\nWashington schools were also closed, and children in Philadelphia, parts of New Jersey and Pittsburgh also enjoyed a snow day. In Boston, students were told to trudge to school.\nThe storm dumped about a foot (30 cm) of snow on parts of Maryland and Pennsylvania, according to the National Weather Service, while further inland snow also blanketed parts of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky.\nAirlines scrapped more than 4,412 flights into and out of the United States, according to flight tracking website FlightAware, and more than 2,000 other flights were delayed.\nThe nor'easter caused some power outages, but the region escaped the widespread blackouts of past snowstorms. About 12,000 homes and businesses lost power in Maryland, and thousands of others lost power in Virginia, West Virginia and New Jersey.\nAcross the country in Southern California, residents of Santa Barbara County braced for potential mudslides as rains hit the region.
