After years of development beginning with the founders' research in Stanford GSB, mCart technologies expects to be the leader in streamlining the process of closing the gap between online and offline shopping, sales and advertising for retailers, influencers, and consumers. mCarts can turn any type of content, from an Instagram post to movies and real world events and places shoppable. Through mCart, the retail marketer will be able to set budgets, reward to value ratio, dictate which influencers can participate and allocate the necessary funds leveraging blockchain and mCart cryptocurrency. The influencer will then have the ability to decide which offers on the blockchain they want to promote. When a shopper engages with an mCart offer, that shopper will be rewarded by mCart token for verification of the purchase. mCart will disrupt the traditional affiliate networks models, removing the middlemen and back office bottleneck of settling micro payments to influencers and loyal shoppers.\nMavatar long-term investors, management and advisory team include well-known names such as the former CPO of Facebook, former CEOs of Macy's and YSL/Apple EVP, former California Controller and ebay VP of marketing, Stanford professor, Oracle Blockchain VP, Edelman Managing Director and EVP, Zoosk founder & CEO, Polymath CEO & Ethereum investor, CEO of eaccess, former Rakuten CRO, ABC Head of strategy, among others.\nThe mCart token is scheduled to be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain in May 2018 as an ERC-20 token with a fixed supply of 100 million tokens.

Of the 100 million total token supply up to 40% will be made available during the presale and an anticipated public ICO.\nThe ICO will occur in up to three phases, The first phase of the mCart Protocol ICO presale took place in December and included investments from CollinStar Capital PTY Ltd., Candou Angel Network LLC., Blockchain Ventures as well as other professional investors and entrepreneurs specializing in digital assets, cryptocurrency and Blockchain enabled infrastructure. The first phase raised 2200 ETH and paused after two weeks for the company to develop an in-house comprehensive solution for token pre-sales and post-ICO management, to ensure the maximum security. The second phase is now commencing and involves a presale of the right to acquire mCart tokens. The third phase, if conducted, would involve a public crowdsale of mCart tokens, and would be expected to take place commencing in the second quarter of 2018.\n\"CollinStar is one of the pioneer funds that have realized the growth potential of the blockchain industry, which we believe is set to disrupt and effects the world around us maybe even more than the Internet did decades ago.
