The acquisition is expected to accelerate the development and integration of machine learning and AI-based applications for the Sparq® 3 customer intelligence platform. Vision Critical announced a set of AI-powered applications for Sparq 3, called CRIS (Customer Relationship Intelligence Science), late last year.\n“Adding artificial intelligence and machine learning applications to Sparq 3 enables companies to surface previously hidden insight and to create better end-to-end customer experiences based on the data they’re gathering,” said Divesh Sisodraker, President, Chief Product Officer for Vision Critical. “We’re delighted to welcome the Aida team to Vision Critical to help us accelerate the integration of CRIS applications into Sparq 3 and get them into the hands of our customers.”\nAs part of the acquisition, the entire Aida data science team joins Vision Critical, including Jenny Yang, a serial entrepreneur with a successful exit in her prior machine learning startup. Ms. Yang began her career as an engineer at Telus and Nortel, then held consulting positions at The Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Co. before joining BDC Venture Capital, where she led and managed BDC’s investments in early stage tech companies. Before founding Aida, she co-founded and served as CEO of Metafor Software, which was acquired by Splunk in 2015. Ms. Yang will lead data science initiatives at Vision Critical.\n“The Vision Critical Sparq 3 platform offers a lot of exciting possibilities for using AI to improve the customer experience – a mission that we shared at Aida,” said Ms. Yang. “We’re excited to join forces with Vision Critical and its impressive enterprise customer base to deliver highly differentiated AI solutions.”\nAbout Vision Critical\nVision Critical provides customer relationship intelligence software that improves customer relationships to grow customer lifetime value.
