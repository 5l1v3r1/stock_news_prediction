(“Brookmount”), a Nevada incorporated company (OTC:BMXI) announced that The Company has reported solid progress in its gold production operations in Indonesia with production for the 6 (six) months to December 31, 2017 exceeding 1,600 oz, generating revenue for the period of approximately $2 million. Operating profit for the period was in excess of $800,000.
