This suggested demand remained resilient even as trade relations with the U.S. deteriorated.\n“It’s a sign that the global economy is growing pretty healthily and demand for Chinese products is strong,” said Hammarlund. But he added that the huge surplus, which widened to $33.7 billion, could fuel speculation about U.S. President Donald Trump getting tougher on China: “It’s a double-edged sword.”\nTrump has demanded that Beijing lay out plans for reducing its trade surplus with the United States. China said it would respond “as necessary” in the event of a trade war with the U.S.\nChinese mainland shares rose one percent and Hong Kong stocks gained 1.5 percent. Index heavyweight South Korea, which is one of the more exposed markets to U.S. steel tariffs, rose 1.3 percent.\nBut the Hong Kong dollar eased to its weakest versus the U.S. dollar since the peg was introduced in 1983, hampered by abundant liquidity in interbank markets.\nTurkish assets came under some selling pressure in the wake of a downgrade by Moody’s, which cut Turkey’s sovereign credit rating deeper into junk territory overnight. Moody’s cited a continued loss of institutional strength and increased risks from the wide current account deficit.\nOn Wednesday Turkey’s central bank kept interest rates steady, and said it would keep policy tight faced with double-digit inflation of 10.26 percent.\nTim Ash, a strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, said the central bank had a credibility issue for the market and the ratings agencies. “I guess we have to assume that both S&P and Fitch likely will follow Moody’s lower now,” he said in a note.\nThe lira slipped 0.4 percent and the average yield spread of Turkish sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified widened by five basis points (bps) to 303 bps, a one-week high.\nThe 10-year benchmark local government bond yield also rose to 12.28 percent from a close of 12.20.\nThe South African rand fell 0.9 percent, although this has to be seen in the context of a strong rally since early December.\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa told ratings agency Moody’s on Wednesday that a drive to expropriate land without compensation would be done in a way that would not harm the economy or food security. Moody’s will announce its outlook on South Africa on March 23.\nLand reform is high on investors’ radar screens, muting some of the euphoria over Ramaphosa. John Ashbourne, Africa economist at Capital Economics, said the fears were overblown and a “mushy compromise” was more likely than a Zimbabwe-style land grab.\nThe Polish zloty touched a three-month low against the euro after tumbling on Wednesday when the central bank governor said Poland’s first rate increase might come a year later than he’d initially expected, as the bank lowered its inflation forecast.\nHungary’s inflation slowed to 1.9 percent year-on-year in February, underscoring that central banks in the region could keep rates lower for longer.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1196.46 +7.26 +0.61 +3.28\nCzech Rep 1117.54 +4.56 +0.41 +3.65\nPoland 2338.91 -20.66 -0.88 -4.97\nHungary 38448.34 +262.14 +0.69 -2.36\nRomania 8460.39 +17.23 +0.20 +9.11\nGreece 801.78 +3.37 +0.42 -0.07\nRussia 1270.17 -11.26 -0.88 +10.03\nSouth Africa 52404.09 +399.00 +0.77 -0.25\nTurkey 17130.60 +288.16 +0.25 +1.56\nChina 3289.29 +17.63 +0.54 -0.54\nIndia 33436.76 +403.67 +1.22 -1.82\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.42 25.42 +0.00 +0.44\nPoland 4.20 4.20 +0.10 -0.60\nHungary 311.60 311.96 +0.12 -0.34\nRomania 4.66 4.62 -0.80 +0.46\nSerbia 117.84 117.88 +0.03 +0.48\nRussia 56.99 56.83 -0.27 +1.18\nKazakhstan 320.86 320.86 +0.00 +3.72\nUkraine 26.10 26.10 +0.00 +7.84\nSouth Africa 11.93 11.83 -0.84 +3.59\nKenya 101.10 101.20 +0.10 +1.98\nIsrael 3.46 3.46 -0.05 +0.60\nTurkey 3.82 3.80 -0.35 -0.68\nChina 6.34 6.32 -0.20 +2.70\nIndia 65.05 64.87 -0.28 -1.88\nBrazil 3.24 3.24 +0.02 +2.09\nMexico 18.74 18.71 -0.13 +4.87\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 313 1 .01 7 89.50 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench, Editing by William Maclean\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:08:29.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
