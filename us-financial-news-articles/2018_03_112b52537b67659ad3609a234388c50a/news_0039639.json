The Company confirms that copies of these annual filings can be obtained at www.rubiconminerals.com or www.sedar.com .\nHighlights from the Fourth Quarter 2017 Results and Subsequent Events to December 31, 2017:\nCash position: As of March 22, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately C$27.4 million.\nExploration and evaluation expenditures: For the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company spent approximately C$4.9 million in expenditures related to underground development, drilling, maintenance and technical consulting fees. Expenditures increased by C$1.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 and is primarily driven by the commencement of underground development activities. The Company anticipates exploration and evaluation expenditures to increase over the coming months due to drilling, test mining, bulk sampling and processing activities at the Phoenix Gold Project (the \" Project \"), as outlined in the 2018 Exploration Program.\nGeneral and administrative expenses (including salaries and benefits, and consulting and professional fees): For the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company spent approximately C$1.6 million on expenditures related to general and administrative, salaries and benefits, and consulting and professional fees. Expenditures increased slightly by C$0.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 and is primarily attributed to an increase in corporate activity to support the Project.\nC$10.9 million private placement flow-through financing: On February 26, 2018, Rubicon completed a private placement flow-through financing for aggregate gross proceeds of C$10.9 million to the Company. The proceeds from this financing will be used for Canadian Exploration Expenses. The Company intends to expand its 2018 Exploration Program and will provide further details when finalized.\nApproximately 10,000 tonnes of mineralized material stockpiled on surface: The Company is advancing its underground development and test mining activities at the Project. The site team is currently blasting the #977 test stope, production drilling the #015 test stope, and developing the #161 test stope. In terms of material stockpiled on surface, Rubicon currently has approximately 3,000 tonnes of low-grade material that will be used for mill bedding and roughly 7,000 tonnes of mineralized material from the #977 test stope. The Company anticipates processing the mineralized material from the test stopes in mid-2018.\nUpdated preliminary interpretation of the structural geology of the F2 Gold Deposit (\"Preliminary Structural Interpretation\"): On March 12, 2018, Rubicon and its consultants developed a Preliminary Structural Interpretation. Some of the key takeaways from the Preliminary Structural Interpretation were, 1) the primary structural controls on the gold mineralization at the F2 Gold Deposit are the well-established Riedel vein system of quartz-actinolite veins, 2) the Preliminary Structural Interpretation shows more continuity of gold mineralization within the HiTi Basalt Units compared to the 2016 structural interpretation, and 3) the Preliminary Structural Interpretation has simplified and improved future modelling which in turn allows for the evaluation of bulk mining methods. Please see the Rubicon news release dated March 12, 2018 for further details.\nPlease refer to our Consolidated Financial Statements and MD&A for the year-ended December 31, 2017 for further details.\nAbout Rubicon Minerals Corporation\nRubicon Minerals Corporation is an advanced gold exploration company that owns the Phoenix Gold Project, located in the prolific Red Lake gold district in northwestern Ontario, Canada.
