An unspecified number of supporters have also been banned for life for “violently throwing coins or objects with intent to injure or harm on the bridge directly in front of the Directors’ Box”, the club added. West Ham said the investigation into the incidents remained ongoing and that the club expected to issue further bans before their next home game against Southampton on March 31. The club are two points above the relegation zone in 17th place in the table.
