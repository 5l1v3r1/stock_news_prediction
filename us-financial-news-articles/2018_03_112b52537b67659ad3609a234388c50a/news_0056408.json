Buses have passed slowly through pro-government towns, with signs of President Bashar al-Assad’s victory over the rebels on full display. \nRegime loyalists have thrown stones at them, breaking bus windows. Some traveled nearly a day without food.\nThese evacuations are the result of deals reached with the government earlier this month, but officials have made the passage difficult.\n“The whole way the regime was terrorizing the buses,” said Anas al-Khole, who left the besieged rebel enclave of Eastern Ghouta on Wednesday night for the northwestern Idlib province. “They tried to make the trip as long as possible.”\nThe drivers were under orders to restrict passengers from getting off at any point on the nearly nine-hour journey, Mr. Khole said. “Some children had to relieve themselves on the bus.”\nSyrian and Russian soldiers inspect the belongings of rebels and their families who being evacuating from Eastern Ghouta.

More than 128,000 people have left Ghouta, according to Syrian state media.\nForces loyal to Mr. Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, have carried out a ground and air assault since February that has killed nearly 2,000 people, according to local figures. The offensive was launched after a five-year siege that caused widespread malnutrition and dozens of deaths from lack of medical care.\nA man looking at his family for the last time after they were approved to leave Eastern Ghouta.

Mr. Assad has vowed to retake every inch of Syria.\nThe United Nations says that about 80,000 people have evacuated Ghouta to the shelters around Damascus but it isn’t tracking how many are choosing to go to northern Syrian areas still under rebel control, such as Idlib.\nRelated \nPressure on Civilians in Syria’s Eastern Ghouta Increases as Assault Intensifies (March 16) In Syria, Foreign Powers’ Scramble for Influence Intensifies (Feb. 28) Analysis: As Alliances Shift, Syria’s Tangle of Wars Grows More Dangerous (Feb. 18) The U.N. has played an observer role in some previous evacuation deals “and provide some kind of protection by presence” but wasn’t asked to do so in Ghouta, said Linda Tom, spokeswoman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Damascus.\nThe evacuations from Ghouta have been characterized by uncertainty and chaos—days of waiting followed by scrambles to board.\n“Families left Eastern Ghouta quickly and did not know where they would go,” the International Committee of the Red Cross reported this week. “In such a chaotic situation, many family members were separated, including children from their parents.”\nPhotos taken in towns and villages waiting to be emptied and posted by activists online showed long lines of dusty and bedraggled people carrying children and dragging suitcases and potatoes sacks packed with clothes and other possessions.\n“We waited in line for the buses for about eight hours until we were able to board,” said Dr. Nizar Madani, a surgeon who left Ghouta this week for Idlib. “And then it took another 24 hours until we arrived. It was exhausting.”\nSome displaced residents and activists live-streamed parts of the journey north through lush fields and towns that appeared largely unscathed from the war.\nIn the Ghouta town of Arbeen, Dr. Bassam Bakri had been waiting for days with his wife and children for seats on the departing buses.\nDr. Bakri was in touch with those who have made it safely to Idlib, hearing stories of the difficult journey ahead of them. But he is focused on having to rebuild a new life, away from the destruction wrought upon his home.\n“I’m just tired,” he said. “My wife, my mother and my daughters also need some rest like me.”\nWrite to Raja Abdulrahim at raja.abdulrahim@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T22:30:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
