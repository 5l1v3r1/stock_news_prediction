One idea is to suggest a deadline of 60 days from the date of the interview, the person said. \nAnother consideration for the legal team is reaching an agreement with Mueller on the scope of his questioning of the president, which they expect to focus largely on his decision to fire former national security adviser Mike Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, according to people familiar with the matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T22:51:36.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
