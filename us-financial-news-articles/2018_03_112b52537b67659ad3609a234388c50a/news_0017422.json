She “raised our deep concern.... noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties’ interests,” her spokesman said.\nThat intensified a trans-Atlantic war of words over the weekend, with Mr. Trump tweeting a threat to slap new taxes on European cars in response to a European threat to block U.S. exports of motorcycles, denim and bourbon.\nRelated \nOfficials Beat Back Warnings on Tariffs The Outlook: Steel Tariffs Put Wrench in Infrastructure Plan Steel Town Welcomes President’s Plan Stock Rally’s Inevitability Fades U.S. lawmakers from both parties issued their own warnings about the danger of fighting others, rather than Beijing.\n“The Chinese send very little steel to the United States, so we’re not punishing the Chinese, we’re hurting mostly our allies,” New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell told reporters Sunday. “China wins when we fight with Europe,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said on CBS. “We’re losing with this tariff regime.”\nTrump aides respond that, while Chinese overcapacity may be the source of the industry’s woes, their immediate priority is protecting U.S. manufacturers against all foreign competition, whether those producers are culprits or fellow victims of the glut.\n“It doesn’t matter who is sending us this product, the fact is if we keep receiving it the way we are, we’re not going to have an aluminum industry, we’re not going to have the steel industry,” Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, told Fox News on Sunday.\nThe global steel and aluminum industries have been among the sectors hit hardest by sharp growth in Chinese exports since Beijing joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.\nIn 2016, China accounted for 49% of global steelmaking capacity, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, up from 15% in 2000. Chinese aluminum smelter capacity similarly exploded, jumping from 5.4 million tons in 2002 to 41 million tons at the end of 2016, according to country’s National Bureau of Statistics.\nWashington responded by repeatedly slapping steep duties on Chinese products, curbing their share of the American market. In 2017, China was the 11th-largest steel exporter to the U.S., supplying just 2% of imports, according to a Commerce Department study used to shape the new tariff policy. Steel imports from China to the U.S. dropped nearly 6% last year, but steel imports overall rose 12%, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute and the U.S. Census Bureau. China was the second-largest foreign aluminum seller to the U.S., shipping 11% of imports—but well behind No. 1 Canada, the source of 41% of imports, according to Commerce.\nIndustry executives and Trump officials say those numbers don’t capture the full picture, arguing that Chinese producers “transship” their product through other countries, who then sell to the U.S.—hence the need for the broad global tariffs to ensure full protection against the impact of Chinese overcapacity. At the same time that Chinese exports to the U.S. fell, exports from Turkey, Vietnam and South Korea soared. China exported 31% less steel in 2017 than in 2016, reflecting stronger domestic demand for steel.\n“We have steel coming into our country from countries that don’t even know what steel is,” President Trump told lawmakers at a recent White House meeting.\nBut Mr. Trump’s attempt to save U.S. producers from the Chinese glut risks aggravating the problem for European Union, steelmakers there fear. The bloc already has 53 measures in place on steel and iron products, 27 of which target China, and said Friday that it would monitor markets “very closely” to determine whether additional safeguards are needed. If non-Chinese producers dump their steel in Europe, that could also fuel trade tensions between the EU and significant trading partners like South Korea, Turkey and Brazil.\n“Diverted trade flows threaten Europe with a new steel glut when as things are the EU market is far from tackling (its own) import crisis,” said Hans Jürgen Kerkhoff, president of the German Steel Federation. “If the EU doesn’t act, our steel industry is going to be left footing the bill for American protectionism.”\nSince Mr. Trump’s 2016 election, the Europeans have been trying to discourage the U.S. from moving unilaterally on steel, arguing that Washington should instead join its allies by pressuring China to curb production.\nTo that end, the EU was one of the primary drivers in establishing the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, a group formed during a December 2016 gathering of the Group of 20 major economies and some members of the OECD.\nBut the Trump administration has been lukewarm toward the effort. When the global steel forum met in Berlin this past November, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer sent his chief of staff to the minister-level gathering, a move seen as a diplomatic snub.\nAt the end of the meeting, the EU hailed a global agreement to tackle global overcapacity with “concrete policy solutions.” The U.S. takeaway was the exact opposite: “Much work remains,” Mr. Lighthizer’s office said, adding that while cooperating with international partners Washington wouldn’t shy away from unilateral action.\nThe steel forum is slated to meet again this week in Paris, but the discussion is now likely to focus as much on U.S. actions as China’s.\n—Zeke Turner, Lingling Wei and Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.\nWrite to Jacob M.
