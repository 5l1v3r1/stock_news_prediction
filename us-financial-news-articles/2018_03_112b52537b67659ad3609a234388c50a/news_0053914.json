Gordon looks to the SPY's previous low back in mid-February at around $252.\n\"I'm looking at around the $252 region, that was the low from mid-February here,\" he said. \"So we're looking for a rejection on down towards these old lows.\"\nAs a result, Gordon wants to buy the May monthly 262-strike puts and pair that with the sale of the 255-strike puts for a total cost of $1.74, or $174 per options spread. Should SPY close above $262 on May 18 expiration, Gordon would lose the $174 he paid to make the trade.\nBut if SPY closed below $255 on expiration, Gordon could make up to $525 on the trade.\nIn order to prevent losing that premium, however, Gordon also establishes a point at which to exit. He refers back to the old resistance levels he believes are in the charts for SPY.\n\"If the market were to move back above this resistance level just at around $269.40, let's go ahead and close the trade,\" he said.\nSPY has fallen more than 3 percent in the last week.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
