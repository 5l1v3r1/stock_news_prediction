U.S. President Donald Trump waves upon his arrival in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque “Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting!

North and South Korea will also hold their first summit in more than a decade next month at the border village of Panmunjom, the head of a delegation from South Korea told a media briefing. The delegation met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a visit to the North. Trump earlier tweeted: “We will see what happens!” Reporting by Eric Walsh and Susan Heavey; Editing by Will Dunham", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T18:36:05.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
