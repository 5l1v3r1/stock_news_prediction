LVMH \nFrance's LVMH has a portfolio featuring 70 of the world's most-celebrated luxury brands, including Givenchy, TAG Heuer, Louis Vuitton, Glenmorangie and Marc Jacobs. With a retail network of over 4,370 stores worldwide, the conglomerate's offering spans from perfume and jewelry, to alcoholic spirits and high-end designer outfits. \nWith a global headcount of 134,000 employees, the company seeks to recruit and develop \"the most talented individuals,\" with the company stating that the diversity of its ecosystem \"offers each person unparalleled career opportunities.\" David Mareuil | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images 2. L'Oreal \nThis beauty powerhouse showcases over 30 brands across 140 countries, including Lancôme, Garnier and Maybelline New York. So for such a wide portfolio, it's no surprise L'Oreal has an overall total of 82,600-plus employees. \nWhen it comes to company perks, L'Oreal offers childcare assistance, places to elevate wellbeing such as meditation rooms , salons and gyms — and even opportunities to fly home with your partner once a year, if you work outside your home country.

From what began in the early 1900s, Chanel now has stores and offices across several continents, including South America and the Middle East. \nWhen it comes to employment, the luxury group encourages \"a multi-experience journey,\" where workers are offered the chance to work in various environments with different teams. By doing this, Chanel hopes this offers employees a better understanding of the brand and their own motivations to work for them. Feng Li | Getty Images News | Getty Images 4. Richemont \nLike LVMH, Switzerland's Richemont is home to a plethora of luxury brands including Cartier, Montblanc, and Chloe; with these luxury houses selling across various markets. Richemont describes its employees as \"one of a kind\": those who are inspired to take initiative and embrace the art of thinking and acting like entrepreneurs . \nAs a group, Richemont is committed to being successful, but to do this, it believes in \"intellectual challenges, work-life balance, personal development and diverse career opportunities.\" In fact, according to the group, over half of its jobs are filled through internal promotions, highlighting a commitment to retention.

The bank has also set up the BNP Paribas Foundation, which looks to promote and support cultural, environmental and social projects. ERIC PIERMONT | AFP | Getty Images 8.
