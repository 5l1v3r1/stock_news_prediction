With our technology, we're able to take over and further improve upon the customer experience.\"\nBel Air Internet, which was named one of the San Fernando Valley Business Journal's Fastest Growing Companies for the past two years, has created a name for itself as a high-quality provider for both residential properties (luxury developments Ten Thousand and The Century are among clients), as well as commercial businesses, including several studios and high-profile media companies. The acquisition allows them to further expand upon their commercial clientele, while sharpening their service footprint.\n\"The acquisition of Polaris provides even more flexibility to the Bel Air Internet footprint, adding new redundant paths to our existing network,\" says Bel Air Internet CTO Diego Salas. \"With additional points of distribution, we will be able to service new areas with even higher bandwidth capacity.\"\nIt is just the first step for Bel Air Internet, according to Koosed, as they eye several other acquisition targets to continue their rapid expansion throughout the Southern California area. \"There are no shortage of customers seeking quality, reliable bandwidth,\" Koosed says. \"That fuels our business model as we continue to grow in Los Angeles and beyond.\"\nAbout Bel Air Internet:\nBel Air Internet is a fully integrated communication provider offering high-speed Internet access, DIRECTV & voice service to over 50,000 daily customers.
