The All-share index was down 0.2 percent to 56,050 points. The Top 40 index fell 0.3 percent to 49,417 points.\n“Our shares are trading at big discounts and might become a target for foreign investors,” said Greg Davis, equities trader at Cratos Wealth.\n“We are surprised that the market is not a lot stronger after the positive news from Moody’s and a good chance of a rate cut tomorrow.”\nIn fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was down 2.5 basis points to 7.890 percent.
