I was aggressive when I needed to be. I rolled a couple putts in that resulted in seven-under,” Korda said of her third round.\n“I’m very happy with how it ended but I still have 18 more holes to go. There’s still a bunch of great girls, great golfers up on the leaderboard near me,” she added, before turning her thoughts to the possibility of a second Korda win in two weeks.\n“It would definitely be really exciting, but I can’t think about it too much. I’m just going to relax and take it shot-by-shot.”\nJessica, though, is still close enough to win consecutive events on her own after the 25-year-old signed for a 68 to leave her in a tie for fifth, alongside compatriots Marina Alex and Michelle Wie, and Korea’s Ko Jin-young, five shots off the lead.\nKorea’s Jenny Shin and Jang Ha-na are level with Briton Charley Hull on nine-under and with the New Tanjong Course offering plenty of birdie opportunities, everyone in the top-10 will be hoping for a fast start to put pressure on their rivals.\nKang rued her last hole lapse but is looking forward to chasing her second LPGA Tour victory on Sunday.\n“I didn’t want to finish on a bogey but it was a really unlucky lie on the fairway, Quote: fairway, got plugged in the bunker,” said the American whose only other tour victory was at last year’s PGA Championship.\n“But I gave myself a really good par chance and I ended up one shot behind the lead. Got 18 more holes to play and that’s a lot of golf.”\nReporting by John O'Brien; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T11:07:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
