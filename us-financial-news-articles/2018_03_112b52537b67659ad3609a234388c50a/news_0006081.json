Matt Armanino, Armanino chief operating officer (COO), will succeed him effective January 1, 2019.\nUnder Andy’s leadership, the firm experienced unprecedented growth—expanding its service offerings and technology solutions, welcoming hundreds of new staff and stretching its footprint across California, Texas and Illinois. During his tenure, the firm grew to become a top 25 public accounting firm and was regularly recognized as a “Best of the Best” firm by INSIDE Public Accounting (IPA) and on numerous best places to work lists. The firm was also named “Best of Accounting” for Client Satisfaction by Inavero for its client-assessed net promoter score, three years in a row.\nAndy’s leadership in the profession has also been recognized. He has been named to IPA’s Most Admired Peer list for six of the past seven years and currently serves as vice chair of Moore Stephens North America and Moore Stephens International, a global accountancy and consultancy network.\n“While I am extremely proud of all our firm has accomplished, I am most proud of our efforts to become the most innovative and entrepreneurial firm that makes a positive impact on our clients and people,\" said Andy Armanino. \"I believe good leadership involves knowing how and when to initiate change. It is time for a new generation of Armanino leaders to take the helm, and I am confident that through them our legacy will live on and the firm will continue to thrive.”\nIncoming managing partner Matt Armanino joined the firm as COO in 2008 and has been a member of its executive committee for the past nine years.
