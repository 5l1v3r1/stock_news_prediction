The current third fiscal quarter results include one month of results from the Company's acquisition of RSI Home Products, Inc. (\"RSI\"), which closed December 29, 2017. Excluding the impact of the RSI acquisition, net sales for the third fiscal quarter increased 2% to $254 million compared with the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the impact of the RSI acquisition, the Company experienced growth in all sales channels during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nNet income was $2.0 million ($0.12 per diluted share) for the third quarter of the current fiscal year compared with $14.6 million ($0.89 per diluted share) in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Net income was negatively impacted by purchase accounting entries of $6.3 million of inventory step-up amortization, acquisition related costs of $10.2 million, both offset by associated tax benefit of $4.4 million, and gross margin declines which were partially offset by additional sales volumes and lower incentive costs. Adjusted EPS per diluted share was $0.84 for the third quarter of the current fiscal year compared with $0.92 in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $36.0 million, or 12.3% of net sales compared to $28.1 million, or 11.3% of net sales for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to additional sales growth in the quarter and the inclusion of one month of results for RSI.\n\"Despite the third fiscal quarter being our toughest comp verses prior year, I am pleased to report that sales grew across all channels,\" said Cary Dunston, Chairman and CEO. \"We did see our growth in single family new construction decline due to a more aggressive market shift towards first-time buyers than we had planned. However, this shift towards opening price point homes further supports the strategic rationale for the RSI acquisition which was successfully completed in the quarter.\"\nFiscal Year-to-Date 2018\nNet sales for the first nine months of the current fiscal year increased 9% to $844 million from the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the impact of the RSI acquisition, net sales for the first nine months of the current fiscal year increased 4% to $806 million from the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the impact of the RSI acquisition, the Company experienced growth in both the new construction and dealer channels during the first nine months of the current fiscal year.\nNet income for the first nine months of the current fiscal year was $44.0 million ($2.67 per diluted share) compared with $53.9 million ($3.28 per diluted share) for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EPS per diluted share was $3.41 for the first nine months of the current fiscal year compared with $3.31 for the same period of the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $110.4 million, or 13.1% of net sales compared to $99.1 million, or 12.9% of net sales for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The year over year increase is primarily due to additional sales growth and the inclusion of one month of results for RSI.\nFree cash flow totaled $81.8 million for the first nine months of the current fiscal year.\n\"Shortly after the end of the third fiscal quarter, we also took advantage of the opportunity to refinance RSI's 6½% $575 million senior secured second lien notes due 2023 with $350 million in 4.875% senior notes due 2026 and $250 million available under a delayed draw term loan facility,\" said Scott Culbreth, CFO.\nAbout American Woodmark\nAmerican Woodmark Corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.
