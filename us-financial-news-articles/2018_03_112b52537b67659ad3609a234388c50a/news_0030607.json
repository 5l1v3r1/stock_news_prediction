Since its inception in 2012, Restore Utah and Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group have revitalized low- and moderate-income neighborhoods by transforming vacant or neglected properties hard hit by the financial crisis into quality affordable rental homes for low-income families.\nPine Valley is a 60-unit apartment community that was built in 1970 and offers two bedrooms units. Pine Cove is an adjacent 16-unit apartment complex that was built in 2014 and consists of one and three bedroom units. Restore Utah plans to enhance the community through complete interior renovations, heating and cooling improvements and a common area overhaul planned to include a new playground, dog park and gathering pavilion.\n\"We are pleased with the acquisition of Pine Valley and Pine Cove and are optimistic regarding the Salt Lake market because of its expanding population, strong job growth and low unemployment.
