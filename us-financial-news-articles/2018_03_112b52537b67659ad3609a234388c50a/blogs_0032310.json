Elizabeth Warren holds a news conference on banking deregulation legislation on March 6, 2018. Bill Clark—CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images By Bloomberg 1:08 AM EDT \nWells Fargo & Co. (wfc) Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan’s pay raise drew criticism from U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren. \n“Wells Fargo is about to be sanctioned for running an auto-insurance scam that cost Americans millions of dollars. I don’t think that sort of corporate management merits a raise for CEO Tim Sloan,” Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and frequent Wall Street critic, said Thursday in a tweet . \nThe San Francisco-based bank has been embroiled in scandals for 16 months, including a revelation that auto-loan clients were forced to pay for unwanted car insurance . The firm announced this week that it paid Sloan $17.4 million for 2017, a 36% increase from a year earlier. \nFor more on Sen. Warren’s dispute with Wells Fargo, watch Fortune’s video: \n“I disagree with almost everything Elizabeth Warren says,” Sloan told reporters after an appearance at the Detroit Economic Club, according to a report by Reuters. “Most of her comments are both ill-informed and inappropriate.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T07:08:36.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
