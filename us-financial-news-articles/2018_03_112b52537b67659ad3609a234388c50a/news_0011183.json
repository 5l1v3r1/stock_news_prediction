His wife is studying for a business degree in the town of Hasselt while his children are enrolled in the local school.\nThrough his friend, Khalil joined an Irish folk band which meets regularly to perform songs in Davidts’ basement.\n“He is a fantastic musician. We only need to bring up a song and he immediately knows all the chords and he is on his way,” said one of the group members, Richard Glockemann.\nKhalil also still practices Syrian music including his own and in 2016 took part in a project called Refugees for Refugees.\nReporting by Natalie Rice; Editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:06:02.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
