A man serves wine in black glasses, specially designed for wine blind testing, during the presentation of the new Strasbourg University geo-sensorial wine tasting university degree, in Strasbourg, France, March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Vincent Kessler \nFrance’s first university diploma in wine studies has been launched in Strasbourg: a one-year course in wine-tasting, pedology - or soil science - and the neuroscience behind good wine. \n“The ground it comes from is living stuff, where all kinds of things - physical, biological, chemical - are going on,” said geography professor Dominique Schwarz, who will teach the course that aims to increase the understanding of local characteristics of wine, rather than how to churn out industrial quantities.
