Honda Motor Co fell 1.8 percent, Toyota Motor Corp dropped 1.4 percent and Subaru Corp shed 1.1 percent.\nShippers were sold, with Mitsui OSK Lines falling 2.5 percent and Kawasaki Kisen off 2.1 percent.\nWith the dollar falling for a fourth straight session, investors have started to worry that Japanese companies will have to lower their dollar-yen assumptions for the next fiscal year, which would impact their profit outlook.\nThe dollar stood at 105.43 yen, slightly above Friday’s low of 105.23, a level not seen since November 2016.\nThe broader Topix dropped 0.7 percent to 1,696.91.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T04:48:53.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
