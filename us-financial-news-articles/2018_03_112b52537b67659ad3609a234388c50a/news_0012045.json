Welte also won the women’s team sprint.\nAustralia’s Matthew Glaetzer beat Britain’s Jack Carlin 2-0 in the men’s sprint final.\nReporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T00:56:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
