The company has been investing heavily in large and high potential markets such as Germany, China, Latin America, South East Asia and the United States, where trading conditions have been favourable. PageGroup, which finds candidates mainly to fill permanent positions rather than temporary roles, said gross profit rose to 711.6 million pounds for the year ended Dec.31 from 621 million pounds a year earlier. Revenue at constant currencies rose 9.8 percent to 1.37 billion pounds. The company said the number of fee earners, or recruitment consultants as opposed to support staff, rose 16.7 percent last year. British staffing companies have benefited from growth in their international businesses, but domestic market uncertainties have weighed on their profits. PageGroup warned that the UK business, its single largest market, would remain under pressure in 2018. “We remain cautious in several markets as we progress through the year: primarily in the UK, where we will focus on protecting margins.” The company warned of challenges in Australia, where it invested in headcount and a new Canberra office, as well as in Brazil, which had a strong fourth quarter.
