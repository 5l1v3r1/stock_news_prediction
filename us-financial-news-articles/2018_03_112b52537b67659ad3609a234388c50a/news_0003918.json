A negative spread could increase pressure for capital outflows from Saudi Arabia, which authorities are keen to avoid as they seek to fund domestic investment projects.\nThe repos were a way for the central bank to lend short-term money to banks. When the repos were introduced in late 2016, the Saudi banking system faced a liquidity squeeze due to low oil prices, and authorities were battling to prevent rates from going too high.\nBut in recent months, liquidity has improved dramatically and money rates have come down because of austerity measures which have reduced the state budget deficit, a slow economy that has reduced demand for loans, and heavy borrowing by the government overseas.\nSaudi Arabia announced last week that it was expanding a $10 billion international loan refinancing to $16 billion.\nThe central bank will keep its option of using one-day repos, which it has employed in the past to handle any sudden shortages of liquidity at individual banks.
