Warner had captained Australia’s T20 team. PRECARIOUS \nThe ICC then has Australia down for a test and three ODIs in Zimbabwe but this is not likely to happen given the precarious financial state of the game in Zimbabwe, Reuters has learnt. \nAustralia then host Bangladesh in two tests and three ODIs in August before playing away against Pakistan in a five match ODI series and then hosting South Africa in a similar limited overs series in November. \nAfter India’s tour, the 25-year-old Bancroft will be available for selection when Sri Lanka visit Australia in early 2019 for two tests and three ODIs before Australia travel to India for five ODIs and two T20 matches, which have already been scheduled between Feb. 24 and March 13. \nThe last test series that falls inside the period of Smith and Warner’s ban will be away against Pakistan in March next year. \nTheir ban also ruled out participation for the pair in this year’s Indian Premier League but minutes before the Australian sanctions were handed down, the IPL announced neither would be welcome this year.
