Wiese is the top shareholder in Steinhoff, which dropped sharply after revealing accounting irregularities.\nIts company voluntary arrangement proposal also includes a reduction in rental costs and revised lease terms across 393 stores. As a result of the shop closures, a maximum of 980 colleagues out of a staff base of 15,300 people in Britain will be made redundant, the company said, adding that all efforts will be made to redeploy staff within the business.\nReporting by Dasha Afanasieva, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:00:38.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
