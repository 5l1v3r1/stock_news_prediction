Porton Down was the facility where British scientists identified the nerve agent used to attack Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal in the city of Salisbury. Britain has accused Moscow of being responsible for the attack, which Moscow denies. “Today I can announce that we’re building on our world-class expertise of the defence science and technology laboratory at Porton Down. We’re investing 48 million pounds in a new chemical weapons defence centre to maintain our cutting edge in chemical analysis and defence,” Williamson said in a speech.
