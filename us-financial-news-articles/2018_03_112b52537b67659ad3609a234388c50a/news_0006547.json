Jefferies has a“Buy” rating on the stock.\nThe company announced a deal to sell its AvComm and Wireless test businesses in February, enabling it to reduce a debt burden, and shed a part of the business acquired through the group’s ill-fated Aeroflex acquisition in 2014.\n“I have seen early signs of progress against our operational priorities, while risks and challenges remain. I continue to have confidence in our medium term prospects,” Cobham chief executive David Lockwood said in a statement on Thursday.
