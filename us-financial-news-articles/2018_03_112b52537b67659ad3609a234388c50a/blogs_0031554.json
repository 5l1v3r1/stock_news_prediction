He had indicated he was interested in doing this once before, the sources said. \n\"I think [Jacobs] snapped,\" a source close to the board said of the highly improbably leveraged buyout. \nJacobs resigned last week from his role as executive chairman, as the San Diego-based chipmaker resisted an aggressive takeover attempt from Singapore's Broadcom. That bid was shut down by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. earlier this week amid national security concerns. \nThe Financial Times first reported Jacobs has approached multiple investors to get funding for a Qualcomm acquisition bid. \nJacobs did not return a call for comment. \nDow Jones reported on Friday Jacobs may step down from Qualcomm's board. The board is currently meeting to discuss his fate, Dow Jones said. \nQualcomm's stock price was up 1.5 percent Friday.
