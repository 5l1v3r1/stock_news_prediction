MediWound’s first innovative biopharmaceutical product, NexoBrid ® , received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency as well as the Israeli and Argentinian Ministries of Health, for removal of dead or damaged tissue, known as eschar, in adults with deep partial and full-thickness thermal burns and was launched in Europe and Israel and Argentina. NexoBrid ® represents a new paradigm in burn care management, and clinical trials have demonstrated, with statistical significance, its ability to non-surgically and rapidly remove the eschar earlier and without harming viable tissues.\nMediWound's second innovative product, EscharEx ® is a topical biological drug being developed for debridement of chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds and is complementary to the large number of existing wound healing products, which require a clean wound bed in order to heal the wound. EscharEx ® contains the same proteolytic enzyme technology as NexoBrid ® , and benefits from the wealth of existing development data on NexoBrid ® . In two Phase 2 studies, EscharEx ® has demonstrated safety and efficacy in the debridement of chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds, within a few daily applications.
