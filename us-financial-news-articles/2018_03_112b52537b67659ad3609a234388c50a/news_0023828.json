The package then exploded, killing a 17-year-old boy and leaving a woman with non-life-threatening injuries. \nManley said the U.S. Postal Service doesnâ€™t believe that package was sent through its service. Police said that incident was similar to the deadly March 2 explosion, and that both involved packages left on the doorsteps of homes in the morning. Later Monday, another package explosion left a woman with potentially life-threatening injuries, authorities said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T23:41:56.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
