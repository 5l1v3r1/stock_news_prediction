Alula includes two award-winning security system leaders, that together create the most advanced smart security platform designed to meet the needs of today’s customers while simplifying business for professional security dealers, installers and integrators.\nAlula is dedicated to making smart security simple for dealers. Alula helps dealers grow their business with a modern and simplified security platform that expands their reach, allowing dealers to win against often unreliable consumer off-the-shelf solutions through a simple, professional, yet easy-to-install approach. Dealers can also use Alula to embrace DIY as part of their strategy and extend into broader, connected home offerings. Alula is the first fully-integrated security product and service platform designed and dedicated entirely to professional dealers and installers. With integrated products and services, Alula allows independent security companies to bank on a single platform for hundreds of security configurations -- the two-room townhouse, the suburban spread, the small shopkeeper and the growing business. From voice-controlled and mobile app-driven homes to video monitoring and smart device controls, Alula delivers a modern security solution for increasingly complex installation environments.\n“Building Alula for professional dealers means we are advancing Resolution Products and ipDatatel beyond industry-leading sensors, panels, communicators, networks and software,” said Alula Holdings CEO, Brian McLaughlin. “Creating Alula means challenging ourselves to build a competitive advantage for our 3,500 dealer partners. For Alula, simplifying security means making security professionals more productive and profitable.”\nAlula Connect+ (based on the popular Helix alarm panel from Resolution Products and the widely deployed SecureSmart Network by ipDatatel) is an innovative and reliable new solution for dealers. The easy expansion and upgradability of Alula Connect+ ensures integration of smart devices, takeover of wired systems and communications to central stations via IP and cellular. And, Alula’s entire platform is designed to work for professionals. Leveraging Alula Connect+, alarm dealers have the independence to price, configure and control their installations as they choose. Advanced capabilities provide customers with powerful automation of smart home devices, and integrated video making security a lasting feature of the smart home. Whether integrating existing systems or customer specified retail products, Alula Connect+ puts the professional in charge and provides a reliable point of recurring revenue.\n“We are excited about the new company, Alula, and are confident the melding of these two companies will be a force multiplier to continue to drive innovation,” said Michael Morton, Chief Revenue Officer, EMC Security. “In an industry filled with disruption we recognize the importance of choosing partners that embrace continual innovation. Both ipDatatel and Resolution Products have impressed us over the years with their ability to listen to the market and develop products that meet the desires of consumers.”\n“Professional dealers and installers of security and automation solutions are being undercut by vendors and suppliers who promise the future while trying to make independent dealers a thing of the past,” said Alula’s, Brian McLaughlin. “We built Alula to grow the professional dealer businesses as the industry’s best defense against commoditized products and services, off-the-shelf DIY and so-called ‘powered-by’ partners that make dealers pay too much for too little.”\nAbout Alula\nAlula is the only security platform that delivers security simplified for independent security dealers and installers and the customers who rely on their service and expertise. Today, thousands of dealers across North America have over 250,000 active locations secured and connected with Alula. Designed for professional security professionals, the Alula platform provides a complete security, alarm, video and automation solution for renters, homeowners and commercial installations. Alula is a business-driven security platform designed to reduce truck rolls, increase RMR, simplify inventory and put dealers in control of their business, their customers and their revenue.
