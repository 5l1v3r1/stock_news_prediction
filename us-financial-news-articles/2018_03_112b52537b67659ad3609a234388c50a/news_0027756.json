In addition, this press release is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities issued in connection with any contemporaneous notes offering, nor shall there be any sale of the securities issued in such offering in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nVarious statements in this release, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, may be considered forward-looking statements (as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, revenues, income and capital spending. When we use the words \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"anticipate,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" or their negatives, or other similar expressions, the statements which include those words are usually forward-looking statements. When we describe strategy that involves risks or uncertainties, we are making forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release, if any, speak only as of the date of this press release; we disclaim any obligation to update these statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the factors discussed in the 2017 Form 10-K under \"Risk Factors,\" as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cnx-resources-corporation-announces-tender-offer-for-its-8000-senior-notes-due-2023-300614529.html\nSOURCE CNX Resources Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cnx-resources-corporation-announces-tender-offer-for-its-8000-senior-notes-due-2023-300614529.html", "http://www.dfking.com/cnx"], "published": "2018-03-15T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T18:24:09.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
