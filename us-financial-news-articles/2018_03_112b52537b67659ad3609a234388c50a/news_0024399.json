During her tenure she served as Chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and sat on the Committee for Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and was a champion for public transit and for environmental responsibility. She will advise CityLift in its growing public sector business, which includes transit authorities, universities, municipalities, and other governmental agencies.\nDavid Gensler served as co-CEO of Gensler, the world's largest architecture firm, for 23 years before retiring in 2015. Mr. Gensler was involved in leading the firm through a period of rapid growth, including the construction of some of the world's most significant buildings, including the Shanghai Tower, the world's second-tallest building. He will advise CityLift on its business strategy and market outreach to the planning and design community.\nAndy Ball was the founder and CEO of Webcor Builders for 18 years, as well as President of Suffolk Construction. He is currently President of RAD Urban, one of the leaders in modular construction in the US. Mr. Ball will advise CityLift on its operations and market outreach.\n\"We are delighted and excited to have these three extremely accomplished individuals as part of the CityLift team as members of our Advisory Board,\" says Scott Gable, CEO of CityLift Parking . \"We are looking forward to working closely with them. Their unique backgrounds and deep experience in their respective fields will elevate CityLift to the next level. Senator Boxer is no stranger to the public and has years of experience relevant to solving our nation's transportation challenges in an environmentally responsible way. David Gensler led one of the most important architecture firms in the world, and his extensive experience and strategic thinking will help elevate CityLift's leadership in the automated parking lift industry. Andy Ball is one of the most respected and innovative leaders in the construction industry today in the US.\"\n\"Public agencies are facing increasingly scarce and more expensive land to meet their parking needs,\" says former United States Senator Barbara Boxer . \"CityLift's automated parking systems provide these agencies with cost-effective and environmentally friendly solutions to this vexing parking challenge.\"\n\"CityLift is a leader in the rapidly growing automated parking industry and we can expect to see automated parking becoming as common in the US as it is in Asia and Europe,\" says David Gensler .\n\"Automated parking is one of the most needed solutions in today's construction industry. Most buildings can no longer justify building conventional parking and this provides the means for developers and builders to get their projects built,\" says Andy Ball. \" CityLift is a local Bay Area company with a large national presence and I'm equally excited to be a part of its growth.\"\nHeadquartered in Oakland, CityLift Parking designs, installs and services automated parking lifts that save space, reduce the cost of building parking, and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of building parking structures.
