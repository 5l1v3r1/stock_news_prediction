Prices have stayed between $1,310 and $1,360 over the past several weeks, taking their cue from the dollar.\nA weaker dollar makes gold and other dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for overseas buyers. On Tuesday, the WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, fell 0.4%.\nSome investors favor gold as a haven asset when they think markets might turn rocky. Photo: leonhard foeger/Reuters “I think commodities, but most particularly gold, are very much a weaker dollar story,” said Lila Manassa Murphy, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.\nInvestors were reacting to several news events Tuesday.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un told a visiting South Korean delegation that he was willing to hold talks with the U.S. about giving up nuclear weapons and normalizing relations with Washington, and would halt weapons tests during any negotiations, officials in Seoul said Tuesday.\nDivision in the Republican party about U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has contributed to uncertainty about the Trump administration’s protectionist policies.\nRecent results of the Italian election also added to the list of possible geopolitical risks, as two antiestablishment parties performed well in the country’s recent election, and both played down the possibility of entering into coalitions.\nIn addition to contributing to a weaker dollar, those events were boosting gold because some investors favor the haven asset when they think markets might turn rocky, some analysts said.\nAmong base metals, front-month copper for March delivery climbed 1% to $3.1370 a pound, continuing a trend of close-knit moves with oil, stocks and other risky investments. The industrial metal has fallen 4.5% from roughly four-year highs it hit in late December with some analysts worried about an economic slowdown in China, but some investors think demand will still rise in the coming years.\nWrite to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com and David Hodari at David.Hodari@dowjones.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T20:31:01.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
