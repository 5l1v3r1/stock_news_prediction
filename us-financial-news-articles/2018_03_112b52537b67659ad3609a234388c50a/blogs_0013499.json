Jeff Flake , R-Ariz., also came out against the tariffs and said he would introduce legislation intended to nullify the president's move. \n\"Trade wars are not won, they are only lost,\" said Flake, a frequent Trump critic who has decided not to pursue reelection. \"Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster.\" \nFlake's bill, however, is likely to be seen as a symbolic gesture. \nThe tariffs impose penalties of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum. \n\"A strong steel and aluminum industry are vital to our national security,\" Trump said before signing the orders. \"You don't have steel, you don't have a country.\" \nTrump used a report from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross outlining national security threats as a basis for justifying the tariffs. \nBut Ryan disagreed, saying: \"Our economy and our national security are strengthened by fostering free trade with our allies and promoting the rule of law.\" \nThis is breaking news.
