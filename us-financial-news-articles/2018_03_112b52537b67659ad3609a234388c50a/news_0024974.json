But the government quickly mounted a propaganda push, blocking some articles and publishing pieces praising the party. \nThe party loyalists who attend the annual session of parliament have said the decision is popular with ordinary Chinese people and asserted that China was lucky to have a leader of President Xi’s caliber. \nXi began his second five-year term as party chief in October and at the end of the week will be formally appointed by parliament.
