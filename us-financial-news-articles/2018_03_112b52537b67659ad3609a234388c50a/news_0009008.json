Authorities have not identified any suspects, though cyber security firms have speculated that China, North Korea or Russia could be behind the hack.\nWhile it is not the first time that false flags have been used to make it tougher for investigators to identify hackers, this is one of the most sophisticated attempts known to date because the forged indicators were difficult to locate, Kamluk said.\nSergey Novikov, Deputy Director, Global Research & Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab appears on stage at the two-day Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit in Cancun, Mexico, March 8, 2018. REUTERS/Jim Finkle He said that while he does not know who was behind the hack, he is certain the attackers inserted the false digital fingerprint to make it look like Lazarus, a group linked to North Korea.\nKaspersky researchers obtained a sample of Olympic Destroyer from a Pyeongchang ski resort, which is one of the Russian anti-virus software maker’s clients.\nKaspersky Lab CEO Eugene Kaspersky speaks at opening reception at the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit in Cancun, Mexico, March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Jim Finkle Early review of that code suggested it was from Lazarus because some technical features looked similar to malicious software used in a previous attack widely believed to have been launched by Lazarus, Kaspersky researcher Igor Soumenkov told the crowd of some 300 security experts.\nBut closer inspection revealed evidence that specific elements were forged, he said.\n“We can say with 100 percent confidence that it is false. It is not the Lazarus Group,” he said. “We don’t know who they are, but they are not the Lazarus group.”\nReporting by Jim Finkle in Cancun, Mexico; Editing by Matthew Lewis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:39:52.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
