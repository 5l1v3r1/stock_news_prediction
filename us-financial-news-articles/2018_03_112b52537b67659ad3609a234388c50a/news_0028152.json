REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo The world’s second-biggest fashion retailer said sales in the December-February period, including VAT, were unchanged in local currencies, below a mean Reuters poll forecast for an 1.2 percent increase. Sales excluding VAT fell to 46.2 billion Swedish crowns ($5.65 billion) from 47.0 billion a year ago, versus expectations of 47.3 billion. In the previous quarter, local-currency sales unexpectedly shrank for the first time in decades as the core H&M brand attracted fewer shoppers to its stores. Having seen like-for-like sales slow and its shares tumble over the past couple of years, H&M at its first-ever capital markets day in February failed to convince investors it has a viable strategy to turn around a weak trend in its core brand. Biggest rival Inditex ( ITX.MC ), owner of Zara, on Wednesday posted a 7 percent profit rise in its fiscal year through January and said sales grew 9 percent in the first five weeks of its new financial year. H&M is due to publish its full fiscal first-quarter earnings report on March 23.
