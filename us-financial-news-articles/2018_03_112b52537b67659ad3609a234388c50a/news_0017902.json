(OTC PINK: FLMP), a leading provider of Specialty Chemicals for the Passive Fire Protection Market, today issues the following update to its Stockholders.\nFrom: Craig Keyser, CEO\nSubject: December 31, 2017 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results and Corporate Update\nFourth Quarter and Year End Results for 2017\nFlame Seal 2017 revenues were $2,499,032, a decrease of $688,027 or 22% less the 2016 record revenue year resulting in a loss of $259,325. Revenues were adversely affected, principally in our coatings products, as other revenues were relatively flat. Operations were negatively impacted as we continued to invest in personnel, plant and equipment (PPE) while testing and certification costs rose appreciatively.\nRevenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $465,658, a $329,345 decrease or 41% less than the comparable 2015 quarter producing a $110,337 loss.\nCraig Keyser comments, \"Flame Seal (FSP) experienced a difficult year in 2017. We entered the year as our largest coatings customer informed us of an internal reorganization and inventory realignment which cut our 2016 volume in half. Though orders resumed in the second half, coatings represented approximately $700,000 reduction in sales. Transitioning to our successor technologies has proven more challenging than we expected, though we have learned that the added knowledge gained through multiple testing difficulties has given our team insight as to how to produce the efficacy we demand. FSP’s legacy product sales doubled since 2013 through targeted, professional marketing. As the market place changes and produces more efficient and effective products, FSP must achieve technological equivalency, if not, superiority in order to succeed longer term. We reiterate, it is important to note that the heavy investment in FSP’s long term future is essential for next planned milestone: solid, sustainable profitability and not just short term, quarter to quarter results.”\nThe Board of Directors (BOD) is unanimous in supporting FSP’s policy of transparency and openness with our shareholders.\nBalance Sheet Update\nFSP's current ratio of assets to liabilities remained strong at 4.04. Receivables remained healthy and current. Flame Seal has no outstanding litigation issues as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017 FSP had 63,898,153 shares outstanding, a 1,202,700 or 1.9% increase over 12/16/2016.\nCraig Keyser adds, “As recently agreed this year, Flame Seal’s (FSP) financial position will be materially strengthened by a planned major investment by a Board of Directors’ (BOD) member. The equity investment of over $700,000 comes at a crucial time in our development and will allow us to continue our product development and focus on growing our overall business. This investment reflects positively on our prospects. The conversion will become a strategic asset to further FSP’s goals.”\nOnline Marketing Initiative\nWith the launch of our new Website in late 2016, our analytics have shown an increase in web traffic from 2016 to 2017 by an impressive 65 percent. The new SEO (search engine optimization) website continually attracts new customers daily as well as providing up-to-date information, training, and company product information. In the fourth quarter of 2017 Flame Seal (FSP) launched its online ecommerce platform - www.flamesealshop.com .
