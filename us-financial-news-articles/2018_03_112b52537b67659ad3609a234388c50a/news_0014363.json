(“Willdan”) (NASDAQ: WLDN), a provider of professional technical and consulting services, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 29, 2017 and provided its financial targets for fiscal year 2018.\nFiscal Year 2017 Highlights\nTotal contract revenue of $273.4 million, an increase of 31% over prior year Net Revenue was $121.4 million, an increase of 16% over prior year Net income of $12.1 million, an increase of 46% over prior year Diluted earnings per share of $1.32, an increase of 36% over prior year\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nTotal contract revenue of $64.2 million, an increase of 12% over prior year Income from operations of $3.0 million, an increase of 11% over prior year Net income of $3.3 million, an increase of 110% over prior year Diluted earnings per share of $0.36, an increase of 100% over prior year\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Willdan reported total contract revenue of $64.2 million and net income of $3.3 million, or $0.36 per diluted share. This compares with total contract revenue of $57.4 million and net income of $1.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Net Revenue, defined as revenue, net of subcontractor services and other direct costs (see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below), was $31.1 million, up 9.8% compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increase in earnings per share was primarily attributable to higher revenue and a decrease in deferred tax expense. Adjusted Diluted EPS (see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below), which excludes the one-time benefit from remeasuring deferred tax liabilities as a result of the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted in December 2017, was $0.22, up from $0.18 in the prior year.\n“We had a strong year in 2017, surpassing our long-term 20% growth targets,” said Tom Brisbin, Willdan’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Importantly, through both organic growth and our acquisition activity, we continue to improve the diversification of our revenue across geographies, customers, and project types. We anticipate another positive year in 2018, as a number of significant new programs ramp-up including our Local Capacity Requirements program for San Diego Gas & Electric and recent wins from ComEd to expand our energy efficiency work in Illinois. Through renegotiation and a change in our approach to executing certain programs, we expect to continue reducing the amount of equipment pass-through revenue we recognize with little or no margin. This approach is expected to significantly improve our profit margin in 2018, and we expect to generate another year of strong earnings growth.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal contract revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $64.2 million, an increase of 11.7% from $57.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to growth in the Energy Efficiency Services segment, which increased revenue by 19.4% over the same quarter of the prior year.\nRevenue, net of subcontractor services and other direct costs (see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below), for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $31.1 million, an increase of 9.8% from $28.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDirect costs of contract revenue were $44.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $4.8 million, or 12.3%, from $39.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to the expanded revenue base from new contracts in the Energy Efficiency Services segment.\nTotal general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 10.3% to $17.0 million, from $15.4 million for the prior year period, due primarily to the need for increased staffing in support of the continuing growth in our Energy Efficiency Services and Engineering Services segments.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to income tax expense of $1.1 million for the prior year period. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law, which, among other items, lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a one-time decrease in deferred tax expense of $1.3 million for the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2017 to account for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities on the enactment date.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.3 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe growth in Net Revenue and improvement in project profitability enabled Adjusted EBITDA (see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) to increase 24.6% to $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $4.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net Revenue, was 17.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared with 15.0% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal contract revenue for fiscal year 2017 was $273.4 million, an increase of 30.8% from $208.9 million for fiscal year 2016. The increase was primarily due to new projects and new customers in the Energy Efficiency Services and Engineering segments, which increased revenue 40.7% and 9.8%, respectively, from fiscal year 2016.\nDirect costs of contract revenue increased 37.3% to $196.7 million, or 71.9% of contract revenue, for fiscal year 2017, compared to $143.3 million, or 68.6% of contract revenue, for fiscal year 2016. The assets we purchased from Genesys on March 4, 2016 incurred a total of $56.8 million in direct costs of contract revenue for fiscal year 2017, which also accounts for most of the increase in direct costs as a percentage of revenue, as Genesys’ projects tend to have a significantly higher percentage of equipment and subcontractor costs than much of the rest of Willdan’s business mix.\nNet Revenue for fiscal year 2017 increased 16.0% to $121.4 million, compared with $104.7 million for fiscal year 2016.\nTotal general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $63.0 million, an increase of 16.3% from $54.1 million for the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the Energy Efficiency Services segment.\nWe recorded income tax expense of $1.6 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to income tax expense of $3.1 million for the prior fiscal year. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was 11.4%, as compared to 27.0% for fiscal year 2016. The reduction in the year-over-year effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was primarily attributable to increased deductions for stock options and disqualifying dispositions and the impact of the Tax Act, partially offset by energy efficient commercial building deductions utilized in 2016, which were not available for use in 2017.\nNet income for fiscal year 2017 was $12.1 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $8.3 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2016.\nThe growth in Net Revenue enabled Adjusted EBITDA to grow 32.8% to 21.8 million for fiscal year 2017, compared with $16.4 million for fiscal year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net Revenue, was 18.0% for fiscal year 2017, as compared with 15.7% for fiscal year 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nWilldan reported $14.4 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 29, 2017, as compared to $22.7 million at December 30, 2016. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash paid for the acquisition of Integral Analytics of $15.0 million, payments of $5.9 million for contingent consideration and on notes payable related to our prior acquisitions and $2.2 million for purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements, which was partially offset by cash proceeds from stock option exercises and proceeds from sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of $2.7 million and cash provided by operations of $11.1 million.\nOutlook\nWilldan has provided the following financial targets for fiscal year 2018:\nTotal Net Revenue of $130 - $140 million Diluted earnings per share before stock-based compensation expense of $1.95 - $2.05 Effective tax rate of approximately 23% Diluted share count of 9.3 million shares Depreciation of approximately $2.0 million Amortization of approximately $3.0 million\nOver the long-term, Willdan continues to target both organic and acquisitive Net Revenue growth of greater than 10%, resulting in total Net Revenue growth of greater than 20% per year.\nConference Call Details and Investor Report\nChief Executive Officer Thomas Brisbin and Chief Financial Officer Stacy McLaughlin will host a conference call today, March 8, 2018, at 5:30 p.m. Eastern/2:30 p.m. Pacific to discuss Willdan’s financial results and provide a business update.\nInterested parties may participate in the conference call by dialing 866-548-4713 and providing conference ID 7721987.

The replay will be available through March 22, 2018.\nAn Investor Report containing supplemental financial information can also be accessed on the home page of Willdan’s investor relations website.\nAbout Willdan Group, Inc.\nWilldan provides professional technical and consulting services, including comprehensive energy efficiency services, for utilities, private industry and public agencies throughout the United States.

Willdan provides integrated technical solutions to extend the reach and resources of its clients and provides all services through its subsidiaries specialized in each segment. For additional information, visit Willdan's website at www.willdan.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n“Net Revenue,” a non-GAAP financial measure, is a supplemental measure that Willdan believes enhances investors’ ability to analyze our business trend and performance because it substantially measures the work performed by our employees. In the course of providing services, Willdan routinely subcontracts various services. Generally, these subcontractor services and other direct costs are passed through to our clients and, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and industry practice, are included in our revenue when it is our contractual responsibility to procure or manage these activities. Because subcontractor services and other direct costs can vary significantly from project to project and period to period, changes in revenue may not necessarily be indicative of our business trends. Accordingly, Willdan segregates costs from revenue to promote a better understanding of our business by evaluating revenue exclusive of costs associated with external service providers. A reconciliation of contract revenue as reported in accordance with GAAP to revenue, net of subcontractor services and other direct costs is provided at the end of this news release.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by Willdan’s management to measure its operating performance. Willdan defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), stock-based compensation, interest accretion and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. Willdan believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows Willdan’s management to evaluate its operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period and against its peers without regard to its financing methods, capital structure and non-operating expenses. Willdan uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its performance for, among other things, budgeting, forecasting and incentive compensation purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s costs of capital, stock-based compensation, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets. Willdan’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may also differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures. Willdan believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors, research analysts, investment bankers and lenders because it removes the impact of certain non-operational items from its operational results, which may facilitate comparison of its results from period to period. A reconciliation of net income as reported in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA is provided at the end of this news release.\n“Adjusted Net Income” is a supplemental measure used by Willdan’s management to measure its operating performance. Willdan defines Adjusted Net Income as net income plus stock compensation expense and impact of state net operating loss carryover minus the tax benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities. Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of net income as reported in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted Net Income is provided at the end of this news release.\n“Adjusted Diluted EPS” is a supplemental measure used by Willdan’s management to measure its operating performance. Willdan defines Adjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net Income divided by the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Adjusted Diluted EPS has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, diluted EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of diluted EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted Diluted EPS is provided at the end of this news release.\nWilldan’s definition of revenue, net of subcontractor services and other direct costs (Net Revenue), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as contract revenue and net income.\nForward Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release that are not purely historical, including statements regarding Willdan’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, representations, projections, estimates, plans or predictions of the future are within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding Willdan’s targets for fiscal year 2018 and the expected benefits of Willdan’s acquisition of Integral Analytics.
