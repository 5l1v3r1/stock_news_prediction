(NYSE: AIZ), a global provider of risk management solutions, today announced the commencement of a public offering of 2,500,000 shares of its Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (“mandatory convertible preferred stock”) with a liquidation preference of $100.00 per share, subject to market conditions. The company expects to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 375,000 shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock, solely to cover over-allotments.\nThe company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering together with proceeds from the issuance of new indebtedness, cash on hand and common stock consideration to fund the company’s previously announced acquisition of TWG Holdings Limited, refinance its existing 2.50% Senior Notes due 2018 and pay related fees and expenses.\nUnless converted earlier at the option of the holders, each share of mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into a variable number of shares of the company’s common stock on or around March 15, 2021. The conversion rates, dividend rate and other terms of the mandatory convertible preferred stock will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering.\nThe offering is not contingent upon the consummation of the acquisition of TWG Holdings Limited, although under certain circumstances the mandatory convertible preferred stock is subject to redemption at Assurant’s option, in whole but not in part, if the acquisition is not consummated. If for any reason the acquisition of TWG Holdings Limited is not consummated (and if Assurant does not exercise its option to redeem the mandatory convertible preferred stock), the net proceeds from this offering would be available for the refinancing of the 2018 Senior Notes and general corporate purposes.\nMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as joint book running managers for the offering.\nAn effective shelf registration statement, under which the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock will be issued, was filed previously with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
