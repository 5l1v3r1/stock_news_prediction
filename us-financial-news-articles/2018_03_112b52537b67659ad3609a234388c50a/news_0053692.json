The child labor issue is “on the top of our radar” but a “complicated issue in the DRC context,” she added.\nThe RCI intends to hold an open session for cobalt market participants at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a key backer of the RCI, in Paris in mid-April, said Feng.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T08:23:15.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
