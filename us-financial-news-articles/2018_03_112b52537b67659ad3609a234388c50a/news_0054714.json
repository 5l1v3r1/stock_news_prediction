REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo \nThe world’s largest wealth manager said in January it would combine its businesses servicing American and international clients into one global division. \nUBS is now combining the regional teams responsible for managing products and services related to alternative investments, investment mandates and partnerships, an internal memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the bank said. \n“We are confident that our new set-up will enable us to capture the many new opportunities that our worldwide wealth management business offers,” Jason Chandler and Christian Wiesendanger, who jointly lead wealth management’s Investment Platforms and Solutions (IPS), told UBS employees on Tuesday. \nWiesendanger and Chandler were named global co-heads of IPS a year ago, in a move that presaged the merger of Wealth Management Americas and the separate international Wealth Management unit which took effect in February. \nWhile the North American and international wealth management businesses will maintain distinct business models, with the United States continuing to service clients through a brokerage model, the Swiss-based bank said the unification would better serve ultra-wealthy clients while cutting costs. \nBy combining IPS reporting lines, UBS hopes to give clients access to its full product suite across wealth management. \nJerry Pascucci — hitherto alternative investments head in America — will lead the global alternatives team offering hedge fund and private market investments, including investments in private equity, real estate and impact investment, with effect from April, according to the memo. \nRoman Berri and Jake Elmhirst will assume responsibility for private markets and hedged strategies respectively out of Zurich and London. \nUBS will also align its mandates business under global investment management head Bruno Marxer and expand offerings in the United States through a new American subdivision. \nA global partnerships team under Greg Toskos will provide a single contact point for third-party partners as well as the bank’s asset management and investment banking divisions.
