(“Epsilon”) (TSX:EPS) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\nMr. Michael Raleigh, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are excited by the current prospects for Epsilon given the talented additions to our operational team in 2017, an unlevered balance sheet, a cash flowing asset and the opportunity to allocate capital to economically attractive gas and liquids projects in the Marcellus and Anadarko basins.\nIn the Marcellus, Epsilon recently proposed seven wells to hasten development and increase our working interest production in this attractive asset. In the Anadarko, Epsilon is participating with small working interests in multiple locations with several operators in order to gather data, improve our technical understanding and position us to begin de-risking and growing this asset. As validation of our strategy, Epsilon has been approached by several operators and lease holders in our Anadarko assets to jointly develop portions of our acreage.”\nHighlights for the year and material subsequent events following the end of the quarter through the date of this release include:\nRetired Cdn$38.5 million (US$29.5 million) of convertible debentures.\nExecuted rights offering raising Cdn$24.6 million (US$18.0 million) of capital.\nClosed four transactions totaling approximately 7,000 net held-by-production acres across 100 sections (64,000 gross acres) of the NW STACK in Dewey County, Oklahoma.\nTotal estimated proved and probable natural gas reserves of 266 Bcf as of December 31, 2017 after 2017 production of 9.0 Bcf, and 45 Mbbl of proved oil and condensate reserves after 2017 production of 3 Mbbl.\nMarcellus working interest (WI) gas averaged 27 MMcf/d for the fourth quarter of 2017. Working interest gas production as of this release is approximately 25 MMcf/d.\nGathered and delivered 88.2 Bcf gross (30.9 Bcf net to Epsilon’s interest) during the year, or 242 MMcfe/d through the Auburn System which represents approximately 73% of maximum throughput.\nGathered and delivered 20.9 Bcf gross (7.3 Bcf net to Epsilon’s interest) during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEpsilon is closing in on fully satisfying the regulatory requirements for US companies and to obtain a listing on a major US stock exchange\nFinancial and Operating Results\nThree months ended December 31, Twelve months ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue by product - total period ($000) Natural gas revenue ($000) $ 4,057 $ 5,047 $ 19,204 $ 15,263 Volume (MMcfe) 2,211 2,969 9,010 11,016 Avg.

Of this, $19.1 million was spent on acquisition of producing properties with deep rights to the Mississippian and Woodford intervals in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, USA. The remainder of the capital spending, $0.2 million, was allocated to the ongoing build-out and maintenance of the Auburn Gas Gathering system.\nEpsilon is planning capital expenditures of $32.5 million for 2018. In the Marcellus Basin, Epsilon is budgeting $24 million for drilling & completing wells, $6 million for lease acquisition and $0.5 million for the Auburn Gas Gathering system. The upstream budget is discretionary and will be driven by natural gas prices and the participation elections of Epsilon’s working interest partners in outstanding well proposals. In the Anadarko Basin, Epsilon is budgeting $2 million to participate in drilling & completing wells with various operators.\nMarcellus Operational Guidance\nThe Operator did not drill any wells during the fourth quarter of 2017. The table below details Epsilon’s well development status at December 31, 2017:\nSeptember 30, 2017 December 31, 2017 Gross Net Gross Net Producing 78 19.58 91 22.60 Shut-in 15 4.51 4 1.54 Waiting on pipeline - - - - Waiting on completion 7 0.13 5 0.09 Drilling - - - - Epsilon proposed seven wells subsequent to quarter end. The Operator and other working interest parties have elected to participate in three of the wells. The election results of the four remaining proposals are not known at the date of this release.\nFourth Quarter Results\nEpsilon generated revenues of $6.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The Company’s Marcellus net revenue interest production was 2.1 Bcf in the fourth quarter, and Oklahoma was 20,378 BOE.\nRealized natural gas prices averaged $1.80 per Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating expenses for Marcellus Upstream operations in the fourth quarter were $1.3 million.\nThe Auburn Gas Gathering system delivered 20.9 Bcf of natural gas during the quarter as compared to 22.7 Bcf during the fourth quarter of 2016. Primary gathering volumes increased 31.0% quarter over quarter to 12.6 Bcf. Imported cross-flow volumes increased 18.3% to 8.3 Bcf.\nEpsilon reported a net after tax income of $8.5 million attributable to common shareholders or $0.16 per basic and diluted common shares outstanding for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net loss of $0.3 million, and $(0.00) per basic and diluted common shares outstanding for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Epsilon's Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") was $2.3 million as compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to decreased upstream production and a decrease in the gathering rate charged on midstream throughput.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nEpsilon defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before (1) net interest expense, (2) taxes, (3) depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, (4) impairments of oil and gas properties, (5) non-cash stock compensation expense, (6) unrealized gain on derivatives, and (7) other income. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance as determined under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of profitability or liquidity.\nAdditionally, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Epsilon has included Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because its management believes that EBITDA provides useful information regarding its ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures. It further provides investors a helpful measure for comparing operating performance on a \"normalized\" or recurring basis with the performance of other companies, without giving effect to certain non-cash expenses and other items. This provides management, investors and analysts with comparative information for evaluating the Company in relation to other oil and gas companies providing corresponding non-IFRS financial measures or that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. These non-IFRS financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures for financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The table above sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable measure of financial performance calculated under IFRS and should be reviewed carefully.\nAbout Epsilon\nEpsilon Energy Ltd. is a value creating natural gas and liquids development, production and midstream company focussed on the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania and the NW STACK in Oklahoma.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this news release constitute forward looking statements. The use of any of the words “anticipate”, “continue”, “estimate”, “expect”, ‘may”, “will”, “project”, “should”, ‘believe”, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumption but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and the forward-looking statements included in this news release should not be unduly relied upon.\nThe reserves and associated future net revenue information set forth in this news release are estimates only. In general, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and the future net revenue therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as production rates, ultimate reserves recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, ability to transport production, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially from actual results. For those reasons, estimates of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, as well as the classification of such reserves and estimates of future net revenues associated with such reserves prepared by different engineers (or by the same engineers at different times) may vary. The actual reserves of the Company may be greater or less than those calculated. In addition, the Company's actual production, revenues, development and operating expenditures will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material.\nStatements relating to \"reserves\" are deemed to be forward-looking statements as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and can be profitably produced in the future. There is no assurance that forecast price and cost assumptions will be attained and variances could be material.\nProved reserves are those reserves which are most certain to be recovered. There is at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated proved reserves. Undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (proved, probable) to which they are assigned. Proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty and are expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure is required to render them capable of production.\nThe estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effects of aggregation. The estimated future net revenues contained in this news release do not necessarily represent the fair market value of the Company's reserves.\nContact Information:\n281-670-0002\nMichael Raleigh\nChief Executive Officer\nMichael.Raleigh@EpsilonEnergyLTD.com\nSpecial note for news distribution in the United States\nThe securities described in the news release have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “1933 Act”) or state securities laws.
