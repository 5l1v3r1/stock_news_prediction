The statement came in response to a report in local newspaper Valor Economico, which said the two parties were close to announcing a merger. Suzano said that given the issues that remain in the talks, it was “not possible to confirm the veracity of the news.” Fibria reiterated in a filing released shortly after that its controlling shareholders, BNDES Participações SA and Votorantim Industrial SA, were in negotiations with Suzano.
