We are thrilled to have Daniel on the team at Kuebix and congratulate him for this well-earned achievement.”\n“The diversity of this year’s award winners reflects the growing complexity of the global food supply chain and the many people whose individual and collective successes are driving the industry to new heights,” notes Lara L. Sowinski, editorial director at Food Logistics .\nAs Director of Supply Chain Operations at Kuebix, Padilla is responsible for directing and managing the manufacturing, grocery and food services divisions. He is an accomplished logistics professional and supply chain director with 15 years of hands-on experience driving cost reductions and quality improvements in the shipping, receiving and transportation of consumable and non-consumable goods. He is also responsible for business development through on-site client meetings to work on additional product offerings, identify gaps within their current structure and build on the relationships, which has increased sales by 20% year over year with current customers.\nLeveraging his years of experience in the grocery industry, Padilla is highly involved with Kuebix’s national grocery customers.
