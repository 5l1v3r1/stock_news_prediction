REUTERS/Brian Snyder Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo Securities predicts the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will approve Philip Morris’ IQOS (I-Quit-Ordinary Smoking), a system that heats tobacco cigarettes rather than burns them, as soon as this year.\nLike vaping, IQOS is said to offer reduced risks compared to smoking, while better matching the cigarette experience, according to the article.\nHerzog has a price target of $85 on Altria, which would be up about 30 percent from recent levels. The stock closed at $65.65 on Friday.\nReporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T04:31:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
