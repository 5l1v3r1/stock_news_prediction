In her role, Denise will guide global sales, marketing and operations of the automotive industry's leading messaging platform.\nDenise was formerly a co-founder and the President of Retail at LotLinx, where she was a pioneer in the creation of VIN-specific advertising. Denise's history in digital automotive also includes her role on the original management team of Cars.com and later she launched the automotive vertical at Google. Throughout her career, Denise has driven innovation in the industry and will bring those skills to accelerate the momentum that Contact at Once! has established in automotive digital messaging.\n\"Contact At Once! has the long-standing leadership position in digital messaging, helping dealers and automakers connect with in-market shoppers and car owners across the automotive internet,\" said Denise. \"Now, in partnership with our parent company LivePerson, we're poised to take the industry well beyond transactional dealer chat and text. By leveraging bots, in a 'tango' with human agents, manufacturers and dealerships can provide a superior shopping experience for consumers at scale.\"\nDenise explains that empowering the consumer to connect with dealers and automakers wherever and whenever they're shopping, and via their preferred conduit for communication, which is primarily messaging, is the next revolution in auto retailing. \"Consumers shop everywhere now – on the dealer or automaker site, in advertising, on Google, Facebook, etc., and they have a variety of needs. Some are ready to talk payments and finance, some are just starting to compare models. By weaving people, bots and CAO messaging technologies together, we can guide the shopping experience in a fast, knowledgeable, and satisfying way, while helping dealers focus on what they do best: closing sales,\" she said.\nIt is widely acknowledged in the automotive industry that the path to purchase is difficult, time consuming and often, not enjoyable. Adding the ability for car shoppers and owners to connect with a dealer or automaker via text, chat, or messenger takes a tremendous amount of friction out of the process. In fact, in the consumer surveys conducted by Contact At Once! , shoppers have expressed a preference for dealers who offer messaging.\nChudy isn't surprised. \"When sellers take advantage of the opportunity to build relationships in a unique way that helps the consumer save time and aggravation, it's a win.\"\nAvi Kedmi, executive vice president, commercial, at LivePerson, says Chudy's industry knowledge will help the company continue to evolve its messaging platform to fit the needs of automotive companies. \"LivePerson's mission is to transform the way consumers communicate with businesses. We're investing in new products for the industry because we believe there is great opportunity here to help dealers and automakers create innovative customer experiences.\"\nABOUT CONTACT AT ONCE!\nContact At Once!, a LivePerson company, helps boost engagement by making it easy for consumers to connect with brand manufacturers and retailers to ask questions at the moment their interest is piqued—whether on a brand or retailer site, via online advertising, on social media or more.
