He said about 40 more IRPT members in exile still had such warrants active against them.\n“It obviously has massive implications for your reputation,” Mik said.“Having your face plastered on the list of internationally wanted people isn’t going to help your cause.”\nTajikistan’s Interior Ministry said it was unaware of the Red Notice for Kabiri being deleted.\nRakhmon, 65, has been in power since 1992, the first five years of his rule marked by a civil war with an armed opposition that included factions ranging from liberal democrats to Islamists.\nIRPT founders were among those fighting government forces , and in 2000 accused Rakhmon of violating a 1997 peace agreement in order to boost his powers.\nIn January 2017, Rakhmon appointed his eldest son, 30-year-old Rustam Imomali, mayor of the capital Dushanbe, fuelling prompting speculation he was grooming him as his successor.\nRakhmon’s current term in office ends in 2020.\nReporting by Olzhas Auyezov; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:41:21.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
