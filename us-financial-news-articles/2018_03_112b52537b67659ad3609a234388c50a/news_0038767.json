Despite being aware of the misuse since 2015, Facebook did not alert its users.\nFacebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke out on Wednesday for the first time since the news broke. In a Facebook post he wrote, \"We have a responsibility to protect your data.\" But the stock tumbled considerably this week. \n\"Big tech and the centralized control isn't working,\" said Susan Och, senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tank New America. \n\"This is why distributed ledger technology is taking off,\" Och said on \" Closing Bell \" Wednesday. \nDespite the recent declines of bitcoin and other digital currencies, Steves predicted that cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology could swell into a $10 trillion industry within the next 15 years . The use of decentralized computing and open source software will help this market develop, he said.\nBitcoin was one of the first applications of blockchain technology nearly a decade ago. The same technology has been used by developers to create other digital currencies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T01:36:00.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
