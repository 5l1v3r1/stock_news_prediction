Jujhar Khaira made it 1-1 with a shorthanded marker at 8:01. Ryan Strome pounced on a loose puck at the Oilers blue line, and though Arizona goalie Darcy Kuemper stopped Strome’s shot on the ensuing 2-on-1 rush, Khaira tucked home the rebound.\nMilan Lucic snapped a 29-game goal drought, scoring for the first time since Dec. 23 to make it 2-1 at 13:21. Lucic was sprung by a long stretch pass from Leon Draisaitl and from the left circle fired a rocket of a slapper and showed his relief after.\nJesse Puljujarvi potted Edmonton’s third goal of the first period at the 17:04 mark. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins stole the puck from a Coyotes defender before feeding Puljujarvi in the high slot, and he promptly ripped a top-corner shot for his 11th goal of the season.\nThe Coyotes may sit last in the league but made a game of it, starting with Christian Dvorak’s goal at 11:31 of the third period pull within one. Richard Panik took advantage of a bad turnover in the Edmonton zone and fed his teammate in front of the net, and Dvorak made no mistake from the close-quarters opportunity.\nNiklas Hjalmarsson then potted his first goal in 14 months to make it a 3-3 game with 4:39 left in regulation. The visitors were buzzing before Hjalmarsson found the mark with a shot from the slot during a scramble.\nTalbot made 32 saves for the Oilers to snap a three-game losing skid, while Kuemper stopped 32 shots for Arizona.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:23:24.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
