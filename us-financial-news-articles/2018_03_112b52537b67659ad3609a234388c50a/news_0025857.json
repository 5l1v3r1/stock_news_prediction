(NASDAQ:WVE), a biotechnology company focused on delivering transformational therapies for patients with serious, genetically-defined diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, and provided a business update.\n“2017 was a transformative year for Wave as we transitioned into clinical development by initiating trials for our three lead neurology programs, established our in-house manufacturing capability and made great progress on delivering three more neurology development programs in 2018,” said Paul Bolno, MD, MBA, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wave Life Sciences. “Our expertise in designing potentially first-in-class and innovative medicines continues to grow as we generate additional in vivo data demonstrating the impressive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of stereopure oligonucleotides in a variety of animal models across multiple organ systems and tissues. We look forward to advancing our existing and planned clinical programs, collaborating with our partners at Takeda and continuing to build our internal capabilities in preparation for the potential commercialization of our lead programs.”\nBusiness Summary and Update\nGlobal strategic collaboration with Takeda to advance therapies for central nervous system (CNS) disorders\nIn February 2018, Wave formed a global strategic collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) to discover, develop, and commercialize nucleic acid therapies for disorders of the CNS. Under the terms of the agreement, Takeda is obligated to make an initial payment of $110 million to Wave and purchase $60 million of Wave’s ordinary shares at $54.70 per share. Takeda is also required to fund at least $60 million of Wave research over a four-year period to advance multiple preclinical targets. Wave’s collaboration agreement with Takeda will become effective upon satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Preclinical in vivo data supporting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) programs presented at 28th International Symposium on ALS/MND\nIn December 2017, Wave announced data from preclinical studies of WVE-3972-01, the company’s investigational stereopure antisense oligonucleotide designed to target the pathogenic allele of the C9ORF72 gene for the treatment of ALS and FTD. In preclinical in vivo studies, WVE-3972-01 demonstrated a potent, sustained and preferential knockdown of toxic biomarkers associated with ALS and FTD. Neurology pipeline continues to progress and expand across multiple diseases\nExpanding the neurology pipeline into spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3)\nWave announced today that it expects to name a potential candidate targeting the ATXN3 gene for the treatment of SCA3 by the end of 2018. This new program will add to Wave’s current and planned clinical neurology development programs in Huntington’s disease (HD), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), ALS, and FTD.\nSCA3, also known as Machado–Joseph disease, is caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene, resulting in an abnormally long polyglutamine stretch in the encoded ataxin-3 protein. Mutant ataxin-3 protein is thought to cause widespread neuronal loss in the brain and spinal cord, likely through a toxic gain of function mechanism. SCA3 is the most common dominantly inherited form of ataxia. The prevalence of SCA3 is believed to be one to two cases in 100,000 people with significant geographic and ethnic variations. There are currently no therapies approved for the treatment of SCA3.\nHD: WVE-120101 and WVE-120102\nThe PRECISION-HD program, which includes two global Phase 1b/2a clinical trials evaluating WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 for patients with HD, continues to enroll patients and the company is on track to report topline data in H1 2019.\nWave’s two programs are allele-specific and differentiated from other investigational therapies currently being studied for the treatment of HD. WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 are designed to selectively silence mRNA transcript produced by the disease-causing mutant huntingtin ( HTT ) allele. This personalized approach reduces the mutant HTT protein while leaving the healthy HTT mRNA transcript relatively intact. The healthy transcript is required to produce wild-type, or healthy, HTT protein which is critical for neuronal function, as evidenced by multiple preclinical studies indicating that long-term suppression of healthy HTT protein may have detrimental consequences. Wave’s allele-specific approach may also enable the company to address the pre-manifest, or asymptomatic, HD patient population in the future.\nDMD: WVE-210201\nWave continues to advance its research and clinical efforts in neuromuscular diseases, including WVE-210201, currently in a global Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of DMD patients amenable to exon 51 skipping. Safety data from the trial are anticipated in Q3 2018 and expected to facilitate the rapid transition to an open-label extension study and efficacy study. Both studies following the Phase 1 are designed to include an interim efficacy readout of dystrophin expression from muscle biopsies in H2 2019.\nALS, FTD and exon 53 DMD programs on track to transition to development in 2018\nThe company intends to initiate clinical trials of WVE-3972-01 in ALS and FTD in Q4 2018. Wave’s next DMD development program will target exon 53, with clinical trials expected to initiate in Q1 2019. New in vivo data support ophthalmology franchise\nWave is advancing the development of stereopure oligonucleotides to target genetic ophthalmologic diseases, with an initial emphasis on retinal diseases. Using the long-noncoding RNA MALAT1 as a proof-of concept target, a 10-fold increase in potency was achieved in vivo with a stereopure oligonucleotide as compared to a stereorandom oligonucleotide following a single intravitreal injection in the back of a mouse eye. The knockdown of MALAT1 RNA was sustained through three months after the single injection and the study is scheduled to continue for a total of six months.\nIn addition, recent results from a preclinical in vivo study in non-human primates demonstrated that a stereopure oligonucleotide achieved a clear dose-dependent knockdown of MALAT1 mRNA in the back of the eye one week following a single intravitreal injection. A six-month duration of effect study is planned.\nWave is conducting additional research to develop stereopure oligonucleotides against specific genetic targets to treat diseases of the eye. Pfizer collaboration progress\nIn November 2017, Wave achieved a milestone under its collaboration with Pfizer by demonstrating significant activity of stereopure GalNAc-conjugated APOC3 antisense oligonucleotides over stereorandom oligonucleotides in in vivo studies and meeting other milestone criteria. The collaboration continues to make progress on developing genetically targeted therapies for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results and Financial Guidance\nWave reported a net loss of $30.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $18.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company reported a net loss of $102.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $55.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net loss for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was mainly due to increases in research and development efforts, infrastructure investments, and employee headcount to support its corporate goals.\nResearch and development expenses were $25.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to $14.0 million for the same period in 2016. Research and development expenses for the full year were $79.3 million as compared to $40.8 million for the prior year. The increase in research and development expenses for the fourth quarter and full year was primarily driven by increases in research, preclinical and clinical investments, as well as facilities-related expenses to continue to advance Wave’s expanding pipeline.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to $5.2 million for the same period in the prior year. General and administrative expenses were $27.0 million for the full year as compared to $16.0 million for the prior year. The increase in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter and full year was primarily driven by the continued growth in Wave’s employee headcount, as well as increases in facilities-related expenses and other general operating expenses.\nWave ended 2017 with $142.5 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $150.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of Wave’s annual operating loss of $102.0 million partially offset by the $93.5 million in net proceeds from the April 2017 follow-on offering.\nThe company expects that its cash and cash equivalents, together with the committed cash from its collaboration with Takeda, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, have the potential to fund its operating and capital expenditure requirements to the end of 2020.\nAbout Wave Life Sciences\nWave Life Sciences is a biotechnology company focused on delivering transformational therapies for patients with serious, genetically-defined diseases.
