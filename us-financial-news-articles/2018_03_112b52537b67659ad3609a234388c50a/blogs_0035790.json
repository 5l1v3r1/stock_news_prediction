Next week, the government plans to start directing water to fill another reservoir serving 17 municipalities, he said. \nWith water for human consumption taking precedence, the diversion project has yet to have significant impact on agriculture. Farmers in the area are still restricted to irrigating 0.5 hectare of land, an area smaller than the size of a soccer field, according to newspaper Folha de S.Paulo. \nThe diversion project, begun by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2005, faced years of setbacks from political infighting, budget overruns and corruption. \nPresident Michel Temer jump-started work on the project, making it a priority after taking office in 2016 following the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff. \nThe northern canal is coming online roughly a year later than expected as the country needed to seek a new builder, Barbalho said, when previous contractor Mendes Junior abandoned work after being accused of involvement in corruption scandal. \n(Reporting by Jake Spring Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T08:51:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
