A Vox headline about the speech said, “He riles up crowds, but nothing he says actually matters or reflects administration policy.”\nI watched the same speech and saw something else—and it mattered, whether one is a Trump supporter or opponent. That Trump speech was an important stop on the admittedly long road to understanding this presidency. \nBecause CPAC is the annual meeting of conservatism’s hardest core, it would not have been a surprise if Mr. Trump merely delivered 70 minutes of bleeding red meat. But the speech was more than red meat.\nWithin one minute, Mr. Trump said: “Do you remember I started running and people said: Are you sure he’s a conservative? I think now we’ve proved that I’m a conservative.”\nHe’s right. There was little reason to believe Donald Trump was a conservative when he belly-slammed into the GOP primary pool. He was an ideology-free zone. What, many wondered, would he turn out to be as president?\nAt CPAC he made clear he has concluded that his political interests and legacy—and perhaps even his survival—are best served inside the structure of the conservative tent.\nA cynical explanation of this conservative self-baptism would be that he hears the hooves of Robert Mueller’s posse and will need friends to fight the impeachment lynch mob if Lady of the Left Nancy Pelosi is House speaker. That explanation for Mr. Trump’s turn toward conservatism is plausible but not sufficient. \nAs the basis for his claim, Mr. Trump listed his appointment of conservative judges, his deregulatory initiatives and the tax cut. Nearly all of his Republican primary opponents would have done these things, too. It’s not obvious, though, that the others would have gone so deep. The Trump policies, especially his deregulation, aren’t merely conservative. They are radically conservative. \nWho among Mr. Trump’s GOP opponents would have canceled and denounced the Paris Climate Agreement or tried to open virtually the entire U.S. coastline to oil and gas drilling? The regulatory rollback, abetted by the Republicans’ use of the Congressional Review Act, was vast and sudden—covering energy, finance, labor law, the environment and education. \nIn the speech, Mr. Trump said he thought the deregulation had “as big an impact” as the tax cuts. It was in fact the booster rocket beneath the—again radical—40% cut in the corporate tax rate. \nAt the time, his critics, such as Mrs. Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, said Donald Trump was doing all this to benefit his wealthy corporate friends. It’s now evident how off the mark that is. \nDeparting from the CPAC text, Mr. Trump said that before he became president, “I was a private-sector guy.” It is important to understand what he means by the “private-sector guy.” It’s not his golfing pals. \nEvery Republican president from Ronald Reagan onward, and all GOP candidates, has used “the government” as an ideological foil. This president rarely mentions “the government” or the public sector. \nFor Donald Trump, the federal government seems to exist as a kind of distant abstraction—with the military occupying a separate space of heroes and service. \nCPAC-style conservatives actively dislike the administrative state. But what’s driving Washington nuts is that Donald Trump doesn’t seem to care much about them or what they do (and that may include an obliviousness to levels of public spending). His disdain in large part explains the Beltway-wide effort to shut down this presidency by any means possible, including the quixotic 25th Amendment. \nSo what matters in the private world of Donald Trump? The answer was in the CPAC speech. The “private-sector guy” is about one thing: jobs. Also known as employment and work. \nEvery president claims to be a jobs president, but after a year it is becoming clear that this may be the only thing Donald Trump thinks about. He may even impose tariffs soon on imported steel, seeing only the protected jobs in front of him and missing the larger loss of jobs in steel-using industries. \nIs his elevation of the private sector working? The Federal Reserve’s latest Monetary Policy Report said Friday “the labor market in early 2018 appears to be near or a little beyond full employment.” \nDonald Trump’s critics say this isn’t enough, that it doesn’t justify the corrosion of public discourse. It’s a legitimate point. A CPAC audience shouted at pro-immigration remarks by a Cato Institute speaker with an incivility normally seen among the campus left.\nPolitics will always be the art of the possible, but no one promised it would also be artistic. And perhaps compulsive inartfulness will be Donald Trump’s undoing. \nFor now, we are discovering what a presidency of radical, private-sector, jobs-obsessed conservatism looks like. For those who want something other than that, the presidential primaries await their alternatives.\nWrite henninger@wsj.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T08:05:08.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
