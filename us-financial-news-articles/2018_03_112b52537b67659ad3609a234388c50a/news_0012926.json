Lending in 2017 climbed 4.9 percent in the nine-months to September, but the bank has yet to release full year figures.\nJoshua, who did not comment on the actual 2017 loan growth figure as the bank was in closed period for auditing, expected retail accounts to make up half of its loan book over the next three to five years from 38 percent now.\nIn 2016, lending climbed 4.5 percent, once the effect of the naira devaluation that year was stripped out.\nFidelity increased pretax profit 65 percent to 16.24 billion naira in the nine-months to September.\nNigerian treasury yields, which fetched as much as 18 percent last year, now trade at about 13 percent after the government raised eurobonds to pay off debt instead of rolling them over as it has done in the past.\nThe bank had 4 million retail and business accounts, Joshua said, saying 400,000 new accounts were added in the past 12 months.\nHe said a third of customers were now using smartphones for transactions such as funds transfer and paying utility bills rather than going through a branch, a move he said created savings for the bank and boosted income.\nShares in Fidelity, which have gained 14 percent so far this year, rose 5 percent on Monday to 2.94 naira, giving it a market value of 85.2 billion naira ($279 million). The stock climbed 193 percent last year.\nReporting by Chijioke Ohuocha; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:08:12.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
