The environment remains difficult with everyone fighting to drive traffic amidst a changing consumer environment. We have many initiatives in place to make Kona Grill the destination of choice for guests. These initiatives are framed around our mission to make every experience exceptional for our guests,” said Berke Bakay, President and CEO of Kona Grill.\n“To lead the turnaround, we hired Jim Kuhn as our chief operating officer in December. In Jim’s first three months with us, he has brought a renewed focus on service, hospitality and cleanliness and has re-energized our company with his relentless pursuit of elevating all aspects of restaurant operations. We are evaluating what we do and who we use to provide products and services in order to generate cost-savings and efficiencies within our restaurants. We are starting to see the benefits of these initiatives in our 2018 operating margins,” he continued.\n“We recently amended our credit facility to among other things, provide relief on our financial covenants to allow time for the many initiatives to take effect. We continue to evaluate our underperforming restaurants and have discussions with our landlords regarding rent abatement or strategic alternatives for certain restaurants. We estimate that the eight restaurants that we have taken impairment charges for over the past two years had a 360 basis point negative impact on our four-wall margins for the fourth quarter of 2017,” he continued.\n“We currently have three international units open as our partners in the UAE and Canada opened the first restaurant in their respective countries during the fourth quarter. We are excited about the potential to grow our brand through franchising and continue to engage in discussions with potential partners in several countries,” he concluded.\nConference Call\nKona Grill will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS (In thousands) (Unaudited) We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Within our press release, we make reference to non-GAAP EBITDA and Restaurant Operating Profit. Restaurant Operating Profit is defined as revenue minus cost of sales, labor, occupancy and restaurant operating expenses. Restaurant Operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, asset impairment charge or preopening expenses. We believe Restaurant Operating Profit is an important component of financial results because: (i) it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance; and (ii) we use Restaurant Operating Profit as a key metric to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared to that of our competitors.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus the sum of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus unusual or non-recurring items, such as impairment, lease termination and exit costs and write-off of deferred financing costs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because: (i) we believe it is a useful measure for investors to assess the operating performance of our business; (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness; and (iii) we use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance and compare our performance to that of our competitors.
