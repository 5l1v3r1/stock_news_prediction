While that was down 12.4 percent from last year, it made for a 4.4 percent monthly gain compared with January.\nThe stabilization in prices was driven by higher costs for condominiums. Price growth is expected to be concentrated in condos and townhomes as the year goes on given their relative affordability, the report said.\nThe home price index, preferred by analysts because it smoothes out the composition of sales, was up 3.2 percent from the year before.
