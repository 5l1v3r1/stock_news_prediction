They’re seeking class action status in their complaint. \nThe case was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California. \nFacebook on Sunday acknowledged it has logged the call and text history of some users who have Android phones, but said it only did so when those users opted in. The company says it has not sold that data to third parties. \nShares of Facebook are down 18% since Mar. 16, and the company is facing a growing movement among users who are deleting their accounts . It’s not just individuals, either. Elon Musk has pulled the Facebook pages of Tesla and Space X earlier this week and Playboy Magazine deleted its page Wednesday.
