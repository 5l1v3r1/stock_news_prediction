Still, government investment is likely to remain a key driver of the economy.\n“The new target deficit ratio is lower than what most expected... as it has not been cut since 2012,” Everbright Sun Hung Kai, a Beijing-based investment bank, said in a note.\nThe 2018 goal bolsters the view“there will not be a further stimulus this year,” it said.\n“However, we expect infrastructure construction growth to moderate, not collapse. The government is able to handle a cut in the deficit ratio without sacrificing state-led investment.”\nDespite the lower deficit target, the absolute amount of the deficit is expected to be unchanged at 2.38 trillion yuan ($375.92 billion), according to the finance ministry’s annual budget report.\nThe Ministry of Finance said the budget deficit ratio“is commensurate with China’s steady economic growth and sound fiscal operations, and will expand the space for long-term development and macro regulation”.\nGrowth in government revenue is forecast to slow this year to 6.1 percent from 7.4 percent, with spending projected to rise 7.6 percent compared with last year’s 7.7 percent.\nChina supplements its general budgets with various types of funds, allowing it to hit its budget deficit ratio targets despite differing headline numbers.\nLast year’s transfers to government revenue topped trillion yuan and included“carryover funds”,“surplus funds”, and other sources.\nChina’s deficit last year after including transfers from other sources came in spot-on target at 2.38 trillion yuan, the finance ministry said. Excluding the transfers, official data indicate last year’s deficit was 3.08 trillion yuan.\nThe finance ministry said it will“step up efforts to restructure the debt of‘zombie enterprises’, and quicken the pace of debt-to-equity swaps carried out in a way consistent with market principles”.\nChina plans to“actively” resolve debt risk at the local government level and to increase the liquidity of local government bonds, the ministry report said.\n($1 = 6.3312 Chinese yuan)\nReporting by Elias Glenn and Stella Qiu; Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T11:40:47.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
