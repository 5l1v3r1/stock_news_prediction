He will report to VF’s Chairman, President and CEO, Steve Rendle and will serve on the company’s Senior Leadership Team.\nThe appointment to Vice President, Strategic Projects marks a return to VF for Murray. He served as President of the company’s Vans ® brand for five years following VF’s acquisition of the brand in 2004. He later served as President of VF’s Action Sports coalition.\n“As VF continues to transform into a more agile, consumer-centric organization, it’s essential that we maintain a sharp focus on advancing the high-priority, strategic initiatives that will accelerate growth for our brands and create value across our global enterprise,” said Rendle. “Steve is an ideal leader to provide this level of sharp focus for VF.
