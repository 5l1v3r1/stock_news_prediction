Some 22.5 percent of the grid’s total output, or 18,000 megawatts, have been affected.\n“That line was inaugurated recently and was not yet operating at full capacity,” the country’s mining and energy minister, Fernando Coelho Filho, told journalists in Brasilia. “There was a surge in power ... and the line fell out of operation.”\nThe transmission line that failed is the responsibility of state-run utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, commonly known as Eletrobras, and China State Grid Corp Ltd. Neither company responded to requests for comment.\nIn the country’s poor north and northeast, the system had “practically collapsed,” Luiz Eduardo Barata, head of national grid operator ONS, told journalists.\nElsewhere in the country the impact was less severe, he said, and service had been resumed in the country’s southern and southeastern region’s shortly after 4 p.m., where spotty outages were reported.\nReporting by Luciano Costa and Leonardo Goy; Writing by Gram Slattery; Editing by James Dalgleish and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-22T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:31:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
