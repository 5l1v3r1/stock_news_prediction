In response, China’s Commerce Ministry announced Friday that $3 billion in U.S. goods would be subject to higher tariffs and said it is preparing more actions.\nA prolonged trade war could hit growth in the U.S. and derail a nascent global recovery, analysts said. Those concerns tend to benefit the yen, a popular destination during times of political or economic uncertainty.\nPolitical worries also gave the yen a boost after Mr. Trump on Thursday named former Ambassador John Bolton as his new national security adviser . Mr. Bolton, who won’t need Senate confirmation to take the job, has been a controversial figure in Washington, D.C., and has pressed the White House to take tougher positions on Iran and North Korea.\nInvestors are growing concerned that the Trump administration is increasingly relying on advice from policy hawks and that there remain fewer voices of reason with every staffing shake-up at the White House, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, in a note to clients.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently down 0.3% to 83.40.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:32:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
