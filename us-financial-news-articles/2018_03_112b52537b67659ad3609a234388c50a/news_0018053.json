It was also targeting overseas firms operating in New Zealand, particularly in the insurance, travel and industrial sectors.\n“As part of NZX’s refreshed strategy, we made a strategic decision to shift our focus away from the regional stock exchange model, instead we focus on creating strong partnerships with global exchanges,” Chairman James Miller said.\nThe stock exchange signed a similar deal in January with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.
