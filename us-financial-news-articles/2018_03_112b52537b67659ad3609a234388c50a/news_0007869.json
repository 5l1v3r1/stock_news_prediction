All statements, other than historical facts are . Such statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding anticipated commercial launch of our Habeo™ therapy and ATI-0918 drug candidate (and timing thereof); completion of manufacturing activities necessary to submit an MAA to the EMA for our ATI-0918 drug candidate; our strategy for addressing our capital requirements through various activities, including operational efficiencies, revenue growth and accessing the capital markets; receipt of feedback from, and related discussions with, BARDA regarding our future contractual relationship with BARDA (and proposed BARDA funding of our thermal burn pilot trial); and our expected 2017 cash burn and reasons for the anticipated cash burn; are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and financial position to differ materially. Some of these risks include clinical, pre-clinical and regulatory uncertainties, such as those associated with conduct and completion of the proposed thermal burn trial, as well as the Company’s anticipated submission of data to the EMA from the previously completed bioequivalence trial for ATI-0918. Specifically, the Company faces risks in the collection and results of the STAR scleroderma and RELIEF thermal burn trials, including enrollment risks, the risks that clinical data from one or more of these clinical trials will fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy of our product candidates, and risks that insufficiently positive clinical data will adversely affect government funding, regulatory approval pathways and commercial prospects for our cell therapy (e.g., Habeo), and nanomedicines product candidates. We also face risks that investigator-initiated trials using our Cytori Cell Therapy fail to fully enroll or otherwise are conducted in a manner that ultimately is injurious to our business. We also face the risk that we will be unable to successfully manufacture our ATI-0918 drug candidate in time to meet our projected timeline for submission of an MAA to the EMA, or at all. We also face risks regarding execution of our managed access program (MAP) strategy in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), including risks relating to our efforts to ethically direct prospective scleroderma patients into our MAP program. Some of these risks also include risks relating to regulatory challenges the Company faces (including the U.S., EU, China, Japan and its other key geographies) due to a number of factors including novelty of the Company’s technology and product offerings, changes in and /or evolution of regulatory approaches to cellular therapeutics like the Company’s in its key geographies, and similar matters. The Company also faces risks relating to achievement of the Company’s financial goals (including balancing capital requirements and meeting projected 2017 operating cash burn guidance). It is possible that the Company could face unexpected revenue shortfalls, expense increases or other occurrences that adversely affect our cash burn and cash management strategies. Further the Company face risks pertaining to dependence on third party performance and approvals (including performance of investigator-initiated trials, outcome of BARDA’s review of the Company’s proposed burn wound trial pursuant to its contract with BARDA, and outcome of the EMA’s review of our ATI-0918 MAA); performance and acceptance of the Company’s products in clinical studies/trials and in the marketplace (including commercial acceptance of the Company’s products in Japan and other markets where are products are commercially available, and similar risks); material changes in the marketplace that could adversely impact revenue projections (including changes in market perceptions of the Company’s products, and introduction of competitive products); unexpected costs and expenses that could adversely impact liquidity and shorten the Company’s current liquidity projections (which could in turn require the Company to seek additional debt or equity capital sooner than currently anticipated); the Company’s reliance on key personnel; the Company’s ability to identify and develop new programs or assets to expand the Company’s clinical pipeline; the right of the U.S. government (BARDA) to cut or terminate further support of the thermal burn injury program (including any decision by BARDA not to proceed with our proposed thermal burn trial, assuming FDA approval of the Company’s IDE submission); the Company’s abilities to capitalize on its internal restructuring and achieve break-even or profitability (or to continue to reduce our operating losses); and other risks and uncertainties described under the \"Risk Factors\" in Cytori's Securities and Exchange Commission Filings, included in the Company’s annual and quarterly reports.\nThere may be events in the future that the Company is unable to predict, or over which it has no control, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may change in the future. The Company assumes no responsibility to update or revise any to reflect events, trends or circumstances after the date they are made unless the Company has an obligation under U.S. Federal securities laws to do so.\nCYTORI THERAPEUTICS, INC.
