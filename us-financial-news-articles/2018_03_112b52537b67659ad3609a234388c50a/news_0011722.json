Big trade imbalance!”\nTrump’s threat comes amid mounting transatlantic tension on trade.\nOn Thursday, Trump said the United States would apply duties of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum to protect domestic producers.\nThe next day, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told German television that“We will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson (motorcycles), on bourbon and on blue jeans - Levis.”\nCanada also has said it will retaliate for any tariffs on steel and aluminum.\nTrump had tweeted on Friday that trade wars are good and“easy to win,” roiling U.S. financial markets.\nIn January 2017, Trump warned German car companies he would impose a border tax of 35 percent on vehicles imported to the U.S. market.\nReporting by Mike Stone Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T00:21:07.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
