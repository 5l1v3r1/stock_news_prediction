(Nasdaq:BSET) announced today its results of operations for its fiscal quarter ended February 24, 2018.\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Highlights\nConsolidated sales were $110.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $105.9 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 4.1%. Operating income for the quarter was $2.1 million or 1.9% of sales as compared to $4.7 million or 4.4% of sales for the prior year quarter. Wholesale sales were $63.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $62.0 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 1.8%. Wholesale operating income for the quarter was $3.1 million or 4.9% of sales as compared to $5.9 million or 9.5% of sales for the prior year quarter. Company-owned store sales were $64.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $61.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 5.0%. This included a comparable store sales increase of 3.3% compared to the prior year quarter. Comparable store operating income was $0.8 million or 1.3% of sales for the current year quarter as compared to a loss of $0.1 million or -0.2% of sales for the prior year quarter. Total retail operating loss was $1.5 million or -2.3% of sales for the quarter as compared to a loss of $1.3 million or -2.2% of sales for the prior year quarter. Comparable store written sales for the quarter decreased 2.5%. Revenue for Zenith was $25.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $22.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, a 13% increase. Zenith’s operating income for the quarter was $0.3 million or 1.3% of sales as compared to an operating loss of $0.2 million or -1.0% of sales for the prior year quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $0.9 million or $0.09 per share as compared to net income of $2.9 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the prior year quarter. The current quarter loss included a one-time non-cash tax charge of $2.2 million arising from the re-measurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets due to the reduction in Federal corporate income tax rates enacted during the quarter. Excluding the effects of the deferred tax revaluation, net income would have been $1.3 million or $0.12 per diluted share.\n“We began 2018 with a challenging quarter as the startup expenses associated with our growth initiatives and rising material costs in our manufacturing segment converged to negatively affect our consolidated operating margin,” commented Rob Spilman, Chairman and CEO. “Although a large portion of these expenses were considered in our internal plan, the year over year diminution of margin was larger than expected. Consolidated revenue grew 4.1% to $110.3 million, largely driven by our corporate retail division and our Zenith logistics subsidiary. Wholesale revenue increased slightly as well. Initial shipments from our newly acquired Lane Venture division were immaterial as we spent the majority of the period moving inventory from the former owner’s facility and opening a new domestic manufacturing operation and warehouse.”\n“Looking ahead, we are focused on the successful implementation of our growth strategies for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019,” continued Spilman. “We opened one new store at the end of fiscal 2017 and three in the quarter just ended. We also opened another location at the beginning of the current quarter – a total of five stores in five months. We are excited about the long term opportunities that these stores present but we are incurring significant pre-opening and startup losses as a result. Our next new location opens in Coral Gables, Florida in July and another twelve are planned over the next five quarters including two relocations, three licensed stores, and our first Generation 3 prototype in Frisco, Texas this fall.”\nWholesale Segment\nNet sales for the wholesale segment were $63.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $62.0 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $1.1 million or 1.8%. This increase was driven by an 8.2% increase in furniture shipments to the open market (outside the Bassett Home Furnishings network), partially offset by a 2.9% decrease in furniture shipments to the Bassett Home Furnishings network compared to the prior year period. Wholesale shipments of accessories, a much smaller component of the Company’s wholesale revenues, increased 55% over the prior year quarter. Gross margins for the wholesale segment were 32.4% for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 35.2% for the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lower margins in the Bassett Custom Upholstery operations from continued higher materials costs coupled with lower absorption of fixed costs from lower volumes. Also lower margins in the imported Bassett Casegoods were primarily the result of higher sales levels of discontinued and discounted goods and higher container freight costs. Wholesale SG&A for the first quarter of 2018 was $17.4 million as compared to $15.9 million for the prior year period. SG&A as a percentage of sales increased to 27.6% as compared to 25.7% for the first quarter of 2017. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by one time acquisition and startup costs associated with the Lane Venture operation and higher digital marketing and other brand development costs. Operating income was $3.1 million or 4.9% of sales as compared to $5.9 million or 9.5% of sales in the prior year.\n“Margin improvement in our wholesale divisions has been the catalyst behind our strong performance over the past five years,” added Spilman. “Our domestically produced Bassett Custom Upholstery operations in particular have led the way with greater manufacturing efficiencies and growing profits. This quarter, a 1.0% decline in Bassett Custom Upholstery products sales coupled with a series of price increases from our raw material providers combined to represent the biggest factor behind the 280 basis point margin decline in our wholesale segment. Although we implemented a modest wholesale price increase on selected items in early January, we have continued to receive price hikes from our suppliers over the past few weeks. We are currently conducting an item-by-item review of our assortment to ascertain the effects of this escalation and will formulate appropriate actions including the consideration of a general across the board price increase. On the other hand, growth in our imported Club Level motion upholstery line partially offset domestic pressures as we continue to place those products with new independent retail dealers. As a result, total upholstery sales grew by 1.7% for the quarter.”\n“Combined sales in our wood operations declined by 1.0% for the period,” said Spilman. “Once again, sales of our domestically produced Bassett Custom Wood product lines grew nicely while we experienced revenue declines in our imported Bassett Casegoods division. Bassett Custom Wood benefited from the rollout of our new Bench Made oak product line and continued growth in our custom casual dining line. Despite overall declines in Bassett Casegoods revenue for the quarter, we are encouraged with the initial retail sales of the newly introduced Bassett Modern product range and note that sales trends for the division improved as the quarter progressed. We have plans to address more value oriented price points in Bassett Casegoods in the months ahead that we believe will complement the aspirational collections that we have emphasized over the past few seasons.”\n“Additional commentary regarding technology investments for the Bassett brand and the startup of our Lane Venture division are required to fully understand the quarter”, continued Spilman. “We are in implementation mode of the digitization of our product assortment to augment the interactive capabilities of our website as we prepare to launch our sectional upholstery configurator and our 3-D room planner later this year. This will ultimately result in augmented reality capabilities in the months to come. We are also enhancing our social media outreach to engage more consumers and we are investing in staff and technology to successfully execute these efforts. While we are very encouraged by customer reaction to our ownership of Lane Venture, we have borne significant expense both in the acquisition and the operational startup of the division since our purchase on December 22, 2017. We believe that the manufacturing model that we employ at Bassett will translate beautifully at Lane Venture and look forward to its full realization. This has meant moving fabric inventory from Mexico to North Carolina and establishing and staffing a domestic cut and sew platform in our geographical area. We have also added new field sales representatives and are in the process of a major showroom remodel and re-packaging of the brand at the Outdoor and Casual Show in Chicago this summer.”\nRetail Segment\nNet sales for the 63 Company-owned Bassett Home Furnishings stores were $64.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $61.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.1 million or 5.0%. The increase was due to a 3.3% increase in comparable store sales and a $1.2 million increase in non-comparable store sales.\nWhile the Company does not recognize sales until goods are delivered to the consumer, management tracks written sales (the retail dollar value of sales orders taken, rather than delivered) as a key store performance indicator. Written sales for comparable stores decreased by 2.5% for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nThe consolidated retail operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.5 million as compared to $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.2 million. The 53 comparable stores generated operating income of $0.8 million for the quarter, or 1.3% of sales, as compared to a loss of $0.1 million, or -0.2% of sales, for the prior year quarter. Gross margins for comparable stores were 50.6% for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 49.4% for the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to improved pricing strategies and product mix. SG&A expenses for comparable stores increased $0.8 million to $29.0 million or 49.3% of sales as compared to 49.6% of sales for the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-comparable stores generated sales of $5.8 million with an operating loss of $2.3 million as compared to sales of $4.6 million and an operating loss of $1.3 million in the prior year quarter. As part of the $2.3 million loss for the first quarter of 2018, the Company incurred $0.7 million in new store pre-opening costs, a decrease of $0.1 million from the prior year. In addition, the Company incurred $0.7 million of post opening startup losses compared to no post opening startup losses in the first quarter of 2017. As previously stated, the Company’s retail expansion is initially costly. However, the Company believes that site selection and new store presentation will generally result in locations that operate at or above a retail break-even level within a reasonable period of time following store opening.\n“The big news around our Corporate Retail segment is the expansion of our store count after several years of operating approximately 60 stores in the fleet,” said Spilman. “As mentioned, this effort comes with substantial upfront effects on earnings. For the quarter, the combined pre-opening and startup losses for 2018 were $600,000 greater than last year. On a parallel track with the expansion of our network is the ongoing refinement of the store itself. The new Generation 3 prototype will be the fusion of the technological gateways to Bassett and a highly interactive in store design experience. The tactile elements of the furniture purchase will be on full display with an array of fabric and wood, metal, stone, and accessory samples housed in a new fixturing template that will bring the products that consumers first encounter on the web or their phone to life in the store. Like many retailers, we have confronted declining physical store traffic over the past year. A higher rate of conversion and an increase in the value of the average sale has enabled us to keep our comparable store sales on a positive trajectory. This quarter, our delivered retail comps increased by 3.3% although our written sales did decline by 2.5% compared to last year’s 3.7% written increase. Our mission is to provide the consumer with a uniquely Bassett journey that features seamless access to our customizable products and capabilities that are showcased in a beautiful destination that offers a personalized level of service second to none.”\nLogistical Services Segment\nRevenue for Zenith was $25.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $22.3 million for 2017, an increase of $2.9 million or 13.1%. Revenues to both Bassett and non-Bassett customers were higher quarter over quarter. Zenith’s operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $24.9 million or 98.7% of revenue as compared to $22.7 million or 101% for the first quarter of 2017. This resulted in operating profit of $0.3 million or 1.3% of sales for the current quarter as compared to a loss of $0.2 million or -1.0% of sales for the prior year quarter. This operating profit increase was primarily due to improved load efficiency in the middle mile operation resulting in higher revenue per mile partially offset by increased fuel costs.\nAbout Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc.\nBassett Furniture Industries, Inc.
