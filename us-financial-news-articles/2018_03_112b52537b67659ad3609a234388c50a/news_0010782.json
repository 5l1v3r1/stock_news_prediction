He referenced a new software tool from Alphabet's cloud unit, Google Cloud, that helps health institutions pull together important medical data.\nDespite these efforts, he described the health care ecosystem as still being stuck in the \"stone age,\" given its reliance on ancient technology such as fax machines and pagers.\nTo combat that, he encouraged the attendees at the HIMSS healthcare conference to consider moving to the cloud and hire more engineers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T07:43:15.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
