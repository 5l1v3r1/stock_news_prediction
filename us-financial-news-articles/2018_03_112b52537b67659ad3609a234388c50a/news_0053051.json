All three major U.S. stock indexes declined on Tuesday, as concerns about regulation of social media and autonomous vehicles led to a sell-off in technology shares. However, the losses were expected to be capped by gains in the materials stocks, likely to benefit from a strengthening in metals prices. The local share price index futures fell about 1 percent or 60 points to 5,758, a 74.3-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark added 0.7 percent on Tuesday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.6 percent or 47.4 points to 8,460.72 in early trade.
