It is due to give its latest assessment on March 20.\nThe GDP data added to a raft of upbeat economic news.\nThe KOF leading indicator, which points to the economy’s expected performance in around six months, rose to an unexpectedly high 108 points in February.\nEmployment remains solid, with non-farm payrolls up 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter. The jobless rate was just 3 percent in January on a seasonally adjusted basis.\nIndustrial orders rose by a fifth in the fourth quarter , and the tourism industry is booming again.\nEven with the economy throttling up, inflation remains subdued. Consumer prices rose 0.7 percent year on year in January, giving the SNB scope to extend its expansive monetary policy that relies on negative interest rates and currency intervention when needed to rein in the franc.\nThe strategy has paid off as the euro rose from below 1.06 francs a year ago to over 1.15 now.\nSNB monetary policy nevertheless appears to be on hold, said VB Bank economist Thomas Gitzel.\n“The SNB can be happy, the chapter of the Swiss franc’s overvaluation has been closed,” he added. “If the SNB pushed ahead with a more restrictive monetary policy, this would lead to a rise in the value of the franc.” (Editing by Catherine Evans)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:50:15.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
