Orphanages should be an option of last resort for children,” she added.\nThe government said its“Smart Volunteering” campaign will discourage citizens from taking part in“short-term, unskilled volunteering in overseas orphanages.”\nThe government pledged to work with state and territorial administrations, as well as universities, to ensure that students do not“unwittingly” take part in programs that exploit children.\nThe movement to stamp out orphanage tourism has gathered pace in Australia, with advocacy groups saying its popularity has seen a rising number of impoverished children taken from their homes.\nIn Cambodia, for instance, the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF said the number of orphanages is growing fast - even though about three out of four children living in them have at least one parent.\nCambodia last year launched a crackdown on bogus orphanages and said it aimed to return 3,500 children to their homes. Cambodian government data showed there were about 400 orphanages across the country, with over 16,000 children.\nThe increase in people taking up“voluntary tourism” has also exacerbated the sexual exploitation and trafficking of children across Southeast Asia, warned the Thailand-based charity ECPAT International.\n“This is an emerging and worrying trend,” its spokesman, Damian Kean, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“We are aware of several cases, for example, in Cambodia, where traveling sex offenders were able to use volunteering at an orphanage as a mean for gaining access to victims.”\nReporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
