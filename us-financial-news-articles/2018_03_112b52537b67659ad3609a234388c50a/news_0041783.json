Since 1998, AlphaTrust has provided its eSignature and document process automation technology to some of the world’s most trusted brands.\nAlphaTrust’s PRONTOSign™ is a next-generation eSignature and document process automation platform. PRONTOSign™ automates the creation of legally enforceable, permanent business records, which are the commercial and legal equivalent of paper records. The solution creates electronic signatures that comply with applicable laws and regulations around the world.\n“Digital transformation is drastically altering how the life insurance and financial services industry thinks about eSignature. Paper is undergoing an obsolescence, rapidly being replaced by automated solutions that meet the expectations of today’s digital customers,” said Tim Wallace, CEO, iPipeline. “The acquisition of AlphaTrust enables us to tightly integrate eSignature and document process automation into our platform for the industry. PRONTOSign™ will meet our customers’ immediate needs while being flexible enough to accommodate emerging business requirements and integrations. We expect to make PRONTOSign™ the industry standard within the next year.”\n“The AlphaTrust acquisition immediately provides iPipeline’s customers with new levels of flexibility and control. While competing products offer a single workflow to secure an eSignature, PRONTOSign™ can accommodate the more complex and robust document workflows used in the life insurance and financial services industry,” said Bill Brice, CEO, AlphaTrust. “We process millions of critical business transactions each year, and our solution can be deployed in a data center, embedded as part of a technology stack, or used as a service, with public and private cloud options. Customers seeking customization, rapid scalability, and strong support for application connectivity and integration will achieve more control, predictability and speed as they digitize and automate various document and signature processes with PRONTOSign™.”\n“Our ability to successfully execute strategic acquisitions allows us to continue to deliver the industry’s most extensive offering to meet the needs of agents, advisors and their digital consumers,” said Larry Berran, COO & CFO, iPipeline. “AlphaTrust brings document process automation and eSignature solutions that are fully compliant with North American, European and various Asia Pacific laws and regulations.
