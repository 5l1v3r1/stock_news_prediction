He is a seasoned SaaS and Software sales leader with over 20 years of progressive business development and sales leadership experience. Dave’s experience has centered around start up, turn-around and hyper-growth situations. He was the BC Director of Sales for Autotrader.ca for 3.5 years helping lead through a critical transformation of the company from print to digital. Online revenue grew dramatically in that time and the organization was sold for $750 million to a private equity firm in 2011. He then went on to become VP Sales and Business Development at Payfirma, one of Canada’s leading mobile payment providers. There he was responsible for leading the sales team to new heights and was in charge of pioneering the growth of the FI channel. Most recently he was head of sales at buddybuild which was acquired by Apple in January of this year. Dave’s customer centric approach and demonstrated ability to build high performing teams with leading tech companies will be key as we accelerate sales through this exciting and critical growth phase.\n“Dave is a known quantity with a track record and reputation for delivering on his numbers which is second to none. Hiring a VP of Sales is a very important milestone for Netcoins. Prior to our oversubscribed $14m raise in the fall, there was no sales or marketing team. Michael Vogel was the only employee. Despite that, because of the quality of Netcoins software, a run rate of $1m per month was able to be achieved. The business has now organically grown to ~$2m per month in revenue. Having Dave establish proper sales and marketing infrastructure, we are very excited to rapidly grow and expand the distribution of Netcoins Software,” said Netcoins CEO, Mark Binns.\nAbout the Company\nThe Company is in the business of developing software to better facilitate the purchase and sale of bitcoin for end-users. Netcoins enables the sale of bitcoin through its software at retail outlets, through individual agents and directly to clients purchasing in large quantities.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n“Mark Binns”\nMark Binns\nCEO and Director\nFor Investor Relations Inquiries please contact Skanderbeg Capital Advisors at 604 687 7130 or email mario@skanderbegcapital.com\nThe CSE does not accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCautionary Statement Regarding “Forward-Looking” Information\nThis information release contains certain forward-looking information.
