Stelco Holdings Inc ( STLC.TO ) emerged from bankruptcy protection last year and went public in November.\n“We are feeling blindsided, truly,” said Keanin Loomis, president of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamilton, the heart of Canada’s steel industry.“We’re a resilient town. We are on the rebound, but this will obviously have huge impact.”\nHe said Canada needs not just an exemption from the tariff, but a strategy to deal with new imports.\nImports rose in 2002 when the United States last brought in broad steel tariffs, exempting Canada.\nSteel and iron products represented 2 percent of Canadian exports last year, with 84 percent sent to the United States.\nArcelor Mittal ( MT.AS ) is the largest steel manufacturer in Canada, employing about 10,300 people with seven units in the country, according to the Canadian Steel Producers Association. In all, the industry accounts for 22,000 direct jobs and supports 100,000 jobs indirectly, said the association.\nReporting by Allison Martell; Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T06:06:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
