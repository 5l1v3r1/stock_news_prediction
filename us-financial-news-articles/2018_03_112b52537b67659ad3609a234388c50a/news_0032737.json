Importantly, we expect gross margin to expand and drive free cash flow above our long term target of 40 percent of revenue.”\nOther Quarterly Data (Dollars in millions, except percentages) Q1 18 Q4 17 Q1 17 Growth Rates Net revenue by segment: Q/Q Y/Y Wired infrastructure $ 1,875 35 % $ 2,146 45 % $ 2,084 50 % -13 % -10 % Wireless communications 2,210 41 1,796 37 1,175 29 23 % 88 % Enterprise storage 991 19 645 13 707 17 54 % 40 % Industrial & other 251 5 257 5 173 4 -2 % 45 % Total net revenue $ 5,327 100 % $ 4,844 100 % $ 4,139 100 % (Dollars in millions, except percentages) Q1 18 Q4 17 Q1 17 Growth Rates Non-GAAP net revenue by segment: Q/Q Y/Y Wired infrastructure (1) $ 1,879 35 % $ 2,150 45 % $ 2,087 50 % -13 % -10 % Wireless communications 2,210 41 1,796 37 1,175 28 23 % 88 % Enterprise storage 991 19 645 13 707 17 54 % 40 % Industrial & other (1) 251 5 257 5 180 5 -2 % 39 % Total non-GAAP net revenue $ 5,331 100 % $ 4,848 100 % $ 4,149 100 % (1) Non-GAAP data include the effect of acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments relating to licensing revenue.\nKey Statistics (Dollars in millions) Q1 18 Q4 17 Q1 17 Cash from operations $ 1,685 $ 1,959 $ 1,353 Depreciation $ 126 $ 117 $ 112 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets $ 1,054 $ 1,099 $ 999 Capital expenditures $ 220 $ 233 $ 325 Days sales outstanding (\"DSO\") 45 46 43 Inventory days on hand (\"DOH\") 64 73 77 Non-GAAP DSO 45 46 43 Non-GAAP Inventory DOH 67 74 78 Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Business Outlook\nBased on current business trends and conditions, the outlook for continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, ending May 6, 2018, is expected to be as follows:\nGAAP Reconciling Items Non-GAAP Net revenue $4,997M +/-$75M $3M $5,000M +/-$75M Gross margin 50.0% +/-1% $795M 66.0% +/-1% Operating expenses $1,375M $485M $890M Interest expense and other $114M - $114M Provision for income taxes $56M $47M $103M Diluted share count 427M 34M 461M\nNon-GAAP net revenue includes $3 million of licensing revenue not included in GAAP revenue, as a result of the effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions;\nNon-GAAP gross margin includes the effects of $3 million of licensing revenue, and excludes the effects of $765 million of amortization of intangible assets, $25 million of share-based compensation expense, $1 million of restructuring charges, and $1 million of acquisition-related costs;\nNon-GAAP operating expenses exclude $280 million of share-based compensation expense, $90 million of acquisition-related costs, $70 million of amortization of intangible assets, and $45 million of restructuring charges;\nNon-GAAP tax provision is $47 million higher than GAAP due to the tax effects of the projected reconciling items noted above; and\nNon-GAAP diluted share count includes the impact of the LP Units on an if-converted basis, which were not included in projected GAAP diluted share count because their effect is expected to be antidilutive, and excludes the impact of share-based compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods and not yet recognized in the Company’s financial statements, which would otherwise be assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method.\nCapital expenditures for the second fiscal quarter are expected to be approximately $190 million. For the second fiscal quarter, depreciation is expected to be $130 million and amortization is expected to be approximately $840 million.\nThe guidance provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release. Among other things, this guidance is based on an initial estimate of purchase accounting adjustments and allocations, all of which are subject to revision. The guidance also excludes the impact of any additional mergers, acquisitions and divestiture activity that may occur during the quarter. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material. The Company undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise any of these projections, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nInterim Dividend\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly, interim cash dividend of $1.75 per ordinary share. A corresponding distribution will also be paid by the Partnership, of which the Company is the General Partner, to holders of LP Units, in the amount of $1.75 per LP Unit.\nThe dividend and the distribution are both payable on March 29, 2018 to shareholders or unitholders of record, as applicable, at the close of business (5:00 p.m.) Eastern Time on March 22, 2018.\nFinancial Results Conference Call\nBroadcom Limited will host a conference call to review its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, ended February 4, 2018, and to provide guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Those wishing to access the call should dial (866) 310-8712; International +1 (720) 634-2946. The passcode is 7796628. A replay of the call will be accessible for one week after the call.

A webcast of the conference call will also be available in the “Investors” section of Broadcom’s website at www.broadcom.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net revenue, net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information includes the effect, where applicable, of purchase accounting on revenue, and excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, litigation settlements, debt-related costs, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on disposition of assets, income (loss) from discontinued operations and non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company’s underlying performance. However, internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company’s operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company’s competitors. The presentation of these and other similar items in Broadcom’s non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. Broadcom believes this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company’s on-going performance and has therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company’s on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release.\nAbout Broadcom Limited\nBroadcom Limited (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of digital and analog semiconductor connectivity solutions.
