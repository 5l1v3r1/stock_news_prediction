U.S. officials reportedly made their request in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping's top economic deputy last week.\nThat is very different than a tweet posted by Trump on Wednesday, in which he claimed to have asked for a $1 billion reduction in the annual trade deficit.\n\"Our relationship with China has been a very good one,\" Trump tweeted. \"We look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with.

Meanwhile, the United States' total trade deficit increased to a more than nine-year high during the first month of 2018.\nA $100 billion decrease in the U.S.-China trade deficit would represent a 26.7 percent reduction in the annual disparity, which totaled more than $375 billion in 2017. Trump's $1 billion figure represents less than 0.3 percent of that year's imbalance.\nThe request to Beijing comes amid a heated international debate on trade policy after Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports last Thursday.\nRead the entire WSJ story here .\nThomas Franck Investments Reporter ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T16:40:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
