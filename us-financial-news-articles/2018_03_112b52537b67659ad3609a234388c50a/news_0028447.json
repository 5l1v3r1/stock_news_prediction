(OTC: ICBU) Board of Directors announced today that the company is in negotiations to acquire valuable mining claims, which have gold and precious metal findings that can be extracted and mined. The company is looking at several targets to acquire that fit within the business space of the company's operations. It is estimated that these claims have recoverable Gold and Precious Metal assets in the amount of 500 million to 1 billion dollars. The company is currently doing its due diligence on the claims to make sure everything is in order. Once claims are acquired the company will have a 43-101 report prepared on the claims. This will give the company and its shareholders an accurate report on the mineral resources and the economic value of the claims.\nThe mining claims have the precious metal family of Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium and Rhodium as well as other metals. The company believes that the current mining operations that it already owns as well as others that it will be closing on soon have the expertise to mine the claims and extract the precious metals.
