The patented GreySpark technology will be integrated into the OPAQ Cloud platform and enable managed service providers (MSPs) and managed security services providers (MSSPs) to automate the assessment of midsize customers’ security architecture and regulatory compliance maturity.\nEffectively communicating the need for and value of security investments to business decision makers is often a challenge for MSPs and MSSPs. The integration of FourV’s risk and executive reporting platform now enables OPAQ channel partners to provide automated security metrics and key performance indicators to non-technical management in terms that are easy to understand.\n“The OPAQ Cloud platform already makes it simpler for service providers to deliver and manage Fortune 100-grade security for their midsize enterprise customers,” said Ken Ammon, Chief Strategy Officer of OPAQ Networks. “The integration of FourV Systems’ GreySpark further enables our partners to demonstrate to customers the value of the security services they are providing.”\n“OPAQ Networks shared our vision for automating security operations management, and we felt their focus on providing a turnkey, enterprise-grade solution for MSPs and MSSPs will revolutionize offerings in that market,” said Derek Gabbard, President of FourV Systems. “From a technical standpoint, GreySpark was a natural fit for the OPAQ Cloud platform. It provides a transparent overlay that gathers the intelligence and metrics service providers need to manage and report on the security and compliance posture of their customers to both IT and business leaders.”\nThe Power to Capture and Communicate Security Value to Customers\nManual security data collection, analysis and reporting is a high cost component for MSPs/MSSPs, and is difficult to scale across large customer bases. The acquisition of FourV Systems extends the OPAQ Cloud platform with automation and machine learning in a way that dramatically reduces the time and expense associated with manual reporting. OPAQ now arms service providers with metrics that transparently demonstrate the efficacy of security programs in the context of business and control frameworks including the NIST CSF, CIS, PCI, GDPR, the new Handbook for Election Infrastructure Security, and more.\nFourV’s technology also automates many security management operations, enhances managed detection and response (MDR) activities, and provides the following benefits for OPAQ channel partners:\nEnables MSPs/MSSPs to perform cost-effective performance assessments at scale Frees expensive security analyst resources from tedious report writing so they can focus on hunt and response activities Automates the gathering and analysis of distributed data sets necessary to produce continuous risk management and compliance reporting Streamlines compliance assessments and audits by mapping and visualizing controls to the corresponding NIST CSF operational security functions\nAbout the OPAQ Security-as-a-Service Cloud Platform\nThe OPAQ Cloud platform enables service providers to make best-of-breed network security capabilities accessible to midsize enterprises. It combines a private network backbone with next-generation firewall, web application firewall, DDoS mitigation, and software-defined segmentation capabilities that are powered by industry-leading security technologies and OPAQ intellectual property. OPAQ is the only company that offers this depth and breadth of security-as-a-service.\nAvailability\nThe OPAQ Cloud platform with FourV Systems’ GreySpark will be available in Spring 2018.\nAbout OPAQ Networks\nOPAQ Networks is the premier network security cloud company.
