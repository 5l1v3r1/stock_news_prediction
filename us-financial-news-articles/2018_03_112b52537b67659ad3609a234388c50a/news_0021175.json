It was a wild first few minutes at the Pepsi Center.\nComeau opened the scoring 1:45 into the clash by finishing off a 3-on-1 rush. He took a feed from Soderberg and deked Arizona goalie Darcy Kuemper before sliding home a backhand.\nThat just started the craziness, as Christian Dvorak pulled the Coyotes even 29 second later. Bernier didn’t stop the ring-around of the puck and it came to Richard Panik, who fired a long shot that Dvorak deflected home on his team’s first shot on net.\nBut just 27 seconds after that, Barrie put the Avs ahead 2-1. Nathan MacKinnon fed Barrie at the point, and his floating wrist shot made it through the maze.\nSoderberg then scored at the 4:22 mark of the opening frame to give the hosts a 3-1 edge. He tried to pass on a 2-on-1 rush, and his effort deflected off Panik and into the goal, giving the Avs three goals on four shots.\nPanik responded with a marker of his own with just under five minutes remaining in the second period to make it a one-goal game, but the Avs put down the hammer with a pair of goals midway through the third period.\nTyson Jost batted home a waist-high rebound for a power-play goal at 10:45 of the third period — giving Colorado man-advantage goals in seven consecutive games — and then Rantanen tallied at 12:40 to round out the scoring.\nMacKinnon collected two assists to give him 16 points (7-9-16) in an eight-game point streak. Barrie’s two points give him nine (4-5-9) in a six-game point streak.\nKuemper stopped 26 shots for the Coyotes.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-11T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T16:18:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
