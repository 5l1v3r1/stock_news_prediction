In a separate statement, DDMC said it had agreed to give PPTV right of priority in distribution deals.\n“It makes more sense for us to manage the rights, but Suning remains an important partner for us and PPTV still an important broadcasting channel,” said a DDMC executive who declined to be named. “Both parties look at the long-term gain, and what cooperation could bring.”\nIn 2015, a different subsidiary of DDMC represented Suning as agent in its negotiation with La Liga. Last June, DDMC and Suning said they set up a joint venture company to develop sports rights market.\nLast year, DDMC bought Super Sports Media for $500, giving it the TV rights to the English Premier League (EPL) in China.\nReporting by Pei Li and Ben Blanchard; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-31T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T19:23:17.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
