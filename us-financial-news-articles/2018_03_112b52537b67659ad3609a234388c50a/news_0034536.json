(“Verizon”) (NYSE:VZ) (NASDAQ:VZ) today announced that, in connection with the Group 1 Offers (as defined below), the Group 1 Waterfall Cap (as defined below) will be increased such that all of the 2.946% Notes due 2022 validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Participation Date (as defined below) will be accepted.\nIn addition, Verizon today announced the early participation results, as of 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on March 16, 2018 (the “Early Participation Date”), of its previously announced 13 separate offers to purchase for cash (i) up to an aggregate purchase price equal to the Group 1 Waterfall Cap of the outstanding series of notes listed in the first table below labeled “Group 1 Offers,” (collectively, the “Group 1 Notes”), and (ii) up to $1.5 billion aggregate purchase price of the outstanding series of notes listed in the second table below labeled “Group 2 Offers” (collectively, the “Group 2 Notes,” and together with the Group 1 Notes, the “Notes”). We refer to each offer to purchase a series of Notes for cash as an “Offer,” the offers to purchase the Group 1 Notes, collectively as the “Group 1 Offers,” the offers to purchase the Group 2 Notes, collectively as the “Group 2 Offers” and all the offers to purchase Notes, collectively as the “Offers.” The Offers are made on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated March 5, 2018, as amended by this press release (the “Offer to Purchase”).\nThe withdrawal rights for the Offers expired at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on March 16, 2018. The Offers will each expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on March 30, 2018, unless extended or earlier terminated by Verizon (the “Expiration Date”).\nVerizon’s obligation to accept Notes tendered in the Offers is subject to the terms and conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, including (i) the Acceptance Priority Procedures (as described in Verizon’s press release dated March 5, 2018 announcing the Offers (the “Launch Press Release”)), (ii) a cap on the total cash Verizon pays to purchase the Group 1 Notes validly tendered under the Group 1 Offers (excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (as defined below)) of, after today’s increase, approximately $1.9 billion) (the “Group 1 Waterfall Cap”), and (iii) a cap on the total cash Verizon pays to purchase the Group 2 Notes validly tendered under the Group 2 Offers (excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments) of $1.5 billion (the “Group 2 Waterfall Cap”).\nAll conditions to the Offers were deemed satisfied or waived by Verizon by the Early Participation Date. Accordingly, Verizon has elected to exercise its right to settle early all Group 1 Notes and Group 2 Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Participation Date and accepted for purchase, and the “Early Settlement Date” will be March 20, 2018. Since the aggregate purchase price of the Group 1 Notes (excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments) validly tendered at or prior to the Early Participation Date and accepted for purchase will meet the Group 1 Waterfall Cap, there will be no Final Settlement Date (as defined in the Launch Press Release) and no additional tenders of Notes will be accepted for purchase by Verizon after the Early Participation Date with respect to the Group 1 Notes. Since the aggregate purchase price of the Group 2 Notes (excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments) validly tendered at or prior to the Early Participation Date and accepted for purchase did not exceed the Group 2 Waterfall Cap, Verizon will, until the Expiration Date, continue to accept for purchase Group 2 Notes up to the Group 2 Waterfall Cap. Holders of the Group 2 Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Participation Date and prior to the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase subject to the terms and conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, will receive the applicable Tender Consideration (as defined in the Launch Press Release), which is equal to the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Participation Payment (each as defined in the Launch Press Release).\nVerizon was advised by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, as the Information Agent and the Tender Agent, that as of the Early Participation Date, the aggregate principal amounts of the Notes specified in the table below were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn:\nGroup 1 Offers Acceptance\nPriority\nLevel CUSIP/ISIN\nNumber(s) Title of Security Principal\nAmount\nOutstanding Principal Amount\nTendered as of the\nEarly\nParticipation Date Percentage of\nAmount\nOutstanding\nTendered as of\nthe Early\nParticipation\nDate 1 92343VDQ4/ 2.946% Notes due 2022 $3,194,253,000 $1,909,019,000 59.76% 92343VDM3/\nUSU9221AAS79 2 92343VAX2 4.600% Notes due 2021 $1,334,842,000 $ 426,610,000 31.96% 3 92343VBC7 3.500% Notes due 2021 $1,628,716,000 $ 353,562,000 21.71% 4 92343VCC6 3.450% Notes due 2021 $861,617,000 $ 322,843,000 37.47% 5 92343VDW1 3.125% Notes due 2022 $1,850,000,000 $ 859,874,000 46.48% 6 92343VCN2 3.000% Notes due 2021 $1,226,930,000 $ 295,985,000 24.12% 7 92343VBJ2 2.450% Notes due 2022 $1,464,954,000 $ 195,964,000 13.38% 8 92343VDG6 1.750% Notes due 2021 $873,757,000 $ 158,309,000 18.12% 9 92343VDX9 Floating Rate Notes due 2022 $1,400,000,000 $ 408,192,000 29.16%\nGroup 2 Offers Acceptance\nPriority\nLevel CUSIP/ISIN\nNumber (s) Title of Security Principal\nAmount\nOutstanding Principal Amount\nTendered as of the\nEarly\nParticipation Date Percentage of\nAmount\nOutstanding\nTendered as of\nthe Early\nParticipation\nDate 1 92343VCZ5 4.672% Notes due 2055 $5,499,999,000 $ 424,359,000 7.72% 2 92343VCX0 4.522% Notes due 2048 $5,000,000,000 $ 246,180,000 4.92% 3 92343VCM4 5.012% Notes due 2054 $5,500,001,000 $ 163,916,000 2.98% 4 92343VDS0/ 5.012% Notes due 2049 $4,072,197,000 $130,868,000 3.21% 92343VDP6/\nUSU9221AAT52 Promptly after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) today, March 19, 2018, Verizon will issue a press release specifying, among other things (i) the aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted in each Offer, (ii) the offer yield, which is the fixed spread for the applicable series of Fixed Rate Notes (as defined in the Launch Press Release) plus the yield of the specified Reference U.S. Treasury Security (as set forth in the Launch Press Release) for that series as of 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) today, March 19, 2018, and (iii) the Fixed Rate Note Total Consideration (as defined in the Launch Press Release) for each series of Fixed Rate Notes. On March 20, 2018, holders of Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Participation Date that are accepted for purchase by Verizon will receive the applicable Total Consideration, in cash, and an additional cash payment equal to accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes to, but not including, the relevant Settlement Date (as defined in the Launch Press Release) (the “Accrued Coupon Payment”).\nVerizon has retained Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co.
