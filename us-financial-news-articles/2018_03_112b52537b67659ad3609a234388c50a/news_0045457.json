Rugby Union - England - Eddie Jones Press Conference - Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain - January 17, 2018 England RFU CEO Steve Brown during the press conference Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs Either Manchester or Newcastle is the likely destination for one of the three to four games ahead of the tournament in Japan. “A Six Nations game is unlikely but an autumn test could be an option” said RFU chief executive Steve Brown. The RFU is keen to broaden support for the game around the country, and tests away from Twickenham, which is in west London, could become a regular feature of the rugby calendar. England last played a home game at a different venue in 2015 when they faced Uruguay in their final World Cup pool match at the City of Manchester stadium.
