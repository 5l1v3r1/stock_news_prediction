On Tuesday, Sessions announced that the federal government would seek reimbursement from major drug companies and distributors to recoup costs from the opioid epidemic. The Justice Department will file a “statement of interest” in consolidated litigation on opioids. It was not immediately clear whether, in his remarks at the summit, Trump was referring to that Justice Department action or pressing for further steps. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 42,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2016, the last year with publicly available data.
