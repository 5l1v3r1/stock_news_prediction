At this time that is all the information we have,” she wrote.\nRelatives went to police in Creston early on Friday to report the family had not returned from their vacation, the police said.\nAmy Marie Sharp poses for a selfie, with her son Sterling, daughter Adriana and husband Kevin, in this picture uploaded to Facebook on August 22, 2015.
