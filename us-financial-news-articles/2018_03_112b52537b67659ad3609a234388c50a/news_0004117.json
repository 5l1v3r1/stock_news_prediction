The year prior, 27,500 ounces were sold.\nSpot gold prices fell about 2 percent in February in a wild market ride that saw global stocks sell off sharply and then regain ground.\n“The U.S. Mint sold coins for about three percent over spot prices, so everybody went to the secondary market to buy where the premiums are very low,” said Walter Pehowich, executive vice president of investment services at Dillon Gage Metals.\nData showed the U.S. Mint sold 942,500 ounces of American Eagle silver coins in February, down 70.9 percent from the month before when 3.2 million ounces were sold. That was 22.4 percent lower than the year prior, when 1.2 million ounces were sold, according to the data.\nThe U.S. Mint sold 20,000 ounces of American Eagle platinum coins. It was the first time the U.S. Mint sold platinum coins since January 2017, when it sold the same amount.\nLast month, sales of U.S. Mint American Eagle gold coins marked their slowest January sales in 10 years. January silver coin sales fell to the lowest since 2009.\nReporting by Renita D.
