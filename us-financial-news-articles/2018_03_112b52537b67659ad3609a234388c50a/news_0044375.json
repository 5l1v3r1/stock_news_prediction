At the end of 2017, it also had 222,000 customers for its internet services.\nCellcom’s mobile subscriber base gained 0.6 percent in 2017 to 2.817 million.\nCEO Nir Sztern said the company would accelerate its deployment of a fibre optic network to customers’ homes that would provide Internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit “in order to cement ourselves as a dominant player in the fixed-line infrastructure market.”\nThe company said its board once again decided not to declare a dividend for the quarter given the intensified competition and to strengthen its balance sheet.\n$1 = 3.4903 shekels Reporting by Steven Scheer, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T12:02:27.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
