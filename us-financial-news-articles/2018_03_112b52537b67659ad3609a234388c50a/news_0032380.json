(NASDAQ: KALV), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors, today reported operational and financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended January 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased to have the second candidate from our oral hereditary angioedema portfolio in a Phase 1 trial as we continue to pursue a best-in-class therapy,” said Andrew Crockett, Chief Executive Officer of KalVista. “Our diabetic macular edema compound KVD001 is enrolling in a Phase 2 clinical trial for which we expect to see data in the second half of 2019. The cash position of KalVista continues to be sufficient to reach data readouts in both of these ongoing trials.”\nRecent Business Highlights:\nAnnounced initiation of two clinical trials: A Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KVD001 as a treatment for DME, as well as a Phase 1 trial for KVD900, the second clinical candidate in the HAE portfolio. KalVista also intends to bring at least one additional HAE drug candidate to the clinic before the end of 2018. KalVista’s Chief Scientific Officer, Edward Feener, Ph.D., presented at The International Symposium on Ocular Pharmacology and Therapeutics (ISOPT) on March 2, 2018, in Tel-Aviv, Israel.\nUpcoming Events:\nPresenting “A Novel Oral Plasma Kallikrein (PKal) Inhibitor KV123833 Blocks VEGF-Mediated Retinal Vascular Hyperpermeability in a Murine Model of Retinal Edema,” at The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) on May 1, 2018, in Honolulu, Hawaii.\nFiscal Third Quarter Financial Results:\nRevenue: Revenue was $2.3 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in revenue is primarily due to revenue recognized from the Merck option agreement. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $4.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, compared to $3.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in R&D expense is due to an overall increase in research activities, primarily driven by the KVD001 Phase 2 trial as well as spending on our other development programs. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $2.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, compared to $5.0 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.1 million decrease in professional fees and $0.7 million of severance and payroll expenses related to the share purchase transaction with Carbylan Therapeutics, Inc. in the prior year. Net Loss: Net loss was $5.2 million, or $(0.49) per basic and diluted share for the three months ended January 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $7.6 million, or $(1.03) per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2017. Cash: Cash and cash equivalents were $58.7 million as of January 31, 2018.\nAbout KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nKalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors for diseases with significant unmet need. The initial focus is on inhibitors of plasma kallikrein, which is an important component of the body’s inflammatory response and which, in excess, can lead to increased vascular permeability, edema and inflammation. KalVista has developed a proprietary portfolio of novel, small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitors initially targeting hereditary angioedema (HAE) and diabetic macular edema (DME). The Company has created a structurally diverse portfolio of oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors, and is advancing multiple drug candidates into Phase 1 clinical trials for HAE. KalVista’s most advanced program, an intravitreally administered plasma kallikrein inhibitor known as KVD001, has successfully completed its first-in-human study in patients with DME and began a Phase 2 clinical trial in 2017.\nFor more information, please visit www.kalvista.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
