On Friday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel might make a run at Broadcom to battle the Qualcomm deal.\nBroadcom opened the week up 3 percent on that report and spiked as much as 4 percent Tuesday. ( Intel CEO Brian Krzanich later bucked takeover rumors in an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer.)\nThen, on Tuesday, President Donald Trump ordered the immediate and permanent end of merger talks . On Wednesday, Broadcom called off its bid, and the stock shed as much as 2 percent Wednesday following the announcement.\nOn Thursday evening, Broadcom announced first-quarter earnings that beat estimates, but shares opened nearly 2 percent down Friday and finished the day down almost 5 percent.\nThe stock is up nearly 15 percent in the last 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T22:38:48.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
