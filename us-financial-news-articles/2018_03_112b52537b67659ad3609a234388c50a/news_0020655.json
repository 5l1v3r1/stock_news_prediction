( http://bit.ly/2Id7pYh )\nAutonomous vehicles offer a multi-billion-dollar opportunity to remake urban transportation systems, and companies ranging from Tesla Inc and Apple Inc to traditional car makers such as Ford and General Motors are vying to dominate the market.\nWaymo, which is among the leaders for this technology, expects autonomous vehicles to be able to take over longer distance trucking in the coming years, while allowing human drivers to handle local pickup and delivery routes.\n\"If you are in the Atlanta area, look for a bright blue Waymo truck making a run,\" Waymo said.
