(Nasdaq: VSAT). CPI ASD will acquire Viasat's 6m to 18m multi-band antennas, providing a valuable extension of CPI ASD's larger-diameter antenna product line, while enabling Viasat to focus on antenna and communications technologies for the growing broadband services market. The purchase price for the antennas was not disclosed.\nPer the agreement, Viasat will transfer a range of limited-motion antennas at sizes including 6m, 7.3m, 9.1m, 11.3m, 13.5m and 16/18m, plus a 3.9m truck-mounted antenna, all designed for multi-band operation at C, Ku and DBS frequency bands. These products will be integrated into the CPI ASD satcom product line, which currently extends from nomadic 2.5m antennas up to 9.4m multi-band earth stations. CPI ASD will manufacture the large-diameter antenna products at its facilities in Whitby, Ontario, Canada.\nThe sale of the limited-motion GEO Satcom antennas will allow Viasat to exit a non-core business in antenna manufacturing to focus on its Ka-band services business and related technologies. As part of the agreement, CPI will serve as a source for Viasat in the fulfillment of satellite ground system orders.\n\"Viasat has an outstanding reputation for innovation, and its large-diameter satcom antenna products and technology are a natural complement to those offered by CPI's Antenna Systems Division,\" said CPI ASD president Tony Russell. \"Adding their proven products to CPI Antenna Systems Division's portfolio will allow CPI to expand our product line to address the broadest range of customer's needs for high-precision satcom antenna systems.\"\nKevin Harkenrider, president, Commercial Networks at Viasat commented, \"Our large-diameter product line has demonstrated years of consistent success in the market and will now fit squarely into CPI ASD's product roadmap and growth objectives. With our focus transitioning to new broadband markets, we see this deal as a win-win for both companies.\"\nThe agreement is focused on the purchase of antenna technologies and is not expected to have an impact on employee headcount at either company.\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close within thirty days.\nAbout Communications & Power Industries\nCommunications & Power Industries (CPI) is a global manufacturer of electronic components and subsystems focused primarily on communications and defense markets.
