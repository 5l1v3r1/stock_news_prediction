It does not reflect the Group's true intrinsic business worth or its prospects. We strongly advise shareholders to take no action,\" Smurfit Kappa chairman Liam O'Mahony said in a statement.\n\"The Board believes that it is in the best interests of all stakeholders for the Group to pursue its future as an independent company.\"\nIt did not disclose the detailed terms of the offer and said it was responding without the consent of International Paper.\nTraders said Smurfit Kappa's shares were expected to open 7-10 percent higher on the back of the approach.\nSmurfit Kappa, which operates in 34 countries in Europe and the Americas, recorded a slight rise in full-year earnings to 1.24 billion euros ($1.5 billion) last year after a strong fourth quarter. It said on Tuesday that the underlying positive trading conditions had continued into 2018.\nAs part of its full-year results, it announced an acceleration of its investment programme that it said would improve its market position between 2018 and 2021.\nInternational Paper's market capitalization is almost three times that of Smurfit Kappa at $24.1 billion.\nThe Memphis-based group combined its North America consumer packaging business with Graphic Packaging Holding Co in a deal that valued the International Paper division at $1.8 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T12:15:16.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
