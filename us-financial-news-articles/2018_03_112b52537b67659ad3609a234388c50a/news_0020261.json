It would then carry forward the remaining 54 million euros in profits.\n“In order to withstand the competition in the pharmaceuticals market, Stada must be able to invest in R&D, new products, technologies and markets,” the company said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe proposal is subject to approval at its annual meeting.\nIt also published 2017 results, with sales up 8 percent, but with reported EBITDA up just 1 percent to 363.8 million euros due to costs involved with the takeover by Bain and Cinven. Adjusted EBITDA rose 9 percent to 433.9 million euros and it said it expects an increase to around 480 million euros, with a 5 percent margin either side of that number, for 2018.
