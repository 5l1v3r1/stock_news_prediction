The Nikkei average dropped 0.15 percent to 21,791 while the broader Topix shed 0.1 percent to 1,739.21 as their rally on Monday driven by strong U.S. jobs data ran out of gas. Steelmakers fell 1.2 percent, while transport equipment makers lost 0.9 percent, extending their underperformance since the U.S. tariffs were announced on March 1. Some market participants say a political scandal engulfing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâ€™s government is raising doubts about his ability to pursue economic reform, undermining stock market sentiment.
