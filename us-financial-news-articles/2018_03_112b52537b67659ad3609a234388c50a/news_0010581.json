(NYSE: ARE), an urban office real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") uniquely focused on collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 90 cents per common share for the first quarter of 2018. The dividend is payable on April 16, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 29, 2018. The common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2018 of 90 cents per common share represents an increase of 7 cents, or 8 percent, over the first quarter of 2017.\n\"We are very pleased to announce the quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of 90 cents per common share for the first quarter of 2018. The dividend allows the Company to share our continued high-quality, strong and increasing cash flows from operations with our common shareholders while we retain significant cash flows from operating activities for reinvestment into our highly leased pipeline of development and redevelopment of new Class A properties. Additionally, our funds from operations payout ratio (quarterly common stock dividend divided by quarterly funds from operations) remains favorably low at 61 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Growth in net cash flows provided by operating activities after dividends continues to generate additional opportunities to grow our quarterly cash dividend per common share while we maintain a low funds from operations payout ratio,\" said Joel S.
