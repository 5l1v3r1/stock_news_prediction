With 130 million Facebook users, Brazil comes behind India with 250 million and the United States with 230 million. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said his company has a responsibility to stop fake news that could affect elections. \n\"There's a big election in India this year, there's a big election in Brazil, there are big elections around the world, and you can bet that we are really committed to doing everything that we need to make sure that the integrity of those elections on Facebook is secured,\" he said in a Wednesday interview with CNN. \nFake news, including stories posted on Facebook, and their potential to interfere in the coming elections is a growing concern in Brazil.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T12:21:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
