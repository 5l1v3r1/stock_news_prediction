If we can't, we don't deserve it,\" said the advertisement, which appeared in plain text on a white background with a tiny Facebook logo.\nThe world's largest social media network is coming under growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States, and is trying to repair its reputation among users, advertisers, lawmakers and investors.\nThis follows allegations that the British consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to users' information to build profiles of American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.\nU.S. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press\" on Sunday that Facebook had not been \"fully forthcoming\" over how Cambridge Analytica had used Facebook data.\nWarner repeated calls for Zuckerberg to testify in person before U.S. lawmakers, saying Facebook and other internet companies had been reluctant to confront \"the dark underbelly of social media\" and how it can be manipulated.\nGetty Images Founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg 'Breach of Trust' Zuckerberg acknowledged that an app built by a university researcher had \"leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014.\"\n\"This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,\" Zuckerberg said, reiterating an apology first made last week in U.S. television interviews.\nFacebook shares tumbled 14 percent last week, while the hashtag #DeleteFacebook gained traction online.\nThe Reuters/Ipsos online poll found that 41 percent of Americans trust Facebook to obey laws that protect their personal information, compared with 66 percent who said they trust Amazon.com Inc, 62 percent who trust Alphabet Inc's Google, 60 percent for Microsoft Corp.\nThe poll was conducted from Wednesday through Friday and had 2,237 responses.
