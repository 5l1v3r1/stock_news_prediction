In addition to taking this step with BMO this year we’ve also taken decisive steps to strengthen our management team and our ability to grow. Angela Rivera and David Finn are already having a positive impact and this new partnership with BMO will better position us to execute our strategy in 2018 and beyond.”\n“This new banking relationship will allow us to optimize our capital structure to align both our business and financial strategies, focusing on long term growth for the Company,” stated Paul Anthony, CFO of CynergisTek. “With BMO, we will have a partner who can bring added advisory services which will be essential as we execute on our strategic initiatives.
