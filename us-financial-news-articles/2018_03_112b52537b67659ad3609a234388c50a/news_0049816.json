REUTERS/Rashid Umar Abbasi/File Photo \nThe lawsuit alleged the board of Tesla breached its duties to shareholders by approving the SolarCity deal. \nTesla bought solar panel installer SolarCity for $2.6 billion in an all-stock deal in 2016. Musk was then biggest shareholder in both Tesla and SolarCity, and his SolarCity shares were converted to $500 million of Tesla shares. \nIt is “conceivable that Musk, as a controlling stockholder, controlled the Tesla board” during the SolarCity deal, the judge said. \n“We do not agree with the decision and will be taking appropriate next steps,” a Tesla spokesperson told Reuters. \n“It’s important to emphasize that this was a motion to dismiss in which the court was required to assume as true all of the allegations that are made in the complaint.” Reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T00:55:20.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
