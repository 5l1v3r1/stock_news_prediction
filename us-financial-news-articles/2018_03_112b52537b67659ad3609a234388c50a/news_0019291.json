But like Cohn, Kudlow has said he's no fan of the president's plan to impose broad import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.\n\"I don't like blanket tariffs,\" Kudlow told CNBC, where he is a senior contributor.\nKudlow said sometimes \"targeted tariffs\" can work in getting the true culprit's attention. \"I would have started with China,\" he argued. \"Go after China. Canada is not our enemy.\"\nWall Street wants to know whether Canada and Mexico would be exempted from the tariffs. Negotiators for those two nations and the United States are currently trying to overhaul the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.\nWhile there's been no confirmation from the White House on whether such exemptions are in the works, Trump signaled an openness to them if a new NAFTA deal can be reached.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
