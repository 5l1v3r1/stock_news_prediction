Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell is watched by a security guard and an Australian police officer as he leaves Melbourne Magistrates' Court in Australia, March 19, 2018. AAP/Stefan Postles/via REUTERS \nPell’s lawyer said the police operation set up in 2013 failed to find any accuser until a year later, and when police did identify accusers, they failed to follow normal procedures in seeking corroboration for their allegations. \n“Operation Tethering targeted Cardinal Pell, it was specific to Cardinal Pell?” Pell’s lawyer Robert Richter asked a police witness. \n“That’s my understanding,” Victoria Police Detective Superintendent Paul Sheridan told the court. \n“It was commenced as an intel probe into what offences might have occurred,” Sheridan later said. \nKey people who could have helped corroborate some of the evidence were not questioned until after police laid charges in June 2017, Richter said. \n“That’s astonishing in a serious investigation of a very, very high profile suspect,” he told the court. \nThe detective who had first contact with some of Pell’s accusers, David Rae, told the court he did not take notes from his first phone calls with them. He agreed with Richter’s assertion that as a result there was no record that, in some instances, their allegations differed from their sworn written statements to police. \nSome of Pell’s accusers had made much more serious allegations about earlier sexual offences against them by other people in the church, but police decided not to pursue those, Richter told the court. \nSheridan said he did not know why those allegations were not pursued by the police. \nThe pre-trail hearing is due to end on Thursday. \nPell, 76, was summoned by Australian police in 2017 to face charges of historical sexual offences. Details of the charges associated with multiple accusers have not been made public. \nPell’s lawyers have said he will plead not guilty to all charges. He is not required to enter a plea unless the magistrate determines there is cause for a full trial.
