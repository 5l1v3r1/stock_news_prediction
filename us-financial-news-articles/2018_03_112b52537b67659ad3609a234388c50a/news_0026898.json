(\"CGNT\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CGNT) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by LABORIE Medical Technologies, Inc. (\"LABORIE\"). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $3.85 in cash for each CGNT share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether CGNT's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $5.00 per share, or $1.15 above the offer price. Additionally, the Company recently issued a press release preliminarily announcing positive results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. It reported that it anticipated preliminary and unaudited revenue of $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which would reflect annual increase of approximately 17% when compared to the figures reported in the same period of the prior year.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether CGNT's Board acted in the best interests of CGNT's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own CGNT shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/cogentix-medical-inc/ .\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-investigates-cogentix-medical-inc-acquisition-300614726.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP", "external_links": ["http://www.weisslawllp.com/cogentix-medical-inc/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-investigates-cogentix-medical-inc-acquisition-300614726.html"], "published": "2018-03-15T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T20:12:38.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
