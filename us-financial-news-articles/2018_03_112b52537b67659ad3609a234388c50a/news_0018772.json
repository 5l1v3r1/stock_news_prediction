The quality and youth of our fleet now rank us an industry leader. We repurchased more than 13% of our shares at a significant discount to book value, raised a new $332 million secured facility at a very attractive margin, and refinanced and extended $375 million of unsecured notes at a significantly reduced interest rate. This was a good investment in our future earnings despite the debt extinguishment charge in the fourth quarter.\"\n\"Last week we announced an exciting deal with AirAsia in which FLY will acquire a total of 55 aircraft, seven engines, and options to acquire 20 new A320neo family aircraft,\" added Barrington. \"This landmark acquisition grows FLY's fleet with the most attractive and newest generation of narrowbody aircraft and will drive high levels of stable, long-term profitability and cash flows for the benefit of our stakeholders.\"\nFinancial Results\nFLY is reporting net income of $7.2 million, or $0.25 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares to a net loss of $63.8 million, or $1.98 per share, for the same period in 2016. The financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include $20.8 million of debt extinguishment costs, primarily relating to the discharge of FLY's 6.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (\"2020 Notes\").\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.6 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to a net loss of $29.1 million, or $0.88 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income was $30.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $30.6 million for the same period in the previous year. On a per share basis, Adjusted Net Income was $1.09 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.95 for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted Net Income was $66.6 million, or $2.19 per share, compared to $79.3 million, or $2.38 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is shown below.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the fourth quarter, FLY repurchased 715,934 shares for $9.8 million at an average price of $13.65 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2017, FLY repurchased 4.3 million shares for $57.1 million at an average price of $13.35 per share. In November 2017, FLY's board of directors approved a $50.0 million share repurchase program expiring in December 2018, to replace its program which expired in December 2017.\nFinancings\nOn October 16, 2017, FLY completed its offering of $300 million of unsecured 5.25% Senior Notes due 2024. The net proceeds were approximately $294.2 million, which FLY used, together with cash on hand, to discharge the $375 million of its outstanding 2020 Notes.\nOn December 8, 2017, FLY closed a new $332 million secured debt facility. The facility has an eight-year term and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.65%.\nAirAsia Portfolio Acquisition\nOn February 28, 2018, FLY signed definitive agreements with AirAsia Berhad (\"AAB\") for the acquisition of 55 Airbus narrowbody aircraft, seven CFM engines and options to purchase an additional 20 Airbus A320neo family aircraft. Nearly all aircraft will be subject to leases to AAB and its affiliates, other than the option aircraft. The transaction is expected to close in the second and third quarters of 2018, subject to approval by AAB shareholders, receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nFinancial Position\nAt December 31, 2017, FLY's total assets were $3.6 billion, including investment in flight equipment totaling $3.1 billion.

The table below does not include the two B767 aircraft owned by a joint venture in which FLY has a 57% interest.\nPortfolio at\nDec. 31,\n2017\nDec. 31,\n2016\nAirbus A319\n9\n9\nAirbus A320\n12\n12\nAirbus A321\n3\n3\nAirbus A330\n3\n3\nAirbus A340\n2\n2\nBoeing 737\n46\n38\nBoeing 757\n3\n3\nBoeing 777\n2\n2\nBoeing 787\n5\n4\nTotal\n85\n76\nAt December 31, 2017, the average age of the portfolio, weighted by net book value of each aircraft, was 6.4 years.

Two aircraft were off-lease at year end, one of which was subsequently delivered to a new lessee in January 2018, and the other aircraft is expected to be delivered to a new lessee in the first quarter of 2018. FLY's lease utilization factor was 98.3% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 99.6% for the year.\nConference Call and Webcast\nFLY's senior management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss these results at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 8, 2018.

outstanding for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 includes dilutive common share equivalents of 53,989 and 46,068, respectively.\nFLY defines Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) plus or minus (i) non-cash impairment charges; (ii) non-cash amortization of debt discounts, loan issuance costs, lease premiums and discounts, and other items; (iii) adjustments related to the GAAM portfolio acquisition comprised primarily of amortization of fair value adjustments recorded in purchase accounting; (iv) losses from debt modification and extinguishment; (v) non-recurring expenses; (vi) unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses; (vii) deferred income taxes; and (viii) the ineffective portion and gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges. The adjustments included within Adjusted Net Income are primarily non-cash items, one-time or non-recurring items that are not expected to continue in the future, and certain other items that we consider unrelated to the ongoing performance of our operations. Adjusted Return on Equity is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the average shareholders' equity for the periods presented. For periods of less than one year, the resulting return is annualized.\nFLY uses Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Return on Equity, in addition to GAAP net income and earnings per share, to assess our core operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. Management believes these measures are helpful in evaluating the operating performance of our ongoing operations and identifying trends in our performance, because they remove the effects of certain non-cash, one-time or non-recurring items that are not expected to continue in the future, and certain other items that are not indicative of our overall operating trends. In addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Return on Equity help us compare our performance to our competitors. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for net income or other financial measures determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States. FLY's definitions may be different than those used by other companies.\nSOURCE Fly Leasing Limited", "external_links": ["http://www.flyleasing.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fly-leasing-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300610586.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T16:41:01.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
