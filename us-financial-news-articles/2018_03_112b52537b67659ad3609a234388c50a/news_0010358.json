If Saudi picks up, I think the bulk will be geared toward Saudi,” he said.\nOpportunities for investment banks have increased tremendously due to Vision 2030, the reform programme launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the economy and end its reliance on oil exports.\nRiyadh has ambitious privatisation plans, including to raise $100 billion through the listing of five percent of state oil firm Saudi Aramco at home and on one or more overseas markets.
