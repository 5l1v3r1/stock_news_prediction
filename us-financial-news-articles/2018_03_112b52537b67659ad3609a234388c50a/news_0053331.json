I was never in too much trouble. \n“Sure, I was in the rough a few times and had to make a couple of good up-and-downs around the greens, but I never put myself under too much stress.” \nUehara, one shot back, made what could have been a demoralising bogey at her opening hole, but responded well with birdies at the next two. \n“I had a three-putt, and I kind of played tight,” she said, adding that she had not started to relax until making three successive birdies around the turn. \nUehara, ranked 121st in the world, said her experience of contending at last year’s Evian major, where she tied for 10th after a late double-bogey, had helped her understand how to control her adrenaline. \nRecari also shot 66, thanks to six birdies in the first 12 holes. \n“I’ve always felt if I was going to win a major it was going to be on this course. It really suits my game,” said the Spaniard, who has three LPGA victories, the most recent in 2013. \nJessica Korda started with four straight birdies and finished on 67. \nThe American, daughter of former tennis world number two Petr, is playing with verve and serenity this year after surgery to correct a debilitating jaw problem. She has 27 screws holding her face in place. \n“I didn’t realise how much it affected me until I got the surgery done,” said Korda, who won the Honda LPGA Thailand in February. \n“I’m just a happy person now. I wake up, no headaches. I get to wake up pain free every day and that’s amazing to me.” (Reporting   Carolina, editing by Ed Osmond/Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T07:01:57.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
