They are essential to any offshore exploration plans\n* Schlumberger announced in January plans to exit the offshore and onshore seismic acquisition market due to weak returns.\n* “This could create a problem for oil companies in the future... They will have to do it (develop new technology) themselves or ensure that geophysical service companies can make sufficient margins to defend long-term investments,” she said\n* Earlier on Wednesday, the CEO told the conference she expected day rates for hiring seismic vessels to increase by around 10 percent in 2018 and around the same in 2019\n* “It’s my best guess, but vessel utilisation is more important than day rates. If we get higher utilisation, day rates could be lower,” she told Reuters (Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis, editing by Gwladys Fouche)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:38:40.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
