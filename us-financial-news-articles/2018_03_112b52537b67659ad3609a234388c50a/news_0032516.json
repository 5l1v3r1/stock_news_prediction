The bank said the gap reflected the fact that there were more men than women in senior positions at the firm. It also reported a mean gender pay gap of 16.1 percent and a mean bonus gap of 32.5 percent in Goldman Sachs (UK) SVC Limited, which it said employs around 1,600 individuals from non-revenue divisions. The remainder of its UK employees are employed in its international business.
