Three or four such bottles were found beneath the floor of a house abandoned for the past three years, where an obstetrician had once lived and which was being renovated by a recent purchaser, Kyodo added. The bodies appeared to have been preserved in a substance resembling formalin, Kyodo said, adding that police were investigating further. Police declined to confirm the report.
