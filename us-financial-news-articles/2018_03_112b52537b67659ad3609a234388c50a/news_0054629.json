We are on track to fulfill our promise to emerge from this strategic restructuring process as a stronger business partner while retaining our primary focus on safety.”\nWeil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is Westinghouse’s legal counsel, AlixPartners LLP is acting as Westinghouse’s Chief Transformation Officer and restructuring advisor, and PJT Partners is the investment banker to Westinghouse.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180327006166/en/\nWestinghouse Electric Company\nCourtney Boone, +1 724-816-9408\nVice President, Global Communications\nEmail: booneca@westinghouse.com\nSource: Westinghouse Electric Company", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180327006166/en/"], "published": "2018-03-27T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T00:01:35.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
