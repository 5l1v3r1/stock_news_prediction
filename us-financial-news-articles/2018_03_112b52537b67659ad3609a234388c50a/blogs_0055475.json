Lululemon Athletica reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations on Tuesday, sending shares up as much as 9 percent in after-hours trading.\nHere's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:\nEPS: $1.33 adj. vs. $1.27 expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $929 million vs. $912 million expected, according to Thomson Reuters The athleisure brand reported net revenue of $929 million, beating expectations of $912 million. That figure represented an increase of 18 percent since the same quarter the year prior. \nIn the fourth quarter, the company earned $120 million, or 88 cents a share, compared with $136.1 million, or 99 cents a share, a year ago.\nAfter adjusting for one-time items, Lululemon earned $1.33 per share, topping analysts' estimates of $1.27 per share.\nIt also said it anticipates 2018 net revenue of $2.99 billion to $3.02 billion and diluted earnings per share of $3.00 to $3.08.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company expects net revenue to be in the range of $612 million to $617 million based on a total comparable sales increase in the low double digits on a constant dollar basis.\nDiluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 44 cents to 46 cents a share for the fiscal first quarter.\nLululemon announced its first earnings since CEO Laurent Potdevin stepped down in February after \"falling short\" of the company's \"standards of conduct.\" CNBC previously reported one of the issues contributing to his departure was a relationship with a female designer at the company. \nInvestors are expecting an update on the new CEO search. \nInvestors are also awaiting an update on the many initiatives the athleisure brand carried out under his stewardship. Lululemon was one of the first to kick off the \"athleisure\" trend, but has more recently seen growth slow as new competitors have infiltrated. \nTo regain momentum, it has focused on maintaining leaner inventory, selling directly to its customers and fostering a clearly defined brand. It has also been growing in the men's category after deciding last year to wind down its Ivivva business for kids.\nInternationally, Lululemon is making a bigger push in China, where an increasing number of consumers are focused on living healthier lifestyles and staying active.\nSome of these efforts appear to have had an impact, with Lululemon having reported strong holiday sales in January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T23:16:23.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
