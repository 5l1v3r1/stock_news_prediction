She said sometimes she would advise women in tech to have a \"man's name like Randi.\"\n\"Because I can't tell you how many meetings I got because I would email someone and they thought that it was a man that was coming to meet them. Then, I would show up,\" she quipped.\nBut the situation is getting better for women, according to Zuckerberg.\nIlya S. Savenok | American Theatre Wing | Getty Images Randi Zuckerberg \"I think it's a wonderful time to be a woman in business. I think there's much more financing opportunity, a lot of women are now becoming investors themselves,\" she said, adding that women still faced a \"long, uphill journey ahead\" to balance responsibilities at home and at work.\nAmong the top 100 venture firms, there was a 17 percent increase in the number of female investing partners from 2016, according to the Crunchbase report. At the same time, women held about 15 percent of partner roles at accelerators and corporate venture firms while they founded 16 micro-venture funds in recent years, the report added.\nMany prominent women venture capitalists have also started new initiatives to help female founders with their business pitches to potential investors.\nZuckerberg, who has her own angel investing portfolio, said she \"won't even look at a company\" if it does not have at least one female founder.\nIt's also important for governments to continue playing an important role in building an entrepreneurial society, Zuckerberg said.\nshow chapters Randi Zuckerberg's three pieces of advice for budding entrepreneurs 4 Hours Ago | 01:03", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T08:40:26.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
