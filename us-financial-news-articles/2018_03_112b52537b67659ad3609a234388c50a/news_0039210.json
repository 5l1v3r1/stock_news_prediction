Prosecutors say his file-sharing infrastructure allowed the illegal download of about a billion copyrighted musical works from at least 2012 through 2015.\nSargsyan pleaded guilty in September to criminal copyright infringement for private financial gain. In addition to the prison term, the judge ordered him to pay $458,200 in restitution and to forfeit nearly $185,000.\nProsecutors say Sargsyan ignored repeated notifications that he was illegally hosting and sharing copyrighted works.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T01:12:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
