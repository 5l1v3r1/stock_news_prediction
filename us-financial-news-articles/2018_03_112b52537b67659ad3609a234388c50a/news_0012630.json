Best has commented that the Financial Strength Rating of A++ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings of “aa+” of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) (Springfield, MA) and its life/health subsidiaries, C.M. Life Insurance Company and MML Bay State Life Insurance Company (both domiciled in Enfield, CT) remain unchanged following the announcement of the sale of its subsidiary, MassMutual Japan to Nippon Life Insurance Company .\nMassMutual agreed to sell 85.1% of its ownership interest in its wholly owned life insurance and wealth management affiliate to Nippon Life at a sales price of $935 million (at an assumed closing exchange rate), with MassMutual retaining a 14.9% interest.
