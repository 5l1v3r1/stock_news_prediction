It seems to me the Bank of Canada is trying to find all the reasons possible to delay further hikes,” Sebastien Lavoie, chief economist at Laurentian Bank, said.\nThe bank has hiked rates three times since last July, but financial markets now expect the bank to wait until July at the earliest to raise again.\nThe Canadian dollar, already weakened by the threat of a trade war with the United States, sank in response to the bank’s dovish tone to hover near its weakest level since July 2017.\nNodding to the dual influences of policy decisions in the United States, Canada’s largest export market, the bank said that new U.S. government spending and tax cuts are anticipated to boost American growth in 2018 and 2019.\n“However, trade policy developments are an important and growing source of uncertainty for the global and Canadian outlooks,” the bank said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said last week he would impose global tariffs on steel and aluminum, later adding that Canada could get a better deal if it agrees to U.S. terms in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada is hoping for an exemption from the tariffs. NAFTA spans the United States, Canada and Mexico.\nDisruptions to trade would sideswipe Canada’s export-led economy and make it difficult for the Bank of Canada to continue hiking rates, even as inflation pressures are beginning to build.\nTurning to Canada’s precarious housing market, the bank said strong data late in 2017 and softer data this year suggests that some demand was pulled forward ahead of new mortgage rules that have made it harder for some buyers to get financing, and that more time is needed to assess how the changes will play out.\n“While largely devoid of surprises, this statement gives zero sense of urgency for further rate hikes, and seems to fit in with our view that the Bank is on the sidelines until the second half of the year,” Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.
