But attitudes about sexual assault have shifted since October when accusations of sexual misconduct by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein gave rise to a movement. Mr. Weinstein has admitted mistakes but denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.\nRelated\nJudge Declares Mistrial in Bill Cosby Sexual-Assault Case Fallout Grows for Harvey Weinstein Dozens of People Recount Pattern of Sexual Misconduct by Las Vegas Mogul Steve Wynn Lawyers for Mr. Cosby, who denies the charges, are trying to limit the influence of recent high-profile allegations against other men in the trial slated to begin April 2 in Montgomery County Court near Philadelphia. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.\n“The climate is so much more accepting of victims’ stories than it was even a year ago,” said Wes Oliver, a law professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.\nProsecutors say the 80-year-old Mr. Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted former Temple University employee Andrea Constand in his home outside Philadelphia in 2004. Ms. Constand, 44 years old, met Mr. Cosby while he was a member of the Temple board of trustees.\nMr. Cosby has said he had a consensual sexual relationship with Ms. Constand and that he is innocent of the charges. On the night of the alleged assault, he said he gave her three Benadryl pills. Ms. Constand said the pills incapacitated her.\nSeveral jurors said at the time that among other things, they were divided about how to apply words like “unconscious” and “reasonable doubt” while deliberating.\nProsecutors and Mr. Cosby’s defense team declined to comment for this article.\nIn pretrial arguments, the two sides are sparring about whether other Cosby accusers should be allowed to testify. Prosecutors argue that 19 women who have alleged Mr. Cosby assaulted them should be allowed to testify to establish a pattern of “bad acts.”\nMr. Cosby’s attorneys contend that the additional accusations aren’t legally admissible under rules of evidence and would unfairly prejudice the jury. They noted that some alleged assaults date to the 1960s and would now be hard to defend against.\n“This trial is about one issue—what occurred between Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand during one night,” Mr. Cosby’s lawyers wrote in a court filing Tuesday. The case is “not about broader social issues impacting other people in other circumstances.”\nJudge Steven T. O’Neill could rule as early as this week on the issue.\nMr. Cosby’s lawyers have said in court filings that they want to call witnesses to dispute Ms. Constand’s prior statements that she didn’t have a romantic relationship with Mr. Cosby, who has been married to Camille for more than 50 years. Moreover, his attorneys have indicated they will contend that she made up her account to get money from Mr. Cosby.\nMs. Constand settled a civil lawsuit with Mr. Cosby in 2005 for an undisclosed amount.\nMr. Cosby’s new legal team, which was hired since the first trial, includes Los Angeles-based attorney Tom Mesereau, who successfully defended Michael Jackson from child molestation charges in 2005. Mr. Mesereau declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T22:39:26.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
