All of these discussions are ongoing,” it added.\nMothercare said, however, that it expected its net debt at the end of the year to be slightly lower than the 50 million pounds it had forecast.\nThe company, which has been cutting costs, said it was continuing with its strategy of closing UK stores and bolstering online sales.\nThe fall of Maplin and the British operations of Toys R Us into administration put more than 5,000 jobs at risk.\n$1 = 0.7242 pounds Reporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:26:20.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
