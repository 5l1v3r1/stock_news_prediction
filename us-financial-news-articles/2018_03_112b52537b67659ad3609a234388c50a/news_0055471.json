(OTCQB: GIGL) (the “Company”) , owner and operator of family-friendly restaurants that bring together high-end, organic food with active, cutting-edge play and entertainment for children, announced its plans today for the first 180-days after the closing of its rights offering.\nCoinciding with the closing of the rights offering, Philip Gay, former CFO of California Pizza Kitchen and former CFO and CEO of Wolfgang Puck Food Company, will assume the position of CEO of Giggles N’ Hugs and will join its Board of Directors. Mr. Gay most recently served as the Company’s Chief Business Development Officer and brings nearly three decades of industry-related senior executive experience to Giggles N' Hugs.\n“Our business model aligns well with trends in the restaurant industry and the needs of major mall owners and operators, and with proper funding in place, we have multiple near-term expansion opportunities available that we plan to capitalize on over the next six months,” stated Mr. Gay. “Shareholders that participate in the current rights offering will play a major role in helping us achieve our goals and we intend to reward them by improving shareholder value while rapidly scaling operations, both domestically and abroad.”\n“Early investors of major restaurant brands such as Shake Shack, Cheesecake Factory, and Panera Bread have reaped significant gains as these companies entered their explosive growth phase. With the capital we are raising from the rights offering, we believe we are about to enter our own phase of growth,” continued Mr. Gay.\nUpon assuming the role of CEO, Mr. Gay’s primary priority will be expanding the Company’s footprint into new markets, such as Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Silicone Valley where seasonal weather is more extreme than sunny Southern California, driving families indoors for parties and play time. Based on ongoing discussions we have had with major mall owners in each market, and with funding in hand, the Company will be well-positioned to quickly move forward on signing new leases.\nDiscussions have also taken place with interested parties for franchising in both domestic and international markets. The Company expects to announce specific franchising deals after the offering closes.\nIn addition to new expansion opportunities, the Company plans to announce new additions to its Board of Directors, including experts in franchising, M&A, product launches and licensing, as well as merchandising.\nWe have pioneered a very unique concept in the market place and with sales up year over year, unit level margins at histotical highs, the rights offering fully subscribed, along with Philip Gay at the helm with the rest of the management team, we will finally have the capital and expertise to leverage these years of hard work as we bring the Giggles N’ Hugs experience to parents and children around the world,” stated Joey Parsi, founder of Giggles N’ Hugs.\nAbout Giggles N’ Hugs\nGiggles N' Hugs is the first and only restaurant that brings together high-end, organic food with active, cutting-edge play and entertainment for children. Every Giggles N' Hugs location offers an upscale, family-friendly atmosphere with a dedicated play area that children 10 and younger absolutely love. We feature high-quality menus made from fresh and local foods, nightly entertainment such as magic shows, concerts, puppet shows and face painting, and hugely popular party packages for families that want to do something special.\nForward Looking Statements:\nCertain statements in this press release constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
