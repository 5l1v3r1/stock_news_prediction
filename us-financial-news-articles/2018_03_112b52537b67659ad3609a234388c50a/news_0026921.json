A police officer stands behind a cordon placed around a payment machine covered by a tent in a supermarket car park near to where former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found poisoned in Salisbury, Britain, March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls Ofcom has an ongoing duty to check that holders of broadcast licenses remain“fit and proper” to operate in Britain. The regulator said it had written to ANO TV Novosti, the holder of RT’s UK broadcast licenses, to explain that, should Britain determine there was unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the UK, it would consider this relevant to the“fit and proper” test. Ofcom said ANO TV Novosti was financed from the budget of the Russian Federation. Britain has given President Vladimir Putin until midnight on Tuesday to explain how a nerve agent developed by the former Soviet Union was used to strike down Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, in the city of Salisbury.
