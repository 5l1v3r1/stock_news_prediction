He has been a vocal advocate of “supply-side” economics, the idea that cutting business taxes and regulation will lead to greater investment, hiring and economic growth. He supports free trade and a strong dollar, positions at odds with those of his new boss. He also favors tax cuts and low interest rates, putting him in sync with the president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T21:47:00.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
