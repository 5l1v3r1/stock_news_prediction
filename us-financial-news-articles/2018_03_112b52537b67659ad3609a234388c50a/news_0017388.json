The Guaranty Agencies and U.S. Department of Education accounted for student lending revenues of $21.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $23.7 million and $3.7 million the prior year period. Student loan placement volume (defined below) during the quarter totaled $0.5 billion, compared to $0.6 billion in the prior year period.

Medicare audit recovery revenues were $0.5 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $0.1 million from the prior year period. The Company began work on the CMS Recovery Audit programs in Regions 1 and 5 during Q2 of 2017 and while the Company has begun to recognize some revenue from these contracts, claim volumes for the RAC program remain at low levels due to document request limits. Commercial healthcare clients contributed revenues of $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $1.4 million from the prior year period.\nOther revenues in the fourth quarter were $7.2 million, up from $4.1 million in the prior year period.

Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.0 million as compared to $4.9 million in the prior year period. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.3 million, resulting in $0.02 per share on a fully diluted basis. This compares to adjusted net loss of $1.5 million or $(0.03) per fully diluted share in the prior year period.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately $23.5 million.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nRevenues for the full year ended December 31, 2017 were $132.0 million, a decrease of 6.6% compared to $141.4 million in 2016.

This compares to adjusted net income of $4.1 million or $0.08 per fully diluted share in 2016.\nBusiness Outlook\n“Looking ahead to 2018, we have several large opportunities, although these opportunities will require investment during 2018. These opportunities include the new Department of Education contract, which is currently in protest process, the Medicare as Secondary Payer Commercial Repayment Center contract, and our two new Medicare Recovery Audit Contracts with CMS, for Regions 1 and 5, which are still in their early contract stage. We expect that these contracts that we are implementing in 2018 will have strong financial contribution as we look forward from 2018, but implementation expenses during 2018 will bring down margins. With that in mind, we are providing full year 2018 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $123 to $150 million and $2 to $6 million, respectively. This guidance does not include the new Department of Education contract which would require additional investment in 2018, and the balance sheet impact of closing out our old Region A CMS contract,” concluded Im.\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this press release, to supplement our consolidated financial statements, the Company presents adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. These measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and accordingly reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to net income determined in accordance with GAAP are included in the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Results” table at the end of this press release. We have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income in this press release because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income provide useful information to investors and analysts in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In particular, many of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items, specifically interest, tax and depreciation and amortization expenses, equity-based compensation expense and certain other non-operating expenses, that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, these measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nTerms used in this Press Release\nStudent Loan Placement Volume refers to the dollar volume of defaulted student loans first placed with us during the specified period by public and private clients for recovery. Placement Volume allows us to measure and track trends in the amount of inventory our clients in the student lending market are placing with us during any period. The revenue associated with the recovery of a portion of these loans may be recognized in subsequent accounting periods, which assists management in estimating future revenues and in allocating resources necessary to address current Placement Volumes.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern. A live webcast of the call may be accessed on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at investors.performantcorp.com .
