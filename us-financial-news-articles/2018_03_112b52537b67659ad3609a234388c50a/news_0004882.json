The West African country aims to raise a further $2.8 billion this year.\nUnion Bank and Renaissance Capital declined to comment, while a Citi representative was unable to make immediate comment.\nBanking sources said Union could issue up to $250 million in bonds including one in local currency.\nThe bank, in which Atlas Mara owns a 22.1 percent stake, plans to tap opportunities to lend to agribusinesses.\nNigerian banks are gearing up to tap Eurobonds to boost lending and to refinance existing dollar debts before interest rates begin to rise further in the United States.\nThe race for more capital has also been fuelled by stricter accounting principles on how lenders recognise losses, which are likely to knock 50-200 basis points off industry capital, banking executives have said.\nThe central bank this year put a restriction on dividend payments for lenders with high non-performing loans and capital ratios lower than its minimum requirement.\nBanking sources said that rival lenders could follow Union Bank’s lead. FCMB is considering a Eurobond and Diamond Bank, with an existing $200 million Eurobond due next year, could tap markets again, sources say.\nFidelity Bank issued a $400 million Eurobond in October at 10.75 percent to refinance existing debt and boost lending. The mid-tier bank told Reuters it used the bond proceeds to fund its trade book in the fourth quarter.\nAn FCMB spokesman said the bank was open to raising funds in the future but details have not been worked out. A Diamond Bank official said investors would be informed on any decision to raise fresh capital.
