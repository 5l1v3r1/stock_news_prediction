Music can be lost, just because it is on the wrong shelf of the library and it stays there for centuries,” he ADDED.\nPrandi and his Ghislieri ensemble will perform the mass at festivals in France, Germany and Malta in the coming year.\nReporting by Clement Rossignol and Robert-Jan Bartunek, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T16:12:40.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
