Kvaal added that customers don’t appear to like the iPhone X’s high price and have opted for other devices rather than the $999 handset. \nApple released the iPhone X last year with a variety of new components, including an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen and a face scanner the company calls Face ID. The iPhone X has a revamped design that eliminates the physical home sensor and comes with wireless charging. At the time, Apple called the iPhone X the future of smartphones. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nSince its release in November, however, the iPhone X has been the subject of countless reports that demand isn’t as strong as Apple had hoped. Those reports, which have come from analysts and industry watchers, have suggested that the iPhone X’s price has proven a barrier among consumers. Reports earlier this year went so far as to say that Apple would stop producing the iPhone X this summer, months ahead of when it was scheduled to do so. \nFor its part, Apple hasn’t commented on individual iPhone model sales. Instead, the company has kept a brave face and pointed to the iPhone division’s strong sales and profits as proof that demand for its handsets is strong. \nApple did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment on the analysts’ claims.
