The value of the net short dollar position was $14.61 billion in the week to March 13, compared with $11.46 billion the previous week. Net short positioning on the greenback has increased for a third straight week. U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.
