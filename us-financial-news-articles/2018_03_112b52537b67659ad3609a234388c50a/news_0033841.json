A lawyer for Zervos was also not immediately available.\nThe ruling could force Trump to submit to questioning by lawyers for Zervos and lead to further public scrutiny of other claims of sexual misconduct that have been made against the president.\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Zervos, a restaurateur, was one of several women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct after the emergence of a conversation caught on an open microphone in 2005, in which Trump spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women.\nShe had met Trump after becoming a contestant on NBC's \"The Apprentice\" in 2005 and accused him of kissing her against her will at his New York office in 2007 and later groping her in a Beverly Hills hotel after she met with him about a possible job.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said at rallies and on Twitter that all of the accusations made by women after the tape became public were \"lies.\" At one point, he re-published on Twitter another user's post that called Summer's accusation a \"hoax.\"\n\"In their context, defendant's repeated statements ... cannot be characterized simply as opinion, heated rhetoric or hyperbole,\" Schecter wrote.\nThe case is Zervos v Trump, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 150522/2017.
