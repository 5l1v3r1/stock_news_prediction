Terrell was Rhode Island’s only player with more than 11 points, but he missed crucial free throws with 27 and 15 seconds left, and Davidson capitalized.\nComing off a 117-113 triple-overtime loss to St. Bonaventure on Tuesday — a game in which Aldridge had a career-high 45 points — the Wildcats showed fortitude down the stretch.\nThe Wildcats scored the final nine points of the game — six by Grady — over the last two minutes. Rhode Island led by seven with 2:47 left, but Grady had six straight points down the stretch to cut the lead to 61-60.\nTerrell had 16 points at halftime as Rhode Island built a 35-29 lead. The Rams shot just 44 percent from the field in the first half but held Davidson to 39 percent shooting and outrebounded the Wildcats, 20-14. Grady had 10 points in the first half to lead Davidson.\nGudmundsson added 11 points, six rebounds and six assists for Davidson, which shot 39.3 percent from the field and 85.7 percent from the free throw line. Rhode Island shot 40.3 percent and 45.5 percent from the free throw line.\nStanford Robinson and Cyril Langevine each had 11 points for the Rams, and Langevine added 11 rebounds to lead Rhode Island, which outrebounded Davidson, 40-34.\nBoth teams play next Thursday in the second round of the A-10 tournament at Capital One Arena in Washington D.C.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T11:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:35:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
