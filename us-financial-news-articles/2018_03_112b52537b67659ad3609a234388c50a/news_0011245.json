North Korea has not carried out any such tests since November last year. \nReacting to the news, President Donald Trump tweeted: \"We will see what happens!\" \nWashington and Pyongyang have been at loggerheads for months over the North's nuclear and missile programmes, with Trump and Kim Jong Un trading insults and threatening war. North Korea has regularly vowed never to give up its nuclear programme, which it sees as an essential deterrent and \"treasured sword\" against U.S. plans for invasion. show chapters 11:56 AM ET Mon, 24 April 2017 | 02:58 \nThe United States, which stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the Korean War, denies any such plans. \nTo ensure close communication, the two Koreas, whose 1950-53 conflict ended in a mere truce, not a peace treaty, will set up a hotline between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un, Chung said. \nThe last inter-Korean summit was in 2007 when late former president Roh Moo-hyun was in office. \nThe agreement came on the heels of a visit made by a 10-member South Korean delegation led by Chung to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, on Monday in hopes of encouraging North Korea and the United States to talk to one another. \nKim Jong Un met senior South Korean government officials for the first time and said it was his \"firm will to vigorously advance\" inter-Korean ties and pursue reunification, the North's official news agency said. \n\"Through this delegation visit, the South Korean government created a very important opportunity to manage North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, prevent war on the Korean peninsula and create military trust going forward,\" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute. \nTensions between the two Koreas eased during the Olympics in South Korea, where Moon hosted a high-level North Korean delegation and the two sides presented a joint women's ice hockey team. Kim Jong Un had invited Moon to North Korea for a summit, which was the first such request from a North Korean leader to a South Korean president. US-South Korea drills to go on \nNorth Korea has boasted of developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, but Pyongyang and Washington both say they want a diplomatic solution to the standoff. \nThe first inter-Korean talks in more than two years were held early this year to bring North Korea to the Winter Olympics, when South Korea and the United States also postponed an annual joint large-scale military exercise that North Korea views as a preparation for invasion. \nDuring this week's visit, a senior Blue House official said North Korea was informed it was not feasible to postpone the joint military drills between South Korea and the United States again and that Kim Jong Un acknowledged the situation. \nKim Jong Un said he understood the drills, expected in April, would be of a similar scale seen in previous years, the official said. The North Korean leader also had a request for the world: that he be seriously acknowledged as a dialogue counterpart, said the official. \nThe South's delegation leader, Chung, said he would travel to the United States to explain the outcome of the visit to North Korea and that he had a message from North Korea he will deliver to Trump. \nChung will later visit China and Russia, while Suh Hoon, the head of South Korea's spy agency and another member of the delegation, will head to Japan.
