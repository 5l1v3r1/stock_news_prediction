No class has yet been certified in the above action.\nThe complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants’ The complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants’ failure to disclose during the Class Period that the Company’s founder and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen A. Wynn, had engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct with respect to Wynn Resorts employees, including instances of sexual assault, and that discovery of Wynn’s misconduct would subject the Company to heightened regulatory scrutiny and jeopardize Wynn’s tenure at the Company.\nAccording to the complaint, following a January 26, 2018 article published by The Wall Street Journal revealing detailed accounts that Wynn had coerced and pressured several Wynn Resorts employees to perform sex acts and that Wynn had paid a Wynn Resorts employee $7.5 million after being accused of forcing the employee to have sex with him, and that the Massachusetts Gaming Commission announced that it would open a regulatory review into the Company over the sexual misconduct allegations reported in the Wall Street Journal article, the value of Wynn Resorts shares declined significantly.\nIf you have suffered a loss in excess of $100,000 from investment in Wynn Resorts securities purchased on or after February 28, 2014 and held through the revelation of negative information during and/or at the end of the Class Period and would like to learn more about this lawsuit and your ability to participate as a lead plaintiff, without cost or obligation to you, please contact Brower Piven either by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com or by telephone at (410) 415-6616.\nAttorneys at Brower Piven have extensive experience in litigating securities and other class action cases and have been advocating for the rights of shareholders since the 1980s.
