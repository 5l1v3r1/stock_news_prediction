In 2015 and 2016, we acquired corn facilities in Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey and Morocco, then launched a significant expansion effort to enhance our capabilities in those businesses. And we’ve grown significantly in Asia, with our sweetener facility in Tianjin as well as several animal feed plants. Taken together with this expansion into Russia, these global additions represent a substantial transformation for our Corn business as we continue our geographical growth and diversification.”\nADM is targeting a close for the transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, late in the second quarter of 2018.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the above statements constitute forward-looking statements.
