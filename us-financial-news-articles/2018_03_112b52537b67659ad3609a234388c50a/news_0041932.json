Her deep experience in design, development and merchandising, and her global consumer knowledge will be invaluable assets propelling Kate Spade’s next chapter of growth.”\n“I am extremely excited about leading Kate Spade’s passionate and accomplished team and joining Tapestry’s house of brands,” said Ms. Bakst. “I believe the Kate Spade business has tremendous opportunity across product categories, channels and geographies.
