He became a top sales producer at Yahoo!, where during his seven-year tenure he developed enterprise licensing partnerships that included a co-branded ISP service for Costco and K-Mart.\nHe has also activated foundational content licenses for Autonomy's consumer video platform, Blinkx, and launched consumer revenue operations for Bezos Expeditions-backed SkyGrid. He has served as vice president of west coast sales for NewsCorp’s FOX Audience Network, and as chief revenue officer of ShareThis where he was responsible for sales, account management, ad operations and business intelligence.\n“I’m honored to lead our talented Sellpoints team and further our mission of helping brands sell more online,” commented Gregg. “Our focus on developing world-class technology has driven the evolution of our OMNI and ReTargeter platforms.
