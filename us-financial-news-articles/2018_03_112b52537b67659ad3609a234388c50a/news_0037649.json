But the U.S. is actually the breaker of WTO rules, which can be seen clearly by how subsidized U.S. soybeans are dumped on China,\" the newspaper said. \n\"Strong restrictive measures need to be taken against the massive subsidies and dumping of soybeans by some countries on China. This can reduce the adverse effects of imported soybeans on the Chinese market.\" \nThe Global Times also said Chinese authorities had issued a policy document urging efforts to nurture large grain dealers and agricultural firms that were internationally competitive and to make international trade for agricultural goods fairer and more reasonable. \nChina, the world's top soybean importer, buys 60 percent of the commodity traded worldwide to crush into soymeal used in animal feed. It mainly imports from Brazil and the United States. \nA U.S. Department of Agriculture attache in China on Tuesday forecast that the country will import 100 million tons of soybeans in 2018/2019.
