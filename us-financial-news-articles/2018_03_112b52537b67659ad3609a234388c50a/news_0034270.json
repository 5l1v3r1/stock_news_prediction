A bird's eye view of the Olorgesailie Basin shows a shift in the environment between 500,000 years ago, which marks the last known evidence of the handaxe toolmakers in the Olorgesailie Basin, and the more recent sediments dated 320,000 years and younger, which preserve the Middle Stone Age evidence, in southern Kenya in this undated handout photograph released on March 15, 2018.

The researchers described ochre pigment that produced a bright-red color, which could have been used for body painting or other symbolic expression, and tools fashioned from obsidian, a volcanic rock that yields extremely sharp blades, that contrasted with clunkier ones used by earlier species in the human evolutionary lineage. The researchers found abundant evidence of long-distance transfer of obsidian to the Olorgesailie Basin location from sites up to 55 miles (88 km) away over rugged terrain, leading them to believe it was acquired from another group through trade although it was unknown what was provided in exchange. The findings indicate advances in technology and social structures unexpected so early in our species’ history, they said. “My view is that these newly evolved mental and social abilities — including awareness of distant groups, use of pigments and innovative technologies including projectile points — were at the foundation of our species’ origin,” said paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History’s Human Origins Program.

The researchers described obsidian tools that were smaller, more carefully crafted and more specialized than larger stone tools called handaxes used by earlier human species. The obsidian was used in a wide range of tools including scrapers, implements with chisel and gouging edges and also in small points that could be placed at the end of a wood or bone shaft for use as a projectile weapon. The research was published in the journal Science.
