But after analyzing Starbucks' disclosures and financial results for its China stores, Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan predicts the Asian country will only produce 20 percent of the company's revenue growth in fiscal 2019. \nAs a result, he estimates Starbucks will generate same-store sales growth of 2.5 percent in fiscal 2019 versus the Wall Street consensus of 3.3 percent and management's long-term guidance of 3 percent to 5 percent. \n\"China analysis points to lower contribution to overall revenue growth than initial management commentary,\" Setyan wrote in a note to clients Thursday. He added he no longer sees drivers of same-store sales growth and EPS consensus expectations for fiscal 2018 and sees \"rising risks to FY19 expectations.\" \nStarbucks shares fell 0.5 percent Thursday after the report. \nSetyan reduced his price target for Starbucks shares to $56 from $70. The new target is 3 percent lower than Wednesday's closing price. \nStarbucks sent the following statement when asked for comment on this story: \n\"We continue to see Starbucks as a growth company, uniquely positioned in our industry.\" \nâ€” CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:39:50.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
