REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/File Photo The new measures are part of a goal to attract five million additional travelers – four million international tourists and one million extra local holiday trips and will help limit the “blip” a major drought is having on South Africa’s top tourist draw card, Cape Town, said minister Derek Hanekom.\n“I am bullish because there is huge growth potential,” Hanekom told Reuters in an interview.\n“On the international front conditions are very much in our favor so its going to be easier to achieve the four million part than the one million,” he said.\nTourism, which contributes more than 400 billion rand ($34 billion) to Africa’s most industrialized economy, or around 8 percent of GDP, is seen by government as key to help drive growth and reduce a stubbornly high unemployment rate.\nSouth Africa emerged from a recession last year but is struggling to grow its economy and less disposal income means locals are hesitant to travel.\nHowever, the long-haul destination still provides good value for money for foreign tourists attracted to its white beaches, iconic Table Mountain and wildlife safaris.\nFILE PHOTO: Tourists take pictures from a viewing platform overlooking Cape Town's Atlantic beachfront, November 17, 2013.
