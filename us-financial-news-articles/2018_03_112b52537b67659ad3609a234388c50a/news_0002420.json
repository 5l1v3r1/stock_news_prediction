Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States.\n* Shares of trade-sensitive auto parts and railroad companies added to Thursday's declines. Magna International Inc fell 1 percent to C$68.02 and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd retreated 0.9 percent to C$224.96.\n* The overall industrials group slipped 0.5 percent, while the financials group, which accounts for more than one-third of the weight of the TSX, declined 0.4 percent.\n* The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.3 percent.\n* Gold futures rose 1.4 percent to $1,320.5 an ounce, boosted by investor demand for safer investments.\n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Sleep Country , which rose 12.9 percent after it reported fourth-quarter results after the close on Thursday.\n* The TSX posted 2 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows, while five of the index's 10 main groups were lower.
