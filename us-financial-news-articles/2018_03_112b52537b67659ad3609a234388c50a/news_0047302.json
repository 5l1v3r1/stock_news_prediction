Conflict in Darfur began in 2003 when mainly non-Arab tribes took up arms against Sudanâ€™s Arab-led government. \nThe ceasefire was set to expire at the end of March. \nIn October, the United States lifted 20-year-old sanctions tied to progress on counter-terrorism cooperation and on resolving internal conflicts.
