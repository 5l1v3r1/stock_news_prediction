That compares with figures of around 10 to 20 percent at other German airports.\nHowever, main customers Lufthansa and Thomas Cook’s Condor are also growing at the moment, following the collapse of Air Berlin last year, he said.\nHe said passenger growth on European routes would be strongest, while growth in intercontinental passengers would be around 3 percent.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:08:58.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
