Analysts predict the deal will go down to the wire.\nOn Monday, Dana said it would pay an additional $140 million in cash to GKN for its Driveline auto business.\nIn response, GKN said it would return up to 700 million pounds in cash to shareholders as soon as practicable, as part of an already announced 2.5 billion pound cash return programme from the Dana sale and the planned divestment of its powder metallurgy unit.\nThat compares with Melrose's offer of 81 pence in cash for each GKN share plus 1.69 new Melrose shares, which would hand shareholders 1.4 billion pounds and 60 percent of the enlarged Melrose â€” a bid worth 7.8 billion pounds in total.\nShould they back GKN management's plan, GKN shareholders would end up with 47.25 percent of the enlarged Dana group, which would be listed in both the U.S. and London.\nA mainstay of Britain's engineering sector, GKN makes parts for the U.S. aviation industry, such as the Boeing 737 jet and Black Hawk helicopter, as well as components for Volkswagen and Ford cars.\nGetty Images FILE PHOTO: UH-60A Black Hawk helicopters prepare to takeoff as the 82nd Aviation Brigade relocates in the desert during Operation Desert Shield. (photo by DOD) Illustrating the bitter nature of the takeover battle, it featured on the front page of Britain's Daily Mail newspaper on Monday: \"Don't let Vultures destroy a British colossus\", it said, noting some shareholders did not have a long-term interest in the company that helped make Spitfire fighter aircraft in World War II.\nShareholders split \nWhile the hostile bid has prompted criticism from politicians - concerned that after improving GKN, Melrose could break it up and sell parts to foreign buyers - the decision now rests with shareholders.\nElliott Advisors, which has a 3.8 percent interest, making it one of GKN's biggest shareholders, on Friday backed Melrose's deal, saying it did not trust GKN management to deliver the \"profound\" cultural shift needed to meet new targets while driving through two major asset sales.\nColumbia Threadneedle, with a 3.4 percent stake according to Reuters data, has said it will reject Melrose's offer.\nGKN said that following Dana's improved offer for its auto business it would receive $1.77 billion in cash after deducting $1 billion for the transfer of a pension deficit to the combined Dana-GKN Driveline group.\n\"We believe that the true value of GKN is over 5 pounds per share and that Melrose's final offer fundamentally undervalues your company and should be rejected,\" Chairman Mike Turner said.\nThe offer from Melrose, which has said its bid is final, meaning it cannot now improve the terms, values GKN at 451 pence per share in cash and shares, based on Melrose's share price on Monday. GKN's stock was trading at 430 pence at 0930 GMT.\nIn a separate statement, GKN was forced to retract comments made to Sunday newspapers in which it said it thought investors would back its plan. It said the comments had not been verified.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:41:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
