Flights and trains were cancelled across both Britain and Ireland.\nLondon’s busiest railway station, Waterloo, showed more than half of trains cancelled or delay at the height of rush hour. Paddington station was closed.\nSouthern Railways said an 8-ft icicle in a tunnel was delaying services between Gatwick and Brighton.\nBritain’s Met Office warned that freezing rain was likely across southern England as Storm Emma pushes northwards from Portugal and France.
