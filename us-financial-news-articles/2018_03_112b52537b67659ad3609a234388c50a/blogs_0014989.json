President Donald Trump announced last week a plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports.\nOverall, U.S. economic activity expanded at a \"modest to moderate\" pace in January and February and price gains were moderate, the Fed said. Those assessments were similar to those from its prior Beige Book report.\nFinancial markets expect the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates later this month. Fed policymakers projected three rate increases for 2018 at a December policy meeting. They\nalso raised rates at that meeting.\nA range of Fed policymakers have argued in recent weeks that rates need to rise gradually to keep tightness in the labor market from eventually fueling high inflation.\nWhile the Beige Book report is not a systematic survey, it does reflect each district's sense of the regional economy.\nThe San Francisco Fed compiled Wednesday's report with information from the central bank's 12 districts collected on or before Feb. 26, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T21:19:16.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
