He tweeted that he will form 10100, an investment fund that will be home to his “passions, investments, ideas, and big bets.” He adds that the fund will focus on “large-scale job creation” with investments in real estate, e-commerce, and emerging innovation in China and India. In other words, this says everything and nothing at the same time. It covers a lot of ground, but I’m working on getting more details.\nKalanick will invest his own capital, and he has plenty of it. His new fund comes on the heels of the news that he sold 29% (worth about $1.4 billion) of his stake in Uber. As he begins this next chapter, it’s not likely Kalanick will make a play to come back to Uber and “Steve Jobs” it.\n#StartWithEight: We all know the stats. Only 2% of venture funding went to female founders in 2017, and just 8% of partners at the top venture capital firms are women. In honor of International Women’s Day, venture firm Alpha Edison wrote a Medium post about “doing something about these statistics through action.”\nThe post urges male and female investors to take meetings with eight women outside of their networks in the month of March. So far, 29 firms, including Canaan Partners, 8VC, and Flybridge Capital Partners, have signed the pledge to do so. People have also started using the hashtag #StartWithEight to highlight female founders and investors in the industry.
