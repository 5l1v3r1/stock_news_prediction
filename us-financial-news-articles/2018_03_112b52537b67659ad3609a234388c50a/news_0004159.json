Neither company could be reached immediately for comment.\nAlvean was seen buying about 7,945 lots and Wilmar receiving about 6,670 lots, the traders said.\nSingaporeâ€™s Wilmar has developed a strategy of sourcing sugar through the physical deliveries against the futures contract since first buying an ICE delivery in March 2013. Alvean, a joint venture between agribusiness Cargill Inc and Brazilian sugarcane cooperative Copersucar, has emerged as a buyer of recent expiries.\nThe exchange was due to publish the official data on the delivery on Thursday.\nThe March contract on ICE jumped 0.51 cent, or 3.6 percent, to finish at 13.48 cents per lb on its final day of trade. That put it at a premium of 0.10 cent per lb above the May futures contract.
