(OTCQB:MRIC) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFull-Year and Fourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nTotal revenue increased 28% to $7.4 million for 2017, from $5.7 million in 2016, reflecting a 34% increase in functional neurology sales, and a 50% increase in capital equipment sales; Gross margin increased to 61% for the full year, compared with 54% in 2016; Net loss full year 2017 declined 12% to $7.1 million, as compared with $8.1 million in 2016; Completed a record 629 procedures using the ClearPoint Neuro Navigational System, an increase of 25%; Grew the installed base of ClearPoint Systems to 52 centers in the U.S., including the Company’s seventh top-ten children’s hospital; Furthered research and development efforts with partners toward the development of new therapeutic applications for intra-cranial hemorrhage and pancreatic cancer; Participated in a One Room-One Procedure laser ablation Practical Clinic during the Congress of Neurological Surgeons; and Announced the appointment of Joseph Burnett as President and Chief Executive Officer.\n“MRI reported another year of strong growth and thoughtful transformation in 2017, driven by our fifth year in a row of significant procedure and revenue growth, as well as the evolution of our strategic plan to go deeper into our own therapeutic products,” commented Joe Burnett, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our core functional neurology business grew revenue 34%, to $5.3 million, and procedure volume ramped 25% to a record 629 cases. Our biologics and drug delivery partnerships continued to advance through the regulatory process in examples such as Voyager Therapeutics. We also signed multiple new partnerships as the premier live-MRI guidance and navigation partner for drug delivery companies. Capital sales and service grew 50% as a testament to the interest in acquiring access to our technology and hospitals willing to put skin in the game for that access.\n“We now look to 2018 with expectations for another year of strong revenue growth in all three of our product areas: functional neurology, biologics and drug delivery, and capital sales and service. Also, we anticipate the introduction of two new product families to clinical usage, including the commercial release of our ClearPoint 2.0 fusion software and the first human case of our intracerebral hemorrhage therapy product in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic. We believe that these additions to our platform, in concert with streamlining our marketing and product development processes and capabilities, will improve workflow efficiency while staying true to our commitment to precision and sub-millimetric accuracy under live MRI-guidance. We expect that these advancements and our focus on continued growth in procedures will enable us to lead the movement toward minimally invasive therapy procedures in the brain, as we have seen take place in other medical device markets including cardiology.”\nFinancial Results – Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFunctional neurology revenue, which consists of disposable product sales related to cases utilizing the ClearPoint system, increased 34% to $5.3 million from $4.0 million in 2016. This increase was due primarily to a 25% increase in the utilization of the ClearPoint system, to a record 629 cases during 2017, from 504 cases in 2016.\nBiologics and drug delivery systems revenue, which consists primarily of disposable product sales related to customer-sponsored clinical trials utilizing the ClearPoint system, was $563,000, as compared with $771,000 in 2016. This fluctuation arose due to $222,000 in advance purchases of such products by Voyager Therapeutics (“Voyager”) in late 2016, which have been subsequently used in Voyager’s clinical trials.\nCapital equipment revenue, consisting of sales, rentals and service of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software, increased 50%, to $1.5 million, from $980,000 in 2016. This increase was due primarily to increases in equipment sales, new equipment rental revenue and equipment service contract revenue.\nGross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved to 61% from 54% in 2016. The increase was due primarily to a favorable mix of revenue in 2017, relative to 2016. Also contributing to the increase were lower costs for scrap, expired product and reserves for inventory obsolescence during 2017, relative to 2016.\nResearch and development costs were $2.8 million for year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.6 million in 2016, an increase of $186,000, or 7%. The increase was due primarily to payments, the majority of which were in shares of the Company’s common stock, required under certain license and product co-development agreements entered into in April 2017, that were partially offset by decreases in software development and intellectual property-related costs, and in personnel costs.\nSales and marketing expenses were $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.8 million in 2016, an increase of $179,000, or 5%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.2 million for in 2016, a decrease of $144,000, or 3%. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in professional fees and stock-based compensation, that were partially offset by costs incurred in connection with recruiting and hiring Mr. Burnett in November 2017.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded gains of $25,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities. Such derivative liabilities related to the terms of certain warrants issued in 2012 and 2013, and in connection with amendments the Company made to certain note payable agreements in 2016, discussed further below.\nIn April 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Brainlab AG (“Brainlab”) under which the note payable to Brainlab was restructured and reissued. As a result, the Company recorded a debt restructuring gain of $941,000.\nIn June 2016, the Company entered into the amendments with Brainlab and with certain holders of the Company’s 2014 junior secured notes payable (the “2014 Note Holders”). Based on the provisions of these amendments, on June 30, 2016, the Company recorded a debt restructuring loss of $820,000.\nIn August 2016, the Company entered into additional amendments with the 2014 Note Holders. Based on the provisions of these amendments, on August 30, 2016, the Company recorded a debt restructuring loss of $933,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded other income of $17,000, as compared with other income of $216,000 recorded during 2016, representing a decrease of $199,000, or 92%. This decrease was due primarily to grant income from a U.S. federal agency of $203,000 earned from a project in process during the 2016, which was discontinued by the agency later in 2016. The Company has not since undertaken any additional such projects.\nNet interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $873,000, compared with $1.1 million for 2016. The decrease was due primarily to the conversion of an aggregate $1.74 million in principal balance of notes held by the 2014 Note Holders in connection with the Company’s completion of a private placement of equity units in September 2016.\nFinancial Results – Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nFunctional neurology revenue increased 23%, to $1.3 million from $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was due primarily to a 26% increase in the number of cases using the ClearPoint system, to 160 cases in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 128 cases during the same period in 2016.\nDrug delivery product revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $120,000, a decline of 63% as compared with $327,000 during the same period in 2016, reflecting the previously mentioned $222,000 purchase of drug delivery cannulas and related products by Voyager in 2016.\nCapital equipment revenue was $291,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared with $272,000 during the same period in 2016.\nGross margin for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 improved to 61% from 59% for the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to a favorable mix of revenues during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, relative to the same period in 2016.\nResearch and development costs were $582,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $530,000 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $52,000, or 10%. The increase during the fourth quarter of 2017, in comparison to the same period in 2016, was due primarily to increases in personnel, regulatory and software development costs, that were partially offset by decreases in intellectual property costs.\nSales and marketing expenses were $1.0 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $946,000 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $65,000, or 7%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in exhibit activity during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, relative to the same period in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.3 million for each of the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, primarily attributable to decreases in professional fees and stock-based compensation being offset by costs incurred in connection with recruiting and hiring Mr. Burnett in November 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a loss of $23,000, and during the same period in 2016, the Company recorded a gain of $318,000, resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities. Such derivative liabilities related to the terms of certain warrants issued in 2012 and 2013, and in connection with the amendments the Company made to certain note payable agreements in 2016, discussed further above.\nNet interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $236,000, compared with $215,000 for 2016. The increase was due primarily to an increase during the three months ended December 31, 2017, relative to the same period in 2016, in the amortization of discounts on the Company’s notes payable.\nTeleconference Information\nInvestors and analysts are invited to listen to a live broadcast review of the Company's 2017 fourth quarter and full year financial results today at 4:15 p.m. Eastern time (1:15 p.m. Pacific time) that may be accessed by visiting the Company's website at www.mriinterventions.com and selecting “Investors” / “News” / “IR Calendar.” The conference call may also be accessed at https://78449.themediaframe.com/dataconf/productusers/mric/mediaframe/23404/indexl.html .
