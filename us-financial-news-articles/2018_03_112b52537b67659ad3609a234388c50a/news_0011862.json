While China produces about half of the world's steel , it is not among the top five exporters to the U.S. It ranks number 11, according to the International Trade Administration.\nThe levies will instead hit American allies including Canada, South Korea and Mexico, who comprise 16, 10 and 9 percent of U.S. steel imports, respectively. More details on the tariffs, including potential exemptions, may emerge in the coming week.\nStill, the measures would be \"indirectly credit negative for the Asian steel industry,\" Moody's wrote, since a reduction in export volumes to the U.S. would make steelmakers divert their output elsewhere, \"in turn intensifying competition in Asia.\"\nAnalysts predict that China is likely to hit back by raising tariffs on U.S. products that would hurt American exporters, particularly in the agricultural sector. The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.\nTweet1\nThe proposed measures, which come under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 , would impose a 25 percent levy on all steel imports and a 10 percent levy on aluminum imports . The U.S. currently imports 30 percent of its steel, and a longtime global supply glut has led the country's steel industry heads to call for a clampdown on foreign imports.\nAs part of his campaign promise to salvage long-struggling U.S. industries, Trump has defended the move as a boon to American jobs. Critics, meanwhile, say it will raise costs on downstream producers of goods that use the materials, while simultaneously risking a trade war.\nIn the long-term, however, tariffs on steel and aluminum \"could signal a marked deterioration in global trade relations,\" the ratings agency warned, depending on how other countries respond and to what extent they choose to retaliate.\n\"While not our baseline scenario, Asia as a trade-reliant region would be vulnerable to a marked slowdown in global trade.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MoodysInvSvc/status/969476669449777152?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet", "https://www.worldsteel.org/media-centre/press-releases/2017/world-steel-in-figures-2017.html", "https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2018/02/secretary-ross-releases-steel-and-aluminum-232-reports-coordination"], "published": "2018-03-02T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T16:32:17.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
