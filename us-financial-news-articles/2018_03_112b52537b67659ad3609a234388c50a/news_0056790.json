Some Tesla owners had complained about the issue on online forums.\nSome 123,000 Model S vehicles globally contain the bolts, Tesla said.\n“We have observed excessive corrosion in the power steering bolts, though only in very cold climates, particularly those that frequently use calcium or magnesium road salts, rather than sodium chloride (table salt),” Tesla wrote in an email to customers.\nWere the bolts to fail, the driver would still able to steer the car but would need to use more force “due to loss or reduction of power assist,” Tesla wrote.\nA retrofit in Tesla service centers should take about an hour, Tesla said.
