Facebook Partner Categories provides audience targeting options by leveraging third-party data providers, including Acxiom’s Audience Solutions division.\n“Today, more than ever, it is important for businesses to be able to rely upon companies that understand the critical importance of ethically sourced data and strong data governance. These are among Acxiom’s core strengths,” said Acxiom CEO Scott Howe. “It will always be true that the ethical use of data creates tremendous value for both businesses and consumers.”\nFinancial Impact\nAcxiom does not expect this change to impact its fiscal 2018 guidance.\nThe Company intends to provide fiscal 2019 guidance on its fourth quarter earnings call. However, given the change at Facebook, it is updating its preliminary fiscal 2019 guidance as follows:\nAcxiom now expects total revenue and profitability to be negatively impacted by as much as $25 million. However, the Company continues to expect its LiveRamp segment to grow by at least 30% year-over-year.\nThese estimates are based on our current understanding of Facebook’s new guidelines and could change materially.\nAbout Acxiom\nAcxiom provides the data foundation for the world’s best marketers.
