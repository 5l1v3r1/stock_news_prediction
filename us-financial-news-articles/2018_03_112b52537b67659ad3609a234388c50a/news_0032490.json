Energy companies are rising with the price of oil while technology companies are slipping. While retailers are mostly higher, jewelry chain Tiffany is falling after a weak sales report and disappointing forecast. The S&P 500 has slipped for four days in a row and is still down 1 percent this week.\nKEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index gained 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,752 as of 1:45 p.m. Eastern time.

The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks jumped 7 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,584.\nAfter a dramatic drop at the beginning of February followed by a rapid recovery of some of their losses, stocks haven't done that much over the last month. Positive news about the economy has been countered by concerns about rising tensions over international trade. The Dow, which surged past 26,000 in mid-January, has been wobbling around 25,000 for about a month and a half.\nLOOKING GOOD: Ulta Beauty climbed $14.64, or 7.1 percent, to $220.78 after the beauty products retailer's fourth quarter report.

Its forecast for the current year was also below what investors were looking for.\nOVERSTOCK SINKS: Online discount retailer Overstock.com said profit margins have fallen hard because of competition with Wayfair, and CEO Patrick Byrne said the company will \"respond in kind,\" meaning Overstock will try to ramp up its growth and will be willing to lose money to achieve that goal. The stock dropped $3.68, or 7.6 percent, to $44.53 while Wayfair lost $5.24, or 6.2 percent, to $78.72.\nFED AHEAD: The top policymakers at the Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday, and they are expected   again.
