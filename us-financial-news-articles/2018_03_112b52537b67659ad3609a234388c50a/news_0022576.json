In a statement, Don Meyer, co-head of the Northwest Seaport Alliance—made up of the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, Wash.—said retaliatory actions could hurt the region’s agriculture and manufacturing exporters.\n“As a state in which 40% of our jobs are tied to international trade, we are risking jobs and quality of life by levying blanket tariffs against some of our most important trading partners and opening the door to their retaliation.”\nThe NWSA port handled more than $6.8 billion in agricultural and forest product exports in 2016.\n‘ In the long term, we could see a loss in cargo volume and all the jobs that depend on it ’\n—Jonathan Gold, National Retail Federation. Jonathan Gold, vice president for supply chain and customs policy with the National Retail Federation, said in a statement that the tariffs will have an immediate impact on consumer prices, canceling out the gains from tax reform.\n“In the long term, we could see a loss in cargo volume and all the jobs that depend on it, from dockworkers on down through the supply chain,” he said.\nSome logistics operators behind North America’s vast, interconnected supply chains don’t appear deterred by Washington’s tough trade stance.\nIllinois-based logistics operator SEKO Logistics expanded into Mexico this week, and Chief Executive James Gagne says the company isn’t fazed by slow-moving negotiations on resetting the North American Free Trade Agreement and suggestions.\n“We will figure out how to navigate any relevant tariff or trade barriers that may come into play,” Mr. Gagne said in an interview. “Particularly in Mexico, Canada and the U.S., the interdependence and coupling of these economies is extraordinary. If there’s any interest by governments to try to decouple that for the satisfaction of a constituency, I must say I think it will be extremely difficult, at best.”\nWrite to Erica E.
