Iron and steel fell 1.25 percent and non-ferrous metals shed 0.45 percent.\nThese sectors underperformed, seen suffering if U.S. President Donald Trump follows through with the threat of imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.\nThe resignation of top U.S. economic adviser Gary Cohn, seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces within the Trump camp, was expected to give White House trade sceptics the upper hand.\nShares of defence equipment companies sagged after tensions in the Korean Peninsula eased amid a perceived thawing of regional tensions, following news on Tuesday that South Korea would hold its first summit with the North in more than a decade.\nIshikawa Seisakusho Ltd lost 16.6 percent. Howa Machinery Ltd, which makes firearms as well as machine tools and construction equipment, plunged up to 18.3 percent. Nippon Avionics Co, maker of command and control systems for naval vessels, retreated 4.1 percent.
