But to be able to secure one more gold medal in the world championships is a crazy feeling.”\nWorld outdoor champion Kendricks said he was“ecstatic” with silver after just losing out to his great friend.\n“Every time cannot be your day to win but I bow out to Renaud and understand that he is a great indoor jumper and he made those jumps when it was crucial. On Friday I said it would take something special to win and that was it,” he said.\nReporting by Neil Robinson, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T13:16:15.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
