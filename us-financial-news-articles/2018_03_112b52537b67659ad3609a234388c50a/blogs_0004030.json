Amtrak service on the Northeast Corridor remains canceled until at least tomorrow including Keystone Service. \nAmtrak: Despite our best effort to restore service between BOS and WAS today, we have determined at this time it is not safe to do so. Hazardous conditions for our customers & crews have led us to cancel all Amtrak service on the Northeast Corridor until tomorrow. We sincerely apologize. \nEarlier Friday, Amtrak temporarily suspended service on routes between Boston and Washington until 6 p.m. But as the late winter storm, which brought high winds and a mix of snow and freezing rains to the U.S. Northeast, continued unabated, Amtrak was forced to extend its cancellations.\nAmtrak: Amtrak service southbound out of WAS is also suspended until at least tomorrow morning due to multiple downed trees blocking the freight line's tracks that we operate on. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, \nA spokesman for Amtrak services said there was no threat of service in the Chicago area being disrupted due to weather. \nThe National Weather Service on Friday at 5:19 p.m. ET issued flood advisory warnings to the New York City area, which are expected to remain in effect until Sunday.\nFive people have been killed by storm-related causes, law enforcement officials told NBC.\nThis story is developing.
