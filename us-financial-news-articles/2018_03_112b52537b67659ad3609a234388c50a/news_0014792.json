Express Gifts is Findel’s largest business.\nAs part of these discussions, Liam Rowley, Sports Direct’s head of strategic investments will attend board meetings as an observer. Findel said Rowley’s role does not constitute a seat on its board.\n“We remain a supportive and long-term shareholder in Findel and see significant benefits from developing a deeper commercial agreement,” said Rowley.\nFindel shares were up 8 pence at 223.5 pence at 0848 GMT, valuing the business at 191.4 million pounds ($264.73 million). Shares in Sports Direct were up 1.5 percent, valuing it at about 2 billion pounds.
