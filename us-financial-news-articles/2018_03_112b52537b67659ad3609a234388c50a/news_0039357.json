REUTERS/Mike Blake The casino mogul’s share sale comes a week after Wynn Resorts said Steve and Elaine Wynn, who has a 9.26 percent stake, had scrapped a shareholder agreement that prevented them from selling their stakes. Steve Wynn resigned as CEO of the Las Vegas-based company last month, following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances. He has denied the accusations. Analysts have said Wynn Resorts may become a takeover target following the departure of Steve Wynn, who was a strategic visionary and the chief diplomat for the company. Elaine Wynn said in a regulatory filing earlier this week that she may hold talks with Wynn Resorts shareholders and management regarding the company’s strategy, capital structure and allocation, and board composition, among others.
