The main left-wing opposition Socialists (MSZP) are running third on around 10 percent. Orban, who is campaigning on a nationalist agenda with a strong anti-immigration focus, will seek a third consecutive term in the April 8 ballot. Zavecz said 56 percent of the electorate had definite plans to vote, up from 46 percent in February.
