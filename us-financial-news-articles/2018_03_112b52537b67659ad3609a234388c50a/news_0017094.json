Cape Town faces “Day Zero” on July 9 when its taps could run dry.\nThe firm declared an interim dividend of 26.56 cents per share, compared with 24.21 cents per share a year ago.\n$1 = 11.8309 rand Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath and Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:25:26.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
