IHS Markit said panelists reported that domestic as well as overseas clients in February showed more demand.\nManufacturers, expecting growth could be maintained, hired more staff for the first time in six months.\nThe hiring was at the“sharpest extent in 18 months, signaling confidence that demand is strong enough to warrant increased production capacity,” said Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit.\nIn February, manufacturers faced higher input costs due to increased labour and raw material costs, which meant tighter profit margins.\nHayes said that“selling price inflation eased, while input prices increased sharply,” causing firms to boost input buying during February with expectations that the upward trend in raw material prices would continue.
