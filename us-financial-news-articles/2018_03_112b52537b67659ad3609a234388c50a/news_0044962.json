Eastern European currencies including Poland’s zloty and Hungary’s forint tracked gains made by the euro overnight.\nEM investors were back buying both in local and hard currency debt markets.\nIndia’s rally saw its 10-year bond yields drop to as much as 7.3565 percent from 7.62 percent.\nIt marked the lowest since late January, was the biggest one-day fall since December 9, 2013 and helped repair some of the damage done this year by a string of banking sector problems and nerves over rising inflation.\nBesides a lower than expected borrowing number, investors also cheered the government’s decision to issue bonds uniformly spread across different maturities in contrast to the previous format where large chunks were concentrated in the 10-14 year tenure, traders said.\n“India has been a laggard” in the rally in local EM debt this year said Kevin Daly at Aberdeen Standard Investments, “but we think it is pretty attractive at these levels.”\nElsewhere, South Africa’s rand gave back roughly half the gains it had made on Monday after the country dodged a long-feared credit ratings downgrade.\nTraders were also gearing up for a widely expected rate cut on Wednesday while the news was still generally upbeat. S&P Global doubled its economic growth forecast for the country this year to 2 percent from 1 percent.\n“This is partly due to strengthening domestic and foreign investor sentiment following a change in the country’s leadership and ensuing policy announcements,” it said.\nBrazil’s real held firm after a court rejected an appeal by former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to have a conviction for corruption overturned.\nLula remains Brazil’s most popular politician according to polls, but his high spending policies often unsettled markets during his tenure. If he is jailed, he would be unable to fight in Brazil’s October elections.\n“We think he has no chance of running, I think the market was expecting the appeal to fail as well,” said Aberdeen Standard’s Daly.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see)\nReporting by Marc Jones, graphic by Karin Strohecker in Munich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T13:17:00.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
