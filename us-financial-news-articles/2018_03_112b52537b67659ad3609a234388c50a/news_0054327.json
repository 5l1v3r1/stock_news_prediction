The producer price index would have fallen by 0.2 percent had the exchange rate stayed constant.\nPrices for energy and petroleum products fell by 1.8 percent on lower prices for light fuel oils, diesel fuel and gasoline.\nThe raw materials price index dropped by 0.3 percent on lower prices for crude energy products.\nReporting by David Ljunggren; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:20:07.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
