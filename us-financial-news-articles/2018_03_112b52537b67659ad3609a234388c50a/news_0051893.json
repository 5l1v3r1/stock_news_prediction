REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/Files Ties between London and Moscow are badly strained by the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. Britain alleges Russia was to blame, but Moscow says it had no involvement.\n“An analysis of all the circumstances ... leads us to think of the possible involvement in it (the poisoning) of the British intelligence services,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.\n“If convincing evidence to the contrary is not presented to the Russian side we will consider that we are dealing with an attempt on the lives of our citizens as a result of a massive political provocation.”\nReporting by Katya Golubkova; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T13:29:46.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
