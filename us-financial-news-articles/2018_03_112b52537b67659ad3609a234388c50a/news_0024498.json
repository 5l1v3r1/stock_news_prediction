Small aircraft ply an extensive domestic network and often run into trouble at remote airstrips.\n“So far 49 people are dead and 22 are undergoing treatment at different hospitals,” Sanjiv Gautam, executive director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), told reporters.\nSeveral people were rescued from the burning wreckage of the Bombardier Q400 series aircraft and are undergoing treatment at hospitals, army spokesman Gokul Bhandari said.\nChettri said that moments after the plane received permission to land, the pilot said he wanted to go in a northern direction. Asked by the control tower if there was a problem, he replied in the negative.\nThe plane was then seen making two rounds in a northeast direction, Chettri said. Traffic controllers again asked the pilot if things were OK, and he replied, “Yes”.\nThe tower then told the pilot his alignment was not correct, but there was no reply, Chettri added.\n“The plane should have come from the right direction,” Chettri said, adding that it hit the airport fence, touched the ground and then caught fire.\nIt was not immediately clear if the pilot had issued a “Mayday” call, or distress signal.\nUS-Bangla Airlines’ Asif, however, said that wrong signals might have led to the crash.\nA wreckage of a US-Bangla airplane is seen at the crash site at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal March 12, 2018. REUTERS/ Navesh Chitrakar “A three-minute conversation between the pilot and the air traffic control before the landing indicated that they sent wrong signal to the pilot,” he told reporters in Dhaka.\nSERIES OF ACCIDENTS Many of the bodies that lay on the tarmac, covered with cloth, were charred, witnesses said. Thick plumes of smoke could be seen from the aircraft at the Tribhuvan International Airport.\nThose on board include 12 Nepali tour agents who were returning after an annual sales conference in Bangladesh, an official said.\nThe aircraft that went down on Monday was 17 years old, data from tracking website Flightradar24.com showed. It descended to an airport altitude of 4,400 feet (1,341 m) and then climbed to 6,600 feet (2,012 m) before crashing about two minutes later, the website said.\nSlideshow (24 Images) Bombardier said on Twitter it was saddened by the accident.\n“Our thoughts are with those injured, and their families,” it said.\nThere have been a series of accidents at Kathmandu in the past.\nIn March 2014, a flock of birds shattered the windshield of a Malaysia Airlines jet as it landed in Kathmandu. The same month, a rear wheel of an Airbus A320 operated by an Indian budget airline caught fire after landing.\nIn 2012, a plane carrying trekkers to Mount Everest region hit a bird and crashed in Kathmandu, killing all on board.\nIn 1992, all 113 people aboard were killed when a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok crashed while trying to land in Kathmandu.\nUS-Bangla Airlines is a unit of the US-Bangla Group, a U.S. Bangladeshi joint venture company.\nThe two pilots and two cabin crew were Bangladeshi nationals, airline spokesman Kamrul Islam said in Dhaka.\n“Our team will fly to Nepal as soon as the airport is open,” he added. “We are in touch with Nepali authorities.”\nThe Bangladeshi carrier, which launched operations in July 2014 with a slogan - “Fly Fast-Fly Safe”, operates Bombardier and Boeing aircraft.\nMap of Nepal air crash here\nAdditional reporting by Navesh Chitrakar; Ruma Paul in DHAKA; Sudarshan Varadhan and Aditi Shah in NEW DELHI; Writing by Krishna N.
