He said he has no personal animosity toward rival investor William Ackman who spent six years betting against the nutrition company’s future.\nIcahn said he had been thinking about possibly putting up a slate of directors at Newell which makes Rubbermaid containers, Diamond matches, Yankee Candles and Sharpie markers. But before the nomination deadline he realized someone else was thinking the same thing. “I‘m going to be the third horse in a three horse race. I just decided why should I get into it?”\nWhile he declined to quantify his position in Newell, he said he owns “one of the larger positions,” and that he may be influential in deciding who wins the proxy contest.\nIcahn has not returned a call to expand on the comments he made on CNBC.\nRival activist investment firm Starboard Value LP, which owns about 4 percent of Newell, last month announced plans to oust Newell’s entire board, including the CEO.\nThe company’s shares were up 3.2 percent at $26.52 in afternoon trading.. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIcahn said he has not sold a single share of the roughly 23 million Herbalife shares he owns. “I‘m bullish on the company,” he said, adding “But I don’t go out and say what I‘m going to do with my stocks.”\nOn Wednesday, Ackman said he had ended his battle against Herbalife which cost him and his clients hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. He called the company a fraud, saying it was running an illegal pyramid scheme where distributors earn more for wooing new recruits than for selling the products.\nIcahn said Ackman called him on Wednesday to tell him the news that he was out and congratulated him as the stock price surged. “It was a classy thing,” Icahn said about Ackman after having once called him a “crybaby in the schoolyard.”\nReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Boston and Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T20:45:20.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
