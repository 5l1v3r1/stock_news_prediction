(\"Spark\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:SPKE), an independent retail energy services company, today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nKey Business Highlights\nAchieved record Net Income, Retail Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2017 Recorded $102.9 million in Adjusted EBITDA, $224.5 million in Retail Gross Margin, and $76.3 million in Net Income for the year ended 2017, representing year-over-year increases of 26%, 23%, and 16%, respectively Recorded $28.9 million in Adjusted EBITDA, $66.2 million in Retail Gross Margin, and $47.5 million in Net Income for the fourth quarter, representing year-over-year increases of 17%, 13%, and 97%, respectively Total RCE count increased 35% year-over-year to a record 1,042,000 as of December 31, 2017 Overall attrition of 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 Closed three acquisitions in 2017 Two new acquisitions announced thus far in 2018 with a total of approximately 80,000 RCEs Expanded the senior credit facility to $200.0 million in commitments Continue to simplify, streamline, and optimize the organization Engaged Morgan Stanley as financial advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives\n“We are extremely proud to have delivered another year of record financial results despite unfavorable weather throughout the year,” said Nathan Kroeker, Spark Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We saw a mild summer and several severe weather events, including a devastating hurricane, but Spark was able to increase RCE count and improve both top and bottom line financial performance.\n“During 2017, we completed three acquisitions, highlighted by the acquisition of Verde in July. We put a new credit facility in place and have added six new banks and a total of $185.0 million in commitments, which has since grown to $200.0 million in early 2018. In addition, we recently completed a $50.0 million follow-on offering of our Series A Preferred Stock. We launched a company-wide initiative to further integrate acquisitions and realize significant cost-to-serve synergies, including the early termination of the Verde earnout.\n“As we move through 2018, we continue to strategically add customers and pursue additional opportunities to further streamline our business model. In March 2018, we agreed to acquire a small competitor in the Northeast as well as a book of customers from an affiliate of our sponsor. We expect both to be immediately accretive to Adjusted EBITDA. Our sponsor also agreed to reintegrate Retailco Services back into Spark, which will simplify our structure and result in immediate and substantial cash savings to the Company.”\n“Finally, our Board of Directors has engaged Morgan Stanley as a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives. We believe that our stock price has not reflected the strong growth in financial performance we have shown over the past three and a half years as a public company, and look forward to examining additional opportunities to unlock shareholder value.”\nSummary Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Spark reported Adjusted EBITDA of $28.9 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $24.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This increase of $4.1 million is primarily attributable to additional volumes from the Verde and Perigee acquisitions.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Spark reported Retail Gross Margin of $66.2 million compared to Retail Gross Margin of $58.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This increase of $7.4 million is primarily attributable to the increased volumes of retail electricity following the Verde and Perigee acquisitions.\nNet income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $47.5 million compared to net income of $24.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher retail gross margin and the revaluation of the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of the new tax legislation.\nSummary Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Spark reported Adjusted EBITDA of $102.9 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase of $21.0 million is primarily attributable to additional volumes from the Verde and Perigee acquisitions and a full year of the Provider and Major acquisitions, partially offset by milder-than-normal weather.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Spark reported Retail Gross Margin of $224.5 million compared to Retail Gross Margin of $182.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase of $42.1 million is primarily attributable to additional volumes from the Verde and Perigee acquisitions and a full year of the Provider and Major acquisitions, partially offset by milder-than-normal weather.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $76.3 million compared to net income of $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher volumes from the acquisitions and the revaluation of the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of the new tax legislation.\nStrategic Update\nOn March 1, 2018, Spark acquired a retail electric provider with approximately 29,000 RCEs serving electricity and natural gas customers in the Northeast and Midwest. The transaction is immediately accretive to 2018 earnings and requires minimal integration.\nOn March 7, 2018, Spark entered into an agreement with National Gas & Electric, LLC, (\"NG&E\"), an affiliate of Retailco, LLC, the Company's majority owner, for the acquisition of approximately 50,000 RCEs for approximately $12.5 million in cash. The transaction, which was reviewed and approved by a special committee made up of independent members of the Company's board of directors, is scheduled to close in April of this year.\nOn March 7, 2018, Spark agreed to reintegrate the employees and operations of Retailco Services, LLC (\"Retailco\"), which is wholly owned by W. Keith Maxwell III. Retailco was formed in 2015 to provide a variety of back office functions, including customer operations and information technology services, at a lower cost than Spark was realizing at the time. Retailco has been able to reduce the cost per customer over the past two years, and Spark expects to realize additional savings by reintegrating the two companies. This reintegration, which was reviewed and approved by a special committee of independent directors of the Company's board of directors, is scheduled to occur on April 1, 2018, and is expected to be accretive to 2018 earnings. Mr. Maxwell will receive no consideration for this transaction.\nAs previously announced, Spark terminated the Verde Energy earnout agreement on January 12, 2018. This transaction allowed Spark to begin integration of Verde's operations sooner than originally anticipated, which the Company believes should result in significant operational costs savings.\nAs mentioned above, the Board of Directors of Spark has retained Morgan Stanley as a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives.\nOutlook\nSpark expects full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to be similar to that of 2017. The Company will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions, integrate recent acquisitions, drive operational performance improvements, and look to expand its geographic footprint.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n($ in thousands) December 31, 2017\nCash and cash equivalents $ 29,419 Senior Credit Facility Availability (1) 12,501 Subordinated Debt Availability (2) $ 25,000 Total Liquidity $ 66,920 (1) Subject to Senior Credit Facility borrowing base and covenant restrictions.\n(2) The availability of the Subordinated Debt Facility provided by Spark’s founder is dependent on his financial position and liquidity. The Company may use the Subordinated Facility from time to time to enhance short-term liquidity but does not view the Subordinated Debt Facility as a material source of liquidity.\nSince the beginning of 2018, Spark has increased the commitments on its credit facility by $15.0 million to $200.0 million. As previously mentioned, Spark also raised an additional $48.9 million in net proceeds in an offering of Series A Preferred Stock in January 2018.\nDividend\nSpark’s Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.18125 per share of Class A common stock payable on March 16, 2018, and $0.546875 per share of Series A Preferred Stock payable on April 16, 2018. Investors are reminded that on June 16, 2017, Spark completed a two-for-one stock split by means of a stock dividend.\nConference Call and Webcast\nSpark will host a conference call to discuss year end and fourth quarter 2017 results on Friday, March 9, 2018, at 10:00 AM Central Time (11:00 AM Eastern).\nA live webcast of the conference call can be accessed from the Events & Presentations page of the Spark Energy Investor Relations website at http://ir.sparkenergy.com/events-and-presentations .

EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before provision for income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. We deduct all current period customer acquisition costs (representing spending for organic customer acquisitions) in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred, even though we capitalize such costs and amortize them over two years in accordance with our accounting policies. The deduction of current period customer acquisition costs is consistent with how we manage our business, but the comparability of Adjusted EBITDA between periods may be affected by varying levels of customer acquisition costs. For example, our Adjusted EBITDA is lower in years of customer growth reflecting larger customer acquisition spending. We do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of business or portfolios of customers in calculated Adjusted EBITDA. We deduct our net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, excluding current period cash settlements, from the Adjusted EBITDA calculation in order to remove the non-cash impact of net gains and losses on derivative instruments. We also deduct non-cash compensation expense as a result of restricted stock units that are issued under our long-term incentive plan.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors as a financial indicator of our ability to incur and service debt, pay dividends and fund capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our condensed consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, commercial banks and rating agencies, use to assess the following:\nour operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends; and our ability to fund capital expenditures (including customer acquisition costs) and incur and service debt.\nRetail Gross Margin\nWe define retail gross margin as operating income (loss) plus (i) depreciation and amortization expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses, less (i) net asset optimization revenues, (ii) net gains (losses) on non-trading derivative instruments, and (iii) net current period cash settlements on non-trading derivative instruments. Retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity business by removing the impacts of our asset optimization activities and net non-cash income (loss) impact of our economic hedging activities. As an indicator of our retail energy business’ operating performance, retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business's operating performance.\nThe GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Retail Gross Margin is operating income (loss). Our non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities, or operating income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and have important limitations as analytical tools. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or Retail Gross Margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, and are defined differently by different companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management’s decision-making process.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities for each of the periods indicated.\nAPPENDIX TABLES A-1 AND A-2\nADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATIONS\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited) Year Ended December 31, Quarter Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to\nNet Income: Net income 76,281 65,673 $ 47,536 $ 24,137 Depreciation and amortization 42,341 32,788 11,906 9,451 Interest expense 11,134 8,859 2,374 6,004 Income tax expense 37,528 10,426 32,263 3,574 EBITDA (1) 167,284 117,746 94,079 43,166 Less: Net, Gains (losses) on derivative instruments 5,008 22,407 39,233 19,520 Net, Cash settlements on derivative instruments 16,309 (2,146 ) (2,499 ) (5,573 ) Customer acquisition costs 25,874 24,934 7,232 9,717 Plus: — Non-cash compensation expense 5,058 5,242 1,035 1,215 Contract termination charge related to\nMajor Energy Companies change of\ncontrol — 4,099 — 4,099 Change in Tax Receivable Agreement liability (1) (22,267 ) — $ (22,267 ) $ — Adjusted EBITDA (2) 102,884 81,892 $ 28,881 $ 24,816 (1) Represents the change in the value of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability due to U.S. Tax Reform.\n(2) Includes $9.6 million and $1.1 million related to the change in fair value as the result of the revaluation of the Major Earnout liability at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, Quarter Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net\ncash provided by operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 63,912 $ 67,793 $ 88 $ 6,150 Amortization of deferred financing costs (1,035 ) (668 ) (285 ) (203 ) Allowance for doubtful accounts and bad\ndebt expense (6,550 ) (1,261 ) (3,114 ) (419 ) Interest expense 11,134 8,859 2,374 6,004 Income tax expense 37,528 10,426 32,263 3,574 Change in Tax Receivable Agreement liability (1) (22,267 ) — (22,267 ) — Changes in operating working capital Accounts receivable, prepaids, current assets 31,905 12,135 48,989 31,362 Inventory 718 542 (1,218 ) 1,110 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (13,672 ) (17,653 ) (21,808 ) (23,507 ) Other 1,211 1,719 (6,141 ) 745 Adjusted EBITDA $ 102,884 $ 81,892 $ 28,881 $ 24,816 Cash Flow Data: Cash flows provided by operating activity $ 63,912 $ 67,793 $ 88 $ 6,150 Cash flows used in investing activity (97,757 ) (36,344 ) (1,780 ) (2,169 ) Cash flows provided by (used in) financing\nactivity 44,304 (16,963 ) 19,862 (1,928 ) (1) Represents the change in the value of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability due to U.S. Tax Reform.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Retail Gross Margin to operating income (loss) for each of the periods indicated.\nAPPENDIX TABLE A-3\nRETAIL GROSS MARGIN RECONCILIATION\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited) Year Ended December 31, Quarter Ended 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Reconciliation of Retail Gross Margin to\nOperating Income: Operating income $ 102,420 $ 84,001 $ 59,752 $ 33,098 Depreciation and amortization 42,341 32,788 11,906 9,451 General and administrative 101,127 84,964 31,722 29,776 Less: Net asset optimization (expenses) revenues (717 ) (586 ) (36 ) (544 ) Net, Losses (gains) on non-trading\nderivative instruments 5,588 22,254 39,734 19,735 Net, Cash settlements on non-trading\nderivative instruments 16,508 (2,284 ) (2,508 ) (5,625 ) Retail Gross Margin $ 224,509 $ 182,369 $ 66,190 $ 58,759 Retail Gross Margin -
