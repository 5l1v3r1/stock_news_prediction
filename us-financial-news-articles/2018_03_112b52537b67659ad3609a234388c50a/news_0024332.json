This level of revenue led to positive quarterly operating income for the first time in eight quarters.\nAfter a decline in earnings over the last three years, we recorded a 10% increase in revenue and a 14% growth in EBITDA for the full year 2017, demonstrating the effectiveness and success of our industrial Transformation Plan, particularly the sharp reduction in our cost base.\nFollowing the approval of the safeguard plan in France and the exit from Chapter 11 in the United States at the end of February, our financial restructuring is now finalized. At the closing of the financial restructuring and on a pro forma basis, CGG has a restored balance sheet with a net debt brought back to $631m, corresponding to a leverage ratio at 1.7 times.\nThroughout this difficult period, CGG benefited from the continuous support of its clients and the full commitment of its employees and is now ready for a new momentum. With a restored balance sheet, strong technological positions and proven operational excellence, the Group has begun 2018 with renewed confidence and is ready to take full advantage of a rebound in the market.\"\nPost-closing events\nJanuary 15 th : Reduction of the share capital from €17,706,519 to €221,331 by reducing the nominal value of the Company's shares from €0.80 to €0.01 January 22 nd : Launch of the capital increase with preferential subscription rights for an amount of €112 million, by way of an issuance of shares of the Company each with one warrant attached (Warrants #2) January 25 th : Trading halt on the Convertible Bonds 2019, the Convertible Bonds 2020, and the Senior Notes on the Euro MTF market, from the opening of the market on February 1, 2018 February 9 th : Rights issue with preferential subscription right (PSR) of €112 million (including share premium) was fully subscribed February 21 st : Completion of the financial restructuring with settlement-delivery of all securities and instruments.\nThe financial restructuring with settlement-delivery of all securities and instruments will result in a c. $0.75 billion gain in our consolidated statement of operations.

On February 21, 2018, CGG finalized the implementation of its financial restructuring plan, which meets the Company's objectives of strengthening its balance sheet and providing financial flexibility to continue investing in the future. This plan comprised (i) the equitization of all the unsecured senior debt, (ii) the extension of the maturities of the secured senior debt and (iii) the provision of additional liquidity (c. $305m after partial repayment of the secured senior debt) to meet various business scenarios.\nThe Board of Directors considered that (i) the Group no longer faces material uncertainties that may cast doubt upon its ability to continue as a going concern and that (ii) the Group's liquidity and cash flow are sufficient to meet our expected cash requirements until at least December 31, 2018.\nHaving considered the above, the Board of Directors concluded that preparing the December 31, 2017 consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis is an appropriate assumption.\nFirst time application of IFRS 15\nRevenue recognition for multi-clients original participants contracts (formerly 'pre commitments') has been subject to an in-depth analysis of the industry practice and of the multi-client business model with CGG's auditors. In line with what was disclosed recently by other seismic players, a preliminary analysis, based purely on IFRS 15 form and applied to present contracts letter, is showing that there is a high risk that all the revenues related to multi-clients original participants contracts would have, under the new norm, to be recognized only at delivery of the final processed data, which may be more than one year after acquisition of the data. Subject to certain contractual documentation improvement and clarifications, CGG supports the conclusion that original participants contracts are services contracts for which revenue should be recognized over time based on data acquisition and processing progress of the survey, continuing the accounting for pre commitments under current industry practice prior to the adoption of IFRS 15 in 2018. Such conclusion has been shared and discussed with other seismic players. However, this conclusion has not yet been endorsed by the auditors and the regulators of the financial markets where CGG shares are publicly traded.\nAs a reminder, the revenues related to multi-clients original participants amounted to $269m in 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 financial results by operating segment and before non-recurring charges\nGeology, Geophysics & Reservoir (GGR)\nGGR\nIn million $ Fourth Quarter\n2016 Third Quarter\n2017 Fourth Quarter\n2017 Variation\nYear-on-year Variation\nQuarter-to-quarter Total Revenue 230.2 185.9 255.0 11% 37% Multi-Client 133.9 105.5 158.6 18% 50% Prefunding 58.3 70.1 72.1 24% 3% After-Sales 75.6 35.4 86.5 14% 144% Subsurface Imaging & Reservoir (SIR) 96.3 80.4 96.4 0% 20% EBITDAs 155.8 102.0 164.5 6% 61% Margin 67.7% 54.9% 64.5% (320) bps 960 bps Operating Income 26.0 11.8 63.3 143% 436% Margin 11.3% 6.3% 24.8% na na Equity from Investments (2.2) (0.2) (0.2) na na Capital Employed (in billion $) 2.3 2.2 2.2 na na GGR Total Revenue was $255 million, up 11% year-on-year and 37% sequentially.\nMulti-Client revenue was $159 million, up 18% year-on-year and 50% sequentially. 75% of the fleet was allocated to multi-client programs compared to 38% in Q4 2016 and 33% in Q3 2017.

While reservoir businesses were impacted by clients' capex cut.\nEquipment operating income margin was at (14.9)%. Despite very efficient cost management and manufacturing flexibility, profitability was impacted by very low volumes. Contractual Data Acquisition operating income margin was at (31.7)% due to weak pricing conditions in Marine, despite our fleet's good operational performance with a high production rate at 97%. 52% of our fleet was dedicated to the contractual market as we executed two large contracts with high-end multi-source vessel setup.
