It's not going to put us into a depression. This is simply trying to cure abuses.\"\nThe measures are meant to penalize China for trade practices that the Trump administration says involve stealing the intellectual property of American companies.\n\"This is the first of many\" trade actions, Trump said, as he signed the executive memo.\nThe new measures follow a so-called 301 investigation led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer into China's potentially unfair trade practices with the U.S.\nLighthizer's office will publish a list of targeted products in 15 days, and there will be a 30-day period for public comment, according to senior administration officials.\nshow chapters Commerce Secretary Ross: Trade deficits are sucking money out of US      2 Hours Ago | 03:25 Ross said this will not mean the end of global trade, but will instead result in negotiations.\n\"There may be some firing shots over the bow and things like that but I believe at the end of the day this will end up in a negotiated settlement.\"\nIn fact, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a \"very good working relationship with each other, particular on North Korea ,\" Ross said. \"We're not going to try to disrupt that relationship. But everybody, even our closest allies, must play by the rules.\"\nHe also brushed aside questions about the impact of the tariffs on U.S. economic growth, instead pointing to the damage done by the U.S. trade deficits.\n\"The real question is can we continue to afford these mammoth trade deficits that are sucking money out of our country,\" he said.\nBefore joining the White House, Ross made a fortune in the investment world, running W.L. Ross & Co., and buying stakes in distressed assets.\n— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger and Kayla Tausche contributed to this report. \nWATCH: Ross says China does not tell us how to define national security show chapters Commerce Secretary Ross: China does not tell us how to define national security      2 Hours Ago | 02:50", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T19:22:26.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
