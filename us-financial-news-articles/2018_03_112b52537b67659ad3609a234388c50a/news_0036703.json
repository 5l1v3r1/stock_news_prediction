The European Commission said Elna, Hitachi Chemical, Holy Stone, Matsuo, Nec Tokin, Nichicon, Nippon Chemi-Con and Rubycon fixed prices for the supply of aluminium and tantalum electrolytic capacitors. Sanyo Electric Co and Panasonic Corp alerted the EU competition enforcer and avoided a fine. Capacitors are used in electronic products such as smartphones, home appliances, car electronic systems and wind turbines. “Our decision again makes clear that we will not tolerate anti-competitive conduct that may affect European consumers, even if anticompetitive contacts take place outside Europe,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. It said the cartel ran from 1998 to 2012, with meetings taking place mainly in Japan but the operation was on a global scale.
