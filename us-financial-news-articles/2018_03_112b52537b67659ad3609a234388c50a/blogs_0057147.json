Nikulin has denied wrongdoing in comments to Czech media.\nThe decision by Czech Justice Minister Robert Pelikan to extradite Nikulin defied Russia, which had also sought his extradition.\nCourts in the Czech Republic, a U.S. ally and part of the European Union, had said extradition to both countries was permissible, and the decision was up to Pelikan.\nPrime Minister Andrej Babis has said he favored extradition to the United States, but Pelikan said President Milos Zeman, who often takes a pro-Russian stance, had urged extradition to Russia.\n“It was apparent that the United States requested extradition for a suspicion of very serious criminal activity, which was not the case of the Russian request,” Pelikan told Reuters in a phone interview.\nThe decision was closely watched because Babis needs Zeman’s support for a new government, after his minority cabinet lost a vote of confidence last month. Zeman has promised Babis another try at installing a government.\nReporting by Jan Lopatka in Prague and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Richard Balmforth/Mark Heinrich/Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:26:22.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
