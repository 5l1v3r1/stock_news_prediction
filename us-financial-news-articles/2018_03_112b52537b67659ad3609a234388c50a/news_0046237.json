The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, another major U.S. bank regulator, is now close to finalizing an enforcement action and civil penalty related to the firm’s risk controls, people familiar with the matter said.\nIn January, The Wall Street Journal also reported that the OCC was weighing a civil action against the bank that could result in Wells Fargo paying a settlement of tens of millions of dollars.\nThe Fed and the OCC have discussed the retirements with Wells Fargo, people familiar with the changes said. They include the head of financial crimes risk management Jim Richards, who is retiring in early April; head of operational risk and compliance Kevin Oden, who is retiring in May; enterprise risk head Keb Byers, who is retiring in June and taking on a “special assignment” until then; and community banking risk group head Vic Albrecht, who is retiring in May, according to the employees and the memo that described the retirements.\nThe executives didn’t respond to requests for comment; bank spokeswoman Richele Messick declined to comment on their behalf.\nWells Fargo in the internal memo also detailed structural changes to the so-called first and second lines of defense aimed to catch and prevent problems. It also changed certain roles and responsibilities among executives and groups. For instance, the bank is giving its corporate risk group more power to stop or modify business activities for a variety of reasons.\n“Strengthening and transforming how we manage risk is a top priority for Wells Fargo,” Ms. Messick said. “While more work is under way, we’re making meaningful progress that is allowing us to better serve our customers and enable our team members to more effectively manage risk across the company.”\nIn early February, the Federal Reserve sanctioned Wells Fargo for failing to have proper risk controls in place that could detect such issues. In an unusual move, it barred the bank from growing past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017. The Fed cited “widespread consumer abuses” in its rebuke.\nJust weeks before the Fed action, in mid-January, Wells Fargo said its chief risk officer Mike Loughlin would be retiring and that it will hire someone to replace him in “the next few months.” The bank has yet to name a replacement.\nIn late January, Wells Fargo appointed former Federal Reserve Bank of New York official Sarah Dahlgren to oversee regulatory relations for its corporate risk group.\n—Ryan Tracy contributed to this article.\nWrite to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:20:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
