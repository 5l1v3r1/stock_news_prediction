Citing two unnamed sources, the newspaper said is \"seriously considering\" the former chief financial officer for General Motors and Microsoft.\nLiddell joined the administration in January 2017 , and serves as the White House's director of strategic initiatives.\nThe only other person the White House is apparently interested in for the job is Knight — the current NEC deputy director, according to Politico . However, Politico, citing sources who know Knight, also reported that she is not interested in heading the council.\nAlso, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday that CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow was the leading contender for the job . Kudlow is a free-trade advocate.\nThe next NEC director will be replacing Gary Cohn, who announced his resignation last week after Trump said he wanted to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T15:21:41.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
