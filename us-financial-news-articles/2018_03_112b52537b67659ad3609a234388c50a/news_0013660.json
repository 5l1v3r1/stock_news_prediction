(NYSE:SSI) today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, and provided guidance for fiscal year 2018. For the fourth quarter, comparable sales increased 1.1% and net income was $5.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $6.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, including the impact of tax matters and other items discussed below, fourth quarter net income was $13.6 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nMichael Glazer, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “We are very pleased to have ended the year with results that exceeded the high end of our guidance and the prior year, including fourth quarter positive comparable sales, gross margin expansion and significant net income growth. Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 1.1% reflects momentum that began in October and continued through the remainder of the year. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share improved 125% compared to last year. Our strategic initiatives designed to drive sales, including consistent newness in our assortments and accelerating growth in trending categories such as beauty, gifts, footwear, and activewear, proved to be successful. Additionally, we effectively managed promotions in a highly competitive environment, and ended the year with our inventory levels down 5% in department stores and the content in great shape across the entire business. The enhancements we have made to our online business continue to deliver results as ecommerce sales grew double digits in each quarter of fiscal 2017.”\nMr. Glazer continued, “Fourth quarter merchandise margin was up 140 basis points and adjusted gross profit was up 130 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year. We also maintained our strong liquidity position throughout the year, generated positive free cash flow even after investing $47 million in acquiring selected Gordmans assets, and ended the year with $112 million of excess availability under our revolving credit facility. In addition, as part of our focus on returning value to shareholders, we recently announced our 51 st consecutive quarterly cash dividend.”\nFourth Quarter Results\nFourth quarter 2017 results compared to fourth quarter 2016 results were as follows:\nNet sales were $549 million compared to $454 million last year Comparable sales increased 1.1% compared to a decline of 8.5% last year Adjusted EBIT was $22.1 million compared to $13.6 million last year Net income was $5.6 million compared to a net loss of $6.8 million last year Adjusted net income was $13.6 million compared to $5.7 million last year Earnings per diluted share were $0.19 compared to a loss per diluted share of $0.25 last year Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.45 compared to $0.20 last year\nResults for the fourth quarter 2017 reflect 14 weeks versus 13 weeks in 2016, except that comparable sales were measured over 13 weeks for both periods. Adjusted results for the fourth quarter 2017 exclude after tax charges associated with the South Hill distribution center closure, store closures, impairments, pension charges, and $6.3 million or $0.21 of the impact of federal tax reform and the valuation of net deferred tax assets. Adjusted results for the fourth quarter 2016 exclude severance charges associated with workforce reductions, store closures, and impairments.\n2017 Results\nFull year 2017 results compared to full year 2016 results were as follows:\nNet sales were $1,592 million compared to $1,443 million last year Comparable sales declined 3.6% compared to a decline of 8.8% last year Adjusted EBIT was $(29.8) million compared to $(35.0) million last year Net loss was $37.3 million compared to a net loss of $37.9 million last year Adjusted net loss was $23.0 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $24.1 million last year Loss per diluted share was $1.37 compared to a loss per diluted share of $1.40 last year Adjusted loss per diluted share was $0.85 compared to $0.89 last year\nDuring 2017, the company did not open any department stores and closed 21 department stores. The company added 58 Gordmans stores during 2017.\nResults for the full year 2017 reflect 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in 2016, except that comparable sales were measured over 52 weeks for both years. Adjusted results for the full year 2017 exclude after-tax charges associated with the Gordmans acquisition, the South Hill distribution center closure, store closures, impairments, pension charges, and the impact of federal tax reform and the valuation of net deferred tax assets. Adjusted results for the full year 2016 exclude the consolidation of our corporate headquarters, severance associated with workforce reductions, store closures, impairments, and other strategic initiatives.\n2018 Guidance\nRegarding the company’s outlook for fiscal 2018, Mr. Glazer stated, “We are optimistic about 2018 and remain focused on building upon the momentum we established in our department store sales. In addition, our acquisition of Gordmans is a great opportunity for us to leverage the strength of the off-price sector, and we plan to accelerate growth in this business during the coming year. As a result, in 2018, we expect to deliver positive comparable sales, significantly improve EBIT, and generate positive free cash flow.”\nFor fiscal 2018, the company provided the following guidance:\nNet sales between $1,610 million and $1,640 million Comparable sales of flat to an increase of 2.0% EBIT between $(29) million and $(18) million Net loss between $38 million and $27 million Tax rate of 0%, which, when compared to 2017, is expected to negatively impact 2018 EPS by $0.36 to $0.52 per diluted share within the comparable sales and EBIT guidance ranges Loss per diluted share between $1.35 and $0.95 Depreciation and amortization between $55 million and $60 million Capital expenditures of $30 million Open one Gordmans store and close 25 to 30 department stores\nConference Call / Webcast Information\nThe company will post a pre-recorded conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its results and guidance.
