The stock plunged, lawmakers began demanding answers and users threatened to quit the social network altogether. \nCambridge Analytica says it’s launching its own investigation to see if the firm engaged in wrongdoing, and in a Facebook post, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook knew about the policy violation in 2015. Facebook asked the data firm and the researcher to certify that the information had been deleted, but it didn’t notify users at the time.\nNow, Facebook is facing a wave of backlash for not doing more to prevent information from being abused.
