If all goes well, the talks could be concluded by the end of March, the source said, paving the way for approval by the supervisory board.\nThe two sources could not speak for attribution because VW's deliberations on a possible truck IPO are confidential.\nVW has also been pushing steps to cede power from global headquarters to brands and regions after its pre-dieselgate centralized structure was seen as a factor facilitating the cheating.\nBut a review of its portfolio of assets and stakes announced in 2016 as part of VW's post-dieselgate transformation has yet to deliver results. A planned sale of Audi's Italian motorcycle brand Ducati collapsed last year amid opposition from labor leaders.\n\"There are no decisions (on a trucks IPO),\" Mueller said in the interview. \"If there are decisions one day, then we will inform about those in a very qualified way.\"\nDaimler has said it may split parts of its business into separate legal entities, which may allow for a partial listing to raise funds to invest in new services such as autonomous and electric cars.\nAuto parts and tire maker Continental is in talks with banks about a possible structural overhaul that could include listing or spinning off divisions.\nMueller denied that VW in its plans was following Daimler and Continental. \"We have our own views,\" he said, without elaborating.
