It has since taken criticism for surprising the market with interest rate moves, particularly in 2015 when it unexpectedly cut rates in the face of the oil price shock.\nMore recently, the central bank last September had to defend nearly two months of silence leading up to a rate hike that some said left markets inadequately prepared for the move.\nPoloz on Thursday said the bank’s method allows markets to assess economic data and make their own projections on the future path of interest rates.\n“It has taken time, but markets and observers are increasingly adapting to our approach,” Poloz said.\nThe bank has raised interest rates three times since last July and has said it will be cautious and watch incoming data as it considers more hikes.
