They mostly work now from Russian diplomatic premises in central Brussels.\nIn protest at the Crimean annexation, NATO decided to curtail access to the headquarters for all Russian accredited NATO diplomats barring the Russian ambassador, the deputy head of mission and two support staff.\nNATO is awaiting a new Russian ambassador following the departure of Alexander Grushko, who was appointed deputy Russian foreign minister for European relations in January.\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, NATO sought closer ties with Russia and included Russian personnel in its campaign in the Balkans in the 1990s.\nBut since Crimea, NATO has suspended all practical military and civilian cooperation with Russia, although it maintains political dialogue and has tried to restart military channels of communication, mainly to discuss the crisis in Ukraine", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T17:29:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
