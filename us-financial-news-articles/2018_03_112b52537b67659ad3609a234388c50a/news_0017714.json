Last week, he announced that he planned to impose heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. While that has been greeted by worries at home and abroad that it could spark a global trade war, some critics also said the planned move did not focus enough on China.\n“China has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a One Billion Dollar reduction in their massive Trade Deficit with the United States,” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter, mistakenly referring to a deficit where Beijing runs a surplus.\n“We look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with,” Trump wrote.\nIt was not clear who had asked Beijing for this plan, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for details.\nChina ran a record goods trade surplus with the United States last year of $375.2 billion.
