The index weighting will be small but some expect money flows from Hong Kong into China via the stock connect scheme on those days may breach the daily quota.\n“We anticipate there to be a relaxation of the quota around those inclusion days to allow for greater trading on the northbound side,” Austen said.\nASIFMA also requested that China lift the 20 percent cap on repatriation by foreign investors under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme.\nWith such restrictions, early-bird QFII investors are treated unfairly, he said, as latecomers enjoy more freedom investing in China through newer and less restrictive channels like the stock and bond connect schemes.\nThe association called on China to increase transparency and end “window guidance”, whereby authorities regulate through less formal verbal instructions to market institutions, and publish more transparent rules on delistings, share trading suspensions, and tax treatment for foreign investors.\nReporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T07:07:13.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
