(NASDAQ:REGI) (“REG” or the “Company”) today announced its the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn February 9, 2018, the Biodiesel Mixture Excise Tax Credit (\"BTC\") was retroactively reinstated for the 2017 calendar year, although because the reinstatement occurred after year-end, the net benefit of the reinstatement will be recognized in our GAAP financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. Because this credit relates to our 2017 operations, our presentation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 reflects the allocation of the net benefit of the reinstatement to each of the four quarters of 2017 based upon gallons sold in the quarter.\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $577.3 million on 152.8 million gallons sold. Net loss was $17.0 million. Adjusted net income was $78.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $58.9 million. Total gallons sold decreased by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. See the tables below for the definitions of Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of each to net income determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the full year 2017, revenues were $2.2 billion on 586.7 million gallons sold. Net loss was $79.1 million, Adjusted net income was $206.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $230.2 million. For the full year 2017, REG sold 19.6 million more gallons and revenue increased by 6% compared to 2016. Adjusted net income increased by 313%, and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 125%, compared to 2016. The decrease in net income in 2017 is primarily attributed to the absence of the BTC and a $49.9 million impairment charge for property, plant and equipment, partially offset by higher margins from operations. The increase in Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA is primarily attributable to the significant increase in renewable diesel gallons sold and higher margins from our biodiesel operations.\n“We achieved a significant step change in our business performance with $230 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Revenues for the full year exceeded $2 billion and we set new records for Adjusted EBITDA as well as gallons produced and sold in a year,” said Randy Howard, REG President and Chief Executive Officer.\n“Our 2017 Adjusted EBITDA demonstrated the capability of REG's business model to generate cash, reflecting our renewable diesel capacity and multi-feedstock strategy. Our fleet ran at 90% of nameplate capacity last year, and the strong performance at our renewable diesel biorefinery at Geismar, Louisiana reinforces our commitment to that proven technology.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Highlights\nREG sold 152.8 million total gallons of fuel, a decrease of 1.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Gallons sold in the quarter included 85.1 million gallons of domestic biodiesel, 18.1 million gallons of renewable diesel, 9.4 million gallons of biomass-based diesel purchased from third parties, 30.6 million gallons of petroleum-based diesel fuel and 9.6 million biodiesel gallons produced by our German operations.\nREG produced 119.0 million gallons of biomass-based diesel during the quarter, a decrease of 11.1 million gallons from the fourth quarter of 2016. This reduced production was primarily due to downtime at our Ralston, Iowa facility related to an expansion project and downtime for repairs at our Madison, Wisconsin facility. The Company also utilized contract or toll manufacturing arrangements, which contributed 6.4 million gallons in the quarter.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nAll figures refer to the quarter ended December 31, 2017, unless otherwise noted. All comparisons are to the quarter ended December 31, 2016 unless otherwise noted.\nRevenues increased $16.8 million to $577.3 million, driven by an increase in biomass-based diesel prices offset by the absence of the BTC and a 2% decrease in gallons sold. The average price per gallon sold (including RINs) for B100 was $3.21, an increase of 5.2% from the same period in 2016. The average price per gallon sold (including RINs) for B100 when factoring in the impact of the BTC would have been $3.67.\nGross profit was $20.0 million, compared to $81.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin was 3%, compared to 15% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the absence of the BTC for 2017.\nOperating loss was $53.9 million compared to operating income of $32.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 operating results were impacted by a $48.5 million non-cash impairment charge of property, plant and equipment, of which $44.6 million related to our partially completed biorefinery near New Orleans, Louisiana. We determined that the New Orleans facility is unlikely to be completed in the foreseeable future as a result of other strategic investment priorities, such as expansion of our renewable diesel production capacity at the Geismar biorefinery.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $17.0 million, or $0.44 per share on a fully diluted basis. This compares to net income of $20.2 million, or $0.51 per share on a fully diluted basis in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted net income was $78.2 million, or $1.97 per share on a fully diluted basis. This compares to Adjusted net income of $43.8 million, or $1.00 per share on a fully diluted basis in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $58.9 million, a 2% decrease compared to fourth quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $60.3 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, REG had cash , of $77.6 million, a decrease of 31% during the quarter. For the year, the Company's cash decreased by $38.6 million primarily as a result of investments in property, plant and equipment, partially offset with cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2017, accounts receivable were $90.6 million, an increase of $2.9 million from September 30, 2017. Inventory was $135.5 million, an increase of $10.0 million during the quarter.\nThe table below summarizes REG’s results for Q4 2017:\nREG Q4 2017 Results\n(dollars and gallons in thousands, except per gallon data) 4Q-2017 4Q-2016 Y/Y Change Total gallons sold 152,832 155,860 (2 )% ASP per gallon $ 3.21 $ 3.05 5 % Total revenues $ 577,264 $ 560,421 3 % Net income (loss) attributable to the Company $ (16,983 ) $ 20,197 N/M\nAdjusted net income attributable to the Company (1) $ 78,249 $ 43,767 79 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 58,857 $ 60,274 (2 )% (1) On February 9, 2018, the BTC was reinstated for the 2017 calendar year. The retroactive credit for 2017 resulted in a net benefit to us that will be recognized in our GAAP financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. However, because this credit relates to 2017 operating performance, our presentation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA reflects the allocation of the net benefit of the reinstatement to each of the four quarters of 2017 based upon gallons sold in the quarter.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nAll figures refer to the year ended December 31, 2017, unless otherwise noted. All comparisons are to the full year ended December 31, 2016 unless otherwise noted.\nREG sold 586.7 million total gallons, an increase of 3.5% compared to 567.1 million gallons in 2016. Gallons sold in 2017 included 349.3 million gallons of domestic biodiesel, 62.9 million gallons of renewable diesel, 52.9 million gallons of biomass-based diesel purchased from third parties, 83.5 million gallons of petroleum-based diesel fuel and 38.1 million gallons produced by our German operations.\nREG produced 453.7 million gallons of biomass-based diesel, compared to 445.5 million gallons in 2016. The growth in production primarily resulted from our Geismar renewable diesel facility running near capacity for the full year. The Company also utilized contract or toll manufacturing, which contributed 18.3 million gallons in 2017, compared to 23.4 million gallons in 2016.\nRevenues were $2.2 billion, an increase of $117.0 million, or 6%, versus 2016 revenue of $2.0 billion. The increase was due to a 3% increase in gallons sold offset by the absence of the BTC during 2017 and a 3% decrease in average biomass-based diesel prices during 2017. The average B100 price per gallon (including RINs) sold by REG was $3.06, compared to $3.17 in 2016. The average B100 price per gallon (including RINs) sold when factoring in the impact of the BTC would have been $3.48.\nGross profit was $83.6 million, compared to $171.5 million in 2016. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the absence of the BTC in 2017, offset by improved margins as well as higher sales of separated RINs in 2017.\nOperating loss was $73.8 million, compared to operating income of $47.2 million in 2016. Operating loss for 2017 was impacted by a $49.9 million non-cash impairment charge of property, plant and equipment.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $79.1 million or $2.04 per share on a fully diluted basis for 2017. This compares to a net income of $43.5 million or $1.06 per share on a fully diluted basis for 2016.\nAdjusted net income was $206.8 million, or $5.21 per share on a fully diluted basis for 2017. This compares to Adjusted net income $50.0 million, or $1.20 per share on a fully diluted basis for 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $230.2 million, compared to $102.1 million in 2016, resulting in Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11% and 5% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA is primarily attributable to the 101% increase in renewable diesel gallons sold and improved margins for our biodiesel and renewable diesel sales.\nThe table below summarizes the quarterly and year end results for 2017 and 2016:\nREG Annual Results Summary\n(dollars and gallons in thousands except per gallon data) 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Year Gallons sold 2017 122,121 160,219 151,524 152,832 586,696 Gallons sold 2016 98,016 150,052 163,133 155,860 567,061 Y/Y Change 25 % 7 % (7 )% (2 )% 3 % ASP per gallon 2017 $ 2.94 $ 2.86 $ 3.21 $ 3.21 $ 3.06 ASP per gallon 2016 $ 2.92 $ 3.27 $ 3.14 $ 3.05 $ 3.17 Y/Y Change 1 % (13 )% 2 % 5 % (3 )% Total revenues 2017 $ 418,893 $ 535,103 $ 626,983 $ 577,264 $ 2,158,243 Total revenues 2016 $ 297,870 $ 558,301 $ 624,640 $ 560,421 $ 2,041,232 Y/Y Change 41 % (4 )% 0 % 3 % 6 % Net loss attributable to the Company 2017 $ (15,914 ) $ (34,809 ) $ (11,373 ) $ (16,983 ) $ (79,079 ) Net income (loss) attributable to the Company 2016 $ (6,918 ) $ 7,606 $ 23,442 $ 20,197 $ 44,327 Y/Y Change 130 % N/M N/M N/M N/M Adjusted net income attributable to the Company 2017 $ 23,171 $ 63,957 $ 41,409 $ 78,249 $ 206,786 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to the Company 2016 $ (9,406 ) $ (4,780 ) $ 20,457 $ 43,767 $ 50,038 Y/Y Change N/M N/M 102 % 79 % 313 % Adjusted EBITDA 2017 $ 37,332 $ 79,068 $ 54,965 $ 58,857 $ 230,222 Adjusted EBITDA 2016 $ 2,197 $ 8,052 $ 31,624 $ 60,274 $ 102,147 Y/Y Change 1,599 % 882 % 74 % (2 )% 125 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 2017 (1) 9 % 15 % 9 % 10 % 11 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 2016 (1) 1 % 1 % 5 % 11 % 5 % (1) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenues.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per share\nThe Company believes supplementing its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP with non-GAAP measures provides investors with useful information regarding the Company's short-term and long-term trends. Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted diluted net income (loss) per common share are derived from GAAP results by excluding the non-cash impacts related to the change in the estimated fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability, change in fair value of contingent considerations, impairment of assets, and stock compensation, coupled with other items that we believe are not related to our core operating activities. The Company excludes these non-operating, non-cash impacts, as the Company believes they are not indicative of its core operating results or future performance. Adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted diluted net income (loss) per common share and other non-GAAP financial measures used and presented by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 1Q-2017 2Q-2017 3Q-2017 4Q-2017 Year ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 1Q-2016 2Q-2016 3Q-2016 4Q-2016 Year ended\nDecember 31,\n2016 Net income (loss) attributable to\nthe Company $ (15,914 ) $ (34,809 ) $ (11,373 ) $ (16,983 ) $ (79,079 ) $ (6,918 ) $ 7,606 $ 23,442 $ 20,197 $ 44,327 Gain on involuntary conversion — — (942 ) (4,387 ) (5,329 ) (3,543 ) (997 ) (3,470 ) (1,884 ) (9,894 ) Change in fair value of convertible\ndebt conversion liability 172 32,546 (8,560 ) (5,325 ) 18,833 — (13,432 ) (3,013 ) 3,400 (13,045 ) Change in fair value of contingent\nconsiderations 589 (24 ) 1,433 486 2,484 (15 ) 3,571 1,124 3,224 7,904 Loss on the Geismar lease termination — 3,967 — — 3,967 — — — — — Other (income) expense, net 320 (32 ) (12 ) 742 1,018 88 (2,306 ) 314 (854 ) (2,758 ) Impairment of assets — 1,341 — 48,532 49,873 — — — 17,893 17,893 Straight-line lease expense (32 ) (85 ) (85 ) (35 ) (237 ) (94 ) (80 ) (73 ) (38 ) (285 ) Executive severance payment — — 2,420 991 3,411 — — — — — Non-cash stock compensation 1,308 1,688 2,023 1,890 6,909 1,076 858 2,133 1,829 5,896 Biodiesel tax credit 36,728 59,365 56,505 52,338 204,936 — — — — — Adjusted net income (loss)\nattributable to the Company $ 23,171 $ 63,957 $ 41,409 $ 78,249 $ 206,786 $ (9,406 ) $ (4,780 ) $ 20,457 $ 43,767 $ 50,038 Net income (loss) per share\nattributable to common stockholders Diluted $ (0.41 ) $ (0.90 ) $ (0.29 ) $ (0.44 ) $ (2.04 ) $ (0.14 ) $ 0.18 $ 0.59 $ 0.51 $ 1.06 Adjusted net income (loss) per share\nattributable to common stockholders Diluted $ 0.59 $ 1.61 $ 1.04 $ 1.97 $ 5.21 $ (0.21 ) $ (0.11 ) $ 0.52 $ 1.00 $ 1.20 Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nThe Company uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for certain additional items, identified in the table below, or Adjusted EBITDA, as a supplemental performance measure.

The retroactive credit for 2017 resulted in a net benefit to us that will be recognized in our GAAP financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. However, because this credit relates to the 2017 operating performance, our presentation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA reflects the allocation of the net benefit to each of the four quarters of 2017 based upon gallons sold in the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or a measure of liquidity or profitability. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for any of the results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures or the impact of certain cash clauses that the Company considers not to be an indication of ongoing operations; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; Stock-based compensation expense is an important element of the Company’s long term incentive compensation program, although the Company has excluded it as an expense when evaluating our operating performance; and Other companies, including other companies in the same industry, may calculate these measures differently, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nAbout Renewable Energy Group\nRenewable Energy Group, Inc.
