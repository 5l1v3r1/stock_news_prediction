Very, very encouraging. \n“Physically, I’m super-fresh and I’m ready to go for the finals.” \nHe lost only 11 points on serve in the match, firing 13 aces to four for del Potro, who had upset world number one Roger Federer in the Indian Wells final. \nIsner dominated the first set, winning three consecutive games to start the match that included the break of del Potro. \n“The first set was pretty easy,” the American said. “He’s understandably so tired. He’s played so many matches and I was a little bit fortunate to get a del Potro who was very low on fuel. \n“But I knew the second set would be much tougher.” \nAlthough del Potro fought off a break point in the ninth game of the second set, Isner won the first three points in the tiebreak before clinching the match.
