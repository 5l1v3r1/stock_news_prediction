A statue of Harvey Weinstein on a casting couch made by artist Plastic Jesus is seen on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theatre during preparations for the Oscars in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Los Angeles-based street artist Plastic Jesus on Thursday unveiled a statue called“Casting Couch,” depicting a life-size Weinstein, clothed in a bathrobe, sitting on a golden colored couch and holding an Oscar. It was installed near the Hollywood venue where the Academy Awards ceremony will be held. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having nonconsensual sex with anyone. His representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the installation. The accusations against Weinstein triggered a flood of allegations of sexual impropriety by other celebrities that have rocked Hollywood and dominated this year’s movie awards season. “Whilst many thought the‘casting couch’ was a thing of the past it was clearly still a part of the Hollywood culture,” Plastic Jesus said in a statement on his Facebook page.

Weinstein was one of the movie industry’s most influential men, powering independent movies such as“The King’s Speech” and“Shakespeare in Love” to Oscar best picture wins.

The company said on Sunday it planned to file for bankruptcy. The‘Casting Couch’ statue followed the appearance in Los Angeles on Wednesday of billboards designed by street artist Sabo that accused the entertainment industry of staying silent about sexual misconduct. Plastic Jesus said the Weinstein statue was a collaboration with the artist Joshua“Ginger” Monroe and took two months to produce. It was paid for by donations through their websites. Plastic Jesus and Ginger were also responsible for producing naked statues of Donald Trump that appeared in various U.S. cities in 2016, before he was elected U.S. president.
