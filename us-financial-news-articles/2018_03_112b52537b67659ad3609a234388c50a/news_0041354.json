Led by Sarcos Robotics , other X-TAG members include Bechtel, BMW, Caterpillar , GE , Schlumberger and additional leading companies representing aviation, construction, heavy machinery and utilities.\n\"There is no greater responsibility we have than to keep our people and our customers safe,\" said Gil West , Delta's chief operating officer, in a statement. \"This X-TAG is an innovative opportunity to think about how fitting our employees with wearable robotics can build on our strong personal safety culture and further protect our people from injury by giving them an additional layer of strength and protection.\" Read the full announcement here .\nMore from Atlanta Business Chronicle: \nDelta jumps to No. 2 US passenger carrier in 2017; airport still busiest in the nation\nTechFlash: Goodyear chooses Atlanta; Mercedes-Benz USA plans innovation hub\nFormer Georgia Gov. Zell Miller dies at 86 \nThe Sarcos Guardian XO and XO MAX robots are battery-powered exoskeletons that enable workers to perform hours of physical activity that would otherwise be impossible for a single human to perform, the company says. The Guardian XO robot is capable of repeatedly lifting and supporting up to 80 pounds without fatigue or strain for up to a four-hour work session. The XO MAX is capable of lifting and supporting up to 200 pounds without fatigue or strain for up to an eight-hour work session.\nAccording to Sarcos, the human operator bears none of the load of the exoskeleton or its payload, and can be donned and doffed in 30 seconds. These exoskeletons require minimal operator training because they permit natural, fluid and intuitive movement.\nThe Guardian XO and XO MAX robots are in development and are expected to be commercially available in late 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T19:47:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
