They have lost more than 60 percent over the past two years.\nThe Bregenz, western Austria-based company’s key markets are the United States, Germany, France, Austria and Britain.\nWolford reported a loss before interest and tax (EBIT) of 6.2 million euros for the six months through October, an improvement of 21 percent on the previous year’s first half.\n2017/18 half year revenue was flat at 70.2 million euros.\nThe closing of the share purchase agreement and\nthe general meeting that has to approve the cash capital increase are intended to take place in May, Wolford said.\nReporting by Kirsti Knolle; editing by Jane Merriman and Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:40:20.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
