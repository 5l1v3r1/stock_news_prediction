Barton has also spent time at Lightspeed Venture Partners, Cygnus Solutions, Red Hat and McKinsey & Co.\nKieran Harty, CTO, co-founder and member of the Board of Directors added, “Tom’s addition to the executive team comes at the right time for the company. We recently took important steps to strengthen our company, including the addition of $25 million in incremental funding and significant reductions to operating expenses. We’ve now got the right foundation and the right leader in place for the company’s next phase.”\nAbout Tintri\nTintri (NASDAQ: TNTR) offers an enterprise cloud infrastructure built on a public-cloud like web services architecture and RESTful APIs.
