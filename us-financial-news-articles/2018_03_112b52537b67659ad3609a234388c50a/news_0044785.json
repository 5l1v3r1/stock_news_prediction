The case is even stronger in the U.S. if one considers that should a shock occur, monetary policy and fiscal policy may not be expected to respond as forcefully as they did,” Rosengren said.\nThe Boston Fed chief largely steered clear of a discussion of the economic outlook in his remarks, but he said labor market tightness was beginning to feed through into modest increases in wages and inflation, and a more rapid rise in asset prices.\nHis comments come two days after policymakers voted to raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point in light of the strength of the economy and signaled bolstered confidence for the months ahead.\nThe Fed has now raised rates six times since it began a tightening cycle in late 2015, with the pace of hikes having quickened to three rate rises last year. The Fed forecasts three total rate hikes for 2018.\nIn his speech, Rosengren said it was precisely because of the current health of the economy that planning for a future adverse shock should occur.\nHe added that with the neutral rate of interest - a level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary - having fallen in the United States, the Fed would have less space to cut interest rates in any future crisis.\nFiscal policy buffers were also being diminished as the ratio of government debt to GDP has been rising in the United States, he cautioned.\n“My view is that U.S. fiscal policy we have seen since the crisis emerged in 2008 will simply give future policymakers less flexibility to respond,” Rosengren said.
