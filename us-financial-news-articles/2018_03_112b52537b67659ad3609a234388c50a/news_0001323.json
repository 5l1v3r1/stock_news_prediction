REUTERS/Sipho Sithole/File Photo A number of vehicles operated by Taxify, an Estonian start-up, and Uber have been torched in South Africa and police monitor hot spots including a commuter train station in Johannesburg’s upscale financial district of Sandton.\nThe victim was found in the boot of a Chevrolet Aveo.\n“Both the cause and motive behind the incident are still a subject of investigation ... The identity of the deceased is yet to be confirmed,” police said in a statement.\nConventional taxi operators accuse the app-based drivers of poaching customers with cheaper fares.\nUber operates in more than 600 cities and has faced protests in France, Brazil and Hungary, and its drivers have been threatened or attacked in Kenya, Costa Rica and Australia.\nReporting by Ed Stoddard; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:22:49.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
