The increase in cash reflects the net proceeds raised from NuCana’s initial public offering completed in October 2017. NuCana reported a loss of £23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to £6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted loss per share was £0.89 in 2017, compared to £0.25 per share in 2016.\n“2017 was a year of rapid expansion for NuCana and our successful IPO has provided us with the financial resources to swiftly advance our pipeline of proprietary ProTides,” said Hugh S. Griffith, NuCana’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “As we continue to build on our strong platform through 2018, we anticipate reporting interim data from our PRO-105 study of Acelarin in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, further data from the ABC-08 study of Acelarin in biliary cancer, and additional data in various solid tumors from our second ProTide, NUC-3373. We also look forward to advancing our third ProTide, NUC-7738, into the clinic. With such an extensive and varied range of clinical studies we believe there are exciting prospects for NuCana over the coming year.”\nAbout NuCana plc\nNuCana® is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on significantly improving treatment outcomes for cancer patients by applying our ProTide ™ technology to transform some of the most widely prescribed chemotherapy agents, nucleoside analogs, into more effective and safer medicines. While these conventional agents remain part of the standard of care for the treatment of many solid tumors, their efficacy is limited by cancer cell resistance mechanisms and they are often poorly tolerated. Utilizing our proprietary technology, we are developing new medicines, ProTides, designed to overcome key cancer resistance mechanisms and generate much higher concentrations of anti-cancer metabolites in cancer cells.\nOur most advanced ProTide candidates, Acelarin® and NUC-3373, are new chemical entities derived from the nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil, respectively, two widely used chemotherapy agents. Acelarin is currently being evaluated in three clinical studies, including a phase 2 study for patients with ovarian cancer, a phase 1b study for patients with biliary tract cancer and a Phase 3 study for patients with pancreatic cancer. NUC-3373 is currently in a Phase 1 study for the potential treatment of a wide range of advanced solid tumors.\nFor more information, please visit: www.nucana.com .\nThis press release may contain “forward‐looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on the beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management of NuCana plc (the “Company”).
