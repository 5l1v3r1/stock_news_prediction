It was unclear why a third country that does not border South Sudan would be preferable to South Africa.\nThere was no immediate comment from South Africa’s Foreign Ministry.\nStephanie Sullivan, the U.S. State Department’s acting principal deputy assistant secretary for Africa, said the United States would like to see both warring factions renounce violence.\n“We don’t have any particular need for Machar to be physically in South Africa, and the neighbourhood is fine, but he and his group need to renounce violence,” Sullivan told reporters.\nSouth Sudan government spokesman Michael Makuei Lueth said Juba had no problem with the bloc’s decision, but that Machar should not be allowed to take part in peace talks in Addis Ababa.\nA spokesman for Machar’s SPLM-IO rebel group said it was reviewing IGAD’s statement and would respond at a later time.\nCivil war broke out in oil-rich South Sudan in 2013, when troops loyal to President Salva Kiir clashed with forces loyal to Machar, then the vice president. Tens of thousands have since been killed.\nOil production has also been slashed while about a third of the population of 12 million have been forced from their homes.\nThe warring parties signed a ceasefire in December in the Ethiopian capital, but it was violated within hours. A new round of talks is scheduled for late next month.\nIGAD also announced that it wanted to impose targeted sanctions on individuals violating the latest peace deal or otherwise disrupting it, but referred the matter to the African Union.\nLast month, the head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said it was open to imposing sanctions on leaders violating the ceasefire in South Sudan.\nHis comments followed a chorus of other calls for action against those stoking the conflict.\nThe United States imposed a unilateral arms embargo last month but has been unable to convince the 15-member U.N. Security Council to impose one.
