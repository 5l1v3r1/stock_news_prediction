REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo Shares of the Dow component rose nearly 2 percent in extended trade. They had closed down 3 percent at $64.42 in regular trading, primarily after reports investor William Ackman’s Pershing Square had exited the company with a profit of about $100 million. Sales jumped 24.3 percent in China in the third quarter ended Feb. 28, while they rose 19.4 percent in Europe. The strong show in international markets helped offset a 6 percent drop in sales in North America, where Nike is battling rival Adidas ( ADSGn.DE ). “As we close Q3, we now see a significant reversal of trend in North America,” CEO Mark Parker said in a statement. However, the company reported a net loss of $921 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with a profit of $1.14 billion, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier. The company recorded a one-time charge of $2 billion in the reported quarter related to the recently enacted U.S. tax law. Excluding the charge, the company earned 68 cents per share. Revenue rose 6.5 percent to $8.98 billion. Analysts on average had expected adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share and revenue of $8.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
