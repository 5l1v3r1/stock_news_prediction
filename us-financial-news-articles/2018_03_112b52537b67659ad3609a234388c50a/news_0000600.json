It was set for its fourth straight week of falls.\nTrump announced on Thursday he would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminium to protect U.S. producers, risking retaliation from major trade partners like China, Europe and neighbouring Canada as well as helping to trigger a large selloff on Wall Street.
