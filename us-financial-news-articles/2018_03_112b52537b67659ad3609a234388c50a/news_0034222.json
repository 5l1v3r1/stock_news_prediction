This approach is anticipated to be more effective than other immune-oncology therapies, because for every one tumor blood vessel cell killed by the immune system it is anticipated that 300 cancer cells die. In essence the vaccine is designed to stimulate collateral damage to the tumor, while also opening up channels for the immune system to access the tumor microenvironment.\n“The best approach to cure cancer will be to systematically integrate synergistic immunotherapies in a regimen designed to overcome local immune suppression, stimulate the immune system, damage the tumor, and, finally, induce immune memory against the targets expressed on cancer,” said Samuel Wagner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Batu Biologics. “I am honored that Dr. Veltmeyer, who is running for Congress to change the medical system, chose me to lead discussions between such a distinguished panel of biotechnology companies. We anticipate these discussions will plant the seeds of collaboration, which will lead to new treatments for patients.”\nDr. Veltmeyer stated: \"We are facing the biggest crisis in America: our expensive and broken health care system! What I propose is Health care BY the people and FOR the people (vs. rationed care). I'm running for Congress because it is time to put our American families first. I'm committed to build a healthier world for our children and grandchildren.\"\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315006549/en/\nBatu Biologics\nDimitri Theofilopoulos, J.D., 213-359-3179\nChief Operations Officer\nFax: 858-597-7090\ndimitri.theo@batubiologics.com\nwww.batubiologics.com\nSource: Batu Biologics", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.batubiologics.com&esheet=51774405&lan=en-US&anchor=www.batubiologics.com&index=1&md5=7fe5b5ecc5aa0734f0472852e271c24c", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315006549/en/"], "published": "2018-03-16T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T07:45:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
