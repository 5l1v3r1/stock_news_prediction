Yu Gong, Founder and CEO of Chinese streaming platform iQiyi Inc., speaks before ringing the opening bell at the Nasdaq Market Site to celebrate iQiyi Inc.'s initial public offering (IPO) in New York City, U.S., March 29, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nThe company, which is majority-owned by Chinese internet search firm Baidu Inc, had opened at $18.20, slightly ahead of the $18 IPO price, but the stock quickly pared gains. \nThe IPO of the Netflix-like video platform priced on Wednesday in the middle of its $17-$19 per share estimate, generating proceeds of $2.25 billion (£1.6 billion).
