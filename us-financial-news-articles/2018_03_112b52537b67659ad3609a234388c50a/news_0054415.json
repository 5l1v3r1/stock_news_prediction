It has accused union members from competitor airlines such as TAP and easyJet of organising the strike to disrupt its operations, a charge the union has rejected. \nRyanair said in a statement there had been a small number of cancellations on Thursday due to the strike, which it described as “unnecessary and unjustified.” \nData on its web site showed 20 flights had been cancelled, 14 of them to or from Porto airport. \nRyanair flew additional flights on Thursday for disrupted passengers and is planning additional flights on Friday morning, the statement said. The majority of Portuguese crews worked as normal on Thursday, it said.
