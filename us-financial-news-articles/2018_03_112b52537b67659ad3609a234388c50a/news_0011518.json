He also finished with a season-best eight rebounds, eight assists, hit all four free throws and blocked two shots.\nHoward celebrated his 19th birthday by becoming the youngest player in school history to reach 1,000 career points.

With 3:21 left, Rowsey hit a deep 3-pointer to give Marquette a 73-69 lead and with 2:40 left, he hit another long 3-pointer for a 76-71 lead.\nWith two minutes left, Rowsey sank a 3-pointer from the top of the key to make it 79-73.

After missing badly on a 3-point attempt with 32 seconds left, Foster cleanly hit a 3-pointer five seconds later to make it 81-78.\nWith 23.5 seconds left, Hauser missed a 3-pointer but on the next possession he blocked Foster’s 3-point attempt with his right hand, Rowsey grabbed the rebound and sank two free throws with 13.5 seconds to go.\nFoster made a 3-pointer with four seconds left to make it 83-81 but Howard iced the game at the line with three seconds remaining.\n— Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:54:13.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
