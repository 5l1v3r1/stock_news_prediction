It also stands in contrast with dozens of firms whose applications to go public were rejected in recent months after regulatory scrutiny of their reported profits and disclosures. \nFoxconn Industrial was set up in March 2015 and is a subsidiary of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. 2317, +2.80% , one of the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturers, better known as Foxconn. The parent company in December said it was planning to list its unit in Shanghai, and Foxconn Industrial obtained clearance from China’s State Council before submitting its listing application to the China Securities Regulatory Commission. \nThe securities regulator typically requires companies to have a three-year profit record before they can list on the main boards of the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges. That has deterred some startup companies and led them to launch IPOs in Hong Kong or New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T15:44:21.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
