(the “ Company ” or “ Viemed ”) (TSXV:VMD), a home medical equipment supplier that provides post-acute respiratory care services in the United States, announced today that it has posted its year end December 31, 2017 results on SEDAR after the completion of the independent audit.\nHighlights are as follows (all dollar amounts are USD):\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $46.9 million and gross margin was $34.6 million, or 74%. Revenues and gross margin increased 50% and 84%, respectively over the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company has begun to classify more expenses in the cost of goods sold line item to better reflect the direct nature of the therapist's costs and the equipment depreciation in the business.\nThe Company had a working capital balance of $4 million as of December 31, 2017 and total long-term debt of $800,000. This, along with the $5 million of unused line of credit, provides a stable liquidity profile for the Company.\nThe Company grew its ventilator patient count by approximately 43% during the year which is the most significant contributor to its active patient count and growth in revenues.\nCapital expenditures totaled $10.3 million during the year to support organic growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year totaled approximately $12 million or 26%.\nFourth quarter 2017 revenues totaled approximately $13.5 million which is an increase of 47% over fourth quarter 2016.\nThe Company expects to generate total revenues of approximately $14.0 - $14.3 million during the first quarter of 2018 (an increase of approximately 41% in revenues over the first quarter of 2017) and expects similar margins during the current year. Despite the seasonality of the business and the national flu epidemic, the Company is expecting this growth and has set records for new patients during January and February.\n“We are very excited to have the opportunity to communicate our positive financial results as a standalone business which comes as a result of the tireless work of our management team and employees,” said Casey Hoyt, Viemed CEO. “While 2017 was an outstanding year, we have started 2018 off to a record start and plan to drive shareholder value. With less than 5% market penetration for our services, we feel that we are scratching the surface with how many lives can benefit from our therapy. Our team is fortunate to be running a company that has the ability to reduce the costs of healthcare through a practice of improving quality of life of our patients.”\nConference Call information The details of the conference call are: Tuesday, March 13, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time US & Canada Toll Free: Dial In: (800) 289-0517 Meeting ID Number: 9332328 ABOUT VIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nViemed, through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries Sleep Management, L.L.C. and Home Sleep Delivered, L.L.C., is a home medical equipment supplier that provides post-acute respiratory care services in the United States.

The Company's presentation of this financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. This financial measure is intended to provide additional information to investors concerning the Company's performance. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and is a measure of a company's operating performance. Essentially, it's a way to evaluate a company's performance without having to factor in financing decisions, accounting decisions or tax environments. The following table shows the Company’s Non-IFRS measure (EBITDA) reconciled to net income for the indicated periods:\nGross $USD % Net Income % $ 8,176,000 17 % Adjustments % (Income Tax, Depreciation, Interest, and Stock Compensation) $ 3,816,000 9 % Adjusted EBITDA % $ 11,992,000 26 % Management uses this non-GAAP measure as a key metric in the evaluation of the Company's performance and the consolidated financial results. The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors in their assessment of the operating performance and the valuation of the Company. In addition, this non-GAAP measure addresses questions the Company routinely receives from analysts and investors and, in order to assure that all investors have access to similar data, the Company has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. However, non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource:Viemed Healthcare, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Hhou-OkSQwLNkJDjZXHKLZjSjzAW48iQEJsubwbaO03HevXxnqPYWO54QsBOogdVdcMTOycx1ANmXzlYX45b0a2BDL7OAqyHPaXqj6JdDkk=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5h2y5iq48dTCtNN6KtbTyil8_Jp48tgWoW3MD5Fi1U5qufTKHklponQoHjCnP19P8INAnrz31qb49i-803842un-8wGX82d7BorJ9ZeXbjU=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/454cd567-87d2-498b-80e1-644b1104411f", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rhacBHRpmXZhaaT8jlKjSEs4vTJb8WwbVN_Qxg_ffxLro-FIVoUkDLSq_FQIEr7nlrE4KEhElz3A_P7MV7bAkA=="], "published": "2018-03-13T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T02:38:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
