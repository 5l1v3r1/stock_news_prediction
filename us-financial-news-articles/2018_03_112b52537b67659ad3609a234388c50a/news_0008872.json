A Citi economic surprise index for the currency bloc is at near six-month lows.\n\"There is some lingering caution around the outcome of the Italian election results and only the German vote prevented a bigger drop in euro/dollar,\" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.\nshow chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T04:41:11.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
