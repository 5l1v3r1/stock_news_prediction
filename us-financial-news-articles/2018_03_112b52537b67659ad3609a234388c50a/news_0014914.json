The side letter agreement reveals the true identities of the parties as Clifford and Trump, according to the lawsuit.\nClifford asks in the lawsuit for the Los Angeles County Superior Court to declare the agreement and side agreement invalid and unenforceable.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Avenatti was not immediately available for comment.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Clifford and Trump had an intimate relationship that lasted from the summer of 2006 well into 2007, including meetings in Lake Tahoe and at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\nDaniels was quoted in a 2011 interview with In Touch Weekly magazine that she had an affair with Trump after they met at a Lake Tahoe golf tournament in 2006, not long after Trumps wife, Melania, had given birth to their son, Barron.\nCohen has said he paid Clifford $130,000 of his own money in 2016, the year Trump was elected president, but said neither the Trump Organization nor Trumps campaign was a party to the transaction, though he declined to say publicly what it was for.\nThe lawsuit said the 2016 hush agreement called for $130,000 to be paid into the trust account of Clifford's then-attorney. In return, Clifford was not to disclose any confidential information about Trump.\nThe suit alleges Cohen has tried to keep Clifford from talking about the relationship as recently as Feb. 27, 2018.\n\"The attempts to intimidate Ms. Clifford into silence and 'shut her up' in order to 'protect Mr. Trump' continue unabated,\" the lawsuit said.
