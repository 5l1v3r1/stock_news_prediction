England won by six wickets Manchester 2008 - Match drawn London FIRST TEST Eden Park, Auckland - Capacity: 50,000 Originally a drained swamp, it became a sports ground in 1900 and has been the home of Auckland cricket since 1910 and Auckland rugby since 1925. It is also the site of the infamous flour bomb rugby test between South Africa and New Zealand in 1981 and where the hosts collapsed to the lowest test cricket score of 26 against England in 1955. While a dual-purpose venue it has become more of a specialised rugby ground with the construction of stands for the 2011 Rugby World Cup creating a strange configuration for cricket with short boundaries behind square and straight down the ground. Has fallen out of favour as a test venue in recent years, having hosted just 10 matches in the last 20 years and two in the last decade, with New Zealand Cricket preferring the boutique-sized grounds in Hamilton, Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington. Its floodlights and large capacity, however, make it ideal as the venue for the countryâ€™s first day-night test.
