REUTERS/Michaela Rehle/File Photo Daimler has adjusted the way revenues are booked by implementing accounting standards IFRS 9 and 15 which changes the way financial instruments are booked, the Stuttgart-based carmaker said.\n“For each of Mercedes-Benz Cars and Daimler Buses, Daimler anticipates earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) slightly above the prior-year level. The outlook for the other divisions’ earnings remains unchanged,” Daimler said in a statement on Tuesday.\nAdjusting for the new standards, group revenue in 2017 was 164.2 billion euros rather than a previously stated 164.3 billion euros. Group EBIT in 2017 is now 14.3 billion euros rather than 14.7 billion euros a previously stated.\nReporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Arno Schuetze\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T18:32:04.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
