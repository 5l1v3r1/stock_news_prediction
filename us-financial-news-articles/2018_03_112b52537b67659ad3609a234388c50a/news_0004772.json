Evidence at the trial included FBI phone taps as well as recordings made by Pawlowski aides who wore hidden microphones and cameras to record conversations for federal investigators.\nThe lehighvalleylive.com website reported that Pawlowski would forfeit his office and no sentencing date had been set. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney could not be reached for comment.\nPawlowski was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud, making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and multiple counts of bribery, attempted extortion, mail fraud, wire fraud.\nHe was acquitted of attempted extortion, three counts of bribery and three counts of mail fraud, lehighvalleylive.com said.\nHis convictions for conspiracy, lying to the FBI and one of his bribery convictions each carries a five-year maximum prison sentence. Each of his remaining bribery convictions carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Each of his remaining convictions of mail fraud and wire fraud carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence, the website said.\nReporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T06:12:08.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
