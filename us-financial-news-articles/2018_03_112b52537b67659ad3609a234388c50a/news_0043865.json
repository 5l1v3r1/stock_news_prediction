We’ve got a car that’s competitive here, it’s the fourth best car on the grid this weekend,” he told reporters.\n“This team is the smallest on the grid, and if not the lowest then one of the lowest budgets and the least amount of people and resources. And yet we’ve got the fourth best car on this track in qualifying.”\nFerrari had Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel qualifying second and third with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen fourth. Mercedes’ four times world champion Lewis Hamilton starts on pole position.
