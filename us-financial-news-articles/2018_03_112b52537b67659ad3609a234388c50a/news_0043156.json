She’s sitting in a booth in a bustling West Village diner just a few days before the New York premiere of the revival of Tony Kushner’s pioneering 1991 drama, Angels in America , in which she plays Harper, the fragile, pill-popping wife of a closeted Mormon law clerk. Unlike Harper, Gough prides herself on keeping her feet on the ground, rather than drifting off into fantasy or self-absorption. She doesn’t let her tortured characters bleed into her real life. “I’m not saying you can’t feel a bit shit in your everyday life,” she says. “But come on. I’m burning a $300 candle in my fireplace. If I don’t understand how fortunate I am, what’s the point?”\n‘ There can be a lot of trickery on film and TV but theater is a leveler. ’\nThis no-nonsense perspective is due, in great part, to the fact that Gough waited almost 20 years for her big break, which finally came in her mid-30s. “I never had the luxury of being [a] method [actor], because the day after I finished a West End show, I had to be a waitress in a place like this,” she says. Even now, Gough likes to remember her father reminding her to “just get over yourself.”\nACTING OUT Gough and Keira Knightley in ‘Colette.’ Photo: Robert Viglasky, Courtesy of Bleecker Street One of 11 children, Gough left her family home in County Clare, Ireland, at 16 to move to London with a boyfriend. She soon took to theater, earning a scholarship to drama school and working in several plays a year for nearly two decades. But at 34, she was still barely scraping by. She decided to go on one more audition and asked her agent to get in touch with the National Theatre, an institution that hadn’t called her in years. (“I thought I had a bad reputation,” she says. “Because I can be hard work for some people.”) It turned out the theater was struggling to find the right person for the role of Emma, the steely but floundering, drug-addicted actress at the center of Duncan MacMillan’s play People, Places & Things.\nThe poster for the New York production of ‘People, Places & Things.’ Photo: Courtesy of St. Ann’s Warehouse Although she thought the audition went well, Gough decided if it didn’t work out, she’d teach drama. In fact, she wound up being an uncanny fit, and the role launched her into a level of stardom that’s increasingly rare for a theater actress. Reviews have described her performance as “extreme” and “ingenious” and “greater than the script.” “The audition was so good that I didn’t quite believe it,” says Jeremy Herrin, the play’s director. At a callback, they asked Gough, without warning, to perform one of the most emotionally treacherous scenes from the play—Emma’s confrontation with a doctor. “I wanted to test [her] preparation,” Herrin says. “She knew the whole script.” The play debuted in London in late 2015 before doing a run in New York last year, where it struck a chord with American audiences who saw it through the lens of the opioid crisis. According to Herrin, over the course of the performances, Gough’s true artistic triumph was her restraint. “She learned not to demonstrate the character’s emotions, but to feel them,” he says.\nGough and Andrew Garfield during a London performance of ‘Angels in America.’ Photo: Helen Maybanks Gough’s success as Emma brought her an array of new opportunities, including this latest, critically acclaimed turn in Angels (she performed in the show’s London run last year). Whereas Emma was a firebrand, Harper has a meeker and more sensitive quality that Gough is able to draw out carefully. “[Denise’s Harper] is much more vulnerable [than other interpretations], less railing,” says Angels director Marianne Elliott. “She sort of found the poetry within Harper’s imagination.”\nGough has also caught the attention of Hollywood casting directors, and she’s started to branch out into film. In Colette , which premiered at Sundance earlier this year, she plays an androgynous aristocrat opposite Keira Knightley. And yet, she remains committed to the stage. “There can be a lot of trickery on film and TV,” she says. “But theater is a leveler. You have to show up every night and do it.”\nMore from WSJ.
