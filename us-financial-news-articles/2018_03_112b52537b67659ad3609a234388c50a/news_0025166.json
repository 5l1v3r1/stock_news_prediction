The DropBox logo is seen in this illustration photo July 28, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration Dropbox expects its debut price to be between $16 and $18 per share, the company said in a filing. ( bit.ly/2FwgJJ2 ) The San Francisco-based company, which started as a free service to share and store photos, music and other large files, competes with much larger technology firms such as Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) Google, Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) and Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) as well as cloud-storage rival Box Inc ( BOX.N ). In its regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Dropbox reported 2017 revenue of $1.11 billion, up 31 percent from $844.8 million, a year earlier. The company’s net loss narrowed to $111.7 million in 2017 from $210.2 million in 2016. Dropbox, which has 11 million paying users across 180 countries, said that about half of its 2017 revenue came from customers outside the United States. The IPO will be a key test of Dropbox’s worth after it was valued at almost $10 billion in a private fundraising round in 2014. Goldman Sachs & Co, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank Securities, BofA Merrill Lynch are the lead underwriters for the public offer.
