We were targeting the European record but really did not expect a result like this and never dreamed about the world record,” said one of the Poles’ astonished quartet, Rafal Omelko, with a bewildered smile.\nThe quartet of Karol Zalewski, Omelko, established a world indoor mark of three minutes 01.77 seconds, which was remarkable enough in itself.\nYet what truly amazed was the manner in which Krzewina, turning himself into an instant Polish hero, hunted down American anchor leg runner Vernon Norwood to pip what was supposed to be an unbeatable U.S. squad in the dying strides.\nNorwood, the 2016 U.S. indoor champion who has a lifetime best indoors of 45.31 seconds compared to Krzewina’s 46.15, should have made it a formality, as he took the baton for the final leg while leading by some five meters.\nYet the man who had anchored the Americans to victory two years ago in Portland ran a curiously distracted race out front, something he appeared to accept afterwards when he reflected gloomily:“The team did a great job but no comment on my last leg.”\nEverybody, though, was commenting on Krzewina’s never-say-die effort to win from a seemingly impossible position.“I think the last lap with Jakub was the crucial one,” said Omelko.\n“He pushed it so hard and he is very, very strong this year.

Still, this was a big shock.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T22:41:06.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
