Kirby, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ocean Power Technologies, “Our recent contract with Premier Oil to study the feasibility of deploying our PB3 PowerBuoy™ for site decommissioning operations in the North Sea is a leading indicator in expanding our capabilities into the oil and gas sector.”\nOperations Review\nMr. Kirby added, “Our initial work with companies and national and international governments has helped us develop a variety of new opportunities around the world, and has also led to expansion, both in our facilities and on our management team. During the quarter, management authorized the construction of two additional PowerBuoys™ and we completed our move to a new facility, expanding both our corporate headquarters and our manufacturing operations. This new facility will support the completion of the four additional PB3 units, two of which we announced last quarter. In addition, we added Chris Phebus as Vice President of Engineering. He comes with a proven track record from GE and served as GE’s General Manager and Executive Engineering Director for GE Subsea Product and Projects. Chris is further strengthening our capabilities as we continue to scale our business.\n“We remain excited and encouraged that our PB3 PowerBuoy™ offers a unique technology that can meet the needs of current and potential customers in growing markets including oil and gas, defense and security, communications, and ocean observing. We have made significant investments in increased sales and marketing activities, along with initiatives to partner with others and bring about continuous performance improvements, which we believe are critical to our long-term success, and can result in a robust pipeline of potential customers,” concluded Kirby.\nFinancial Review\nThird Quarter Overview\nNo revenue was recorded for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 ended January 31, 2018 as compared to revenue of $221,000 for the prior-year period. The decrease in revenues over the prior year was due to the expected completion of contracts with Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding and Department of Defense Office of Naval Research during the second quarter of the current fiscal year.\nThe net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.7 million, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million for the prior-year period. The decrease in net loss in the current year period as compared to the same period of prior year is mainly attributable to a higher income tax benefit recorded in the current year, partially offset by current year period higher product development costs as a result of the two additional PB3 units in process of being completed.\nFirst Nine Months Overview\nRevenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $289,000, compared to revenue of $593,000 for the same period in fiscal 2017. The net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $6.9 million, compared to a net loss of $6.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2017. The decrease in net loss in the current year period as compared to the same period of the prior year is mainly attributable to a higher income tax benefit recorded in the current year and lower product development spending and is mostly offset by the change in fair value of warrant liabilities.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $14.4 million as of January 31, 2018, up from $8.4 million on April 30, 2017. As of both January 31, 2018, and April 30, 2017, restricted cash was $0.5 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $8.2 million during the nine months ended January 31, 2018. Excluding $1.1 million of cash payments made in the current fiscal year related to the disposition of the mooring anchoring system from a prior project in Reedsport, Oregon, the PB40 site final closeout off the coast of New Jersey, and completion of legal matters, net cash used in operating activities was $7.1 million during the nine months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to $7.6 million during the prior-year period.\nConclusion\nMr. Kirby closed by stating “We are very excited about where we are now in our product commercialization and business development efforts. We believe that we have a unique product, a great strategy, and an exceptional team. We intend to continue our work to bring this technology to the marketplace and build relationships with quality customers around the globe.”\nConference Call & Webcast Details\nOcean Power Technologies’ management will host a conference call and webcast to review the third quarter financial and operating results on March 7, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.
