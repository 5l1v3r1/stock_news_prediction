Both print publications maintain websites as well as e-editions and news apps for their readers.

Reed, New Media President and Chief Executive Officer. “We see Palm Beach as another attractive and growing market that fits in well with our current Florida footprint. These papers have been the primary source of news in their respective communities for over 100 years and have created high digital engagement that we are excited to work to build upon with our UpCurve product offerings. We are looking forward to welcoming the Palm Beach employees to the New Media team and look forward to carrying on their legacy of strong local journalism.”\nWe expect the transaction to close in the second quarter.\nAbout New Media Investment Group Inc.\nNew Media supports small to mid-sized communities by providing locally-focused print and digital content to its consumers and premier marketing and technology solutions to its small and medium business partners.
