It was Quote: d at 4.4575 to the greenback on Thursday compared to 4.4650 a week ago.\n“As we enter the last month of Q1, we expect demand for the dollar to pick up as we anticipate brisk business by both importers and corporates, reversing part of the cedi’s gains made in the last month,” said Raphael Adubila of Accra-based Northstar Home Finance.\nKENYA The Kenyan shilling is expected to remain stable against the dollar, supported by remittances and horticulture export earnings, traders said.\nCommercial banks Quote: d the shilling at 101.30/40 per dollar, compared with 101.85/95 at last Thursday’s close.\n“We’ve had customers selling dollars ... local players who are usually paid in dollars like the tea sector, they were offloading (dollars) that’s why the shilling strengthened,” said a trader from a commercial bank.\nUGANDA The Ugandan shilling is seen trading stable over the next one week amid a slump in appetite for hard currency from both importers and commercial banks.\nAt 1017 GMT commercial banks Quote: d the shilling at 3,640/3,650, stronger than last Thursday’s close of 3,655/3,665.\nA trader at a leading commercial bank said demand was weak from merchandise importers hurt by slow consumer spending. The shilling would play in the 3,640-3,655-range over the coming days, he said.\nZAMBIA The kwacha is likely to remain stable in the coming week, supported by higher copper prices and a favourable credit rating from negative to stable by ratings agency Moody’s.\nAt 1125 GMT on Thursday, commercial banks Quote: d the currency of Africa’s second-largest copper producer at 9.7300 per dollar, stronger than a close of 9.8200 a week ago.\n“The currency has been trading in the 9.700-9.850 range for the most part of the last few months. It will take a significant shift in dynamics to break the firmly established range,” the local branch of South Africa’s First National Bank (FNB) said.\nTANZANIA The shilling is expected to hold steady against the dollar in the days ahead, buoyed by a slowdown in demand for greenbacks from major importers.\nCommercial banks Quote: d the shilling at 2,253/2,258 to the dollar on Thursday, weaker than 2,247/2,257 a week ago.\n“The supply of dollars is matched by demand, so we expect to see the same shilling-dollar exchange rate levels to be maintained next week,” said a trader at CRDB Bank.
