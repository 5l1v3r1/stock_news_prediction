REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Though the decision came into effect on March 6 it was announced only on Tuesday and Uber services were still available in the Slovak capital Bratislava.\n“The defendant is obliged to refrain from allowing people who do not meet legal requirements (...) to carry out taxi services in Slovakia,” court spokesman Pavol Adamciak said.\nThe Bratislava-based Association of certified taxi drivers filed the lawsuit in January, arguing Uber drivers do not meet the requirements for professional taxi drivers and the cars do not meet the safety and regulatory requirements for professional transport services.\nUber in Slovakia declined to comment until it received the court decision.\nUber has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services.\nThe European Union’s top court said in a landmark ruling in December that Uber should be classified as a transport service and regulated like other taxi operators.\nLast year, London deemed Uber unfit to run a taxi service and stripped it of its license to operate. Uber is appealing against the decision.\nReporting By Tatiana Jancarikova; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T14:12:49.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
