REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo Kristin Rose-Moehring, equality commissioner since 2001, made the proposal to strike male-specific references from the anthem in a letter to staff at Germany’s family ministry ahead of International Women’s Day, German media reported on Sunday.\nGermany should replace“Vaterland”, or fatherland, with“Heimatland,” or homeland, and substitute“courageously with heart and hand” for“brotherly with heart and hand”, she wrote.\nThe proposal surfaced hours before Germany’s center-left Social Democrats (SPD) announced that 66 percent of its members backed a re-run of the coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives that has ruled Germany since 2013.\nThe SPD is slated to retain the family ministry in the new government, while Horst Seehofer, leader of the CSU Bavarian conservatives, will head an expanded interior ministry that will also focus on“Heimat” or homeland.\nRose-Moehring said her proposal suits the times.\nFILE PHOTO: German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron listen to national anthems during a ceremony at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, May 15, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo “Why don’t we make our national anthem ... gender sensitive,” Rose-Moehring wrote.“It wouldn’t hurt, would it? And it fits with the new federal ministry for interior, construction and homeland.”\nParts of the“Song of Germany” have been the German anthem since 1922, although since the creation of the modern federal republic, only the third stanza has been used. It begins with the words“unity and justice and freedom”.\nFILE PHOTO: 2016 Rio Paralympics - Wheelchair Basketball - Final - Women's Gold Medal Final - Germany v USA - Rio Olympic Arena - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - 16/09/2016.
