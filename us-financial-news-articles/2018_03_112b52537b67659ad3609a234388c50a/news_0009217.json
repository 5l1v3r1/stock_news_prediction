It is also considering issuing a 10-year sukuk, the document showed.\nSpeaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the conference, Hajjar said he expected to sign a memorandum of understanding with the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) soon, on joint investing in Africa.\n“A collaboration and cooperation with the Chinese and others to finance infrastructure mainly — roads, transportation, energy and other — is very important,” he said. “So we are going toward this direction and then planning to visit them there and also to sign an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with the Chinese bank in order to cooperate, especially in Africa.”\nHajjar declined to give further details on the timing and size of the cooperation, but said it would target the 26 poorest countries on the continent.
