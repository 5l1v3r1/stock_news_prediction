They are expected to appear before a prosecutor on Wednesday. \nGreece has a long history of political violence. It experienced a rise in attacks by suspected far-right groups at the height of the country’s financial crisis, its worst in decades, which started in 2010 and has caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. \nReporting by Renee Maltezou, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T17:59:59.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
