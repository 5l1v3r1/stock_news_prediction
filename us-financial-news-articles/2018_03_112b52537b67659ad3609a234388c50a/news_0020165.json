Doing so caused the funds and their investors to lose securities-lending income without receiving any of the tax benefit, the SEC said.\nThe advisers did not disclose the conflict of interest to the funds’ board of directors or in the funds’ prospectuses, the SEC said.\nThe advisers neither admitted nor denied the findings, the SEC said.\n“We are pleased to have reached this settlement,” Voya spokesman Chris Breslin said in a statement. “Today’s announcement means we avoid a lengthy and costly litigation process and can focus our resources on delivering high-quality investment service to our clients.”\nUnder the amount to be paid under the agreement, about $2 million will go directly to the affected mutual funds, the SEC said.\nVoya manages 401(k) plans for Reuters.\nReporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T00:51:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
