CSX 0.95% is scaling back spending as the freight railroad extends the dramatic overhaul set in motion by its former chief executive, railroad turnaround expert Hunter Harrison, who died in December .\nCSX plans to slash annual capital expenditures by about 20%, to $1.6 billion, over the next few years and streamline operations by eliminating “tens of thousands of touches” the railroad has had along its network, Chief Executive James Foote said Thursday at an investor conference in New York. The railroad also plans to cut more jobs, trimming the workforce to 21,000 by 2020.\nSeveral analysts said they came away from the meeting more confident in the railroad’s ability to execute those plans. Stephens Inc. said in a Friday research note it had “increased conviction” around CSX’s long-term earnings and free cash flow targets, while a Citi note said the conference highlighted the company’s slate of strong operating executives.\n“This is not my first rodeo,” said Mr. Foote, who told investors he started out working the night shift at a Soo Line Railroad Corp. roundhouse when he was in high school. He joined CSX in October as operations chief, having previously worked for Mr. Harrison as head of sales and marketing at Canadian National Railway Co.\nAt CSX, Mr. Foote said, “we are committed to following through with what he started.”\nCSX shares were up 0.8% in Friday afternoon trading, to $54.97.\nMr. Harrison joined the Jacksonville, Fla. railway in March 2017. He moved swiftly to idle hundreds of locomotives, shut down rail yards and implement a new schedule, all aimed at running the company’s 21,000-mile network more efficiently. Known as “precision scheduled railroading,” the strategy helped Mr. Harrison reshape Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. , that country’s two largest railroads.\nBut at CSX, the tactic also led to significant service problems last summer , delaying deliveries of everything from coal to frozen McDonald’s Corp. french fries. The issues prompted an apology tour by Mr. Foote, who told customers the railroad was fixing the problems , which he attributed to the aggressive timeline for the changes.\nCSX executives say that after some initial pushback, workers have now fallen in line with their turnaround plan and implementation of precision scheduled railroading.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Foote said he’s not apologizing for how CSX operates today. “What we do apologize for was the pace of change that the customer had to endure last summer when Hunter carpet-bombed the network and made dramatic structural changes overnight,” he said.\nThe railroad is also trimming its footprint across the Eastern U.S. “We’re freeing up pump yards, surplus real estate everywhere,” Mr. Foote said. “If we don’t need it, we’re going to get rid of it.”\nCSX plans to cut annual capital expenditures to around $1.6 billion for the next few years, down from $2.7 billion in 2016 and $2 billion last year. The cuts aren’t because CSX is deferring maintenance, the company said, adding it plans to replace more rails and ties this year than in each of the previous two years. The railroad isn’t buying new locomotives or railcars, and spending on an electronic safety system called positive train control is nearing its end.\nFederal investigators say that system could have averted last month’s deadly train collision on a CSX track south of Columbia, S.C.\nThose spending levels would allow the company to maintain its current infrastructure, but don’t “reflect much in the way of growth or strategic investment,” Bernstein transportation analyst David Bernstein said in a research note Friday. He said it would be difficult to sustain that level past 2020, particularly if CSX ends up proceeding with a project to increase the height of a Baltimore rail tunnel.\nMr. Harrison had backed out of the plan, but CSX is still in discussions with Maryland officials over the proposal, which would allow clearance for trains with double-stacked containers throughout CSX’s primary network.\nWrite to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com and Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T04:46:06.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
