The proceeds go directly into the EU budget.\nEU anti-fraud office OLAF had said last year that Britain should pay because it allowed the scam to go ahead.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T21:25:20.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
