He did not elaborate.\nHe said Southeast Asia’s largest economy will likely grow 5.2-5.3 percent in 2018, fractionally above last year’s pace.\nWarjiyo is the sole nominee proposed for central bank governor by President Joko Widodo.\nIf Warjiyo’s nomination is approved by parliament, he will succeed Agus Martowardojo, whose five-year term as governor ends in May.\nReporting by Maikel Jefriando; Writing by Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T08:24:16.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
