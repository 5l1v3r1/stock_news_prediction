Takeda Pharmaceutical's signboard is seen on its headquarters building in Tokyo, Japan January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nShares in Takeda fell more than 6 percent at one point in early morning trade, the lowest since last April, sharply underperforming the broader Tokyo market .TOPX , which was around 1 percent. \nTakeda said on Wednesday it was at a “preliminary and exploratory stage” of considering a bid for the rare disease specialist, adding that it had not approached Shire’s board. Shire said it noted Takeda’s statement, and confirmed it had not received an approach. FILE PHOTO: Vitamins made by Shire are displayed at a chemist's in northwest London, Britain, July 11, 2014. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo \nTakeda’s potential bid for Shire, most of whose employees are based in North America, immediately stoked expectations for another takeover battle in the deal-hungry pharma industry. \nShire’s shares ended 15.7 percent higher, valuing the group at about 32 billion pounds ($45 billion). \nShire sells treatments for rare diseases and attention deficit disorder. Takeda said buying it could create a global biopharmaceutical leader, boosting its position in the United States and in the fields of oncology, gastrointestinal diseases and neuroscience. \nThe drugs industry has seen a surge in dealmaking as large players look for promising assets to improve their product pipelines. \nIn recent months, France’s Sanofi ( SASY.PA ) agreed to buy U.S hemophilia specialist Bioverativ BIVV.O for $11.6 billion and Belgium’s Ablynx ( ABLX.BR ) for 3.9 billion euro ($4.8 billion). Before that, U.S.-based Celgene ( CELG.O ) bought cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics JUNO.O. \n($1 = 0.8125 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T09:35:51.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
