They will get to vote again on the new name by post. \nJean-Marie Le Pen, the 89-year old far-right veteran who founded the party in 1972, called the name change political “suicide” in an interview with Reuters last month. \nReporting by Simon Carraud, writing by Michel Rose, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-11T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T17:39:14.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
