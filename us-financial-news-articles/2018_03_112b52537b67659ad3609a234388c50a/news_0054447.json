Related Coverage France could adapt its Syria operations in Islamic State fight - source \nA senior Turkish official had said on Friday a French pledge to help stabilise a region of northern Syria controlled by Kurdish-dominated forces amounted to support for terrorism and could make France a “target of Turkey”. \nMacron had said in December he expected the campaign against Islamic State in Syria to be completed in February. \nAsked about comments by U.S. President Donald Trump that he might disengage from Syria “very soon”, the source said Paris had at this stage not received any official request to send reinforcements. \nFrance, like the United States, has already extended arms and training to the YPG-led militia in the fight against Islamic State, and has dozens of special forces based in the region, which has infuriated Turkey. \nTurkey stormed the northern Syrian town of Afrin last week, and has repeatedly threatened to push its operations further east to the SDF-controlled Manbij where U.S. troops are stationed. \nMacron’s office on Thursday said the young leader had offered to mediate between the Turks and the SDF, which it said had distanced itself from the PKK. \n“We will continue the dialogue with Turkey, it is an important and essential partner to find a solution to the Syrian civil war,” the source said, responding to a barrage of angry rhetoric on Friday from Ankara. \nHowever, he warned that any military advance from Turkey to Manbij would be “unacceptable”.
