Carolina is nine points out of that spot with five games remaining.\nKyle Palmieri scored two power-play goals and Pavel Zacha added an even-strength goal for the Devils.\nTaylor Hall assisted on the first three New Jersey goals, giving him 52 helpers for the season. That matches the most in a season for the Devils since Patrik Elias had 52 in 2011-12.\nHall’s delivery in front of the net for Palmieri’s second goal allowed the Devils to tie the game with 8:55 to play.\nNew Jersey goalie Keith Kinkaid made 31 saves, though he stopped only seven shots in the third period with much of the action at the other end of the ice.\nNoesen’s 12th goal of the season came off a rebound, breaking a 3-3 tie as the Devils put together an active and productive third period.\nNew Jersey has won three games in a row and six of its last eight games.\nNoah Hanifin scored early in the third period to give Carolina a 3-2 lead.\nPhillip Di Giuseppe and Warren Foegele each netted a goal, and Jeff Skinner posted two assists for Carolina.\nThe result prevented the Hurricanes from notching their second four-game winning streak of the season.\nCarolina goalie Scott Darling stopped 41 shots.\nZacha opened the scoring 5:47 into the game.\nDi Giuseppe took a pass from Elias Lindholm and blasted a shot as he came down the slot to tie it for the Hurricanes at 11:41 of the opening period. Foegele, who scored in his NHL debut a night earlier against Ottawa, gave Carolina a 2-1 lead at 16:53 of the first period.\nPalmieri’s first goal was the only scoring action of the second period. His tally tied the game 2-2 with 14:07 remaining in the period.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:41:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
