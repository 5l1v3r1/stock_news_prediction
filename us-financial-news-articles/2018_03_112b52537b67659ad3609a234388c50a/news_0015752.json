That’s far longer than the typical horizon of digital currency funds of just a few months.\n“What you’re seeing is the next wave of serious investment coming to an exciting, recently-legitimized asset class,” Samani said in an interview late on Wednesday.\nDigital currencies such as bitcoin have emerged as a new asset class over the last two years as its underlying technology called the blockchain, an online database, has gained worldwide acceptance from corporations and financial institutions.\nMulticoin is one of 225 crypto funds across seven strategy types, with combined assets estimated at $3.5 billion to $5 billion, according to data from Autonomous NEXT. The funds invest in cryptocurrencies, which use cryptography for security.\nAside from Andreessen, who co-founded the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, Multicoin’s investors include David Sacks, the first chief operating officer of PayPal Holdings Inc and founder of enterprise social network Yammer Inc, and Elad Gil, co-founder of genomic testing company Color Genomics, Samani said.\nChris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, and Bill Lee, a partner at Craft Ventures also invested in Multicoin, he said.\nMulticoin’s funding reflects a trend in which venture capital partners and investors are turning to crypto funds as individual investors. Most traditional venture capital firms have investor agreements that bar them from deploying cash into high-risk assets, such as digital currencies.\n“While there are lots of similarities between crypto investing and traditional startup investing, there are many differences,” Samani said.\n“Most obviously, crypto assets become liquid much sooner in their life cycles than traditional private equity,” he added. “In addition to liquidity, everything in crypto is open source, which requires thinking about investing in a fundamentally different way.”\nSamani said he believes there could be consolidation in the crypto funds industry, and he expects sub-scale funds to have difficulty surviving.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Peter Szekely\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T02:45:09.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
