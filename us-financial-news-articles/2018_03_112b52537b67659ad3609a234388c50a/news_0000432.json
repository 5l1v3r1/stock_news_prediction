For Fortune’s annual list of the best companies to work for in the region, research and consulting firm Great Place to Work surveyed thousands of employees, to bring you the creme de la creme of workplaces in the area—each one with a unique assortment of great perks, camaraderie, and most critically, uplifting workplace cultures. \n\n(Scroll down for small and medium-sized companies.) 1. Salesforce \nNumber of U.S. employees: 17417 Industry: Information Technology Major locations in Bay Area: San Francisco Number of locations: 59 \nEmployees say: \n“When things aren’t going as planned, people are encouraged to call it out and help drive the necessary change to make things better. This creates a culture of innovation, with people striving to find new ways to solve our biggest pain-points.” \n“The people at Salesforce genuinely care about each other, their communities, and the company. Many people are particularly inspired by our CEO who encourages us all to contribute to the world around us in meaningful ways, both personally and professionally. I am very proud to work for a company that embodies the ideals of equality and that allows all employees to bring their whole selves to work. I would also like to give a shoutout to our amazing benefits program, which includes fertility benefits such as support for IVF treatments, etc.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 2. Cooley \nNumber of U.S. employees: 1892 Industry: Professional Services U.S. headquarters: Palo Alto, Calif. Major locations in Bay Area: Palo Alto, San Francisco Number of locations: 10 \nEmployees say: \n“The Cooley Culture is contagious. Management sincerely cares about its employees and provides training, support and mentorship. The atmosphere is collaborative from support staff to management. Employees are rewarded for their stellar efforts.” \n“Cooley has a culture of inclusion and open communication. We want everyone in the firm to understand where we are going as a firm and why. We feel strongly that communication is empowering. The best example of that is the annual state of the firm presentations by our CEO, Administrative Partner and CFO. Over the course of two weeks in mid-to late February they travel to every office to present the prior year’s results and to preview the coming year from a strategic and financial perspective. EVERY employee in the firm is invited to attend to hear from firm leadership in great detail how Cooley is doing and what the firm hopes to achieve together going forward. The level of detail and transparency is remarkable and likely unmatched among the leading law firms with whom Cooley competes.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 3. Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants Courtesy of Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants \nNumber of U.S. employees: 8265 Industry: Hospitality Major locations in Bay Area: San Francisco Number of locations: 116 \nEmployees say: \n“The people here are incredible! I’ve never felt so connected to and supported by a manager as I have here. Managers here believe in their employees and truly want to see them grow and learn within the company.” \n“Kimpton really truly allows me to be my authentic self. It’s difficult to measure the value of the freedom to be me but I can sincerely say it has made me a better employee and I would even say those around me agree. If I need a couple of minutes to reconnect, I am free to grab a yoga mat and stretch or meditate or do whatever I need to do to refocus. This ability for everyone to be themselves makes it seem like everyone is on the same playing field. Upper management is so open and the comfort level afforded by that makes it encouraging to speak to them directly without having to follow a chain of command.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 4. Workday \nNumber of U.S. employees: 5473 Industry: Information Technology Major locations in Bay Area: Pleasanton \nEmployees say: \n“We are blessed to have a culture that supports its people on a daily basis. This includes career development, training, assistance with customer issues and problem solving, support for wellbeing and a true desire to see people be successful.” \n“Workday retains a culture that truly does care about its people. I say people instead of employees, because we’re treated that way. We’re encouraged to balance our work lives and our personal lives. The company doesn’t take itself too seriously, while knowing that we are still going above and beyond to get our work done and deliver. Our conferences provide a sense of community while making sure are all up to date on what the company is doing to improve and grow.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 5. Accenture \nNumber of U.S. employees: 50000 Industry: Professional Services U.S. headquarters: New York City Major locations in Bay Area: San Francisco \nEmployees say: \n“The consistent level of intelligence throughout the entire organization, when combined with the most collaborative working environment and interesting professional challenges possible, make the firm a delight to go to work for every day of the week.” \n“I truly appreciate the visible and intentional focus over the last 5 years on ‘social responsibility’ — from programs like Skills-to-Succeed, Junior Achievement, Pro-bono non-profit support all the way through to our (more recent and outward) position on achieving more diversity, better work/life balance, etc. This social responsibility, coupled with our desire and execution to do always do great work for our clients, is what makes Accenture a great company to work for.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 6. SAP America \nNumber of U.S. employees: 18379 Industry: Information Technology U.S. headquarters: Newtown Square, Pa. Major locations in Bay Area: Palo Alto, San Francisco Number of locations: 59 \nEmployees say: \n“I am extremely proud each time I see SAP participating in a Pride Parade or similar event. Also, the Autism at Work program and our work with refugees is to be commended. We don’t just say we want to help people’s lives run better. We DO IT!” \n“I believe what makes SAP unique is its commitment to develop their workforce. They have a myriad of tools and resources that I’ve never experienced in any company I’ve worked for. In addition, SAP is committed to giving back. A lot of companies say they do but SAP commits their money and people energy. I love the month of service in the fall but was especially happy to hear they’ve expanded the program outside of the single month of service. It makes me proud to work here.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 7. Zillow Group Courtesy of Shidume Lozada/Zillow Group \nNumber of U.S. employees: 2908 Industry: Information Technology Major locations in Bay Area: San Francisco Number of locations: 8 \nEmployees say: \n“Everyone is really open to collaboration, regardless of seniority or experience. Everyone’s ideas are taken into account and everyone is really focused on the same goal of creating the best product and experience for our customers and users.” \n“The executives’ transparency is unlike anything I’ve seen at other companies. We have much more access to ask them questions and get candid updates on what’s happening in the company versus anywhere else I’ve worked. Also, the responsiveness to our internal survey feedback is prompt; management takes our opinions very seriously and implements new programs to meet our demands for benefits and other desired improvements quite fast for an organization of this size. I also feel energized by our executives’ passion for the industry and our upcoming initiatives and their willingness to share progress with us at quarterly meetings. It makes me proud to work here and excited for the future.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 8. GoDaddy \nNumber of U.S. employees: 4851 Industry: Information Technology Major locations in Bay Area: Sunnyvale, San Francisco Number of locations: 19 \nEmployees say: \n“GoDaddy takes measures to ensure that everyone enjoys their role. They’re a realistic company that lets you have fun but also expects you to work hard. Employees are encouraged to bring new things to the table without being afraid to do so.” \n“The most striking thing is that the executives really make an effort to be approachable and are involved with every level of the company. Even the CEO and the top HR folks will eventually personally reply to almost every email anyone sends them. A lot of them also work in the same offices as everyone else, next to everyone else, and will often even eat lunch and chat with the rest of the office. Almost everyone has personally met the CEO at least once and he’s great fun to talk to. Joviality aside though, they are very easy to bring up concerns with and involved at every level of the company.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 9. Stryker \nNumber of U.S. employees: 16232 Industry: Manufacturing & Production Major locations in Bay Area: San Jose Number of locations: 188 \nEmployees say: \n“Our company focuses on quality and being ethical while ensuring that we deliver products that are innovative and contribute to improving of the quality of life for many around the world. It’s a company that you feel proud about what you are doing.” \n“ Stryker is, in my opinion, the most generous company that I ever hope to work for. The financial benefits are incredible, but more importantly the focus on employee wellbeing in general is unique. From tuition reimbursement to a tobacco cessation program, all aspects of wellbeing are supported through Stryker. It’s the little things that matter, and Stryker does a great job showing that it cares.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 10. Protiviti \nNumber of U.S. employees: 2411 Industry: Professional Services U.S. headquarters: Menlo Park, Calif. Major locations in Bay Area: Menlo Park, San Francisco Number of locations: 34 \nEmployees say: \n“I really appreciate the mentorship program, in which every person is paired with a network of advisors at different levels (peer, career, executive) allowing all employees to get valuable guidance and feedback.” \n“People at Protiviti are genuinely kind and considerate of everyone’s unique circumstances. Employees are encouraged to have a life outside of work, and management works hard to make that possible: whether that’s supporting employees’ other passions and interests through the sabbatical program; designing flexible work schedules for parents (or otherwise); or just through genuine compassion and support during individuals’ more challenging seasons.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 11. Nvidia \nNumber of U.S. employees: 5658 Industry: Information Technology U.S. headquarters: Santa Clara, Calif. Major locations in Bay Area: Santa Clara Number of locations: 15 \nEmployees say: \n“Work at Nvidia has huge amounts of interdisciplinary effort and cooperation built into it. This leads to employees picking up skills that they would not have elsewhere, and examining challenges from new angles, leading to new solutions.” \n“The culture at Nvidia is one which promotes authenticity. Employees here are made to feel comfortable bringing their true selves to work, regardless of demographic or personality difference. Additionally, as someone new in career I am so appreciative of and grateful for the abundance of opportunities I’ve been able to be a part of and the strong mentors I have. I’ve worked at Nvidia for slightly over a year and have grown immensely, both personally and professionally. It’s a fast paced, challenging, intellectually stimulating place to work, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 12. Intuit \nNumber of U.S. employees: 6389 Industry: Information Technology U.S. headquarters: Mountain View, Calif. Major locations in Bay Area: Mountain View Number of locations: 11 \nEmployees say: \n“The leadership and mentors I’ve had the privilege of working with are wonderful individuals that are truly invested in me as an individual and wanting to see me be successful. I’ve had the privilege of passing it forward to act as a mentor to others.” \n“The company culture is genuine and cultivated by all. There is a strong focus on the customer, a willingness to accept that trying and failing can lead to innovative breakthroughs, and feedback and personal development are almost required. I feel my contributions are recognized and I have the potential to make a difference in not just my role, but to our company’s performance on a bigger scale. Our key value is ‘integrity without compromise’—to me that is a clear directive that strikes to the heart of what we do, both in how we treat people, do our work, and serve our customers, and I have never ever felt any pressure to do otherwise.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 13. Acxiom Slaven Vlasic—Getty Images for AWXII \nNumber of U.S. employees: 2643 Industry: Information Technology Major locations in Bay Area: Redwood City, San Francisco Number of locations: 7 \nEmployees say: \n“It’s permitted for your reach to exceed your grasp. I am allowed to try my hand at things that are not within my zone of ease. Occasionally, I fail at performing the task but I’m helped to do it and then given a chance to try another tough thing.” \n“I was able to go from an entry level job to a technical product manager for one of our most complex product offerings in 1.5 years. We grow leaders rather than hiring them. We are also all very good friends outside of work, and hang out often, which fosters good working relationships. People have very diverse backgrounds and are exceptionally smart, which makes working fun, exciting, and rewarding. LiveRamp really values employees and offers them many perks.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 14. Perkins Coie \nNumber of U.S. employees: 2139 Industry: Professional Services Major locations in Bay Area: Palo Alto Number of locations: 16 \nEmployees say: \n“We’re committed to one another’s success and wellbeing. When I send a request for help, I receive multiple positive responses within minutes. I too respond quickly when others ask. It’s part of the culture to help while asking for nothing in return.” \n“Perkins has always offered me opportunities to professionally grow and expand my practice. We jokingly refer to this as the ‘pursue until apprehended’ rule. It reflects an appreciation of what I believe to be critical principle of good management, and that is, almost everyone can be successful if they are given the right opportunities to make contributions commensurate to their skillsets.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 15. Adobe Systems \nNumber of U.S. employees: 8673 Industry: Information Technology U.S. headquarters: San Jose, Calif.

The emphasis on diversity and concern for the environment are other reasons this is a great place to work.” \n“Adobe is an amazing place to work! From the wonderful office locations, amazingly passionate and intelligent co-workers, top of the line benefits and much more. Each day, I believe that I’m working on something that is important to our company and to our customers. We make amazing products and we are treated fairly, respectfully and generously by management.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 16. Nugget Market \nNumber of U.S. employees: 1907 Industry: Retail Major locations in Bay Area: Novato, Sonoma, Vacaville Number of locations: 19 \nEmployees say: \n“What makes Nugget so unique is the individual attention we receive. I have never worked somewhere, where I felt so important regardless of the position or title you hold the treat you as if there wouldn’t be a company without you.” \n“Honestly, I’m not sure how but we hire such an amazing team! I love everyone I work with. It isn’t like we’re forced to put a smile on someone’s or even our faces. Obviously everyone has their days but I wouldn’t change anything about the people around me. I’ve learned so much about myself and others just being here every day. I have a specific two year old guest who comes in just to see me make her balloon!” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 17. Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe Courtesy of Orrick Herrington Sutcliffe \nNumber of U.S. employees: 1535 Industry: Professional Services Major locations in Bay Area: San Francisco Number of locations: 12 \nEmployees say: \n“I find that I have the freedom to take initiative. For example, after a year of taking initiative to improve our recruiting efforts, I was promoted to hiring partner. Whenever I have made suggestions to improve the office, the firm has supported it.” \n“Orrick is remarkably egalitarian—particularly given that it’s a 150-year-old law firm—and I believe every member of the staff, lawyer or not, feels valued and appreciated for his or her contributions. It is also a place that has long embraced authenticity. I feel completely comfortable being myself here, and I’ve felt that since I started here 13 years ago. I believe most Orrickians feel that way.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 18.

Employees are often recognized for promotions, completing a project or contributing to the team on all-hands, team calls or in group emails.” \n“VMware creates of culture that encourages giving back. As a new hire, the first thing I received was a specific dollar amount I could donate to the charity of my choosing. After that, we were given the ability to fund a micro-loan of our choice. During our Club trips for high achievers, there is always a component of the trip that includes a project that gives back to the local community. VMware truly lives up to the values of which it promotes.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 20.

Management is involved and provides guidance but they prefer you come to them with a solution and will discuss options so that you can truly make an informed decision.” \n“New ideas get the attention of both the workforce and management, and are highly encouraged. The queue of concepts to work faster, better, smarter is always growing, and those with the most potential gain both management and financial support. This keeps our customers happy, our idea creators motivated and the collaborative workplace required to execute refreshing.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 21.

People are also very interested in helping each other succeed. It is common that when I ask someone for help, they are happy to drop whatever important work they are doing. I get the impression that they receive a lot of joy from helping me work through something I was having difficulty on my own. It feels like a deep-rooted cultural norm here at Dropbox. I’ve never experienced anything like it, but now that I have, I would hate to lose it.” \nRead Great Place to Work review here . 22.

If you need help, anyone and everyone is willing to help you if they are able. The bosses pitch in just as much work as the rest of the employees, even going so far as to assist various departments if they are being flooded with work unexpectedly.

We have events ranging from the office Olympics to margarita parties, etc. These events allow for lawyers and staff to mingle and participate together in ways that the normal work day would not allow.

While some days can be stressful, it’s nice to look up from your computer to see genuine smiles from co-workers.
