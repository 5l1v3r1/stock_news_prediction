The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to eliminate the effects of items management does not believe are representative of the Company’s ongoing performance. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash flow provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. These financial metrics are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to operating earnings (loss) or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not presented as and should not be considered as alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP.\nThese limitations include the fact that Adjusted EBITDA: (i) excludes certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to the Company; (ii) excludes certain adjustments for purchase accounting; (iii) does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs, capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (iv) does not reflect the Company’s significant interest expense; and (v) does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company’s debt. Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. In addition, other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or Free Cash Flow differently than it does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nIn calculating these financial measures, the Company makes certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove inaccurate. In addition, in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. The following table reconciles net earnings (loss) as reflected in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA (figures may not sum due to rounding):\nThirteen weeks ended Twenty-six weeks ended (in millions)\nJanuary 27,\n2018\nJanuary 28,\n2017\nJanuary 27,\n2018\nJanuary 28,\n2017\nNet earnings (loss) $ 372.5 $ (117.1 ) $ 346.3 $ (140.6 ) Income tax benefit (389.6 ) (77.5 ) (408.5 ) (100.8 ) Interest expense, net 76.5 74.2 152.6 146.3 Depreciation expense 53.4 57.2 108.7 114.1 Amortization of intangible assets and favorable lease commitments\n24.3\n26.3\n49.2 53.6 EBITDA $ 137.2 $ (36.8 ) $ 248.3 $ 72.6 Impairment charges - 153.8 - 153.8 Non-cash stock compensation and other long-term cash incentives\n3.7 (0.9 ) 10.1 0.5 Incremental non-cash rent expense related to purchase accounting adjustments\n2.1 2.5 4.4 5.0 Liquidation markdowns and expenses related to store closures\n12.2 1.5 13.5 1.5 Expenses related to Cyber-Attack, net of insurance recoveries\n- - 1.1 - Expenses incurred in connection with openings of new stores / remodels of existing stores\n1.5 3.0 2.3 5.7 Expenses incurred in connection with strategic initiatives\n1.4 1.9 1.8 8.5 MyTheresa acquisition costs - 1.3 - 0.7 Non-cash gain related to change in vacation policy (7.8 ) - (9.0 ) - Other expenses 4.6 0.5 4.6 1.3 Adjusted EBITDA\n$ 154.8 $ 126.8 $ 277.2 $ 249.7\nIn the twenty-six weeks ended January 27, 2018, the Company’s Free Cash Flow of $129.7 million reconciles to (i) net cash provided by operating activities of $195.5 million, less (ii) capital expenditures of $65.8 million, in each case as reflected in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180309005044/en/\nNeiman Marcus Group LTD LLC\nMark Anderson, 214-757-2934\nDirector – Finance and\nInvestor Relations\nSource: Neiman Marcus Group LTD LLC", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.neimanmarcusgroup.com&esheet=51770535&newsitemid=20180309005044&lan=en-US&anchor=www.neimanmarcusgroup.com&index=1&md5=1f723f65168bbdfd0f5cfb60b384f4e0", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180309005044/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.neimanmarcusgroup.com&esheet=51770535&newsitemid=20180309005044&lan=en-US&anchor=www.neimanmarcusgroup.com&index=2&md5=1a9e27c99fd8e4d4c606595cb9ccf525"], "published": "2018-03-09T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T20:25:21.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
