A Czech Justice Ministry spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment. \nA U.S. federal grand jury in California indicted the 29-year-old Nikulin last year on suspicion of hacking into the U.S.-based social media companies LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring in 2012. \nLinkedIn has said the case was related to a 2012 breach at the social networking company that it previously said may have compromised the credentials of 100 million users, prompting it to launch a massive password reset operation.

Reuters could not immediately reach his attorney on Friday. \nAfter Nikulinâ€™s arrest in Prague, Russia also asked for his extradition. A Moscow court issued a warrant for his arrest in November 2016 for the alleged theft of $3,450 via Webmoney in 2009, the Czech Justice Ministry said then. \nCzech courts have ruled extradition to both countries was permissible, and the decision was up to Pelikan. \nPrime Minister Andrej Babis has said he was in favor of extradition to the United States but Pelikan said President Milos Zeman, who often takes a pro-Russian stance, had urged extradition to Russia.
