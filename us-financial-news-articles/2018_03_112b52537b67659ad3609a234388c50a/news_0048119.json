Wednesday’s fall of 42.8 points left the benchmark at 5,789.5. \nAll three major U.S. stock indexes slumped on Tuesday, as concerns about regulation of social media and autonomous vehicles hit technology shares. \nIn Australia, financials and materials led the losses. \nThe materials index slid 1.4 percent, with BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto both losing 1 percent. \nAnglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto on Tuesday announced the sale of its remaining Australian coal asset to private equity manager EMR Capital and Indonesia’s Adaro Energy for $2.25 billion. \nFinancial stocks were also under pressure, slipping 0.8 percent, with the ‘Big Four’ banks edging down between 0.4 percent and 1.1 percent. \nThe biggest loser on the main index was graphite products supplier Syrah Resources Ltd, finishing nearly 9 percent down to its lowest close in two weeks. \nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 1.4 percent, or 120.04 points, to end at 8,388.08, pulled down by consumer staples and utilities. The percentage drop was the biggest for a day since Feb. 5. \nConsumer staples accounted for nearly half the losses, with dairy firm a2 Milk Company Ltd slumping 6.5 percent. \nSubscription television provider SKY Network Television Ltd was the biggest percentage loser on the benchmark as it plunged 7.9 percent after announcing that it may lose its Rugby World Cup broadcast bid. \nNew Zealand business sentiment deteriorated in March even as firms’ outlook for their own activity improved, an ANZ Bank survey showed on Wednesday.
