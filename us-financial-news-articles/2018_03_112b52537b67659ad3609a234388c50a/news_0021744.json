Parkwood Development Corp., which initiated the redevelopment project in 2012, will retain an ownership stake in the project. The Wonder Lofts building will be converted into 89 luxury residential units with over 10,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenity space and a to-be built retail space fronting Clinton Street.\nOriginally built in 1909 and used as an industrial facility that produced Wonder Bread, the Wonder Lofts will offer a reasonably priced alternative to those looking to live close to New York City. The project will be comprised of five separate buildings and will maintain a significant amount of the existing architecturally significant detail seen at the building today. The buildings will also have on-site parking.\n“As the Manhattan and Brooklyn markets have become less affordable over the past decade, Hoboken’s appeal as an alternative to these neighborhoods has significantly increased,” said Daniel Rudin, Director, Angelo, Gordon. “The Wonder Lofts are ideally situated in Hoboken, located near public transportation, and offer amenities and luxury details at prices rare to find elsewhere in the Greater New York Metropolitan area.”\n“This is an exciting development opportunity in a prime location near New York City,” said Eugene Diaz, Principal of Prism Partners. “We are pleased to be partnering with Angelo, Gordon on the Wonder Lofts project.”\nThe project has received the necessary approvals and nearly all demolition and construction preparation work has been completed. Prism Capital will also hold an ownership stake and be responsible for executing construction and completion of the project.\nAbout Angelo, Gordon & Co.\nAngelo, Gordon & Co., L.P. is a privately held limited partnership founded in November 1988.
