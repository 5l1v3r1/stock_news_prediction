The approach pre-dated May’s time as leader, and was made when former Prime Minister David Cameron was running the party. “The Conservative Party has never employed Cambridge Analytica, or its parent company, nor used their services,” a Conservative Party spokesman said when asked for further details. The suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on Tuesday that his UK-based political consultancy’s online campaign played a decisive role in U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory.
