REUTERS/Satish Kumar Officials from Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) displayed two cube-shaped vehicles built by U.S.-based Next Future Transportation company in Italy as they spun around on a main street in Dubai. Passersby stopped to try out the six-seat vehicles and question the Italian engineers overseeing the test. RTA officials said they have allocated 1.5 million dirhams ($410,000) for further research and development of the vehicles, which Dubai hopes to use for local transportation under the city’s 2030 Dubai Future Accelerators, which aims to make 25 percent of daily transportation self-driven. “The goal is to develop these two research vehicles,” Khaled al-Awadhi, director of Automated Collection Systems at the RTA, said.

He said several projects were being developed, including self-driving buses and a marine transportation system.

No date was provided for the start of either service. RTA officials said they hoped to have a more solid plan for the program by the end of 2018 or early 2019. The vehicles are powered by electricity and have a top speed of 80 kms (50 miles) per hour. Dubai last year unveiled plans for a“flying taxi”.
