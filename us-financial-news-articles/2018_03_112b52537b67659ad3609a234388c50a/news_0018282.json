(the \"Company\" or “La Quinta”) (NYSE:LQ) announced today that the Company has established a record date of March 19, 2018, and a meeting date of April 26, 2018, for a special meeting of its stockholders to, among other things, consider and vote on a proposal to approve the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Wyndham Worldwide”) and WHG BB Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Wyndham Worldwide, pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Wyndham Worldwide has agreed to acquire La Quinta’s franchising and management business (the “Merger”). As previously announced, La Quinta has agreed that it will effect, prior to the consummation of the Merger and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and related agreements, a separation of La Quinta’s real estate assets and certain related assets and liabilities, which will be conveyed to CorePoint Lodging Inc. (“CorePoint”), a newly formed subsidiary of La Quinta, followed by a pro rata distribution to La Quinta stockholders of common stock representing 100% of the interest in CorePoint (the “Spin-Off”). After the Spin-Off is completed, CorePoint will be a separate, publicly held company that will own La Quinta’s real estate assets and certain related assets and liabilities.\nLa Quinta’s stockholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2018, will be entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Additional information concerning the proposed Merger and the special meeting will be included in the definitive proxy statement that will be mailed to La Quinta’s stockholders of record as of such date.\nLa Quinta also announced today that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), in connection with the Merger, has expired. Expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act satisfies one of the conditions to the closing of the Merger. La Quinta continues to expect the Merger and the Spin-Off to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to approval by La Quinta’s stockholders and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe foregoing contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws relating to forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements relating to the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed merger, separation and spin-off, as well as other statements representing management’s beliefs about, future events, transactions, strategies, operations and financial results, including, without limitation, our expectations with respect to the costs and other anticipated financial impacts of the spin-off and merger; future financial and operating results of CorePoint Lodging Inc.
