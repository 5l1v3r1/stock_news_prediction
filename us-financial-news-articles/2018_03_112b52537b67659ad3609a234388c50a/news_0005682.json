(NASDAQ:HABT) (“The Habit” or the “Company”), today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 26, 2017.\nHighlights for the fourth quarter ended December 26, 2017 include:\nTotal revenue increased 15.2% to $85.1 million compared to $73.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCompany-operated comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.0% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet loss of $6.2 million, or $(0.30) per diluted weighted average share, which included $6.1 million of net expense relating to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, compared to net income of $1.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted weighted average share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net loss (1) was $44,000, or $(0.00) per fully distributed weighted average share compared with adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income of $1.8 million, or $0.07 per fully distributed weighted average share for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) was $7.3 million compared to $8.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company opened 13 new company-operated restaurants and one franchised restaurant during the fourth quarter. As of December 26, 2017, the Company had 193 company-operated locations and 16 franchised/licensed locations (excluding seven licensed locations in Santa Barbara County, California from which the Company is not entitled to royalties) for a system-wide total of 209 locations.\n(1) Adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to each of these measures is included in the accompanying financial data. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” included herein.\n“We believe we made progress solidifying our business in 2017 and remain confident in the strength of the Habit brand and our strategy of providing a differentiated, high-quality fast casual experience at a tremendous everyday value,” said Russ Bendel, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Habit Restaurants, Inc. “We have a number of exciting and relevant initiatives that we’re working on to naturally evolve our brand, focused on quality/value, convenience and innovation. We believe our initiatives can enhance the Habit experience not only in 2018, but for many years to come.”\n“During the quarter, we opened 13 new company-operated Habit Burger Grills, of which four were drive-thrus, and one franchised restaurant in Shanghai, China. In 2018 we plan to open approximately 30 new Company-operated locations, including approximately 15 drive thru locations, while franchisees expect to open six to eight locations during the year.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nTotal revenue was $85.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $73.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCompany-operated comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.0% for the quarter ended December 26, 2017. The decrease in company-operated comparable restaurant sales was driven primarily by a 3.0% decrease in transactions partially offset by a 2.0% increase in average transaction amount.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.2 million, or $(0.30) per diluted weighted average share, which included $6.1 million of net expense relating to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, compared to net income of $1.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted weighted average share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted into law. This new legislation provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, among other provisions. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company recognized other income of $57.9 million related to the reduction in liabilities under its tax receivable agreement (“TRA”). The Company also recognized an additional $64.0 million of income tax expense as related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $44,000, or $(0.00) per fully distributed weighted average share, compared to adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income of $1.8 million, or $0.07 per fully distributed weighted average share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. A reconciliation between GAAP net income (loss) and adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income (loss) is included in the accompanying financial data.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nTotal revenue was $331.7 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to $283.8 million in fiscal year 2016.\nCompany-operated comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.1% for the year ended December 26, 2017. The decrease in company-operated comparable restaurant sales was driven primarily by a 1.1% decrease in transactions partially offset by a 1.0% increase in average transaction amount.\nNet loss for fiscal year 2017 was $2.8 million, or $(0.14) per diluted weighted average share, which included $6.1 million of net expense relating to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, compared to net income of $4.7 million, or $0.27 per diluted weighted average share in fiscal year 2016.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net income in fiscal year 2017 was $4.2 million, or $0.16 per fully distributed weighted average share, compared to $8.0 million, or $0.31 per fully distributed weighted average share, in fiscal year 2016. A reconciliation between GAAP net income (loss) and adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income (loss) is included in the accompanying financial data.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company currently anticipates the following for its fiscal year 2018:\nTotal revenue between $389 million to $393 million; Company-operated comparable restaurant sales of flat to slightly positive for the year; The opening of approximately 30 company-operated restaurants and six to eight franchised/licensed restaurants; Restaurant contribution margin of 16.0% to 17.0%; General and administrative expenses of $37.5 million to $38.0 million; Depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $24.0 million; Capital expenditures of $43.0 million to $46.0 million; and An effective pro forma tax rate of approximately 29.0% to 30.0%, which assumes the conversion of all common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC for shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock), which would eliminate the non-controlling interests.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 today at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. Russ Bendel, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ira Fils, Chief Financial Officer will host the call.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing (855) 327-6837 or for international callers by dialing (778) 327-3988. A replay will be available after the call and can be accessed by dialing (844) 512-2921 or for international callers by dialing (412) 317-6671; the passcode is 10004264. The replay will be available until Wednesday, March 7, 2018. The conference call will also be webcast live from the Company’s corporate website at ir.habitburger.com under the “Events” page. An archive of the webcast will be available at the same location on the corporate website shortly after the call has concluded.\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used in this release:\nComparable restaurant sales reflect the change in year-over-year sales in our comparable restaurant base. A restaurant enters our comparable restaurant base in the accounting period following its 18th full period of operations. We operate on a 4-4-5 calendar, each accounting period will consist of either four or five weeks with the exception of a 53-week year, where the last period contains six weeks.\nAverage Unit Volumes (AUVs) are calculated by dividing revenue for the trailing 52-week period for all company-operated restaurants that have operated for 12 full accounting periods by the total number of restaurants open for such period.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net income includes net income attributable to The Habit (i) excluding income tax expense, (ii) excluding the effect of non-recurring items, (iii) assuming the exchange of all common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC into shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock), which results in the elimination of non-controlling interests in The Habit Restaurants, LLC, and (iv) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on fully distributed pro forma net income before income taxes at our estimated long term effective income tax rate. Adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income is a non-GAAP financial measure because it represents net income attributable to The Habit, before non-recurring items and the effects of non-controlling interests in The Habit Restaurants, LLC. We use adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone and eliminates the variability of non-controlling interests as a result of member owner exchanges of common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC into shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock).\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net income per fully distributed weighted average share is calculated using adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income as defined above and assumes the exchange of all common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC into shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock).\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, represents net income before interest expense, net, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, represents EBITDA plus pre-opening costs, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of assets, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, and exchange related expenses.\nAbout The Habit Restaurants, Inc.\nThe Habit Burger Grill is a burger-centric, fast casual restaurant concept that specializes in preparing fresh, made-to-order chargrilled burgers and sandwiches featuring USDA choice tri-tip steak, grilled chicken and sushi-grade tuna cooked over an open flame.
