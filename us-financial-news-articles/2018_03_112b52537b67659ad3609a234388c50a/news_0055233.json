The loss compared with a 206 million ringgit profit a year ago.\nSapura said in its filing that the impairment would enable the group to operate at a lower cost base going forward, and the company continued to optimise costs, including impairing assets.\n“The industry has seen a gradual recovery from the low levels of activity experienced in the last three years as reflected in the higher crude oil prices,” it said.\n“The group remains focused on maintaining strong operational performance and replenishing the order book by strengthening its position in existing markets and embedding ourselves into new ones to enlarge the bid opportunities.”\nSapura Energy’s shares were down 1.8 percent on Wednesday afternoon, underperforming a 0.2 percent decline in the benchmark index.
