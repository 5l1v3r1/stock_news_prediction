If confirmed in an official estimate due on March 26, it would be the first time in a decade that France has stayed within the EU limit of 3.0 percent.\nThe government introduced a new exceptional charge last year on big companies to help offset the impact of the tax reimbursement.\nReporting by Leigh Thomas and Myriam Rivet; Editing by Richard Lough and Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T20:09:38.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
