Pope Francis blesses faithful gathered to attend the Palm Sunday Mass in Saint Peter’s Square at the Vatican, March 25, 2018 REUTERS/Tony Gentile \nFrancis spoke a day after hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters answered a call to action from survivors of last month’s Florida high school massacre and rallied across the United States to demand tighter gun laws. He did not mention the demonstrations. \nThe 81-year-old Roman Catholic leader led a long and solemn Palm Sunday service before tens of thousands in St. Peter’s Square, many of them young people there for the Catholic Church’s World Day of Youth. \nCarrying a woven palm branch known as a “palmurello,” Francis led a procession in front of the largest church in Christendom to commemorate the day the Bible says Jesus rode into Jerusalem and was hailed as a savior, only to be crucified five days later. \nDrawing on biblical parallels, Francis urged the young people in the crowd not to let themselves be manipulated. \n“The temptation to silence young people has always existed,” Francis said in the homily of a Mass. \n“There are many ways to silence young people and make them invisible. Many ways to anesthetize them, to make them keep quiet, ask nothing, question nothing. There are many ways to sedate them, to keep them from getting involved, to make their dreams flat and dreary, petty and plaintive,” he said.

Even if others keep quiet, if we older people and leaders, some corrupt, keep quiet, if the whole world keeps quiet and loses its joy, I ask you: Will you cry out?” \nThe young people in the crowd shouted, “Yes!” \nWhile Francis did not mention Saturday’s marches in the United States, he has often condemned weapons manufacturing and mass shootings. \nPalm Sunday marked the start of a hectic week of activities for the pope. \nOn Holy Thursday he is due to preside at two services, including one in which he will wash the feet of 12 inmates in a Rome jail to commemorate Jesus’ gesture of humility toward his apostles the night before he died. \nOn Good Friday, he is due to lead a Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession at Rome’s Colosseum. On Saturday night he leads a Easter vigil service and on Easter Sunday he delivers his twice-yearly “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message.
