Security Council resolutions, with shrill, bellicose rhetoric coming from both Kim Jong Un and Trump.\nNorth Korea has boasted of its plans to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the mainland United States. But fears of all-out war eased last month, coinciding with North Korea’s participation in the Winter Olympics in the South.\n“From looking at the news or Twitter, I believe President Trump is positive about the results of the North Korea visit (by South Korean officials),” Moon told political party leaders.\n“However, as this is just the beginning, I believe we are not at a situation yet where we can be optimistic.”\nMoon added he had no plans for an easing of sanctions.\n“Just because there are talks ongoing between North and South Korea doesn’t mean international sanctions can be eased,” said Moon. “There cannot be an arbitrary easing of sanctions; we do not wish to do that and I tell you now it is impossible.”\nSouth Korea’s goal was the denuclearisation of North Korea, nothing less, said Moon in comments distributed by the Blue House.\n“We cannot have things like the prevention of nuclear proliferation or a moratorium as a final goal,” said Moon.\nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North defends its weapons programmes as necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The South hosts 28,500 U.S. troops, a legacy of the war.\nNorth and South next month will have the first meeting between their leaders since 2007 at the border village of Panmunjom, Chung Eui-yong, head of the South Korean delegation, said on Tuesday.\nLeaders around the world have also met the apparent breakthrough with guarded optimism, wary of repeating past negotiations that failed to prevent Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in delivers a speech during a ceremony celebrating the 99th anniversary of the March First Independence Movement against Japanese colonial rule, at Seodaemun Prison History Hall in Seoul, South Korea, March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji On-again off-again “six-party” talks, grouping the two Koreas, Japan, Russia and the United States and hosted by China, ended in failure in 2009, with North Korea criticising U.S. aggression.\nSouth Korean officials who met the North Korean leader will leave for Washington on Thursday. Chung said he had a verbal message from Kim Jong Un that he will relay to U.S. officials but it was unclear whether he would meet Trump.\nAfter returning from the United States, Chung will visit China and Russia, while Suh Hoon, the head of South Korea’s intelligence agency, will head to Japan to brief officials.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “COME A LONG WAY” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office the United States had “come a long way, at least rhetorically” with North Korea and “statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive”.\nAsked if he had any preconditions for talks, Trump said: “I don’t want to talk about it. We’re going to see what happens.”\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence said the United States would continue to apply “maximum pressure” on North Korea and that all options were “on the table” until Washington sees evidence Pyongyang is taking steps towards denuclearisation.\nKeeping up the pressure, the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it had determined Pyongyang used the chemical warfare agent VX to assassinate Kim Jong Un’s half-brother in Malaysia in 2017 and had imposed sanctions in response.\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said any sanctions imposed unilaterally and not under the auspices of the United Nations were illegitimate.\nRelated Coverage Analysis: As talks with North near, S.Korea sees familiar hurdles ahead Two women, an Indonesian and a Vietnamese, have been charged in Malaysia with murdering Kim by smearing his face with VX, though they say they were unwitting pawns. Four North Korean fugitives have also been charged with the murder.\nChinese state-run tabloid the Global Times published an editorial saying the Korean nuclear issue cannot be solved without China, Russia and the U.N. Security Council.\n“The reality is that North Korea now has an intercontinental ballistic missile that can allegedly hit targets in the U.S.,” the paper wrote. “No one can intimidate anyone. Negotiation is the only way out.”\nMarkets reacted positively to the prospect of talks and a lowering in geopolitical tensions.\nShares in South Korean companies with exposure to North Korea rallied on signs of a thaw in relations, while companies in the defence market saw their shares dip.\nReporting by Christine Kim and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by David Alexander, Lisa Lambert, Linda Sieg, Ben Blanchard, Kaori Kaneko, Hyonhee Shin and Maria Kiselyova; Writing by Josh Smith; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T08:14:00.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
