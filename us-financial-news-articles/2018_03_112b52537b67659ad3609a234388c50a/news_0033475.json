The invitation includes the caption, “Let’s take a field trip” and invites attendees to the Lane Tech College Prop High School on Chicago’s north side. Apple said that the event will focus on “new creative ideas for teachers and students.” \nRumors have been swirling that Apple was planning a March event . However, those rumors suggested the company’s event would be held at its Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino. The rumors also said that Apple would unveil new iPads at the show and perhaps a new iPhone SE for budget-conscious shoppers. \nAlthough Apple has hinted that its March 27 show will focus on students, it might have broader appeal. New tablets, for instance, could benefit students and teachers as much as consumers. And considering the Apple invite featuring the company’s logo appears to have been drawn digitally with a stylus, it’s possible the tech giant could also unveil a new version of its Apple Pencil stylus for digitally writing on iPads. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nIt’s no surprise Apple is focusing on the education sector. Google’s Chromebooks are already among the most popular computing options among students and Microsoft has recently focused more of its time on challenging Google and getting more Windows 10-based machines into schools. Apple could be eyeing the same market conditions and deciding how it can improve its standing in the space. \nApple’s announcement comes just days after the company said that its Worldwide Developers Conference event for developers will kick off on June 4. Apple will also hold a keynote address that day, when it’s expected to announce new products and software updates.
