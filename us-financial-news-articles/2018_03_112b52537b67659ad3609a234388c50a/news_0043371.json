It's a 5,000-square-mile area off of New England.\nMarine national monuments are underwater areas designed to protect unique or vulnerable ecosystems.\nThe lawsuit was put on hold by a review of national monuments ordered by the Trump administration. But court filings at U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia say the stay was lifted in mid-March and the litigation can proceed.\nThe court ordered the federal government to respond to the lawsuit by April 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T21:39:07.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
