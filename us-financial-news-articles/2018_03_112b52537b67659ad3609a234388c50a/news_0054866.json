(OTCQB: GOPH) (\"Gopher\"), a development-stage company which specializes in the creation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence enabled mobile technologies, announced the closing of the sale of common stock and common stock purchase warrants, which generated $500,000 in proceeds. The details on the funding can be found in the Company’s Form 8-K/A filed March 23, 2018 - https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/sec-filings/12640521/content/html .\nThe financing is continuation of the Company’s strategy to reduce its dependence on variable priced convertible note financing and create a balance sheet that gives investors clarity regarding the number of shares outstanding and potential dilution. The investor that participated in this financing previously loaned the Company capital in consideration of convertible notes. This financing included an equity raise generating in total to date gross proceeds of $1.5 million as well as the conversion of previously issues convertible notes into common stock.\nGreg Bauer, CEO of Gopher, said, “Since the acquisition of the UGO assets and successful closing of an equity financing in December 2017, including our latest acquisition of ECS Assets, Gopher’s Board of Directors believe it is well positioned to eventually seek to list on a National Exchange. To assist in the process, Gopher engaged Donohoe Advisory Associates LLC to advise and assist in the up-listing effort. There is no guarantee that these efforts will be successful or that Donohoe Advisory will recommend to Gopher to pursue any particular avenue for exchange listing.” Mr. Bauer summarizes, “We are moving at a significant pace as we continue to develop our sales channels through acquisitions as well as advance our products which include GPS tracking, drones, a MESH network technology for use in autonomous driving tracking, Artificial intelligence and IoT. We anticipate Gopher’s technology can be implemented in everyday life and we envision unlimited applications for our core technology. While accelerating our growth through strategic partnerships and acquisitions, we believe it makes sense for our shareholders to explore uplisting, which in turn may provide additional access to capital.”\nAbout Donohoe Advisory\nDonohoe Advisory – www.donohoeadvisory.com Donohoe Advisory Associates LLC help companies go public, get listed, stay listed and structure financing and acquisition transactions.
