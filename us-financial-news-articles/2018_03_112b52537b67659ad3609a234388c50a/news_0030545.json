It also taught me a lot about what it means to face challenges, battle back, and overcome them.

And, to the fans, thank you for cheering me on throughout my career.” The German won 15 titles on the ATP Tour, the last two coming in 2013 when he triumphed in Munich and Vienna. He reached a career-high ranking of number two in 2002 and made a total of 28 final appearances. Haas, who turned professional in 1996, reached the Australian Open semi-finals three times — in 1999, 2002 and 2007 — as well as the last-four at Wimbledon in 2009. A tough fighter who always bounced back from injury adversity, Haas underwent a total of nine surgeries in his career and won ATP Comeback Player of the Year awards in 2004 and 2012. Haas, who won the silver medal for Germany at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, finishes his career with 569 wins — the last of which was a memorable victory over Federer at Stuttgart last year.
