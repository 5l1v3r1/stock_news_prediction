We add it to batter or chili, maybe, and that’s about it. But a budding love affair with sour beers—U.S. sales jumped nearly 20% in 2016—could change that. “These are not big, hoppy IPAs,” said Washington, D.C., chef Peter Smith, who mines the world-class Belgian beer list at his restaurant, the Sovereign, for many of his dishes. “They’re more comparable to wine or even Champagne.”\nWays to Use It\nSteam mussels Sauté garlic and onions in a large pan over medium heat. Add 2 pounds cleaned mussels and cook 2 minutes. Add ½ cup sour beer, cover, and cook until mussels pop. (Discard any mussels that do not open.) Make sorbet Let 24 ounces Kriek beer get slightly flat. Dissolve 1/2 cup sugar in beer. Churn in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer’s instructions. Braise meat Use sour beer in place of red wine in your favorite recipe for pot roast or coq au vin. Traditionally made in Belgium and Germany, sour beers come in a variety of styles: aged and blended gueuzes, cherry-steeped krieks, raspberry framboises and citrus-scented, wheat-based Berliner weisses. Each has a distinct character and history, but they all share a refreshing sour funk. That flavor comes from two sources. Wild yeast collected from the skin of fruit—commonly Brettanomyces or “Brett,” as the beer geeks like to call it—brings on the funk, along with spicy and fruity notes, when used to ferment beer. And helpful bacteria such as Lactobacillius and Pediococcus convert sugar in the brew to acids that lend a tart edge.\nEuropeans learned centuries ago that a good sour beer can be a boon to cooking. The classic Flemish beef stew carbonnade flamande draws body and rich flavor from the ale it braises in, and there’s probably not a seafood joint in the Low Countries that doesn’t serve mussels braised in fruity lambic. At Sovereign, Mr. Smith has concentrated the flavors of rare sours in a gelée to pair with pâté, and he’s churned ice cream with apricot sour ale. At left, a few ways you can use these bracing brews in your own kitchen.\nWhere to buy There’s no need to purchase a pricey sour beer for cooking. But do choose a solid one with no sugar added, such as Oud Beersel’s Gueuze (aged lambic) or Kriek (cherry-steeped lambic), or Gueuzerie Tiquin’s Oude Gueuze Tilquin à l’Ancienne, all frequently available at Whole Foods (prices vary depending on location). Or ask for recommendations at your local bottle shop.\n Spicy Red Sauce That Goes With Everything March 14, 2018 How to Stop Worrying and Love Hosting Dinner Parties March 9, 2018 How To Do ‘Good Fat’ Better February 28, 2018 The Elusive American Black Truffle February 10, 2018 Hey, Dark-Chocolate Snobs: Milk Chocolate Could Be Making You Happier February 8, 2018", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T18:09:03.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
