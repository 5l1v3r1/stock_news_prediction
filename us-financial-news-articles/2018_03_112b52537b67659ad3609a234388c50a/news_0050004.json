Among the victims there were Beltrame and butcher Christian Medves.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday led a national tribute to Beltrame, who swapped places with a woman Lakdim had been holding hostage. A ceremony for the three civilians killed was held on Thursday morning.\nLakdim was shot dead by police.\n$1 = 0.8130 euros Reporting By Brian Love and Emmanuel Jarry; Editing by Richard Lough and Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T12:58:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
