Hagerty \nPeter Munk escaped Nazi-occupied Hungary to become a freewheeling international entrepreneur and founder of Barrick Gold Corp. \nAside from building Barrick ABX, -1.35% through takeovers into the world’s largest gold miner, he helped create a maker of stylish stereo equipment, made abortive efforts to enter the auto-manufacturing business, developed hotels in the South Pacific and built a marina for giant yachts in Montenegro. \nMunk died Wednesday in Toronto, Barrick said. He was 90. He was born in Budapest Nov. 8, 1927, into an affluent Jewish family whose fortune derived from real estate and distribution of Viennese chocolates. In 1944, when the Nazis invaded Hungary, he escaped to Switzerland on a train that would prove one of the last routes out of the country for Jews. \nMunk arrived in Canada with a single suitcase and supported himself as a student in Toronto partly by selling Christmas trees. Munk’s guiding principle was that the “only thing in life that is constant is change,” and that helped him adapt and move into new businesses, business partner David Gilmour said in a 2012 interview. \nIn 1983, Munk and Gilmour formed Barrick, listed its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange and bought a half interest in an Ontario mine. Riding a boom in the price of gold, the company quickly gobbled up mines. By 2006, Barrick owned 27 mines worldwide. In 2011, Barrick paid $7.65 billion for copper miner Equinox Minerals Ltd. just as copper prices started to slide. He clung to his role as chairman as the company sold assets and slimmed down. But gold prices continued to fall and in 2014 he stepped down from Barrick’s board at age 86.
