( NYSE: CSRA ), a leading provider of next-generation IT solutions and professional services to government organizations, for $44.00 per share in cash and stock.\nGROWTH FOCUSED\nThis transaction is about growth and represents a transformation of two companies that will reshape the entire government solutions and services industry. Combining the long- term customer relationships and unique capabilities of both companies, our vision is to create a new kind of company, with the depth and breadth of capabilities required to meet the evolving requirements of any customer, current or in the future. In light of recent increased government spending in many of our markets, the combination of CACI and CSRA would allow CACI’s and CSRA’s shareholders to participate in the long-term value creation of the combined company.\nThe detailed, factual and material terms of our proposal include the following:\nCACI’s proposal anticipates leverage of 4.8x gross debt to EBITDA based on pro forma debt at closing and trailing twelve months’ EBITDA excluding non-cash stock compensation and including net run-rate synergies of $165M. We anticipate a reduction to 4.0x within 24 months after closing. CACI’s net synergies target of $165M is based on readily identifiable opportunities and consistent with synergies achieved in precedent transactions. The net synergies number is based on a gross savings target of approximately $270M, of which approximately 40% will be passed to our customers through cost-plus contracts. The net synergies target is equal to approximately 1.7% of combined revenue, which is consistent with the net synergies achieved in CACI’s acquisition of L-3 NSS, as well as the synergies reported by Leidos in its acquisition of Lockheed IS&GS, and by the parties in the combination of CSCGS and SRA. CACI’s proposal is expected to be neutral to our fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS), and accretive in our fiscal year 2020. Non-GAAP EPS adds back the amortization of deal-related intangibles and financing fees, adds back the one-time costs to achieve synergies, and removes non-cash pension income. On an adjusted EPS basis (adding back certain non-cash expenses including depreciation and intangible amortization), the transaction will be meaningfully accretive in the fiscal year post close and thereafter. CACI’s proposal is structured to provide CSRA shareholders with immediate upside from equity participation in the substantial value creation of the combined entity, while still delivering superior economic value than the GD proposal at a CACI share price of $140 or higher. CACI’s proposal of $44.00 per share factors in the break-up fee of $204M. This is included within the CSRA debt to be assumed by CACI at closing and in our pro forma leverage and adjusted non-GAAP EPS calculations noted above, as well as in our analysis supporting the conclusion that our proposal offers superior value. This acquisition will further strengthen our already robust position for future growth as announced in a separate press release yesterday regarding guidance. In that release we continued to provide enhanced shareholder value by raising our net income and diluted earnings per share guidance, as well as the lower end of our annual revenue guidance for Fiscal Year 2018. We are confident that this is a superior proposal and look forward to negotiating any of the specific points of our proposal to help CSRA and their Board determine likewise.\nCACI’s proposal letter delivered to CSRA on March 16, 2018, is an attachment to CACI’s Form 8-K filed today.\nVALUE CREATION\nWith the strongest free cash flow in comparison to any of our competitors, this benefit will enable us to invest in our business and pursue the highest value opportunities for all our stakeholders. Our investors will experience value creation and the accelerated growth we expect from combining two market-leading companies with minimal contract overlap and whom possess highly differentiated offerings. Our customers will benefit from a broader set of offerings and the ability to transform their operations with end-to-end, mission-to-enterprise solutions. In addition, our customers will benefit from the substantial savings to be generated as part of the combination which will be passed back in the form of profits and lower costs on our contracts.\nOPERATIONS\nOperationally, we expect to experience substantial diversity across our customer set including an improved footprint in the Department of Defense, especially in areas of electronic warfare, cloud-based solutions, data analytics, machine learning, cyber and readiness and training. Further, we expect greater margin contribution as ~ 60% of our contract base will be firm fixed price and time and material structures. Finally, our combined ~$29 billion total backlog position with combined total awards over the last twelve months of ~$14 billion and a pipeline of over $19 billion provides a significant foundation for future growth buoyed by important customer past performance.\nINTEGRATION\nWe have a long history of creating long term shareholder value through acquisitions and an extensive track record of integrating value-creating acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner. Our plan is in place to fully integrate the organization and all corporate enterprise systems within 90 days of closing which is integral to achieving the cost synergies we propose. This allows us to focus externally on continued performance, growth, and the benefits we will derive together rather than working through the internal actions typically found in long integration timelines.\nAbout CACI\nCACI provides information solutions and services in support of national security missions and government transformation for Intelligence, Defense, and Federal Civilian customers.
