(NASDAQ:TYME) (“Tyme” or the “Company”) announced today that, on March 6, 2018, it closed its underwritten public offering of 9,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, as well as the full underwriter option to purchase 1,350,000 additional shares, at a public offering price of $2.25 per share. The gross proceeds, including the exercise of the option to purchase additional shares, were approximately $23 million, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company. ‌\nTyme intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for research and further development of its lead clinical program, SM-88, and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and general and administrative expenses.\n“This transaction represents a significant milestone for Tyme and will allow us to accelerate SM-88’s clinical development.” said Steve Hoffman, Chief Executive Officer of Tyme. “We expect that this capital will support the Company’s operations into the fourth quarter of 2019, beyond several expected clinical and preclinical SM-88 data readouts over the next 12 months. Specifically, we intend to utilize this new capital to conduct additional animal model testing in order to further validate our technology platform, expand our team with additional drug development experts, complete the SM-88 Phase II prostate study and release interim results from the planned Phase II trial for SM-88 in pancreatic cancer.”\nEvercore Group L.L.C. and Stifel served as joint book-running managers and as representatives of the underwriters for the offering. Canaccord Genuity Inc. also acted as bookrunner. H.C.

Unlike targeted therapies that attempt to regulate specific mutations within cancer, the Company’s therapeutic approach is designed to take advantage of a cancer cell’s innate metabolic weaknesses to compromise its defenses, leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. The Company’s lead clinical program, SM-88, is a novel combination therapy currently in Phase II development for prostate cancer, and the Company is preparing to initiate an additional Phase II clinical trial in pancreatic cancer.\nForward-Looking Statements/Disclosure Notice\nIn addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
