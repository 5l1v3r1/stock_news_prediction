We just don't believe it is in Amazon's best interest to do that, nor do we believe it is consistent with Amazon's operating philosophy and stated strategy.\"\nUPS' stock has a 3.4 percent dividend yield, according to FactSet. The company's stock is up 3 percent Tuesday.\nRoss lowered his price target for UPS shares to $121 from $127, representing 14 percent upside from Monday's close.\nThe analyst said the company will likely avoid a strike as negotiations with its unionized employees continue into the current contract's expiration on July 31. He predicts an agreement will be completed before the deadline similar to the last three deals.\n\"We believe the package and general freight markets remain strong, and the stock has sold off to a valuation that we believe reasonable considering the risks ahead and the increased capital investments expected over the next several years,\" he wrote.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T14:59:16.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
