REUTERS/David W Cerny/File Photo Environmentalists have long complained about high levels of pollution caused by the plant in the central Bosnian town of Zenica, which has a workforce of 2,200 people and is Bosnia’s top exporter.\nWork will start in coming days on what will be the biggest overhaul at the plant since 1989 and should extend the lifespan of the plant for another 15 to 20 years, Dijana Bozic-Srdanovic, the plant’s spokeswoman, said.\nThe work should be completed by the end of June, she said.\nThe steelmaker was installing three filters at the facility which are designed to capture 95 percent of harmful gases and reduce dust emissions to less then 10 milligrams per normal cubic meter, said Bozic-Srdanovic.\nArcelorMittal produced 756,000 tonnes of liquid steel in 2017.\nReporting by Maja Zuvela; Editing by Daria Sito-Sucic and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-23T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:23:27.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
