Monday's session was the stock's fifth-best ever, behind two sessions in 2016, one session in 2017 and the day of its initial public offering in November 2015.\n\nIn a weekend report, Ari Wald, Oppenheimer head of technical analysis, wrote in a note to clients that Square — along with the broader technology sector — is technically positioned to post further gains. Here are his reasons.\n\n• The S&P technology sector is breaking to the upside relative to the broader index, and its strength has been broad-based across both market capitalizations and sub-industries. Its resilience against rising interest rates, too, has been notable.\n\n• Square, which Oppenheimer fundamental analysts rate a \"buy,\" exhibits a bullish technical trend.\n\n• The stock just broke above its November 2017 high at $50 per share, closing Monday at $50.42, an all-time high.\n\n• Given the bullish trend exhibited so far this year, with a 45 percent rally year to date, an upside breakout is likely to emerge.\n\nBottom line: Square shares have surged triple-digits in the last year, and one top technical analyst sees further upside ahead. \nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
