This serves as a warning to all public relations firm or consultant.”\nBut some legal experts raised concerns over Chan’s judgment.\n“He committed a very fundamental and grave error in not allowing Donald Tsang the chance to explain, before he came to a rather serious and negative conclusion,” said Eric Cheung, a law academic at the University of Hong Kong.\nHe also said it would be the prosecution, not the defense, which gets to choose the trial venue.\nFormer Justice Secretary Wong Yan-lung also said in a statement on Wednesday the judgment contained factual inaccuracies because nobody had arranged his court appearance. The decision had been his alone to show support for Tsang.\nTsang was sentenced in February 2017 after a jury found him guilty of a charge of misconduct in public office.\nHe had deliberately concealed private rental negotiations with a property tycoon while his cabinet approved a broadcasting license for a now defunct radio company that the tycoon partly owned.\nReporting by Venus Wu; Editing by James Pomfret\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:27:51.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
