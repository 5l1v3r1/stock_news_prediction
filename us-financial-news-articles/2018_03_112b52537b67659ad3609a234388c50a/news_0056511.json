Rentsendorj \nAfter the reported rape earlier this month in Dornogobi province in Mongolia’s southeast, a group of concerned mothers created a Facebook group announcing the Saturday protest last week, and it quickly reached more than 400,000 members. \n“We want to show child abusers that we are strong in order to protect our children,” said Davaa Baatar, 41, the father of three children who was attending the protest. \nThe protesters held placards with messages such as “Stop child abuse”, “No child rape” and “Our children, our future”. \nThe protest organizers are demanding stricter laws regarding child abuse, better government services for survivors and more public awareness.

Experts believe this is a small proportion of actual incidents of child sexual abuse due to a pervasive cultural stigma over the topic. \n“The fear of being blamed and shamed means victims and their families keep quiet and don’t report to the police,” Ganbayasgakh Geleg, a founder of the Gender Equality Centre which fights human trafficking and sexual violence, told Reuters. \nMongolia, a thinly populated and mineral-rich country of just three million people sandwiched between Russia and China, transitioned to a parliamentary democracy in 1990 having previously been a satellite of the Soviet Union. \nBut there has been continued public frustration about the economy, corruption and air pollution, among other issues. \nLast year, a slump in foreign investment and declining commodity prices forced Mongolia to agree to a $5.5 billion bailout led by the International Monetary Fund to relieve fiscal strains and try to restore investor confidence.
