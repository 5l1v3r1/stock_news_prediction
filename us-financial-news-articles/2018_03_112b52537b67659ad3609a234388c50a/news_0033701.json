(Reuters) - President Donald Trump promised to bring down prescription drug prices on Monday, saying U.S. citizens pay far more than people in other countries do for the same product. U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive aboard Air Force One at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in Manchester, New Hampshire, U.S. March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst “If you compare our drug prices to other countries in the world, in some cases it’s many times higher for the exact same pill or whatever it is, in the exact same package made in the exact same plant,” Trump said. “We’re going to change that.” During a speech in Manchester, New Hampshire, that focused on the administration’s efforts to battle the nation’s opioid addiction crisis, Trump said he planned a news conference in about a month to roll out drug price proposals. “We’re driving ‘em down,” Trump said. “We pay as a country so much more for drugs because of the drugs lobbies and other reasons, and the complexity of distribution, which is basically another term for saying, ‘How do we get more money.’” Joining Trump at the event, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the Food and Drug Administration last year approved more generic drugs, which generally cost less, than it has in its history. “We’re going to be rolling out in about a month a whole slate of other proposals about how we decrease the price of drugs and how we bring discounts that the middlemen right now are getting, how those will go to our patients, to individuals,” said Azar, who is a former president of the U.S. arm of Eli Lilly and Co. Trading volume in the ishares Nasdaq Biotechnology exchange-traded fund picked up as Trump began talking about drug prices, but the ETF’s price was down about 2.6 percent, roughly where it was before Trump’s comments. In discussing the opioid crisis, Trump said he would provide free Narcan, an emergency treatment for opioid overdoses, to schools. Shares of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, a seller of Narcan nasal spray, spiked as much as 56.3 percent following Trump’s comment before paring gains to close up 27.6 percent at $26.34.
