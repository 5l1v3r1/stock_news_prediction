Howard said she was uncertain that General Mills would be able to pass on higher costs and freight inflation to struggling retailers that are fighting to cut costs themselves.\nGeneral Mills, which also makes Yoplait yogurt and Nature Valley granola bars, now expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share to grow up to 1 percent, compared with a prior forecast for a 3 percent to 4 percent increase.\nNet income attributable to General Mills more than doubled to $941.4 million in the third quarter ended Feb. 25, helped by a one-time tax benefit of $504 million from changes in the U.S. tax code.\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned 79 cents per share.\nNet sales rose 2.3 percent to $3.88 billion.\nAnalysts had expected third-quarter earnings of 78 cents per share and revenue of $3.78 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T20:50:56.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
