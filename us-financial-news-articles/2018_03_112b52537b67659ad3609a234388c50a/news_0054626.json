Blocks in two other basins will be awarded later in the day.\nLeftist frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says that if he wins the July 1 vote he will review more than 90 contracts signed since Mexico passed legislation in 2013 ending the 75-year monopoly of state energy firm Pemex.\nLopez Obrador said this month that he will ask President Enrique Pena Nieto to cancel two auctions planned for the second half of the year, if he wins in July.\nMexico is competing for investment with Brazil, which is also holding an auction this week, with another scheduled in June.\nBrazil holds its own election in October, with the most likely leftist contender in the presidential race, Ciro Ferreira Gomes, warning he would expropriate energy assets bought by investors if he wins.\nIn Thursday’s auction, Mexico offered 35 areas in the Burgos, Tampico-Misantla-Veracruz and Southeast basins.\nFourteen companies including BP, Chevron, Eni, India’s ONGC Videsh, Pemex, Petronas, Repsol, Shell and Total qualified to bid as individual bidders, while 22 consortia have also qualified to bid.
