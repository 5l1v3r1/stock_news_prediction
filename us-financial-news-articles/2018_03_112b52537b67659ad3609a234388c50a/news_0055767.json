Reuters reported earlier in March that China was making plans to allow its offshore-listed tech giants to sell depository receipts on the mainland.\nChina's securities regulator will set up a new committee to select and review firms for the scheme, which applies to companies in fields such as the internet, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, chips, bio-tech and high-end manufacturing.\nThe State Council said firms taking part in the scheme should treat domestic and foreign investors equally, and their prospectuses must disclose voting right differences and any special company structure arrangements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T15:51:57.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
