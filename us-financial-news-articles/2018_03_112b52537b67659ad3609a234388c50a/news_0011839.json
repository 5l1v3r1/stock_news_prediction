He received Academy Awards nominations in 2007 for“Pan’s Labyrinth,” but this was the first time he was nominated in the directing category.\nDel Toro described his films to Reuters earlier this year as“fairytales for modern times.”\nOther nominees included Christopher Nolan for“Dunkirk,” Jordan Peele for“Get Out,” Greta Gerwig for“Lady Bird,” and Paul Thomas Anderson for“Phantom Thread.”\n“The Shape of Water” was hit with a plagiarism lawsuit last month that alleged its plot was lifted directly from a 1969 American stage play. Del Toro, who also wrote the screenplay, said he had never seen or read the play.\nReporting by Nichola Groom and Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Jill Serjeant, Sandra Maler and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T06:55:51.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
