The move also came amid growing political pressure to reduce lending rates.\nFinance Minister Chimed Khurelbaatar said the government was also planning to introduce new tax reforms to support small and medium-sized enterprises.\n“With the IMF, we overcame the economic and financial difficulties and we will continue to collaborate with them,” he said. “We continue to understand and support each other.”\nThe IMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
