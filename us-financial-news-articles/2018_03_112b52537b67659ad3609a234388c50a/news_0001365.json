REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo “Boeing is keen to have us as a customer...but right now we are still very much an Airbus customer,” he told reporters.\nTo a question if he had plans to buy Boeing planes, Fernandes said“not at the moment”.\nLast month, Reuters reported that sources said AirAsia -Airbus’ largest Asian customer - was set to confirm an order of wide-body jets from the European planemaker after Boeing tried to win the airline over and extend a lead in the lucrative long-haul market.\nOn Thursday, the airline also announced the sale of its aircraft leasing operations to firms managed by BBAM Ltd, one of the world’s largest aircraft portfolio managers, in a staggered deal that will see the budget carrier transfer ownership of up to 182 Airbus jets.\nThe deal, valued at $1.2 billion in the first phase, will help the airline pare down debt and return money to shareholders, as well as give it firepower to grow its business.\nReporting by Liz Lee; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T10:04:44.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
