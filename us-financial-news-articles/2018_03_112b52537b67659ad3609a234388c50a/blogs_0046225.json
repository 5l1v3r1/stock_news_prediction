That includes looking at weekdays and off-season months.\nNo wonder: New data from planning site WeddingWire finds that the average wedding, including the engagement ring and honeymoon, cost $36,000 in 2017. The ceremony and reception alone were $27,000.\nAlthough both figures are $1,000 less than in 2016, they still represent a chunk of money.\nYet there are still signs couples are overspending. WeddingWire also found that couples underestimated their budget by 42 percent, while Student Loan Hero notes that 74 percent plan to take on debt to cover their wedding bills.\nLooking at wedding-date trends, it seems like there are clear peaks and valleys in popularity. (See graphic below.)\nAnd the potential savings can be enticing.\nFor example, in Hudson Valley, New York, site fees can range from $5,000 to $15,000 during the peak fall season, said wedding planner Angela Christoforo, owner of Elite Wedding & Event Planning. A winter wedding could trim 20 percent to 30 percent off the venue bill, she said, and other vendors may run winter or off-peak specials, as well.\nWedding planner Janice Carnevale, owner of Bellwether Events in Washington, D.C., said she's seen a slow growth in couples looking to host weddings Mondays through Thursdays. That shift can help couples bring a desired venue into budget by avoiding high weekend food and drink minimums, or increase the chance of a venue or vendor's availability even in a peak season.\n\"The price of tilapia doesn't care if you're getting married in January, or on a Thursday, and people who get hourly wages get paid the same rate regardless of what time of the year or day of the week it is.\" -Janice Carnevale, Owner of Bellwether Events \"In D.C., your venue is one of the most expensive pieces of the budget puzzle,\" Carnevale said, with costs ranging from $8,000 to $20,000. \"If you're looking to reduce that by a third, then a Thursday night might be the way you do that.\"\nBut experts caution that going off-peak for your wedding is a tactic rife with potential pitfalls. Here's what to consider before you save the date.\n1) Expect a limit to savings A vendor's underlying costs contribute to how much give there is (or isn't) in offering a deal for off-peak timing.\n\"The price of tilapia doesn't care if you're getting married in January, or on a Thursday,\" Carnevale said. \"And people who get hourly wages get paid the same rate regardless of what time of the year or day of the week it is.\"\nHigher costs for other items can also offset savings. Flower costs, for example, can be pricier for a winter wedding if your desired blooms aren't in season and need to be imported, she said.\nKeep in mind that deals may not be advertised, or offered up with the regular price list — especially if you make a general price inquiry or initially ask about a prime season or date, Christoforo said. (This is also where your bargaining skills, or those of a wedding planner, can come in handy.)\n\"It's always good to ask if there's an off-peak rate,\" she said.\n2) \"Off-peak\" isn't easy to gauge Broadly speaking, winter is a less popular time to get married; however, planners warn that off-seasons vary by market. And there may not be a slow time at all.\n\"For wedding locations that are popular wedding destinations — think Hawaii or Southern California — or locations where the weather is nice all year round, slow seasons as far as weddings are concerned are basically nonexistent,\" said Christina Farrow, president and co-founder of planning site AislePlanner.com, who previously ran a wedding planning firm in Hawaii.\nTop wedding dates for 2018 Rank Date Holiday 1 Saturday, Oct. 20 2 Saturday, Aug. 18 3 Saturday, Oct. 13 4 Saturday, Sept. 29 5 Saturday, Sept. 2 Labor Day weekend 6 Saturday, Sept. 8 7 Saturday, Sept. 22 8 Saturday, Oct. 6 Columbus Day weekend 9 Saturday, Sept. 15 10 Saturday, Oct. 27 SOURCE: Zola.com Even in a generally quiet season, there can be competition from other local events like conferences and sports games that tie up venues and vendors, reducing your odds of scoring a deal, said Carnevale.\n\"People think December is off-peak for weddings, and it is,\" she said. \"But it's peak for holiday parties.\"\n3) There's a reason it's unpopular Skipping Miami's peak tourist season can cut your hotel and venue costs in half, but there are distinct trade-offs to a summer or fall wedding in the area, said wedding blogger Dara Smith of TheFirstLookBlog.com. Stifling heat and humidity aside, off-season also overlaps with hurricane season, the rainy season and mosquito season.\nWinter storms can create a host of problems, from power outages affecting the venue to bridal party members, guests and vendors unexpectedly unable to travel in, said Anne Chertoff, trends expert for WeddingWire. And picking a weeknight wedding can reduce the number of family and friends able and willing to attend .\nYou'll have to weigh the risk-reward of picking that less-desirable date.\nSome issues can be worked around with planning. Smith said she often talks to couples thinking about a summer destination wedding in Miami about avoiding an outdoor, afternoon ceremony, asking the venue about contingencies such as fans, and being flexible with photo timing to avoid midafternoon rain showers. Also key: Dig into venue and vendor policies.\n\"Definitely go through all the scenarios,\" Smith said. \"What's the emergency clause ... if there's a hurricane and everyone evacuates? Do you get all your money back?\"\nMore from Personal Finance:\nHow much you really need to earn to take home six figures\nRev up your tax savings with these filing tips\nThis is why you shouldn't wait until the last minute to file your taxes\nWedding insurance can be cheap way to buy peace of mind, Chertoff said. Rates are based on factors such as the cost of the wedding, with coverage kicking in to cover nonrefundable costs related to natural disasters as well as other wedding woes, such as a vendor going out of business.\nSome downsides, such as a slimmer guest list, also have their own advantages for couples looking for a more intimate, less pricey affair.\n\"It's the guest list that's really going to determine how much you're spending on your wedding,\" Chertoff said. \"Cutting one table of people could save you thousands of dollars.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T21:02:29.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
