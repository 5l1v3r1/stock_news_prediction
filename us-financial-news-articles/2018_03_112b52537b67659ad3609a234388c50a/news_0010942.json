They’ll play in the quarterfinals Thursday.\nSenior guard Trevon Bluiett paced Xavier with 22 points and set the school’s career 3-point record along the way. His 3-pointer with 12:36 to play was his 308th in a Xavier uniform, which broke the record owned by Romain Sato since 2004.\nSenior guard J.P. Macura added 12 points, including a crucial layup with 1:43 left to halt DePaul’s late push, while graduate forward Kerem Kanter and sophomore guard Paul Scruggs contributed 11 points apiece.\nSophomore guard Brandon Cyrus paced DePaul with a career-high 20 points while junior guard Eli Cain notched 14. The Blue Demons (11-19, 4-14) finished with at least a share of the Big East basement for the eighth time in the last 10 years as they tied with St. John’s (15-16, 4-14).\nXavier, which won for the 12th time in the last 13 games, utilized a 12-2 run over a five-minute stretch midway through the first half to seize a 19-8 lead. Bluiett capped the spree with his first 3-pointer and a pair of free throws.\nThe Musketeers pushed their lead to 22-10 before DePaul, which made just 5 of its first 20 shots, found some holes in the defense. Cain popped two 3-pointers and freshman guard Justin Roberts added a third as the Blue Demons canned five shots in a row to pull within 25-23 at the 3:28 mark.\nDePaul clung within 32-26 at the break despite losing top scorer Max Strus for the final 8:43 of the first half after he committed a charging foul and then picked up a technical foul lobbying his case. The technical counted as his third foul and he produced just 2 points in 11 minutes for the half and 7 points in 31 minutes for the game.\nXavier kept trying to pull away in the second half, but DePaul refused to lose contact. On four occasions, the Musketeers opened a double-digit lead only to see the Blue Demons respond with the next basket.\nThe Musketeers took a 63-55 lead on a pair of free throws by sophomore guard Quentin Goodin with 4:47 left, but then the Musketeers stalled. They whiffed on four consecutive possessions as DePaul pulled within 63-62 on two Tre’Darius McCallum free throws with 1:58 to go, but Macura rescued Xavier with a layup.\nDePaul had four chances to get closer, but the Blue Demons turned over the ball and Cyrus missed a layup before Cain and Strus missed game-tying 3-pointers as time ran out.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:54:17.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
