(NASDAQ: TNDM), a medical device company and manufacturer of the only touchscreen insulin pumps available in the United States, today reported its financial results for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2017 and financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2018.\n“The fourth quarter marked the strongest sales in Tandem’s history, with 80 percent growth in our sequential quarterly pump shipments. This strong demand for the t:slim X2 Insulin Pump was driven by our successful launch of integration with Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM and our unique offering that allows customers to remotely update their pump software using a personal computer,” said Kim Blickenstaff, President and Chief Executive Officer. “In 2018, we expect to build on our commercial momentum while advancing our robust product pipeline. To that end, we recently submitted a PMA application to the FDA for the t:slim X2 Pump with Basal-IQ technology, a predictive low glucose suspend feature, and we’re preparing for a U.S. launch this summer to existing and new t:slim X2 Pump customers, pending FDA approval.”\nSales and Pump Shipments 1\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, (in millions)\n2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Sales $ 40.3 $ 28.9 $ 107.6 $ 84.2 Impact of Technology Upgrade Program (0.3) (4.1) (5.0 ) 4.3 Non-GAAP Sales 1 $ 40.0 $ 24.8 $ 102.6 $ 88.5 Pump Shipments 6,950 4,418 17,061 16,938 1) GAAP sales are determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

The Technology Upgrade Program discussed above created unpredictable GAAP results for its duration. This was principally due to accounting complexities associated with the program that were dependent on a number of future events and variables that were initially difficult to estimate or predict.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used internally by the Company to analyze its operating performance and prospects for future performance. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not necessarily reflect, and may not be a good estimate of, the amount that will actually be recorded in the Company’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information and guidance prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. To the extent the Company utilizes such non-GAAP financial measures in the future, it expects to calculate them using a consistent method from period to period. The Company has provided a reconciliation of its GAAP financial results and guidance to its non-GAAP financial results and guidance under the heading “Reconciliation of GAAP versus Non-GAAP Financial Results and Guidance” in the attached Press Release Exhibit.\nAbout Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc.\nTandem Diabetes Care, Inc.

(“Tandem” or the “Company”) launched a Technology Upgrade Program under a variable pricing structure (the “Upgrade Program”), as a pathway for its t:slim® and t:slim G4™ Insulin Pump customers to experience the Company’s latest technology, the t:slim X2™ Insulin Pump platform which now includes integration with Dexcom G5® Mobile continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) integration. The Company began shipping the t:slim X2 Insulin Pump in October 2016 and is no longer offering the t:slim® Insulin Pump to new customers. In August 2017, the Company commenced commercial sales of the t:slim X2 Pump with DexCom G5 Mobile CGM integration (“t:slim X2 with G5”) and discontinued new sales of the t:slim G4 Pump. The Upgrade Program expired September 30, 2017.\nAccounting Treatment Overview\nPursuant to applicable GAAP revenue recognition standards, revenue is recognized when the product is delivered or when an obligation is fulfilled, among other requirements. Under the Upgrade Program, eligible customers were provided the opportunity to receive, at a future date, a t:slim X2 Insulin Pump, or as of August 2017, a t:slim X2 with G5. This created potential future obligations for the Company that prevented the full recognition of revenue and cost of sales at the time of the customer’s initial purchase of an insulin pump, which resulted in a deferral of revenue and cost of sales on the Company’s financial statements. The deferrals are recognized when the obligation for such upgrades and services are fulfilled or when the Upgrade Program expires. Any fees received by the Company under the Upgrade Program and the Company’s cost of fulfilling the associated obligation are also recognized at that time.\nReconciliation of GAAP versus Non-GAAP Financial Results and Guidance\nDue to this high degree of accounting complexity, the Upgrade Program created unpredictable GAAP results for its duration. To aid investors in better understanding the Company’s performance and minimize potential confusion when comparing its current results to historical results and expected future results, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial information in the accompanying press release, in addition to providing GAAP financial information. In the following tables, the Company has provided a reconciliation of its GAAP financial results and guidance to its non-GAAP financial results and guidance, which illustrates the impact of the Upgrade Program.\nFor the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 respectively, the impact of the Technology Upgrade Program was as follows:\nImpact of Technology Upgrade Program (three months ended December 31, 2017) (in millions) GAAP\nFinancial\nResults\nDeferrals at\nInitial Sale 1\nRecognition of\nDeferrals 2\nUpgrade\nFulfillments 3\nNon-GAAP\nFinancial Results\nSales $ 40.3 $ - $ (0.1 ) $ (0.2 ) $ 40.0 Cost of sales $ 22.8 - - (0.4 ) $ 22.4 Gross profit (loss) $ 17.5 $ - $ (0.1 ) $ 0.2 $ 17.6 Gross margin % 43 % 44 % Operating loss $ (9.6 ) $ - $ (0.1 ) $ 0.2 $ (9.5 ) Operating margin % (24 )% (24 )% * Table may not foot due to rounding\nImpact of Technology Upgrade Program (twelve months ended December 31, 2017) (in millions) GAAP\nFinancial\nResults\nDeferrals at\nInitial Sale 1\nRecognition of\nDeferrals 2\nUpgrade\nFulfillments 3\nNon-GAAP\nFinancial Results\nSales $ 107.6 $ 0.2 $ (4.6 ) $ (0.6\n) $ 102.6\nCost of sales $ 63.5 $ - $ (0.8 ) $ (1.1 ) $ 61.6 Gross profit (loss) $ 44.1 $ 0.2 $ (3.8 ) $ 0.5\n$ 41.0\nGross margin % 41 % 40 % Operating loss $ (62.9 ) $ 0.2 $ (3.8 ) $ 0.5\n$ (66.1 ) Operating margin % (58 )% (64 )% * Table may not foot due to rounding\nFor the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 respectively, the impact of the Technology Upgrade Program was as follows:\nImpact of Technology Upgrade Program (three months ended December 31, 2016) ($ amounts in millions) GAAP\nFinancial\nResults\nDeferrals at\nInitial Sale 1\nRecognition of\nDeferrals 2\nUpgrade\nFulfillments 3\nNon-GAAP\nFinancial Results\nSales $ 28.9 $ 1.4 $ (5.4 ) $ (0.1 ) $ 24.8 Cost of sales $ 18.8 $ 0.3 $ (1.0 ) $ (1.1 ) $ 17.0 Gross profit (loss) $ 10.1 $ 1.1 $ (4.4 ) $ 1.0 $ 7.8 Gross margin % 35 % 31 % Operating loss $ (13.3 ) $ 1.1 $ (4.4 ) $ 1.0 $ (15.7 ) Operating margin % (46 )% (63 )% * Table may not foot due to rounding\nImpact of Technology Upgrade Program (twelve months ended December 31, 2016) ($ amounts in millions) GAAP\nFinancial\nResults\nDeferrals at\nInitial Sale 1\nRecognition of\nDeferrals 2\nUpgrade\nFulfillments 3\nNon-GAAP\nFinancial Results\nSales $ 84.2 $ 9.8 $ (5.4 ) $ (0.1 ) $ 88.5 Cost of sales $ 60.7 $ 1.8 $ (1.0 ) $ (1.1 ) $ 60.4 Gross profit (loss) $ 23.6 $ 8.0 $ (4.4 ) $ 1.0 $ 28.1 Gross margin % 28 % 32 % Operating loss $ (78.1 ) $ 8.0 $ (4.4 ) $ 1.0 $ (73.5 ) Operating margin % (93 )% (83 )% * Table may not foot due to rounding\nSince the launch of the t:slim X2 Pump in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company has fulfilled approximately 3,300 upgrades under the Technology Upgrade Program. The majority of deferred sales and cost of sales were recognized as of December 31, 2017 and the Company is no longer subject to new accounting deferrals.\nNon-GAAP Accounting Definitions\n1) Deferrals at Initial Sale - The deferral of initial sales and cost of sales for eligible pump shipments are summarized in the following table:\nDeferral Treatment for Eligible Shipments on or After July 1, 2016\nSales Deferral Cost of Sales Deferral 100% of each sale classified as a right of return. A portion of each sale classified as a guarantee liability. 100% of the manufacturing cost for each sale classified as a right of return. No deferral for each sale classified as a guarantee liability. 2) Recognition of Deferrals – This reflects any changes in subsequent periods for deferrals made at the time of the initial sale (see Deferrals at Initial Sale above). It includes recognition of amounts previously deferred when actual product upgrades occur and a reversal of any remaining deferrals when the program expires for customers who did not elect the upgrade or service options.\n3) Upgrade Fulfillments – This reflects incremental revenue recognized from an upgrade or service fee, if any, and the cost of sales associated with completing that upgrade or service. Approximately 3,300 upgrade fulfillments have occurred since the fourth quarter of 2016, when the t:slim X2 Insulin Pump became available. At that time, the Company commenced reporting Recognition of Deferrals and Upgrade Fulfillments.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301006453/en/\nMedia Contact:\nSteve Sabicer, 714-907-6264\nssabicer@thesabicergroup.com\nor\nInvestor Contact:\nSusan Morrison, 858-366-6900 x7005\nsmorrison@tandemdiabetes.com\nSource: Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.tandemdiabetes.com&esheet=51766666&newsitemid=20180301006453&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.tandemdiabetes.com&index=1&md5=319bf2232a0ab4c649e0a70325e7e459", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tandemdiabetes.com&esheet=51766666&newsitemid=20180301006453&lan=en-US&anchor=www.tandemdiabetes.com&index=2&md5=843d3d1ef9650eb5e4c4c88a7b9e8b04", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Ftandemdiabetes&esheet=51766666&newsitemid=20180301006453&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Ftandemdiabetes&index=4&md5=b7e341e869e1e19752e51cf3714f566c", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301006453/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTandemDiabetes&esheet=51766666&newsitemid=20180301006453&lan=en-US&anchor=www.facebook.com%2FTandemDiabetes&index=3&md5=383823118384ad1c2393b83e36270c43", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/tandemdiabetes"], "published": "2018-03-02T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T01:21:43.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
