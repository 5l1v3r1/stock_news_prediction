It did not say from whom it had made the purchase. The shares closed at 13.80 rand on Thursday, up 2.2 percent.\nIt added it had also agreed to buy a further 29,005,926 shares from investment management company Allan Gray, M&R&rsquo;s third largest stakeholder, for 15 rand, which would further raise its stake to 39.6 percent.\nM&R previously rejected ATON’s buyout offer as “opportunistic” and poor value. M&R is reluctant to sell cheaply, having spent billions of rand transforming itself from a local builder to a multinational focused on the natural resources sector.\nATON said it would be for M&R shareholders to decide on the offer.\nFinancial services conglomerate Old Mutual ( OML.L ), ( OMLJ.J ), which holds about 5 percent of M&R, rejected an offer from ATON to buy its stake at 15 rand per share on Wednesday, saying that the offer was below fair value.\nATON, with a diverse portfolio of investments in the mining, engineering, aviation and health technology sectors, is making its second attempt at a deal after a previous approach failed in 2016.\nReporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Joe Brock and Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:47:57.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
