The decision helped to boost the balance sheet of Novo Banco, which has subsequently been sold to U.S. fund Lone Star.\nBanco Espirito Santo collapsed in 2014 under the debts of its founding family and after a 4.9-billion-euro rescue its main operations were transferred to a new institution, Novo Banco. Banco Espirito Santo was left with the debts.
