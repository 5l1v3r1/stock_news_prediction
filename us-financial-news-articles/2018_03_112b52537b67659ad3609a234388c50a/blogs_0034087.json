Last month, residents alerted environmental authorities to a reddish hue in puddles and flooded areas near the river after some heavy rains. \nAuthorities said they found areas of irregular discharge. The company initially said it had not released untreated water into the environment, then said it would investigate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T08:51:55.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
