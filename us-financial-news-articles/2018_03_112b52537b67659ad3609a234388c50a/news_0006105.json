Winterkorn said when he resigned that he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part.\nPublic hearings of the case at the Braunschweig court are due to start in early September.\n$1 = 0.8187 euros Reporting by Andreas Cremer Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:02:09.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
