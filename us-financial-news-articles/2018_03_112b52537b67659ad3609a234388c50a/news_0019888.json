The halts spread confusion among investors as to what was trading and whether they received fair prices for completed trades.\n“We take our regulatory obligations seriously and remain focused on building and maintaining industry-leading technology and ensuring that our markets operate with the utmost integrity,” NYSE spokeswoman Kristen Kaus said in a statement on Tuesday.\nPrevious SEC enforcement actions against exchanges include a $14 million settlement in 2015 with BATS Global Markets, which is now owned by Cboe Global Markets ( CBOE.O ), over charges that two exchanges acquired by BATS had given advantages to certain high-frequency trading firms.\nIn May 2013, the SEC penalized Nasdaq Inc ( NDAQ.O ) $10 million to settle charges stemming from mistakes made during Facebook Inc’s ( FB.O ) initial public offering in 2012.\nICE shares were up 0.5 percent at $73.19 on Tuesday.\nReporting by John McCrank in New York and Eric Walsh in Washington; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:38:22.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
