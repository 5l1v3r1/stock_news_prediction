Security Council resolution adopted last Saturday demanding a ceasefire of at least 30 days to allow aid deliveries and medical evacuations, in line with international law, and demands that Syrian authorities allow unimpeded access.\nThe draft resolution also calls on U.N. war crimes investigators on Syria, led by Paulo Pinheiro, to conduct an independent inquiry into events in eastern Ghouta by June.\nThe investigators are scheduled to issue their next report on March 6, to be debated by the Council on March 13.
