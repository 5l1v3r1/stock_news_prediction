Audi CEO Rupert Stadler poses next to the Audi Q7 e-tron quatro car before the company's annual news conference in Ingolstadt, Germany March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Michael Dalder Volkswagen’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) main profit engine will introduce a new model every three weeks this year, including the redesigned A6 and the all-new Q8, it said on Thursday. Audi CEO Rupert Stadler (L) and CFO Alexander Seitz pose next to the Audi Q7 e-tron quatro car before the company's annual news conference in Ingolstadt, Germany March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Michael Dalder Due to the disruptions, Audi has refrained from projecting another outright increase in deliveries, saying it wants to at least match last year’s record 1.88 million sales. Revenue is expected to slightly exceed last year’s 60.1 billion euros ($74.31 billion). “2018 is an exceptional year and requires a feat of strength from Audi which will pay off in the long term,” finance chief Alexander Seitz said on Thursday at the carmaker’s earnings press conference. From 2019, the model offensive is expected to have a “sustained positive impact” on deliveries and earnings, Audi said.
