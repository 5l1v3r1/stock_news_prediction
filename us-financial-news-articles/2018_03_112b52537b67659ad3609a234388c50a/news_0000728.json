Spurs, whose Argentine manager Mauricio Pochettino became the first non-European coach to win 100 Premier League games, moved up to third on 58 points from 29 games, a point ahead of Liverpool who were playing Newcastle United later on Saturday. Son stood out in a one-sided contest and bagged a fine brace after he also netted twice in Wednesday’s 6-1 FA Cup fifth round replay win over League One (third division) side Rochdale. The South Korean said Tottenham thrived from playing at their temporary home after taking some time to settle in. “We feel comfortable at Wembley, we know how we play here,” Son told the BBC.“Of course, it was going to take time but now we feel like we’re at home. We enjoy playing here...” Soccer Football - Premier League - Tottenham Hotspur vs Huddersfield Town - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - March 3, 2018 Tottenham's Son Heung-min is challenged by Huddersfield Town’s Terence Kongolo in the penalty area REUTERS/Eddie Keogh Huddersfield’s Jonas Lossl kept out a close-range effort from league top scorer Harry Kane before Son fired Spurs ahead with a neat finish in the 27th minute after rounding the keeper following a defence-splitting pass by Dele Alli. Lossl denied the hard-working Kane again shortly before the break as Tottenham continued to dominate but he could do nothing to stop Son’s second goal in the 54th minute. Slideshow (3 Images) Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris had parried a stinging Tom Ince shot at the other end before Kane raced down the right flank and delivered an inch-perfect pass to Son, who coolly headed past Lossl into the far corner. Son heaped praise on England striker Kane, who has scored 35 goals in all competitions this season and has already equalled last term’s tally. “The pass from Harry Kane was very good for me, it made it easy to score,” said Son.“Harry is one of the best players in the world. The manager has to choose 11 players but there are many more. I try my best and try to be ready at all times.” Tottenham next face Juventus in the Champions League last 16 at Wembley on Wednesday after a 2-2 draw in Turin.
