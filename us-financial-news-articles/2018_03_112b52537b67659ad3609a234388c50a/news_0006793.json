It will offer severance to those who leave after May 31 and help them with an external job search.\nAbout six years ago, Best Buy struggled with plunging sales and shrinking profit as consumers browsed at brick-and-mortar stores but made purchases online, a practice called showrooming.\nSince then the company has tried to turn itself around by closing underperforming stores, improving customer service and competing with Amazon.com Inc by matching the online retailer’s low prices.\nThose efforts have helped Best Buy grow comparable sales at stores open at least a year in six of the past eight quarters. The company reports fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.\nJoly said in the letter he felt confident about retaining customers and transitioning them to the company’s larger stores and website, adding 85 percent of Best Buy’s mobile stores are within three miles of one of its big box stores.\nReporting by Nandita Bose in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:21:01.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
