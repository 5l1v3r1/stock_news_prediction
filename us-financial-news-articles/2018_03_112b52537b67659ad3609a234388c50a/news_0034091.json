She was an advisor to Chile’s Senate Environment Commission before serving as the country’s Minister of the Environment from 2010 to 2014. Ms. Benítez will be the Company’s first director with primary expertise in environmental management, and will provide invaluable knowledge from a region where Barrick has significant long-term interests, including operations and projects in Argentina, Chile, Dominican Republic, and Peru. Her election will complement the 2016 appointment of our first director from Argentina, further enhancing the Company’s oversight and risk management capabilities in the region.\nFrom 1992 to 2009, Ms. Benítez worked in the private sector as Senior Head of Projects at Gestión Ambiental Consultores, one of Chile’s leading environmental consultancies. In 2012, she received the Female Leader Award from a leading Chilean newspaper, and in 2014, she was honored by the Institute of Engineers of Chile for her career as a civil engineer in the public and private sector. Ms. Benítez holds a degree in Chemical Engineering from the Universidad de Chile.\nAdditional details regarding Ms. Benítez and Barrick’s other director nominees will be provided in the Company’s 2018 Information Circular to be filed later this month.\nINVESTOR CONTACT\nDeni Nicoski\nSenior Vice President\nInvestor Relations\nTelephone: +1 416 307-7474\nEmail: dnicoski@barrick.com\nMEDIA CONTACT\nAndy Lloyd\nSenior Vice President\nCommunications\nTelephone: +1 416 307-7414\nEmail: alloyd@barrick.com\nSource:Barrick Gold Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c5973e8c-4eb1-4439-9fa5-7fff92de682c"], "published": "2018-03-19T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T16:47:03.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
