He’s also used his platform on Twitter and elsewhere to share his political ideas. In a slew of tweets in recent months, Rose has made his distaste for Donald Trump and the president’s family known. On Jan. 4, for instance, Rose tweeted that “the White House is the current U.S. gold standard of what can be considered disgraceful.” Just last week, he said that the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump should not be “part of the White House administration.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nSo, while Rose didn’t hurl a direct insult at Apple’s CEO, given his distaste for the president, he’s obviously not too happy with Cook.\nWhile it’s hard to say exactly why Rose has an issue with Cook, Apple operates one of the most popular streaming and download services in the world in Apple Music and iTunes. Rose, a musician, could be referring in some way to those services. Guns N’ Roses music is available on Apple’s offerings.\nTim Cook has not publicly responded to Rose’s comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T12:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T18:45:31.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
