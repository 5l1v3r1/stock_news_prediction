During his tenure, Paulson gave a tearful apology as the RCMP settled a series of harassment, discrimination and sexual abuse claims that deeply embarrassed the force.\nThe RCMP is also under fire for not doing enough to protect Canada’s largely marginalized and impoverished aboriginal population.\n“We know we have a lot of work to do ... to restore the RCMP to the full position of trust that it really should have in the eyes of Canadians,” Trudeau said.\nHe said the RCMP needed to become better and stronger, adding that Lucki would “play a vital role in advancing reconciliation with indigenous peoples, promoting gender equality ... (and) addressing workplace harassment.”\nFILE PHOTO: Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) cadets await badge presentations at a graduation ceremony at the RCMP Academy, Depot Division in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, June 5, 2017.

REUTERS/Ben Nelms/File Photo The National Police Federation, a union group that represents more than half of the force’s members and has been pushing for reform of its leadership, welcomed Lucki’s appointment.\n“We hope her selection and appointment will trigger an era of renewed investment for the 17,000-plus men and women who serve across the country, and a more supportive environment for female members in particular,” Brian Sauve, founder of the group, said in a statement.\nTwo cadets standing at attention behind the prime minister fainted during Friday’s ceremony, prompting Trudeau to interrupt his remarks. RCMP Sergeant Major Tammy Patterson told reporters it was not uncommon for cadets to collapse after standing still for prolonged periods of time.\n“They were trying their very best, I can imagine, to look great as a backdrop,” Patterson said. “It’s a very exciting opportunity for them ... and probably also very stressful.”\nTrudeau told the crowd he would check on the cadets after the ceremony.\nReporting by Andrea Hopkins; Editing by Dan Grebler and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T19:48:48.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
