Anglo said there was leakage of a mixture of iron ore and water to a local watershed. It asked the local water company to stop using that water to supply residents and it is paying for water trucks to serve the local population for now. It said production at the Conceição do Mato Dentro mine is halted until they can determine what caused the duct’s accident.
