M. Castle & Co. (OTCQB:CTAM) (the \"Company\" or \"Castle\"), a global distributor of specialty metal and supply chain solutions, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter following its emergence from bankruptcy and its full year financial results, which include the pre-bankruptcy period, January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017, and the post-bankruptcy period, September 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The Company emerged from bankruptcy proceedings on August 31, 2017 (the \"Effective Date\"), having successfully restructured its balance sheet and substantially reduced its debt burden and cash interest costs under its Amended Prepackaged Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (the \"Plan\").\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nYear over year volume increase of 12%\nNet sales of $123.2 million\nNet loss of $12.5 million, including $6.2 million of interest expense, $4.8 million of which was non-cash\nPresident and CEO Steve Scheinkman commented, \"We are pleased with the strength of our sales volume in the first full quarter after our emergence from bankruptcy last August. In the quarter, we started to see positive indications that our business is growing from a volume standpoint, and we are carrying that volume momentum into 2018. We believe this bodes well as we look to leverage the operating performance improvements we have implemented over the last year. Although our gross material margin in the quarter was negatively impacted by both residual financial impacts of our recent reorganization and a strategy to reduce excess and slower moving inventory, we are achieving market share gains in key target markets. Much of the restructuring impacts and inventory rebalancing are now behind us. Going forward, we believe sustained volume increases and margin expansion will incrementally improve financial performance.\"\nExecutive Vice President and CFO Pat Anderson added, \"With the completion of our reorganization, our capital structure has improved and our cash interest burden has been significantly reduced. Future cash flows will now be used to grow the business rather than to support an onerous capital structure, as was the case in the recent past.\"\nScheinkman concluded, \"Based on the recent positive market indications we are seeing, combined with the overall favorable demand sentiment and a strong pricing environment, we remain confident as the organization enters 2018. Based on our shipments since the beginning of this year, we are expecting year over year first quarter 2018 volume growth of 7.4% and double-digit sequential quarterly volume growth. We have reduced a significant amount of our excess, slow moving inventory burden, are increasing inventory turns, and, as a result, are seeing improvements in gross material margin. Castle is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the market prepares for substantial tariffs to be placed on imported steel and aluminum. We believe Castle’s long-standing and favorable sourcing relationships with domestic steel mills provide a competitive advantage relative to other U.S. based steel service centers that are more reliant on imports, and we are well-situated to address market disruption caused by the recently imposed tariffs.\"\nPresentation of Predecessor and Successor Financial Results\nThe Company adopted fresh-start reporting as of the Effective Date, the date the Company's Plan became effective and the Company emerged from its Chapter 11 cases. As a result of the application of fresh-start reporting, the Company’s financial statements for periods prior to the Effective Date are not comparable to those for periods subsequent to the Effective Date. References to “Successor” refer to the Company on or after the Effective Date. References to “Predecessor” refer to the Company prior to the Effective Date. Operating results for the Successor and Predecessor periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full fiscal year. References such as the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to A.M. Castle & Co. and its subsidiaries, whether Predecessor and/or Successor, as appropriate.\nAbout A. M.

The non-GAAP financial information should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP financial measures might not be comparative to similarly titled measures of other companies. However, we believe that non-GAAP reporting, giving effect to the adjustments shown in the reconciliation contained in this release and in the attached financial statements, provides meaningful information, and therefore we use it to supplement our GAAP reporting and guidance. Management often uses this information to assess and measure the performance of our business. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to investors, analysts and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analysis of operating results, to illustrate the results of operations giving effect to the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the reconciliations and to assist with period-over-period comparisons of such operations. The exclusion of the charges indicated herein from the non-GAAP financial measures presented does not indicate an expectation by the Company that similar charges will not be incurred in subsequent periods.\nIn addition, the Company believes that the use and presentation of EBITDA, which is defined by the Company as (loss) income before provision for income taxes plus depreciation and amortization, and interest expense, is widely used by the investment community for evaluation purposes and provides investors, analysts and other interested parties with additional information in analyzing the Company’s operating results. EBITDA, adjusted non-GAAP net (loss) income and adjusted EBITDA are presented as the Company believes the information is important to provide investors, analysts and other interested parties additional information about the Company’s financial performance. Management uses EBITDA, adjusted non-GAAP net (loss) income and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of the business.\nCautionary Statement on Risks Associated with Forward Looking Statements\nInformation provided and statements contained in this release that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements only speak as of the date of this release and the Company assumes no obligation to update the information included in this release. Such forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategy, and the cost savings and other benefits that we expect to achieve from our restructuring. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “predict,” “plan,” “should,” or similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and they involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are many factors that could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include our ability to effectively manage our operational initiatives and implemented restructuring activities, the impact of volatility of metals prices, the cyclical and seasonal aspects of our business, our ability to effectively manage inventory levels, and the impact of our substantial level of indebtedness, as well as including those risk factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, which we will file shortly. All future written and oral forward-looking statements by us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to above.
