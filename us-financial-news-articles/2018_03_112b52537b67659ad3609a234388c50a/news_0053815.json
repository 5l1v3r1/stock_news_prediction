(TSX:MRD), an Alberta-based real estate development and asset management company, announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange has accepted its notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid through the facilities of the TSX and on alternative trading systems.\nThe notice provides that Melcor may, during the twelve month period commencing March 31, 2018 and ending March 30, 2019, purchase for cancellation up to 1,669,782 common shares in total, being approximately 5% of its issued and outstanding common shares. The daily repurchase restriction for the common shares is 1,262. In addition, in accordance with the Block Purchase Exemption rules of the TSX and subject to the maximum annual aggregate limit, Melcor may make one block purchase per calendar week which exceeds the daily repurchase restriction.\nThe price which Melcor will pay for any such common shares will be the market price at the time of acquisition. The actual number of common shares which may be purchased and the timing of any such purchases will be subject to compliance with the TSX guidelines.\nUnder the current normal course issuer bid due to expire March 30, 2018, no common shares were purchased for cancellation during the last twelve months (1,667,704 had been approved for repurchase). As of March 23 rd , 2018 there were 33,395,651common shares of Melcor outstanding with an average daily trading volume for the prior six months of 5,050.\nMelcor believes that, at times, its common shares trade in a price range which does not adequately reflect the value of such common shares in relation to the business of Melcor and its future business prospects. As a result, depending upon future price movements and other factors, Melcor believes that its outstanding common shares may represent an attractive investment for itself. Furthermore, the purchases may benefit all persons who continue to hold common shares by increasing their equity interest in Melcor. All common shares purchased by Melcor under the normal course issuer bid will be cancelled.\nIn connection with commencement of the NCIB the Corporation also announced that it has entered into an automatic share purchase plan agreement (“ASPP”) with a broker to allow for the purchase of common shares under the NCIB at times when the Corporation ordinarily would not be active in the market due to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed trading blackout periods. Before entering into such restricted or blackout period, the Corporation may, but is not required to, instruct the designated broker to make purchases under the NCIB in accordance with the terms of the ASPP. Such purchases will be determined by the broker in its sole discretion based on parameters established by the Corporation prior to the restricted or blackout period in accordance with TSX rules, applicable securities laws and the terms of the ASPP. Outside of these pre-determined restricted or blackout periods, common shares will be purchased based on management's discretion, in compliance with TSX rules and applicable securities laws.\nAbout Melcor Developments Ltd.\nMelcor is a diversified real estate development and asset management company that transforms real estate from raw land through to high-quality finished product in both residential and commercial built form.
