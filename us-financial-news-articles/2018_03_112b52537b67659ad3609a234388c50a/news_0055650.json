(OTC PINK: EPSV), a newly formed early stage Blockchain technology company building a multi-solution Blockchain platform launching in 2018, today announced that Gary Potter has resigned his position as Chief Executive Officer, effective April 30, 2018, for personal reasons. Mr. Potter will remain a Consultant to the Company. The Board of Directors is initiating a search for a new CEO, and in the interim, Robert Walter, President and COO of Byzen Digital, will oversee Byzen’s operations.\n“Byzen is on a solid path and poised for its next level of growth and development. My mandate was to bring Byzen to the public market with a publicly trading stock and I’m proud to have accomplished that goal,” said Gary Potter, CEO of Byzen Digital. “I will remain as a consultant to Byzen and as the Board of Directors seeks a permanent replacement, Rob Walter, Byzen’s President and COO, will oversee operations in the interim period. As Byzen rolls out its clearly defined roadmap of solutions and services over the next 18-24 months, I remain confident that Byzen will deliver on its vision to bring easier access to the Blockchain by demystifying it for the masses.”\nAbout Byzen Digital Inc.\nByzen Digital is a new player in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency trading market place. The company intends to bring greater simplicity, efficiency and security of this relatively new technology to the widest possible audience, through a number of innovative solutions, all providing step-by-step education as part of the customer journey.\nOur chosen product markets are already growing exponentially and extremely scalable for the foreseeable future, and we firmly believe that now is the time to strike with a new approach as proposed, enabling us to widen the technology to an even greater audience of new clients, both consumer and corporate.\nByzen Digital already owns its own proprietary decentralized Cryptocurrency, called “Telecoin”, and this currency will be launched formally in 2018 as part of a much broader go-to-market strategy. Additionally, Byzen Digital’s own Cryptocurrencies will power their products and solutions from launch. The company also owns its own in-house media platform, “Digi Ex”.\nByzen Digital, through its Management team, is well networked and connected into the world of Global Payments, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency trading, and the company is well equipped to deliver against both their short terms goals as well as mid-term ambitions to become the “go-to” company for both Corporate, Financial Institutions and Retailers for all of their future Blockchain needs.
