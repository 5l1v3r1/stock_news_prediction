Then intelligence officials urged Americans not to buy phones from Huawei because they could be used to spy on people. \nAt Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, CNBC asked Richard Yu, the head of Huawei's consumer business, at a media roundtable about his thoughts on the company's issues in the U.S. \nWhile Yu was there to speak about the company's latest laptop device, the MateBook X Pro , the executive went off-script for several minutes, calling developments in the U.S. \"ridiculous\" and \"unfair.\" He blamed his rivals for playing politics to keep Huawei out of America because they are worried that it's becoming too strong. \n\"Our competitors are using some political way … To try to kick us out from the U.S. market but we have no issue at all. We are transparent … We are a leading high-tech, innovative company,\" Yu said on Sunday. \"But they cannot compete with us on product, on technology, on innovation, so they compete with us (using) politics.\" \nBut the public communications team at Huawei did not sanction the comments and have sought to distance the company from Yu's strong words. \n\"It's not right to blame the other party for not accepting us, we can only try harder, maintain our openness and transparency and wait until the other party is willing to communicate with us,\" Chen Lifang, Huawei's head of communications, said in an interview with the South China Morning Post on Tuesday . \nshow chapters Huawei's big plans for growth      4:51 AM ET Wed, 7 Feb 2018 | 05:05 Chen said that Huawei does not agree with Yu's views. \nHuawei is yet to respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC. \nThe Chinese company is better known for making networking equipment but in recent years has aggressively grown its consumer business. In a short time, the company has become the third-largest smartphone player by market share behind Apple and Samsung . In the same briefing where Yu made the comments about the U.S., he said that he thinks Huawei could surpass Apple within a couple of years .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T16:08:44.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
