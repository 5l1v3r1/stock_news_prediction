(OTC PINK: IVST). Innovest Global, Inc. is a diversified holding company that focuses on acquiring niche, high-growth businesses that are capable of generating significant annual revenue. The company’s planned subsidiaries operate across telehealth, biotech, commercial energy, business-to-business distribution, national call center and auto sales.\nThe report provides an overview of Innovest Global, Inc., its subsidiaries, financials, industry analysis and more. The content also covers brain and central nervous system (CNS) cancers and associated statistics.\nABTA: Forecasts 80,000 New Cases of Primary Brain Tumors This Year\nBrain cancers seem to not receive the same level of attention and awareness as other forms of the disease. However, in July 2017, Arizona Senator John McCain announced that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, glioblastoma. Glioblastomas are the most common form of brain cancer in adults today.\n“Glioblastoma can be difficult to treat. Average survival for malignant glioblastoma tends to be about 14 months with treatment,” says Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a practicing neurosurgeon.\nAs first-line treatments continue to focus on chemotherapy and radiation, medical professionals are increasingly searching for more advanced methods to treat these forms of cancer.\n\"The brain tumor community is very united in our quest for finding better treatments for our patients, and I think the progress will come through clearly planned and orchestrated clinical trials, looking at both approaches, immunotherapies and appropriate uses of targeted therapies, which will go and attack the genes that drive a particular tumor,\" says Dr. Manmeet Ahluwalia, a brain tumor oncologist and director of the brain metastasis program at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\nAccording to the American Brain Tumor Association , an estimated 80,000 new cases of primary brain tumors will be diagnosed this year. Another 17,000 people are estimated to lose their battle with a primary brain or CNS tumor this year.\nAccording to GBI Research , global revenues for the cancer vaccine market are forecast to grow from $2.5 billion in 2015 to $7.5 billion in 2022, which represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.93%.\nInnovest Signs LOI to Acquire 20% Stake in StemVax, LLC, a Biotech Company Working On Brain Cancer Vaccine\nInnovest Global recently announced that it has signed a Letter of Intent to acquire a 20% stake in StemVax, LLC , a biotechnology company that is currently developing a brain cancer vaccine.\nThe StemVax Glioblast (SVX-GB) cancer vaccine is being designed and formulated to help restore a patient’s immune system in order to fight off existing cancer cells within the body.\nAdding to the excitement of the deal is the fact that Innovest Global’s very own Dr. Dwain Morris-Irvin is the founder and CEO of StemVax, LLC. Dr. Dwain is the CEO of Innovest’s new Biotechnology & Health Sciences Division.\n“Innovest is uniquely equipped to provide immeasurably important elements to StemVax that kick things off for StemVax and dramatically improve its potential for success. This is true for other technologies we will encounter, as well. The best way I can show future scientists how Innovest can serve their mission, is to lead by example with my own company,” said Dr. Morris-Irvin. “Dan Martin (Innovest Global CEO) and I have been planning the business model for this division since 2017. It’s unique and will serve both technologists and Innovest well.”\nAside from biotechnology, Innovest also recently announced that its Innovest Energy Group has signed a Letter of Intent to acquire an energy business that is producing annual revenues of $1.2 million. The energy procurement acquisition target will provide the Energy Division with new technologies and synergies.\nOnce the energy acquisition is completed, management estimates baseline quarterly revenues of $800,000. The Energy Division alone will have more than 300 commercial and industrial clients and puts Innovest Global in perfect position while the company gets started on developing its Biotechnology & Health Sciences Division.\nManagement continues to vet PCAOB auditors to be engaged with the company and assist with auditing the financials. This is in addition to the fact that the company’s corporate counsel is an official OTCQX sponsor, which positions the company to continue pursuing uplisting endeavors that have been laid out in previous press releases.\nFor more information on Innovest Global, Inc., please visit http://innovestglobal.com and http://spotlightgrowth.com/index.php/2018/03/20/this-company-is-working-on-a-brain-cancer-vaccine-that-would-help-fight-against-same-tumor-type-as-senator-john-mccains/\nSpotlightGrowth.com is a digital hub for micro-caps, small-caps, crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, and other emerging growth investors.
