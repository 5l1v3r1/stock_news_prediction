The company, which places people in finance, engineering, legal and marketing jobs, said pretax profit grew to 40.6 million pounds ($55.9 million) in the year ended Dec. 31, from 28.1 million pounds a year earlier. Robert Walters, which generates 71 percent of its fee income from outside the UK, had raised its profit forecast three times last year.
