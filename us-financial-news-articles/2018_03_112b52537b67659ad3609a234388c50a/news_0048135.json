And as in the United States, more consumers in China are opting for SUVs instead of sedans. But Cadillac’s de Nysschen said overall, the number of sedans should continue to grow in China. \n“Our data indicate that by 2025, despite a contracting market share, the luxury sedan segment will be as big as the total Chinese luxury market today,” he said. “The (Chinese) market will almost treble over the next 10 years, so it’s massively important to Cadillac.” \nGM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Wednesday told investors at a conference on the sidelines of the New York show that selling more vehicles, such as the XT4, in China should drive “a 100 percent increase in Cadillac profitability over the next four years.” \nSeparately, Ford Motor Co’s Lincoln brand unveiled a three-row mid-size SUV at the auto show on Wednesday. \nConsumers can buy the Aviator in a hybrid version, which Joy Falotico, head of the Lincoln division, said is aimed in part at the Chinese market with its looming government mandates for electric vehicles. \nChinese buyers “may have their parents in the back seat and they deserve the same stature as children,” Falotico said. “The fact that it’s a comfortable ride is a very important feature.” Reporting By Nick Carey; editing by Diane Craft", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T23:24:38.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
