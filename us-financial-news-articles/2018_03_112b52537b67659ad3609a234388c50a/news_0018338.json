Old Navy placed flower installations on the female historical statutes—there are just five out of 150 in the city, in honor of International Women’s Day . Fearless Girl, the privately commissioned modern-day statute that appeared opposite the Wall Street Raging Bull on International Women’s Day 2017, was also included in the campaign and received a cape of flowers.\nThe remaining historical female statutes adorned with flowers include Gertrude Stein, Golda Meir, Harriet Tubman, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Joan of Arc. Old Navy, which has a leadership team that is 65% female, says the flower installations are meant to honor the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of these and all women around the world.\nFor #IWD2018 Old Navy decorated all the public statues of historical women in NYC (plus Fearless Girl). @OldNavy is led by a woman and its leadership team is 65% female. pic.twitter.com/2U9q30wLGa\n— Lindsey Rupp (@lcrupp) March 8, 2018\nOf course, there is a commercial angle to all of this as well. Old Navy says its “Flower Empower” installations are inspired by the colors and patterns of the brand’s floral spring dresses.\nOld Navy’s parent company, Gap , has made strides in its own workforce. Gap was the first Fortune 500 company to report equal pay for equal work in 2014.", "external_links": ["https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://t.co/2U9q30wLGa", "https://twitter.com/OldNavy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/IWD2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/lcrupp/status/971788857703305216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-03-09T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T21:30:01.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
