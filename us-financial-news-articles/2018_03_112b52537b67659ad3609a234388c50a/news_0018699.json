The deal is expected to close by the end of March 2018; terms were not disclosed.\nThe acquisition follows Neverware's October announcement of its Series B round of funding, which was raised to scale Neverware's sales and marketing efforts in the enterprise space while amplifying adoption of the CloudReady operating system already taking place in the global education market.
