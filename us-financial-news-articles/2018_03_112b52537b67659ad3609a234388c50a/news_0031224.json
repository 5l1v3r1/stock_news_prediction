Separately, the Board approved a cash dividend distribution to Shareholders of approximately NT$0.3 per common share or approximately NT$6 per ADS.\nUpon approval of the Shareholders and competent authority, each Shareholder will receive an amount calculated by approximately NT$1.8 per common share and each holder of ADS will receive an amount calculated by approximately NT$36 per ADS under the combined 2018 Capital Reduction Plan and separate cash dividend distribution.\nAs of today, ChipMOS has 886,297,061 shares issued.

While focusing on profitable revenue growth, margin stability, cash flow growth and building shareholder value, we have achieved considerable success. The 2018 Capital Reduction plan approved by our Board of Directors is the latest action to return capital to our shareholders as we have previously done through both dividends and other cash distributions.
