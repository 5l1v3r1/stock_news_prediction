He said the bill represented a compromise balancing concerns on both sides of the gun debate.\nFILE PHOTO - Florida Governor Rick Scott listens during a meeting with law enforcement, mental health, and education officials about how to prevent future tragedies in the wake of last week's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Florida, U.S., February 20, 2018.

REUTERS/Thom Baur/File Photo Among the most scrutinized measures of the new law is a provision allowing school staff to volunteer to be trained and armed as “guardians” against future gun violence, while giving local sheriffs and individual school districts the discretion of deciding whether to participate in the program. But legislators excluded most classroom teachers from taking part, a compromise aimed at earning the support of Democrats and Scott, who said he was opposed to arming teachers.\nCritics have said permitting school staff to carry firearms on the job only heightened the risks of gun violence, and posed a particular risk to minority students, who they said were more likely to be shot in the heat of a disciplinary situation or if mistaken as an intruder.\nScott said he remained dissatisfied with the guardian provisions as adopted in the bill but signed it nonetheless, saying it would enhance school safety overall.\n“I am glad, however, that the plan in this bill is not mandatory, which means it will be up to locally elected officials,” Scott said. “If counties don’t want to do this, they can simply say no.”\nReporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T22:31:35.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
