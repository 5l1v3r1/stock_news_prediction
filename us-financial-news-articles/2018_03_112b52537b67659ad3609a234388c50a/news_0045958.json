He said he was joking and I believe him,” Vettel told reporters on Sunday.\n“I think we are old enough, I don’t think we need to go on that sort of level. It’s fine as long as we joke with each other.\n“I think we share — all of us — a common passion and that makes us quite equal again.\n“We love racing and we try to do our best, once we’re in the car and beat all the others. I think in that regard, I don’t see why we shouldn’t get on with each other.”\nVettel’s win had echoes of last year’s race, when he re-entered from the pits in front of pole-sitter Hamilton and burned away to victory as the Briton battled traffic.\nLast year, however, Ferrari had a better car and the performance gap with Mercedes was far less glaring, added Vettel, making a sobering assessment of his team’s immediate prospects in the series.\n“I think last year we had more pace in relative terms. Last year, we were putting them under pressure,” said the four-times world champion.\n“At the moment we’re a bit worse off. If you look at the gaps the whole weekend and we’re not yet a true match.\n“Therefore at this point we know that we are not yet where we want to be because we want to be fastest.” (Editing by John O’Brien)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-25T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:18:05.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
