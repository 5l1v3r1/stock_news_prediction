The only president who also served as chief justice, Taft delivered this lively collection of lectures while teaching constitutional law at Yale. In the book, he attacks Theodore Roosevelt’s theory that the president was a “steward of the people” who could do anything that the Constitution or the laws didn’t specifically forbid. On the contrary, Taft insists, the president can only exercise those powers that the Constitution and the laws specifically allow. In addition to defending the Framers’ vision of a constitutionally constrained presidency against new populist threats, Taft offers an invaluable (and still relevant) primer on the constitutional scope of the president’s power to pardon, fire executive officers and make war without congressional approval. To top it off, he tells some good jokes on himself: When Taft informs a mother that her son can join West Point despite his physical shortcomings, she exclaims gratefully: “Mr. Secretary, you are not nearly so fat as they say you are.”\nConstitutional Government in the United States By Woodrow Wilson (1908)\n2. In 1885, Woodrow Wilson’s book “Congressional Government” criticized the Framers’ system of checks and balances and advocated instead a parliamentary system on the British model, in which the majority party would have complete power to legislate, with “no effort . . . to give the minority a share in law-making.” But the presidency of Grover Cleveland, who cast a record number of vetoes in his first term, changed Wilson’s mind and led him to reject the “Whig” view that the presidency was essentially a ministerial office designed to implement the will of Congress. In this 1908 revision, Wilson praised Alexander Hamilton, adding that the next president should be “a man . . . who has the personality and the initiative to enforce his views both upon the people and upon Congress.” Despite this transparent plug for his forthcoming presidential campaign, Wilson once again assailed the Madisonian separation of powers. “We must think less of checks and balances and more of coordinated power,” he concluded, “less of separation of functions and more of the synthesis of action.” His vision of the constitutionally unconstrained presidency didn’t end well.\nUntrodden Ground By Harold H. Bruff (2015)\n3. Harold H. Bruff makes clear how much the modern presidency has evolved from the Framers’ conception of the office as a ministerial check on the legislative supremacy of Congress. Presidents in the Founding era refused to exercise their implicit constitutional power to recommend legislation out of a fear of corrupting the legislators. The presidential veto, too, was dormant until Andrew Jackson made it the central weapon in his war against the Bank of the United States, which he claimed violated the Constitution. Mr. Bruff emphasizes how many of the struggles over presidential powers have focused on the president’s right to fire executive-branch officials, including the battle that culminated in the failed impeachment of Andrew Johnson for firing his secretary of war. In an opinion by Chief Justice Taft, the Supreme Court later held that the law restricting Johnson’s power was an unconstitutional restriction on the president’s ability to remove his subordinates. But during the Reagan administration, the court upheld Congress’s power to restrict the president from firing independent prosecutors, over the lone dissent of Justice Antonin Scalia. This question may be back before the court soon.\nThe Forgotten Presidents By Michael J. Gerhardt (2013)\n4. By focusing on presidents widely viewed as ineffective, such as Van Buren, Tyler, Arthur and Cleveland, Michael J. Gerhardt challenges the myth that, except for Lincoln and Jackson, 19th-century presidents were weak. On the contrary, he argues: Their “strong assertions of their prerogatives” alienated critical consistencies and often placed them on the losing side of history. Still, there is much to learn from the constitutional arguments of the forgotten presidents, including William Henry Harrison’s Whig view that the veto should be used to protect “the people from the effects of hasty legislation where their will has probably been disregarded or not well understood.” Although this view is the opposite of the modern conception of presidential power, Harrison was channeling Madison’s view that the role of the president is to promote thoughtful, reasoned deliberation over time.\nJames Madison : Writings Edited by Jack Rakove (1999)\n5. The Library of America’s collection of Madison’s writings is the best introduction to the Father of the Constitution’s limited conception of executive (as well as legislative and judicial) power. Madison repeatedly insisted that the Constitution created not a direct democracy but a representative republic and that large assemblies, such as the unchecked democracies in Greece and Rome, led inevitably to the rule of demagogues and the mob. Madison believed that the president should defer to the supremacy of Congress and that Congress should have a veto over hastily passed state laws, so as to give the people a chance for sober second thoughts. He thought also that the large size of the Republic would make it hard for factions to mobilize based on passion rather than reason and to elect demagogic leaders. Social media, the internet and the rise of other populist, balkanizing technologies are now calling Madison’s constitutional vision into question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-17T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T14:59:09.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
