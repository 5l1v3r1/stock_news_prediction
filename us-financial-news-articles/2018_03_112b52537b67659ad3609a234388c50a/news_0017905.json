(Nasdaq:CARA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pruritus and pain by selectively targeting peripheral kappa opioid receptors, today announced that the Company will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday, March 15, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET to report fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and provide a corporate update.\nTo participate in the conference call, please dial 855-445-2816 (domestic) or 484-756-4300 (international) and refer to conference ID 2689187. A live webcast of the call can be accessed under “Events and Presentations” in the News & Investors section of the Company’s website at www.CaraTherapeutics.com .\nAn archived webcast recording will be available on the Cara website beginning approximately two hours after the call.\nAbout Cara Therapeutics\nCara Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pruritus and pain by selectively targeting peripheral kappa opioid receptors (KORs). Cara is developing a novel and proprietary class of product candidates, led by CR845/difelikefalin, a first-in-class KOR agonist that targets the body's peripheral nervous system, as well as certain immune cells. In Phase 2 trials, KORSUVA TM (CR845/difelikefalin) injection has demonstrated statistically significant reductions in itch intensity and concomitant improvement in quality of life measures in hemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) and is currently being investigated in Phase 3 trials in hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP. Additionally, CR845/difelikefalin has demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe pain, without inducing many of the undesirable side effects typically associated with currently available opioid pain therapeutics.\nThe United Stated Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conditionally accepted KORSUVA™ as the trade name for difelikefalin injection. CR845/difelikefalin is an investigational drug product and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\nINVESTOR CONTACT:\nMichael Schaffzin\nStern Investor Relations\n212-362-1200\nmichael@sternir.com\nMEDIA CONTACT:\nAnnie Starr\n6 Degrees\n973-415-8838\nastarr@6degreespr.com\nSource:Cara Therapeutics, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZhahJ1F8I1Pu-Y4YsDwwWjCQwwDtAQfvATXZweZld35uSTIh_XXHxnV0hQ0o3f1whbdspapY-ZF8FEcLruN7iyxim3CD2qO8fSwO97AR9ug=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9792299c-7ce7-476e-93da-2260932611ba", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KixQIWIQBlt2vDm_gkB5bWE-eh0adDJ4y2n7D4-8XRiwewRHOJebVEgh8s-2NZO8hsS2pzKQNvOO_IOGGyURXJASgUftN70KDp0-T4r1nbQ=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fdIew6ayBh_wNrKn2U6bErSUJD_lP2aKewRd7TydIXZkyIzGVo2v-7WKY7KvUdk7RvJvyBfW-H1gKA1idJM4NA2_qFCJWH5FhL3A7NK6tbQ="], "published": "2018-03-09T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T03:25:17.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
