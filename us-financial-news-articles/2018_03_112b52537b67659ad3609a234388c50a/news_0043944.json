(NYSE: CRL) announced today that it has refinanced its existing $1.0 billion of revolving credit facility due 2021 with a new $1.55 billion revolving credit facility due 2023, and its existing $650.0 million of term loan facility due 2021 with a new $750.0 million term loan facility due 2023 (the “credit facilities”). In addition, Charles River also announced today that, subject to market conditions, it intends to offer $500 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 (the “notes”) in an unregistered offering.\nCharles River intends to use the net proceeds of the borrowings under the credit facilities to fund the cash consideration and other amounts payable, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness, for its previously announced acquisition of MPI Research, Inc., and to pay related fees and expenses.\nCharles River is issuing the notes as a strategic complement to our long-term capital structure, and intends to use the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to repay borrowings under the refinanced credit facilities.\nThe notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or under the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Unless they are registered, the notes may be offered only in transactions that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The notes will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the notes, nor shall there be any sale of the notes in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
