BJ's also offers digital coupons, same-day grocery pickup services and a mobile app.\nInstacart CFO Ravi Gupta told CNBC in February that the company just had its best year ever and the added competition from Amazon has given it \"tremendous momentum.\" He added that Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods served as a \"catalyst for the entire industry to suggest that e-commerce is for real and everyone needs an e-commerce solution.\"\nIn 2016, Instacart signed a five-year deal to be the exclusive delivery provider for most Whole Foods items. However, Amazon has been testing new delivery options, including tow-hour delivery to Amazon Prime customers in select U.S. cities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T20:15:27.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
