REUTERS/Benoit Tessier In what could be the start of a pushback against the agreed carbon emissions targets by the main ACEA European carmakers’ lobby, Tavares - who currently chairs the ACEA - said he would propose the new demands to its board this week. “I think it’s only logical that there should be commitments from governments,” Tavares told reporters at the Geneva auto show. The potential suspension of penalties if charging network rollouts fall short of targets is “to be discussed”, he added. In a newspaper interview last week, Tavares suggested carmakers should not be fined for non-compliance if the density of electric-car charging networks remained inadequate. The accelerating decline of diesel, long used by carmakers to boost fuel-efficiency, is undermining carmakers’ efforts to meet the looming CO2 goals and avoid big penalties.
