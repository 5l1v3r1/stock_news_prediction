Goldman Sachs analysts said in a Wednesday note that tariffs similar to those proposed by Trump have usually been associated with subsequent currency weakness.\n“We therefore see the latest news as an additional reason to remain cautious on the outlook for the broad dollar,” according to Goldman’s note.\nThe dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, fell 0.02 percent, with the euro up 0.06 percent to $1.241.\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.03 percent versus the greenback at 106.11 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3902, up 0.12 percent on the day.\nOIL, GOLD DROP Steel sector stocks rose sharply on Wall Street, but not enough to keep the major U.S. indexes afloat on lingering concern that a protracted trade war would weaken the U.S. and global economies.\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Losses on the S&P 500 were as deep as 1 percent at one point, but have ebbed and flowed as traders look for clues on the future of trade policy in the day’s headlines.\nEquities got a bid after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who favors strong tariffs, said in a Bloomberg interview he was not a candidate to replace Cohn.\n“The market sees him (Navarro) as a very protectionist type. If he’s not in the running, the market seems to like that,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\nJason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial in Utah, said that with Trump keeping a close eye on stock indexes, selling sparked by tariff and trade war talks could change the president’s mind.\n“Indeed, here is a president who judges his success by using the stock market as an important barometer for that. So if the market votes an overwhelming vote of no confidence on these tariffs, is there a chance that things change next week?”\nAn investor checks stock information on a mobile phone at a brokerage house in Shanghai, China February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song “I suspect that it’s still a fluid situation,” Ware said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 106.72 points, or 0.43 percent, to 24,777.4, the S&P 500 lost 5.46 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,722.66 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.36 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,386.37.\nEuropean car makers ended up 0.6 percent after dropping more than 1 percent on the risk of a hike in tariffs on exports to the United States.\nEmerging market stocks lost 0.45 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.56 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.77 percent.\nOil prices fell after U.S. government data showed an increase in inventories, with Washington’s plans for import tariffs weighing further on investor sentiment.\nU.S. crude fell 2.19 percent to $61.23 per barrel and Brent was last at $64.45, down 2.04 percent.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.8827 percent, from 2.877 percent late on Tuesday.\nThe 30-year bond last fell 10/32 in price to yield 3.1514 percent, from 3.136 percent late on Tuesday.\nSpot gold dropped 0.7 percent to $1,324.41 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.75 percent to $1,325.20.\nCopper lost 0.90 percent to $6,941.00 a tonne.\nAdditional reporting by Stephanie Kelly, Sinead Carew, Megan Davies and Kate Duguid; Editing by Bernadette Baum and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T04:27:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
