Here are his reasons.\n• From a technical perspective, there has been a notable divergence among the major averages during the recovery process in the wake of the early-February sell-off.\n• The Nasdaq Composite has managed to recapture its 50-day moving average, recently rallying to record highs. It is notable that the index is up over 10 percent in 2018, while just about 5 percent of its components are trading at 52-week highs.\n• Meanwhile, the chart of the Dow tells a different story. The 30-component index is now registering consecutive lower highs, subsequently violating its 50-day moving average.\n• Within the Dow, too, there are several extended stocks which appear ripe for a deeper pullback.\nBottom line: The extent to which the Dow and Nasdaq have recovered in the course of the last month is indicative of \"sloppy\" price action ahead, according to Piper Jaffray.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
