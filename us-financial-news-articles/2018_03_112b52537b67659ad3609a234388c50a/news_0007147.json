Full year 2017 diluted EPS increased 11% to $3.17 from $2.86 in 2016. The improvements reflect higher net income and the benefit of previous share repurchase activity.\nOperating Cash: Cash generated from operations decreased 13% to $26.7 million in Q4 2017, compared to $30.7 million in Q4 2016. Cash generated from operations decreased 8% to $76.8 million in 2017, compared to $83.7 million in 2016.\nOperating Income and Margins: Q4 2017 operating margins were 32%, a decrease over Q4 2016 margins of 35%. Operating income for Q4 2017 rose 20% to $33.1 million compared to $27.7 million in Q4 2016.\nFull year 2017 operating margins were at 31%. Operating income for 2017 rose 13% to $113.2 million as compared to $100.3 million in 2016.\nNet Income : Q4 2017 net income rose 8% to $26.6 million, compared to $24.6 million in Q4 2016.

Reflecting its repurchase activity, Ebix’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 31.7 million in Q4 2017 compared to 32.5 million in Q4 2016 and decreased to 31.7 million in 2017 compared to 32.9 million in 2016.\nQ1 & Q2 2018 Diluted Share Counts: Based on share repurchases completed to date, Ebix expects its diluted share count to be approximately 31.7 million in Q1 2018 and Q2 2018.\nDividend: Ebix paid its regularly quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share in Q4 2017 for a total cost of $2.4 million.\nEbix Chairman, and CEO Robin Raina said, “Our record 2017 results mark Ebix’s 18th consecutive year of revenue and EPS growth for the Company, supported by a strong finish to the year especially from EbixCash with record revenue and EPS in Q4 2017. With an annualized revenue run rate of $418 million, Ebix has a strong foundation from which to conquer new frontiers in terms of revenues, operating margins and EPS.”\nRobin added, “We started the year 2017 primarily as an insurance exchange, and have finished the year with a strong presence in the financial exchange sector also through our EbixCash brand in India. Ebix’s Q4 2017 performance did not include full quarter revenues from the recent acquisition of Paul merchant remittance assets, or include any revenues from the recent acquisition of Transcorp, and only a few hundred thousand of revenues from our e-governance division which typically has a quarterly run rate of $6 million. Notwithstanding these factors, Q4 2017 revenues from India operations and the EbixCash Financial Exchange translate to an annualized run rate of $127 million and $125 million respectively. Accordingly, we are encouraged by the momentum we have generated in these businesses in a short time.\n“We are also pleased to have achieved 32% operating margins in Q4 2017, especially considering that the quarter had many non-recurring acquisition related costs. Once we have fully implemented all our acquisition integration and efficiency related measures, we expect the margins to improve from this level.”\nRobin added, “We are in advance stages of review on several acquisition opportunities that have the potential to make material contributions to our 2018 results if we are able to complete these transactions on the contemplated terms. Also, we have executed a number of large new business contracts that are expected to start contributing to our top line in 2018. As a result of our strong business development activity and pipeline, combined with expected organic growth across the business, we believe Ebix is well positioned for another solid year in 2018.”\nSean Donaghy, Ebix’s CFO said “Ebix continues to produce robust operating cash flows, generating $26.7 million during Q4 of 2017 and $76.8 million during 2017. Our financial position remains strong with $89.5 million in aggregate cash, cash equivalents, and short-term cash deposit investments. Combined with available borrowing of $246 million under our syndicated bank facility, Ebix presently has access to approximately $331 million of capital to support continued organic and acquisitive growth as well as dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.”\nConference Call Details:\nCall Date/Time: Friday, March 2, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. EST\nCall Dial-In: +1-877-837-3909 or 1-973-409-9690; Call ID #1064759\nLive Audio Webcast: www.ebix.com/webcast\nAudio Replay URL: www.ebix.com/result_17_Q4 after 2:00 p.m. EST on Mar 2 nd\nAbout Ebix, Inc.\nWith 50+ offices across 5 continents, Ebix, Inc., (NASDAQ: EBIX) endeavors to provide On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the insurance, financial and healthcare industries.
