Yes, fares usually include all meals, but so-called specialty restaurants often impose a cover fee. Dozens of other onboard offerings, from sun-deck cabanas and golf simulators to Chiantis and cappuccinos typically cost extra. “People don’t like to be nickel-and-dimed,” said Torstein Hagen, chairman of Viking Cruises. “It’s just cheating.” In a backlash against this pricing scheme, a flotilla of cruise lines has embraced the more inclusive model that’s standard on riverboats and super luxury liners, but rarely found among the upper-middle class of vessels—until now. These aren’t bargain boats, but they spare cruisers a sticker-shock denouement. The fringe benefits included in the fare vary widely from line to line. Here’s a peek at the perks:\nAzamara Club Cruises Launching its third ship, Pursuit, this August, Azamara prides itself on staying relatively small and nimble. Vessels accommodate 694 passengers each and tend to stay in port longer than the big-ship drive-bys.\nWhat’s Included All beer, wine, all nonalcoholic beverages and some spirits, plus room service, self-service laundry, shuttle service to and from the port and the city center (where available) and one shore excursion per person on trips that are longer than seven days, excluding the trans-Atlantic crossings.\nWhat Isn’t Meals at the specialty restaurants—one the fancy Italian Aqualina, the other a steakhouse—cost $30 per person no matter what you order; port fees.\nSample Sailing An 11-day trip from Miami to Lima in a stateroom with balcony, $4,499 per person.\nCrystal Cruises With two medium sized cruise ships (848 and 980 passengers) and one 62-passenger yacht, Crystal is pricier than the others listed here but packs big-boat amenities and activities into smaller luxury specs. Chef Nobu Matsuhisa consults on some menus.\nWhat’s Included One meal at each of the specialty restaurants, all beverages, room service, Wi-Fi and gratuities. Fitness classes are also complimentary so you can do yoga, Pilates and “chi-energizing” to your cardio’s content.\nWhat Isn’t Port fees, which can add hundreds of dollars per person to each fare.\nSample Sailing A 10-day round trip to Montreal through the Gulf of St. Lawrence in a stateroom with balcony on the newly upgraded Symphony, $7,850 per person.\nPonant This French cruise line is very French, from the Veuve Clicquot to la gastronomie, and sails 10 small, stylish expedition ships: one masted sailboat, an icebreaker and eight cruising yachts. The biggest ships accommodate 264 passengers.\nWhat’s Included Room service, open bar, port fees, and on select itineraries, airfare and shore excursions.\nWhat Isn’t Super premium wines and spirits\nSample Sailing An 8-day trip from Panama to Martinique in a stateroom with balcony, $4,606 per person.\nThe Viking Sun in Hong Kong Sea Cloud Cruises The dramatically masted 64-passenger Sea Cloud, built in 1931 for heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, is a throwback to old-world sailing to lesser known ports in Europe and the Caribbean. The company also sails a slightly larger windjammer, the 94-passenger Sea Cloud II.\nWhat’s Included Wine and beer with lunch and dinner, all nonalcoholic beverages, gratuities (as of 2019), a bottle of Champagne in cabin, daily fresh fruit in your cabin, port fees, use of onboard laptop to send emails, and access to water sport equipment.\nWhat Isn’t Drinks at the bar.\nSample Sailing A 10-day sail from Bilbao to Lisbon, from $3,955 per person.\nViking Ocean Cruises Inaugurated in 2015, the four-ship fleet (930 passengers on each) is new.

Windstar Cruises The biggest of Windstar’s three sailing yachts and three cruise ships hold 310 passengers. Zodiac excursions, James Beard Foundation chefs on some journeys and scholarly lecturers add up to active, elegant trips.\nWhat’s Included Room service, nonalcoholic beverages, use of water sports equipment and, on select itineraries, evening events—like a white-glove dinner and concert at the ruins of Ephesus, Turkey.\nWhat Isn’t Port fees.\nSample Sailing A 10-day journey from Copenhagen to Stockholm in a balcony suite, $5,589 per person.\n​Silversea Cruises With a fleet of nine ships—four expedition vessels and five cruisers with a maximum capacity of 608 passengers—Silversea just re-launched Silver Spirit after stretching it to enlarge the pool and public spaces and adding a restaurant for a total of eight.\nWhat’s Included Butler service; drinks, including wine and spirits; room service, gratuities, excursions on expedition cruises and on some itineraries, airfare.\nWhat Isn’t Cover chargers for some of the specialty restaurants, ranging from $40 to $60 a person.\nSample Sailing: An 11-day trip from Barbados in a balcony suite is $4,410 per person.\nMore in Off Duty Travel\nWhy Bogotá Is Now on Ambitious Travelers’ Agendas March 22, 2018 Antarctica Ahoy: 6 Tips on Cruising to the End of the Earth March 21, 2018 The Secret Spas of Paris March 13, 2018 Why Even Control Freaks Are Opting for ‘Surprise Vacations’ March 8, 2018 How to Spend an Indulgent Day in Rome for $2,000—or $400 March 7, 2018", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T02:25:09.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
