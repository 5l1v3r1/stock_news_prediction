It’s a beautiful day here today, we hope a helicopter comes.”\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it released $221,000 in funds to help relief efforts and would send first aid, water, mosquito nets and shelters, to the region.\nAustralia has also promised aid and sent a C-130 military plane to help with aerial surveys.\nMiners and oil and gas companies were also assessing damage to their infrastructure, including a 700-km (435-mile) gas pipeline that connects to a coastal liquefaction plant, which ExxonMobil Corp on Thursday said was not damaged.\nEarthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific Ocean’s“Ring of Fire,” a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.
