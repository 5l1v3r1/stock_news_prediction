(\"Cemex\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: CX) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Cemex American Depositary Receipts (\"ADRs\") between August 14, 2014 and March 13, 2018, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/cx .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Cemex executives had engaged in an unlawful bribery scheme in connection with the Company's business dealings in Colombia; (2) discovery of the foregoing conduct would likely subject the Company to heightened regulatory scrutiny and potential criminal sanctions; (3) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting; and (4) as a result, Cemex's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn September 23, 2016, post-market, Cemex disclosed the Company's dismissal of two senior executives after an internal probe found that payments worth $20 million relating to a land deal in Colombia had breached company protocols. On this news, Cemex's American depositary receipt (\"ADR\") price fell $0.17, or 2.28%, to close at $7.26 on September 26, 2016. On December 9, 2016, Cemex disclosed receipt of a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeking information about irregular payments made at the Company's Colombia unit. Then, on March 14, 2018, Cemex disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the Company over payments made by the Company related to a cement plant it is building in Colombia to determine whether any violations of federal bribery laws occurred. On this news, Cemex's ADR price fell $0.12, or 1.64%, to close at $7.21 on March 14, 2018.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
