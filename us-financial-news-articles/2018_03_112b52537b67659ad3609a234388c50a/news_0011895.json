Dines said it eventually dawned on him that “Wow, this is a huge market”.\nREGIONAL STAND-OUT\nThe region’s start-up scene was stillborn until recently, failing to rank among Europe’s top dozen countries for investment or to rival decades-old tech hub Israel. ( reut.rs/2D0p1T7 )\nThe funding round represents nearly one-fifth of the 683 million euros in venture financing in Central and Eastern Europe during the whole of 2017, according to data from venture tracking research firm Dealroom.co. Accel partner Lucian Lixandru said developers-turned-entrepreneurs over the last two years have begun building their own products instead of contracting out to other firms.\n“UiPath is definitely going to put the region on the map for investors,” Lixandru, a native of Romania now based in London, told Reuters in a phone interview.\nThe latest investment will be used to integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms into customers’ digital business operations. The funds will also help expand offices across Europe, the United States and Asia, UiPath said.\nThe company counts 120,000 developers who use its software to automate routine business tasks, often within widely used SAP or Oracle business systems. It is working with Google to develop its AI capabilities and CapitalG’s investment reinforces those ties, Dines said.\nLast year, the 590-employee company moved its headquarters to New York to be closer to its growing international corporate base, which rose to 700 customers from 100 in 2016. Its strongest markets are the United and Japan, Dines said.\nRecurring annual revenue grew eight-fold last year and is now in the $50-$100 million range, he said.\nReporting by Eric Auchard; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T15:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T16:02:13.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
