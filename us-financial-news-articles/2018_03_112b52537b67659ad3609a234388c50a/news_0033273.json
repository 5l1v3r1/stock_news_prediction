Our Investment Banking results reflect a good new-issue equity and debt environment, and another strong quarter in mergers and acquisitions. Fixed Income revenues were a strong $213 million and relatively consistent across the quarter. Our Equities revenues were $156 million. Activity in December and January was strong. Volumes during the first half of February were more muted in a period of increased volatility following a sell-off in the global equity markets. Equity secondary activities have subsequently returned to levels experienced in the first two months of our fiscal year. Our pre-tax income for the first quarter was $123 million and, ignoring the provisional tax charge, we would have reported adjusted net earnings of $103 million¹.”\nWe incurred a provisional tax charge of $164 million during the quarter as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). Of this amount, $108 million relates to the non-cash write down of our deferred tax asset, reflecting the impact of a lower federal tax rate of 21% on our deferred tax items. The remaining part of the provisional charge relates to a toll charge on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. Excluding this charge plus an unrelated net tax benefit of $13 million during this quarter, which was derived from the resolution of various historic Federal, state and local items, our adjusted effective tax rate would have been approximately 27%¹. Notwithstanding the $164 million charge this quarter, we expect to benefit from a lower U.S. federal corporate tax going forward. Excluding the impact of discrete items and assuming the same mix of pre-tax profits by tax jurisdiction, we would expect our effective tax rate to be about 27% going forward, reflecting the benefit of the lower federal tax rate of 21%. The comparable adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 36% 1 (which excludes the benefit of $32 million we realized from the repatriation of earnings and associated foreign tax credits from foreign subsidiaries, which occurred during last year’s first quarter).\nOn December 1, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASU 2014-9” or the “new revenue standard”), which provides accounting guidance on the recognition of revenues from contracts with customers and impacts the presentation of certain revenues and expenses on our income statement. The new revenue standard is applied prospectively from December 1, 2017 and there is no impact on our previously presented results. For further information on the impact of ASU 2014-9, refer to Appendix A attached to this release.\nWith our adoption of ASU 2014-9, Investment Banking revenues are no longer presented net of the related out- of-pocket deal expenses. As a result, each of our Investment Banking net revenues and Total non-compensation expenses is higher in the first quarter by an identical $32 million, with no net change to our bottom line. We have also made changes and reclassifications to the presentation of our “Revenues by Source” statement on page 5 to better align the manner in which we describe and present the results of our performance. These changes are reflected in our results for the three months ended February 28, 2018 and historical results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation on a comparable basis. For further information on these changes, refer to Appendix B attached to this release.\nThe attached financial tables should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2017. Amounts herein pertaining to February 28, 2018 represent a preliminary estimate as of the date of this earnings release and may be revised in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nThis release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

It is possible that the actual results may differ materially from the anticipated results indicated in these forward-looking statements.

Management believes such measures for the first quarter of 2018 provide meaningful information to investors as they enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results excluding the impact of the provisional tax charge resulting from the Tax Act. In addition, the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 excludes an unrelated net benefit, which was derived from the resolution of various historic Federal, state and local items. Management believes such measure for fiscal 2017 provides meaningful information to investors as they enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results excluding the impact of the repatriation of earnings and associated foreign tax credits from foreign subsidiaries, which occurred during last year’s first quarter.

There is no impact on total revenue as a result of these reclassifications. Refer to Appendix B attached to this release for further detail. (2) Additionally, we have reorganized the presentation of our gains and losses generated from our capital invested in asset management funds managed by us and related parties. This was previously presented as Asset management: Investment income (loss) from investments in managed funds and is now presented within Principal transactions revenues. (3) As a result of the new revenue standard, Investment banking revenues and Total non-compensation expenses for the three months ended February 28, 2018 reflect changes to the presentation of investment banking expenses and reimbursements thereof. This change in presentation resulted in an identical increase of $32.5 million in each of Investment banking net revenues and Total non-compensation expenses during the three months ended February 28, 2018. Refer to Appendix A attached to this release for further details. (4) The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2018 includes a provisional tax charge of $164 million as a result of the Tax Act. The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2017 reflected a $32 million, or 26%, net tax benefit, which resulted from the repatriation of earnings, along with their associated foreign tax credits, from certain foreign subsidiaries.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (Amounts in Thousands, except where noted) (Unaudited) Quarter Ended February 28, 2018 GAAP Adjustments Adjusted Net earnings (loss) $ (60,819 ) $163,655 $ 102,836 Effective tax rate 149.6 % (123.1 )% 26.5 % Twelve Months Ended November 30, 2017 GAAP Adjustments Adjusted Effective tax rate 29.2 % 6.3 % 35.5 % This presentation of Adjusted financial information is an unaudited non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted financial information begins with information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and then those results are adjusted to exclude the provisional tax charge of $164 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act in the first quarter of 2018. In addition, the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 excludes an unrelated net benefit of $13 million during this quarter, which was derived from the resolution of various historic Federal, state and local items. The adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 begins with information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and then those results are adjusted to exclude the benefit of $32 million that we realized from the repatriation of earnings and associated foreign tax credits from foreign subsidiaries, which occurred during last year’s first quarter. The Company believes that the disclosed Adjusted measures and any adjustments thereto, when presented in conjunction with comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are useful to investors as they enable investors to evaluate the Company's results excluding the impact of the provisional tax charge as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, the resolution of various historic Federal, state and local items and the repatriation of earnings and associated foreign tax credits from foreign subsidiaries. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION (Amounts in Thousands, Except Other Data) (Unaudited) Quarter Ended February 28, 2018 November 30, 2017 (1) February 28, 2017 (1) Net Revenues by Source\nEquities $ 155,777 $ 181,055 $ 155,997 Fixed income 213,053 101,169 221,034 Total sales and trading 368,830 282,224 377,031 Equity (2) 79,840 122,424 61,566 Debt (2) 168,994 174,484 162,628 Capital markets 248,834 296,908 224,194 Advisory (2) 191,157 231,791 183,827 Other investment banking (6,218 ) 12,339 3,799 Total investment banking 433,773 541,038 411,820 Other 9,798 1,548 (6,200 ) Total Capital Markets 812,401 824,810 782,651 Asset management fees 4,930 4,122 6,807 Investment return 3,915 (6,322 ) 6,055 Total Asset Management 8,845 (2,200 ) 12,862 Net revenues $ 821,246 $ 822,610 $ 795,513 Other Data\nNumber of trading days 60 63 60 Number of trading loss days 7 5 3 Average firmwide VaR (in millions) (3) $ 6.30 $ 5.29 $ 10.30 (1) The presentation of our \"Revenue by Source\" for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and February 28, 2017 has been reclassified from that previously reported to conform with changes in the manner in which we describe and present the results of our performance as of the first quarter of 2018.

(2) At February 28, 2018, other sources of liquidity include high quality sovereign government securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities and other high quality sovereign government securities of $930 million, in aggregate, and $388 million, being the estimated amount of additional secured financing that could be reasonably expected to be obtained from our financial instruments that are currently not pledged after considering reasonable financing haircuts. The corresponding amounts included in other sources of liquidity at November 30, 2017 were $1,031 million and $514 million, respectively, and at February 28, 2017, were $1,308 million and $498 million, respectively. (3) Tangible Jefferies Group LLC member's equity (a non-GAAP financial measure) represents total Jefferies Group LLC member's equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that tangible Jefferies Group LLC member's equity is meaningful for valuation purposes, as financial companies are often measured as a multiple of tangible equity, making these ratios meaningful for investors. (4) Level 3 financial instruments represent those financial instruments classified as such under Accounting Standards Codification 820, accounted for at fair value and included within Financial instruments owned. (5) At February 28, 2018, November 30, 2017 and February 28, 2017, total long-term capital includes our long-term debt of $6,492 million, $5,403 million and $5,915 million, respectively, and total equity. Long-term debt included in total long-term capital is reduced by the amount of debt maturing in less than one year, as applicable. (6) Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total equity. (7) Tangible gross leverage ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) equals total assets less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets divided by tangible Jefferies Group LLC member's equity. The tangible gross leverage ratio is used by rating agencies in assessing our leverage ratio. (8) VaR estimates the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. For a further discussion of the calculation of VaR, see \"Value-at-Risk\" in Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2017. (9) On December 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2014-9, which resulted in a reduction of beginning Member's paid in capital of $6.1 million after-tax. Refer to Appendix A attached to this release for further information.\nAPPENDIX A\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES IMPACT OF ADOPTING REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE (Unaudited) The adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in a reduction of beginning Member’s paid in capital of $6.1 million after-tax as a cumulative effect of adoption of an accounting change. The impact of adoption is primarily related to 1) investment banking expenses that were deferred as of November 30, 2017 under the previously existing accounting guidance, which would have been expensed in prior periods under the new revenue standard and 2) investment banking revenues that were previously recognized in prior periods, which would have been deferred as of November 30, 2017 under the new revenue standard.\nThe new revenue standard is applied prospectively in our consolidated financial statements from December 1, 2017 and reported financial information for historical comparable periods have not been revised. The new revenue guidance does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including loans and securities, and as a result, did not have an impact on the elements of our Consolidated Statements of Earnings most closely associated with financial instruments, including Principal transaction revenues, Interest income and Interest expense.\nThere is no significant impact as a result of applying the new revenue standard to our results of operations for the first quarter of 2018, except as it relates to the presentation of certain investment banking expenses. Investment banking revenues have historically been recorded net of related out-of-pocket deal expenses directly related to investment banking engagements. Under the new revenue standard, all investment banking expenses are recognized within their respective expense category on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and any expense reimbursements are recognized as Investment banking revenues (i.e., revenues are no longer presented net of the related out-of-pocket deal expenses). Expenses directly associated with underwriting activities are recorded to a new non-compensation expense line item: \"Underwriting costs\". The impact of this change in presentation on the first quarter of 2018 results was an increase in both Investment banking revenues and Total non-compensation expenses of $32.5 million. This change in presentation has no impact on Net earnings (loss).\nThe following table reflects certain revenues and expenses for our first quarter of 2018 adjusted for the impact of the change in presentation related to investment banking expenses and reimbursements as result of our adoption of the new revenue standard - a non-GAAP measure - and the actual amounts reported for these line items in the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2017 (amounts in thousands):\nQuarter Ended Non-GAAP\nRevenues and\nExpenses\nFebruary 28, 2018 November 30, 2017 February 28, 2017 Investment banking $ 407,506 $ 528,699 $ 408,021 Net revenues 788,761 822,610 795,513 Technology and communications 68,974 73,817 65,507 Business development 24,864 27,661 22,632 Professional services 29,697 31,167 32,124 Other expenses 18,445 25,200 19,206 Total non-compensation expenses 210,390 224,861 211,142\nThe Non-GAAP revenues and expenses for the first quarter of 2018 are considered non-GAAP financial measures, which management believes provide meaningful information to enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results in comparison to the fourth and first quarters of 2017. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table is a reconciliation of the respective U.S. GAAP financial measures to the Non-GAAP financial measures of revenues and expenses adjusted for the impact of the change in presentation related to investment banking expenses as result of our adoption of the new revenues standard (amounts in thousands):\nQuarter Ended February 28, 2018 GAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP\nRevenues and\nExpenses\nInvestment banking $ 439,991 $ 32,485 $ 407,506 Net revenues 821,246 32,485 788,761 Underwriting costs 14,275 14,275 — Technology and communications 69,077 103 68,974 Business development 42,107 17,243 24,864 Professional services 30,408 711 29,697 Other expenses 18,598 153 18,445 Total non-compensation expenses 242,875 32,485 210,390 The adjustments above represent expenses directly associated with underwriting and mergers and acquisitions, restructuring and other investment banking advisory assignments.\nAPPENDIX B\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES REVENUES BY SOURCE PRESENTATION (Unaudited) In connection with the adoption of the new revenue standard in the first quarter of 2018, we have made changes to the presentation of our “Revenues by Source” to better align the manner in which we describe and present the results of our performance with the manner in which we manage our business activities and serve our clients. We believe that the reorganization of our revenue reporting will enable us to describe our business mix more clearly and provide greater transparency in the communication of our results.\nThe “Results of our Operations” has historically been presented on a product basis. Prior to the first quarter of 2018, we presented “Revenues by Source” as follows: Equities, Fixed Income, Investment Banking and Asset Management. As of the first quarter of 2018, we are reporting our \"Revenues by Source\" along the following business lines: Equities, Fixed Income, Investment Banking, Asset Management and Other. Additionally, the results of the Investment Banking business now include a new subcategory “Other”, which contains our share of net earnings from our corporate lending joint venture, Jefferies Finance LLC, as well as any gains and losses from any securities or loans received or acquired in connection with our investment banking efforts. Previously reported results beginning with fiscal 2016 are presented on a comparable basis in the following table.\nThe following is a description of the changes that have been made:\nEquities revenues now represent the activities of our core equities sales and trading, securities finance, prime brokerage and wealth management businesses. Revenues from other activities previously presented within our Equities business have been disaggregated as follows: Our share of net earnings from our Jefferies Finance LLC joint venture, as well as any revenues from securities and loans received or acquired in connection with our investment banking efforts, are now presented as part of our Investment Banking business. Our share of net earnings from our historic Jefferies LoanCore LLC joint venture¹ is presented as part of our Fixed Income business through its sale in October 2017. Revenues related to our principal investments in certain private equity funds and hedge funds managed by third parties or related parties, investments in strategic ventures (including KCG²), certain other securities owned, and investments held as part of obligations under employee benefit plans, including deferred compensation arrangements, are now presented as part of our Other business. Revenue related to our capital invested in asset management funds that are managed by us is now presented within our Asset Management business. Revenues from our legacy Futures business and revenues associated with structured notes issued by us are now presented as part of our Other business. Additionally, revenues derived from securities or loans received or acquired in connection with our investment banking efforts are now presented as part of our Investment Banking revenues. Revenues from principal investments in certain private equity and asset management funds managed by related parties, which were previously presented within our Asset Management revenues, are now presented as part of our Other business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T14:21:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
