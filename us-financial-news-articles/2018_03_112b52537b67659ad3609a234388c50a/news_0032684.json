U.S. President Donald Trump announces a presidential proclamation placing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports while surrounded by workers from the steel and aluminum industries at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 8, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis The draft Federal Register notice, which is expected to be published later on Friday evening and was seen by Reuters, outlines procedures for companies to seek such exclusions. The review period for such requests “normally will not exceed 90 days, including adjudication of objections submitted on exclusion requests,” it said. The exclusion rules have been anxiously awaited by manufacturing companies since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on March 7 to protect domestic steel and aluminium producers on national security grounds. U.S. allies, however, remain in the dark about country-specific exemptions. But steel- and aluminium-consuming industries that must import products, such as the high-strength steel rod used to make tire belts, may end up paying tariffs for a considerable period before being granted an exclusion. The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol is expected to begin collecting the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium at 12:01 a.m. (0401 GMT) on March 23. “The request should clearly identify, and provide support for, the basis upon which the exclusion is sought,” the Commerce Department said in the notice. “An exclusion will only be granted if an article is not produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount, is not produced in the United States in a satisfactory quality, or for a specific national security consideration.” Reporting by David Lawder; editing by Diane Craft and Leslie Adler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-17T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-17T02:17:55.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
