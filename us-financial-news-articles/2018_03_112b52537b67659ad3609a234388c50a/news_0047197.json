The page has since been deleted.\nGerman authorities have sought to crack down on attacks against immigrants which have increased since the influx of over a million mostly Muslim migrants beginning in 2015.\nThere were more than 2,000 attacks against migrants in 2017, ranging from physical assault to serious property damage, the German interior ministry said in February. It was not clear how many of the attacks involved weapons.\nReporting By Riham Alkousaa; Editing by Andrea Shalal and Robin Pomeroy\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
