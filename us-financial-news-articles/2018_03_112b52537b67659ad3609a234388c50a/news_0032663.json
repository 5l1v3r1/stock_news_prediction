Clinical verification studies are underway, and we anticipate beginning clinical trials in the second quarter in support of a 510(k) filing for clinical use of the test with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year.”\nMr. Jones continued, “Earlier this week, we announced a collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston on a clinical verification study for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 test and Acuitas Lighthouse Software. This prospective verification study is among the first to evaluate potential diagnostic and antibiotic decision-making improvements that could be possible using rapid molecular testing and bioinformatics.\n“During the fourth quarter we were awarded a one-year, $860,000 contract from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop smartphone-based clinical decision support solutions for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and infection control in low- and middle-income countries. Our work with partners ILÚM Health Solutions, LLC, created by Merck’s Healthcare Services and Solutions (HSS) division, and Universidad El Bosque, in Colombia is ongoing.”\n2017 Fourth Quarter and Year-end Financial Results\nRevenue : Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.0 million, compared with $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.
