It’s been planned for several weeks,” a Commission official said on Thursday.\nBut U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign on Thursday or Friday a proclamation to establish tariffs on steel and aluminium imports..\nThe commission official said Saturday now offered “the big opportunity” to broach the issue “and to have a frank talk with Lighthizer about what’s been going on on their side and to reiterate what the counter-measures from us would be.”\nThe EU has said that global import tariffs are not the right answer to the sector’s problems, which it says are mainly down to overcapacity.\n“It’s changed the circumstances of that meeting quite significantly of course since it was scheduled... The way forward for this trilateral cooperation has been in doubt given the last week’s developments,” the official added.
