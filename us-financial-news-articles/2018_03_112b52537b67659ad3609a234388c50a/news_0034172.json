Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to clients Monday. \"We recognize the potential for ongoing negative news flow, but Facebook shares currently trade at 18.5x 2019E GAAP EPS, and we would be adding on the pullback.\" \nFacebook announced in a blog post Friday night that the company had suspended political analytics research firm Cambridge Analytica from its platform, suggesting it had not been honest about deleting user data sent to it by the makers of a popular psychology test app. The New York Times reported the data firm was able to acquire 50 million people's Facebook profile information without their consent. \nFacebook stock plunged 6.8 percent Monday as investors digested the weekend reports. Its shares fell another 2.56 percent Tuesday. \nBut analysts believe the company's stock price is already discounting any potential risks. \nDeutsche Bank reiterated its buy rating and $235 price target for Facebook shares, citing the company's inexpensive valuation. \n\"We see a large distance between the current issues / investigations and any legislation that would curb Facebook's ad targeting in a meaningful way,\" analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note to clients Monday. \"We see the valuation as extremely compelling despite the increased risks.\" \nMost other analysts had similar sentiments. \nOne analyst from a small financial firm headquartered in Australia did reduce his price target for Facebook shares, but only slightly. \n\"We are very much concerned that the systemic risk around data-driven online advertising and specific concerns about FB's data are rising quickly,\" Macquarie Research analyst Benjamin Schachter wrote in a note to clients Monday. \"The bottom line is that these headlines matter. The political/regulatory/legal risks are rising.\" \nSchachter reiterated his outperform rating and lowered his share forecast for Facebook to $200 from $205, representing 16 percent upside to Monday's close. \nFacebook stock has outperformed the market over the past year. Its shares rallied 23 percent in the past 12 months through Monday versus the S&P 500's 14 percent gain, but is now down 12 percent from its early February high. \nFacebook declined to comment for this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T15:11:17.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
