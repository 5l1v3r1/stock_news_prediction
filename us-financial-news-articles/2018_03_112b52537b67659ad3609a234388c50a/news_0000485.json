If the direction of monetary policy is changed without deep consideration to this situation, there’s a risk Japan may return to deflation.”\nBOND-BUYING PLEDGE INTACT\nKataoka’s comments run counter to many others in the board, who have signaled the BOJ’s next step should be to dial back stimulus given the rising cost of prolonged easing.\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told parliament on Thursday that inflation expectations were “heightening somewhat,” signaling hope a strengthening recovery will push up inflation.\nBut he conceded that wage and price growth remained disappointingly low, reflecting Japan’s sticky deflationary mindset and underscoring market views the BOJ will maintain its stimulus program for the time being.\nWhile Kataoka is unlikely to garner enough votes to affect BOJ decisions, his views underscore the dilemma the bank faces in seeking to achieve its elusive price target with a dwindling policy tool-kit.\nHis views may carry more weight with the joining of a like-minded academic Masazumi Wakatabe, known as a vocal advocate of aggressive easing, as BOJ deputy governor in March.\nAfter three years of heavy money printing failed to fire up inflation, the BOJ revamped its policy framework in 2016 to one targeting interest rates instead of the pace of asset buying.\nUnder the current policy, the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent.\nThe central bank also has a loose pledge to buy government bonds so its holdings increase at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($749 billion). But the pledge has become obsolete with actual purchases slowing to roughly 50 trillion yen per year, which some analysts have described as “stealth easing”.\nKataoka said the bond-buying pledge was “merely a reference” now with the BOJ’s policy targeting interest rates.\n“But we could face various circumstances, so I don’t see a need to remove the pledge now,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Chris Gallagher and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T04:10:08.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
