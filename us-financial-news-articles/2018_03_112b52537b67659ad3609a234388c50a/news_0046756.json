I’m sure it’s been interpreted a billion times. So this is my version of it.”\nThe Odyssey is not the only literary classic that LaForge is interested in adapting. Inspired by his time in Britain, he also hopes to tackle Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales”.\n“The Odyssey,” runs at London’s Jealous Gallery until April 10.\nReporting by Lisa Keddie; Writing by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T06:56:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
