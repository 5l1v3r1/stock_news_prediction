Brent crude prices were trading at $63.99 on Friday.\nWan Zulkiflee said industry wide costs are showing signs of increasing, driven by what he called“premature exuberance” over the oil price recovery.\n“It is imperative we do not drop the austerity mindset, and continue to ensure we keep costs under control, increase efficiency and drive up value,” he said.\nHIGHER SPENDING Petronas, a major contributor to Malaysia’s budget and one of the country’s biggest employers, embarked on a cost cutting drive after Wan Zulkiflee’s appointment as CEO in early 2015.\nThe company said in 2016 that it would reduce expenses by $12 billion over a four-year period, and has cut thousands of jobs and its dividend payout to its sole shareholder, the Malaysian government.\nControllable costs for 2017 fell 6 percent to 45.9 billion ringgit, Petronas said.\nFor 2018, the company said it planned capital expenditure of around 55 billion ringgit, higher than last year’s 44.5 billion ringgit.\nIt will also increase its dividend to the government this year to 19 billion ringgit, from 16 billion ringgit last year.\nTotal production volume - the sum of Malaysia’s oil and gas output and Petronas’ international output - fell 2 percent to 2.32 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, while sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG) rose two percent to 30.7 million tonnes.\n$1 = 3.9140 ringgit Reporting by A.
