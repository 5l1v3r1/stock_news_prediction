REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri Museveni, who has been in power for 32 years, frequently replaces ministers and other top government officials without publicly giving explanations.\nIn the tweet, Museveni said he had appointed Elly Tumwine, a non-active general in the military as the new security minister, replacing Henry Tumukunde.\nHe also named Okoth Ochola as the new chief of police, replacing Kale Kayihura.\nMedia has reported on a simmering feud between the two sacked officials who fought alongside Museveni in a five-year guerrilla war that brought him to power in 1986.\nKayihura was a target of widespread public anger for failing to stem a wave of crime.\nHe has also attracted significant public censure for a police crackdown on opposition activists, often breaking up rallies with teargas, beatings and detentions.\nReporting by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T08:02:17.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
