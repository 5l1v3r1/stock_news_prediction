Oklahoma secondary school teachers had an annual mean wage of $42,460 as of May 2016, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nIn neighboring Texas, teachers earned about 30 percent more, according to Bureau of Labor figures.\nThe Oklahoma union had set an April 23 deadline for the Republican-controlled legislature to act, but moved that date up at the request of its 40,000 members.\n“The anger and frustration caused by the inaction of the Oklahoma legislature is palpable,” Priest said.\nReporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T09:55:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
