It underscored that Thursday, announcing Jon Favreau would serve as writer and executive producer of the service’s upcoming live-action series based on the films.\nFavreau and Disney have a rich history together. He served as director of Iron Man , the film that both set the tone and began cultivating the audience for future Disney Marvel movies , including The Avengers . Those films have gone on to become a multi-billion dollar franchise for the company.\nFavreau also directed and produced the live-action film adaptation of The Jungle Book and is currently working on a live-action production of The Lion King .\n“I couldn’t be more excited about Jon coming on board to produce and write for the new direct-to-consumer platform,” said Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy in a statement . “Jon brings the perfect mix of producing and writing talent, combined with a fluency in the Star Wars universe. This series will allow Jon the chance to work with a diverse group of writers and directors and give Lucasfilm the opportunity to build a robust talent base.”\nThe still-untitled Star Wars live-action series does not yet have a release date. The streaming service is expected to launch by the end of 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T19:44:40.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
