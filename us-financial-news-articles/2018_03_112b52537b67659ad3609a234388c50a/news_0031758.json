When Ms. Turcke was promoted, it “seemed like a natural breaking point,” Ms. Hudson said. “She deserves someone who will be in it for the long-term with her. That wasn’t going to be me.”\n“Dawn provided refreshing insights and perspectives on how to portray our game, players and the special bond fans have with the NFL,” said an NFL spokesman in an emailed statement. “The league’s multi-platform campaigns have further deepened the connection with fans throughout the year, culminating with exciting and engaging Super Bowl messages. We wish her well in her future endeavors.”\nMs. Hudson spent the last four years helping the league tackle various crises, from accusations of domestic abuse involving players to studies linking football with long-term brain injuries. The league has also been grappling with backlash surrounding players kneeling during the national anthem as a form of protest and two straight seasons of declining ratings.\nThe NFL will conduct a search internally and externally to replace Ms. Hudson.\nIt’s a hectic job with a lot of travel, and no shortage of challenges, said Ms. Hudson. Through various communications and ad efforts, she tried to use the NFL’s reach to shed light on the larger issue of domestic violence, which she described as “a bit of a closet subject people didn’t talk about.”\nMs. Hudson wasn’t always putting out fires. She was also behind various campaigns meant to bring “humanity” to the NFL brand. Among the heartwarming ads were “ Super Bowl Babies ,” a humorous spot that shows babies dressed up as football legends, and “ Inside These Lines ,” an ad promoting unity in a country divided after the Presidential election. The NFL’s Super Bowl commercial this season featured Eli Manning and Odell Beckham, Jr., recreating the famous dance lift from “Dirty Dancing.” Leading up to the most recent season, Ms. Hudson also launched an ad campaign dubbed “ Let the Show Begin ,” in an effort to tout the entertainment value of the game.\nMs. Hudson took on the NFL marketing role after serving in broader management roles, including leadership positions at Pepsi and consultancy The Parthenon Group.\n“I’m unlikely to go do another marketing role,” said Ms. Hudson. “When I agreed to the commissioner to come in and work on the NFL, it was because I had a personal relationship with him and because back in my Pepsi days, he and I formed a great partnership that exists today between PepsiCo and the NFL. I felt like I knew the brand and wanted to help him make that brand stronger.”\nNow she’s leaving the brand in Ms. Turcke’s hands. “There’s so much change in how people consume and watch entertainment,” said Ms. Hudson. “That’s the opportunity for the NFL. That’s what [Maryann] is going to drive.”\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T14:27:48.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
