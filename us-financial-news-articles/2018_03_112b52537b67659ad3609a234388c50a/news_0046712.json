Spacecom also lost contact with another satellite in 2015.\nAmos-8 will replace Amos-3, which was launched in 2008.\nSpacecom is 64 percent owned by Eurocom Holdings.\nReporting by Steven Scheer; By Tova Cohen\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T12:40:35.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
