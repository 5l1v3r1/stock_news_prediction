A ground stop was in place at Philadelphia International Airport. A ground stop orders aircraft scheduled to fly to a certain airport to wait until conditions improve before departing. The FAA had earlier issued a ground stop at New York's LaGuardia Airport but that had been lifted as of 2 p.m. ET.\nThe FAA said delays were minimal at most major airports in the Northeast. But carriers had canceled more than a third of flights from the New York City area's three main airports.\nAt Newark, a major hub of United Airlines , about half of the airport's departures, or 329 flights, had been canceled as of Wednesday morning. Carriers canceled 294 flights from LaGuardia Airport and 260 from John F. Kennedy International Airport, according to FlightAware. A similar number of flights to those airports were also canceled. More than 280 flights were canceled to and from Boston Logan International Airport.\nAirport officials warned travelers to check with their airlines before heading to the airport. \nAirlines including United, Delta , JetBlue , American waived change fees for travelers affected by the storm if those individuals could move their trips to the coming days.\nWhile forecasts are still changing, airlines often cancel flights ahead of severe weather to avoid stranding crews and passengers, which can lead to even bigger logistical headaches.\nWATCH: Second nor'easter in a week takes aim at the northeast\nshow chapters Second nor'easter in a week takes aim at northeast      4 Hours Ago | 01:58", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T16:06:55.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
