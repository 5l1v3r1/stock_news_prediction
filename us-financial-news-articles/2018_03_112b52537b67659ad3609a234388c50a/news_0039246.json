Matthew Maletta, Endo's chief legal officer, in a statement called the settlement \"a significant milestone in Endo's multi-year turnaround plan.\"\nTeva in a statement said it was \"in the company's best interest to resolve this matter and to focus on our mission of providing innovative and affordable medicines to people around the globe.\"\nRepresentatives for Teikoku and the plaintiffs did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe litigation centered on a settlement that was reached in 2012 after Endo and Teikoku sued Watson for patent infringement after it had applied to the Food and Drug Administration to market a generic version of the patch.\nAs part of the May 2012 settlement, Watson agreed to delay launching its generic Lidoderm until September 2013, about two years before the patent expired, the lawsuit said.\nIn exchange, Watson received $96 million in free product and the promise that Endo would not release an authorized generic version of the drug until nearly eight months after Watson began selling its version, the plaintiffs said.\nThey claimed the deal violated antitrust laws and prevented them from being able to purchase cheaper, generic versions of Lidoderm.\nThe case is In re Lidoderm Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 14-md-2521.
