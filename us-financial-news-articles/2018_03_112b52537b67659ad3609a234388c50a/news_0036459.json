Kriegsman, CytRx's Chairman and CEO. \"Our partner and aldoxorubicin licensee NantCell has made progress not just for the indications we developed, but also initiating clinical trials testing aldoxorubicin in combination with their immunotherapy protocols in multiple disease states, including metastatic pancreatic cancer, advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We eagerly await upcoming developments on these studies.\"\nMr. Kriegsman continued, \"Looking ahead to 2018 and the fully owned pipeline assets of CytRx, we are focused on advancing our four new LADR™ (Linker Activated Drug Release) drug candidates which we unveiled last week. Supportive data for these ultra-high potency candidates have already garnered significant investigator interest, evidenced by the selection of three out of three abstracts submitted for presentation at the upcoming American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2018 annual meeting next month in Chicago. Each of the four LADR candidates are eligible to be advanced into Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 and Recent Highlights\nSelected Four LADR™ Candidates for IND-Enabling Clinical Studies. In March 2018, CytRx announced the selection of four LADR™ (Linker Activated Drug Release) candidates for advancement into IND-enabling studies with the goal of filing IND applications for one or more candidates during 2018. These candidates, preliminarily named LADR-7 (AE-Keto-Sulf07), LADR-8 (AE-Ester-Sulf07), LADR-9 (PP072) and LADR-10 (FN296) were chosen from two distinct classes of drugs, auristatins and maytansinoids, both with highly potent cytotoxic agents.\nLADR Candidate Data Selected for Presentation at the AACR 2018 Annual Meeting. In February 2018, CytRx announced that all three submitted abstracts highlighting significant data relating to the Company's LADR drug candidates were selected for presentation at the 2018 AACR Annual Meeting taking place April 14-18, 2018 in Chicago. Posters (abstracts #1657, #2661, and #3703) highlighting the potential of CytRx's ultra-high potency conjugates in solid tumors will be presented between Monday, April 16, 2018 and Tuesday, April 17, 2018.\nInitiation of Pharma Partnering Activities for the LADR™ Ultra-High Potency Drug Candidates. In February and March 2018, CytRx made two announcements that highlighted efforts to strengthen its strategic alliance team. First, CytRx announced that it had entered into an exclusive agreement with Destum Partners, Inc., a leading strategic advisory firm serving companies in the life sciences industry, to assist in executing a strategic alliance for CytRx's LADR™ drug candidates. CytRx also announced that Mr. Eric L. Curtis, MBA, joined its team to provide strategic counsel to the Chairman and CEO for the Company's ongoing programs, including its LADR™ discovery platform and the ultra-high potency drug candidates. Mr. Curtis will assist with introductions to strategic partners from his extensive network of big pharma and biotech companies.

In January 2018, CytRx announced that aldoxorubicin licensee NantCell, Inc. (a private subsidiary of NantWorks, LLC) dosed the first patient in the Phase 1b portion of a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The trial will investigate high-affinity natural killer (haNK) cell therapy in combination with several anti-cancer agents, including aldoxorubicin, in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer whose cancer has progressed on or following standard-of-care chemotherapy. This trial is a single-center, open-label, Phase 1b/2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the various combination therapies with enrollment expected to be approximately 173 patients. The primary endpoint for the Phase 1b portion of the trial is safety and the primary endpoint for the Phase 2 portion of the trial is objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST.\nPartner NantCell Dosed First Patient in Clinical Trial Evaluating Aldoxorubicin in Combination with Immuno-Oncology Agents and Cell-Based Therapies in Patients with Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma. In February 2018, CytRx announced that NantCell dosed the first patient in the Phase 1b portion of a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of either the head and neck or non-small cell lung cancer, the second trial conducted by NantCell to investigate haNK cell therapy in combination with several anti-cancer agents, including aldoxorubicin, in certain high unmet need cancer indications. This single-center, open-label, Phase 1b/2 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the various combination therapies, including combinations with aldoxorubicin, in subjects with SCC who have progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy. Approximately 65 patients are expected to be enrolled. The primary endpoint for the Phase 1b portion of the trial is safety and the primary endpoint for the Phase 2 portion of the trial is objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST.\nFiled Key Provisional Patent Applications for Ultra-High Potency LADR™ Drug Candidates. In December 2017, the Company filed provisional patent applications covering two series of drug candidates from its LADR™ Technology Platform. The newly filed applications cover compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use thereof. When granted, these new patents will expand CytRx's intellectual property estate and the Company will own worldwide rights for each.\nRegained Nasdaq Listing Compliance. On November 16, 2017, CytRx received written notification from the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department that it has regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule Section 5550(a)(2) for continued listing of its common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nCompleted Reverse Stock Split. On November 1, 2017, CytRx completed a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock. The split-adjusted shares of CytRx's common stock will continue trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the Company's existing symbol \"CYTR,\" provided that the Company continues to comply with the Nasdaq listing requirements. The reverse stock split reduced the number of common shares outstanding to approximately 27.6 million as of the effective date. Authorized shares were also proportionally reduced to approximately 41.7 million, and the Company's preferred stock was reduced to approximately 800,000 shares. The reverse stock split was approved by the Company's stockholders at a Special Meeting held on October 27, 2017.\nCompleted Strategic Licensing Transaction with NantCell for Development of Aldoxorubicin. In July 2017, CytRx and NantCell executed a strategic licensing agreement for the global rights to aldoxorubicin. NantCell, led by Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, who developed and commercialized Abraxane®, an albumin-mediated cytotoxic agent, received exclusive rights to develop and commercialize aldoxorubicin for all indications. Under the terms of the agreement, NantCell purchased $13 million of CytRx common stock at a per share price of $6.60 (split-adjusted), representing approximately a 92% premium to the market price at the time of the transaction. CytRx is eligible to receive up to an additional $343 million in regulatory and commercial milestones, plus increasing double-digit royalties on sales for aldoxorubicin's lead indication of soft tissue sarcomas, and mid to high single-digit royalties for any additional indications. CytRx also issued NantCell a warrant to purchase on a split-adjusted basis up to 500,000 shares of common stock at $6.60 over the next 18 months. As a result of this transaction, NantCell is responsible for development, manufacturing and commercialization activities relating to aldoxorubicin.\nPatterson Derivative Action in Delaware. On March 13, 2018, the Vice-Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that CytRx's motion to dismiss was granted, with prejudice.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nCytRx reported cash, and cash equivalents of $37.6 million as of December 31, 2017. During the third quarter, CytRx entered into a global strategic licensing agreement for aldoxorubicin with NantCell and received a strategic investment of $13.0 million at $6.60 per share (split-adjusted). Concurrent with the closing of the aldoxorubicin license agreement, CytRx amended its existing long-term loan and made additional payments of $10 million during the third quarter to the lender.Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $35.0 million, or $(1.46) per share, compared with a net loss of $50.8 million, or $(3.78) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016, a reduction of $15.8 million. In 2017, the Company recognized a non-cash gain of $1.4 million on the fair value adjustment of warrant derivative liabilities related to warrants issued in 2016, compared to a non-cash gain of $3.8 million during 2016 related to now expired warrants.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $19.8 million for 2017, including approximately $11.7 million for aldoxorubicin, $3.2 million for pre-clinical development of new LADR albumin-binding, ultra-high potency drug candidates (Freiburg lab), and approximately $4.9 million for non-cash expenses, licensing fees and general operations of our clinical programs. This is a reduction of approximately 45 percent compared to R&D expenses of $35.9 million for 2016.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $12.5 million for 2017, compared with $16.0 million for 2016, including non-cash stock-compensation expense of $2.8 million for 2017 and $4.9 million for 2016. G&A expenses decreased by approximately 22 percent primarily due to a decrease in non-cash expenses of $2.1 million and a decrease in salaries of $1.0 million.\nConference Call and Webcast\nCytRx will be hosting a conference call and webcast today beginning at 11:00 am ET (8:00 am PT).
