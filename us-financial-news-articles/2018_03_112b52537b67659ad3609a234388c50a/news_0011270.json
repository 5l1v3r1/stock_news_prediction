On the capital front, we issued $43.1 million of equity in a secondary offering, $4.0 million in equity through our at-the-market program, $48.9 million of 5-year unsecured notes and modified our credit facility to extend the maturity and increase the amount available for borrowing. We earned $1.52 per share, including a realized gain of $0.31 per share, more than covering our $1.36 annual dividend. Net asset value per share increased from $13.69 to $13.81. Since year end, we have closed investments in three new and three existing portfolio companies totaling $62.4 million and have received no full repayments\" said Robert T. Ladd, Chief Executive Officer of Stellus.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nWe completed the fourth quarter of 2017 with a portfolio of $371.8 million (at fair value) invested in 48 companies. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio included approximately 38% of first lien debt, 48% of second lien debt, 7% of unsecured debt and 7% of equity investments at fair value. Our debt portfolio consisted of 87% floating rate investments (subject to interest rate floors) and 13% fixed rate investments. The average size of our portfolio company investments was $7.7 million at fair value, and our largest aggregate investment in a portfolio company was approximately $22.2 million at fair value. The weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2017 was approximately 10.8%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we made $175.5 million of investments, at par, in fourteen new portfolio companies and two existing portfolio companies, and received $172.3 million in proceeds from repayments and amortization.\nThis compares to the portfolio as of December 31, 2016, which had a fair value of $365.6 million invested in 45 companies, comprised 31% of first lien debt, 45% of second lien debt, 19% of unsecured debt and 5% of equity investments at fair value. The weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 11.0%. The debt portfolio consisted of 77% floating rate investments (subject to interest rate floors) and 23% fixed rate investments.\nResults of Operations\nInvestment income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, totaled $39.6 million and $39.5 million, respectively, most of which was interest income from portfolio company investments.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, totaled $21.3 million and $22.2 million, respectively. For the same respective periods, base management fees totaled $6.3 million and $6.3 million, incentive fees totaled $2.9 million and $4.3 million, fees and expenses related to our borrowings of $7.9 million and $8.0 million respectively (including interest and amortization of deferred financing costs), administrative services expenses totaled $1.2 million and $1.0 million and other expenses totaled $3.0 and $2.6 million, respectively.\nNet investment income was $18.0 million, or $1.21 per common share, and $17.3 million, or $1.39 per common share, based on weighted average common shares outstanding for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a realized gain of $4.7 million and a realized loss of $13.1 million respectively. The Company's investment portfolio had a net change in unrealized depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $0.02 million and a net change in unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016, of $18.6 million.\nOur net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled $22.6 million and $23.2 million, or $1.52 and $1.86 per common share, based on weighted average common shares outstanding, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company issued 3,465,922 additional shares of common stock in connection with an equity capital raise in April 2017 and an at-the-market program, which began in the third quarter of the year. Gross proceeds resulting from the issuances totaled $48.7 million, and underwriting and other expenses related to the offering totaled $1.7 million. For the same period, our financing activities used cash of $3.3 million, which included distributions to stockholders of $20.3 million and net repayments of $75.3 million under the credit facility.\nOn August 21, 2017, the Company issued $42.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% fixed-rate notes due 2022 (the \"Notes\"). On September 8, 2017, the Company issued an additional $6.38 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes pursuant to a full exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option. The Notes will mature on September 15, 2022, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after September 15, 2019 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest is payable quarterly beginning December 15, 2017. The Company used all of the net proceeds from this offering to fully redeem the $25.0 million of 6.50% notes due 2019 and repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the existing credit facility.\nOn November 28, 2017, the Company drew $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of debentures guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA-guaranteed debentures). The SBA-guaranteed debentures will mature on March 21, 2028 with interest due biannually. The Company used all of the proceeds from this draw to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the credit facility.\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived from our credit facility, notes, SBA-guaranteed debentures and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned and offering of our securities. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and other operating expenses we incur, including the payment of dividends to the holders of our common stock. We used, and expect to continue to use, these capital resources including proceeds from any future public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment activities.\nOn October 11, 2017, the Company entered into a $140 million revolving credit facility with ZB, N.A., dba Amegy Bank, and various other lenders with a maturity date of October 10, 2021 (the \"Credit Facility\"). In conjunction with securing and entering into the Credit Facility, the Company terminated its senior secured revolving credit facility with SunTrust Bank (the \"Original Facility\"). The Credit Facility became effective as of October 10, 2017 and is materially the same as the Original Facility. The Company incurred upfront costs of approximately $1.2 million which were deferred and will be amortized over the four year term of the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $40.8 million and $116.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities, respectively.\nOn November 1, 2017, we entered into a custody agreement with our new custodian, ZB, N.A., dba, Amegy Bank.

For the same period, our financing activities used cash of $10.5 million, due to distributions to stockholders paid during the period.\nDistributions\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we declared aggregate distributions of $0.34 and $1.36 per share, $5.4 million and $4.2 million for the quarter ended and $20.3 million and $17.0 million for the year, respectively.
