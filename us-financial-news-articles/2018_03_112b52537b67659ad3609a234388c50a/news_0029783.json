BEH’s 5-year Eurobond matures in November. In February Fitch upgraded BEH’s ratings one notch to BB with a stable outlook, citing improved financial performance and narrowed deficit at its subsidiary NEK, a public supplier of electricity. BEH, which is made up of Bulgaria’s biggest state energy firms for natural gas supply and transmission, power generation as well as coal mining, is yet to hire lead managers and legal adviser for the new issue. The company has another 5-year 550 million euros Eurobond that matures in 2021.
