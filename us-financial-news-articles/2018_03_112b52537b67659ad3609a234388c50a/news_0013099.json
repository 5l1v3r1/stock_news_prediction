Cohn did not spell out the reasons for his resignation. He had told Trump that markets would slump on a tariffs threat and was regarded as a bulwark of economic orthodoxy in an administration whose protectionist policies have sparked alarm among U.S. legislators and in governments around the world. Cohn’s resignation came after Trump said he was sticking with plans to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
