CEO Mohamed Nasr Abdeen told journalists after the bank’s annual general meeting (AGM) that loan growth, which fell by 4 percent in 2017, was expected to grow by between 5 and 7 percent this year, due to economic stability and growth. “We see a better chance this year due to stability in the economy,” he said, adding the bank was not in a hurry to inflate its loan book. Abdeen said the rise in oil prices was a positive factor. “We expect the government to come up with new projects,” he said. Abdeen said the bank was planning to open five new branches in Egypt, taking the total number of branches in the country to 48.
