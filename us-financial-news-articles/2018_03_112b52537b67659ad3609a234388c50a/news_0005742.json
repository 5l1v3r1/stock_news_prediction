(NYSE:GTY) (“Getty” or the “Company”) announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights For The Fourth Quarter\nNet earnings of $0.33 per share Funds From Operations (FFO) of $0.51 per share Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) of $0.43 per share Acquired 39 properties for $70.1 million Increased quarterly dividend by 14 percent\nHighlights For The Full Year 2017\nNet earnings of $1.26 per share FFO of $2.00 per share AFFO of $1.66 per share Acquired 103 properties for $214 million Completed two redevelopment projects\nChristopher J. Constant, Getty’s President & Chief Executive Officer stated, “The fourth quarter capped a very productive year for Getty. Our operating portfolio delivered consistent results, while we made additional progress in growing and further diversifying our portfolio with accretive acquisitions. Over the years we have evolved our portfolio into one with high quality, well located assets, many with expanded convenience stores which resonate with today’s consumer. We also continue to execute on redevelopment projects and have a solid pipeline which we expect to come online in 2018 and beyond. As we look ahead we are optimistic about our ability to continue to execute on our growth strategy and deliver stable cash flows for our shareholders.”\nNet Earnings\nThe Company reported net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, of $13.0 million, or $0.33 per share, as compared to net earnings of $8.3 million, or $0.24 per share, for the same period in 2016. The Company reported net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, of $47.2 million, or $1.26 per share, as compared to net earnings of $38.4 million, or $1.12 per share, for the same period in 2016.\nFunds From Operations (FFO) and Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)\nFFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $20.2 million, or $0.51 per share, as compared to $17.9 million, or $0.52 per share, for the same period in 2016. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $74.6 million, or $2.00 per share, as compared to $64.2 million, or $1.87 per share, for the same period in 2016.\nAFFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $17.3 million, or $0.43 per share, as compared to $14.5 million, or $0.42 per share, for the same period in 2016. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $62.0 million, or $1.66 per share, as compared to $57.1 million, or $1.67 per share, for the same period in 2016.\nAll per share amounts are presented on a fully diluted per common share basis, unless stated otherwise. FFO and AFFO are defined and reconciled to net earnings in the financial tables at the end of this release. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we revised our definition of AFFO. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues from rental properties in continuing operations increased by $3.4 million to $28.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $24.8 million for the same period in 2016. Revenues from rental properties in continuing operations were $101.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $96.7 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in revenues from rental properties for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to revenue from the properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProperty costs from continuing operations were $7.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $6.9 million for the same period in 2016. Property costs from continuing operations were $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $23.2 million for the same period in 2016. The decline in property costs for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to a reduction in rent, maintenance and state and local taxes.\nEnvironmental expenses from continuing operations were $2.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $2 thousand for the same period in 2016. Environmental expenses from continuing operations were $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared $2.7 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in environmental expenses for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to changes in net environmental remediation costs, and increases in environmental litigation accruals and legal fees. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of change in reported environmental expenses for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nGeneral and administrative expenses from continuing operations were $3.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to an increase in employee related expenses. General and administrative expenses from continuing operations were $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $14.2 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to reductions in legal and professional fees, and non-recurring employee related expenses predominantly due to reductions in severance and retirement costs partially offset by an increase in employee related expenses.\nImpairment charges in continuing operations were $1.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $3.3 million for the same period in 2016. Impairment charges in continuing operations were $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $8.6 million for the same period in 2016. Impairment charges in continuing operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were primarily attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with the Company’s environmental liabilities and reductions in estimated sales prices from third-party offers based on signed contracts, letters of intent or indicative bids for certain properties.\nPortfolio Activities\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company acquired fee simple interests in 39 properties for $70.1 million, in the aggregate. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company acquired fee simple interests in 103 properties for $214.0 million, in the aggregate.\nOn October 3, 2017, the Company completed its previously announced transaction with a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen PLC, whereby the Company acquired fee simple interests in 38 properties for $68.3 million and entered into a unitary lease with the Applegreen subsidiary at the closing of the transaction.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold three properties for $1.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold 12 properties for $4.3 million, in the aggregate.\nRedevelopment Activities\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, rent commenced on the Company’s third redevelopment project. As of December 31, 2017, the Company is actively redeveloping nine of its former convenience store and gas station properties either as a new convenience and gasoline use or for an alternative single-tenant net lease retail use. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had signed leases on four properties, which are currently part of its net lease portfolio. These properties are expected to be recaptured from their current leases and transferred to redevelopment when the appropriate entitlements, permits and approvals have been secured.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $380.0 million of outstanding indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8%. The Company’s indebtedness consisted of $155.0 million drawn on its Credit Agreement and $225.0 million of Senior Unsecured Notes. Total cash and cash equivalents were $20.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company has established its 2018 AFFO guidance at a range of $1.68 to $1.74 per diluted share. The Company’s guidance does not assume any potential future acquisitions or capital markets activities. The guidance is based on current plans and assumptions and is subject to risks and uncertainties more fully described and the Company’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nConference Call Information\nGetty Realty Corp.’s Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call is scheduled for Wednesday, February 28, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. EST.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company owned 828 properties and leased 79 properties from third-party landlords in 28 states across the United States and Washington, D.C.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to measurements defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company also focuses on Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) to measure its performance. FFO and AFFO are generally considered by analysts and investors to be appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measures of the performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO and AFFO are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP and therefore these measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP net earnings or as a measure of liquidity. These measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s performance in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures.\nFFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as GAAP net earnings before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate, impairment charges and cumulative effect of accounting change. The Company’s definition of AFFO is defined as FFO less (i) Revenue Recognition Adjustments (net of allowances), (ii) non-cash changes in environmental estimates, (iii) non-cash environmental accretion expense, (iv) environmental litigation accruals, (v) insurance reimbursements, (vi) legal settlements and judgments, (vii) acquisition costs expensed and (viii) other unusual items that are not reflective of the Company’s core operating performance. Other REITs may use definitions of FFO and/or AFFO that are different than the Company’s and, accordingly, may not be comparable.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company revised its definition of AFFO to exclude three additional items – environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, and legal settlements and judgments – because the Company believes that these items are not indicative of its core operating performance. While the Company does not label excluded items as non-recurring, the Company believes that excluding items from its definition of AFFO that are either non-cash or not reflective of its core operating performance provides analysts and investors the ability to compare its core operating performance between periods. AFFO for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, have been restated to conform to the Company’s revised definition.\nFFO excludes various items such as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate and impairment charges. In the Company’s case, however, GAAP net earnings and FFO typically include the impact of revenue recognition adjustments comprised of deferred rental revenue (straight-line rental revenue), the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, adjustments recorded for recognition of rental income recognized from direct financing leases on revenues from rental properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives, as offset by the impact of related collection reserves. Deferred rental revenue results primarily from fixed rental increases scheduled under certain leases with the Company’s tenants. In accordance with GAAP, the aggregate minimum rent due over the current term of these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis rather than when payment is contractually due. The present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in-place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenue from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in-place leases. Income from direct financing leases is recognized over the lease terms using the effective interest method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. The amortization of deferred lease incentives represents the Company’s funding commitment in certain leases, which deferred expense is recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental revenue. GAAP net earnings and FFO include non-cash changes in environmental estimates and environmental accretion expense, which do not impact the Company’s recurring cash flow. GAAP net earnings and FFO also include environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, and legal settlements and judgments, which items are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. GAAP net earnings and FFO from time to time may also include acquisition costs expensed and other unusual items that are not reflective of the Company’s core operating performance. Acquisition costs are expensed, generally in the period when properties are acquired and are not reflective of recurring operations.\nThe Company pays particular attention to AFFO, as the Company believes it best represents its core operating performance. In the Company’s view, AFFO provides a more accurate depiction than FFO of its core operating performance. By providing AFFO, the Company believes that it is presenting useful information that assists analysts and investors to better assess its core operating performance. Further, the Company believes that AFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of its core operating performance with the sustainability of the core operating performance of other real estate companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCERTAIN STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN MAY CONSTITUTE “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.
