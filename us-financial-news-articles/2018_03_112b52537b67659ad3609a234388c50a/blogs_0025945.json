Bernstein | Reuters Donald Trump Trump enunciated gun restrictions after the Parkland school massacre, then backtracked after fellow Republicans and the National Rifle Association objected. That mirrored his previous handling of the fate of immigrant Dreamers and health-care marketplace stabilization.\nHe said his steel tariffs would hit Canada and Mexico unless they concluded a new North American Free Trade Agreement. Then he backtracked, without a new NAFTA, after fellow Republicans and U.S. allies warned against a trade war and threatened retaliation.\nThe special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election has indicted the former chairman of Trump's presidential campaign . Special counsel Robert Mueller has also secured guilty pleas from Trump's former White House national security advisor , deputy campaign chief and campaign foreign policy adviser — all of whom are now cooperating witnesses.\nTrump's lawyers, who have repeatedly portrayed the investigation as on the verge of ending, are discussing terms under which Mueller can question the president himself about potential collusion with Russia and subsequent obstruction of justice.\nAll these winds buffet the White House as Trump faces hazards, largely of his own making, on several fronts.\nHe rattled markets with the threat of trade disruptions to a strong global economy.\nHe caught national security aides unprepared by agreeing to become the first sitting president to meet with North Korea's nuclear-armed dictator. The administration has articulated no clear U.S. strategy for a meeting South Korea's leader says will occur within two months.\nTrump declined to promptly speak up in solidarity with America's foremost ally after the prime minister of Britain pointed at Russia for the attempted murder of an expatriate on British soil.\nHe has remained silent as an actress in pornographic films is on the verge of publicly telling her story of a pre-White House affair with him. Trump's personal lawyer paid $130,000 for her silence on the eve of the 2016 election.\nFor now, despite his sub-40 percent approval ratings, Trump enjoys political protection from fellow Republicans who control both houses of Congress.\nBut that protection may not survive the year. Here in southwest Pennsylvania, the Democratic candidate in Tuesday's special House election took a late polling lead in a district Trump won in a landslide.\nIf Conor Lamb breaks the GOP's 16-year grip on this district, Republicans will confront the prospect of midterm defeats large enough to make more incumbents reconsider their appetite for the battle.\nAnd if Democrats win back Congress in November, Trump will not merely be standing on shaky political ground. He'll be staring directly at the prospect of impeachment.\nWATCH: GOP can't count on tax cuts to save majority show chapters GOP can't count on tax cuts to save its majority      10:51 AM ET Mon, 12 March 2018 | 03:34", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T18:42:50.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
