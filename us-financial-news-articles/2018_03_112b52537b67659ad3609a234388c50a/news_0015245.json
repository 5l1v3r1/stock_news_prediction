We withdrew the motion for debate on the subject scheduled for this afternoon,” Nonceba Mhlauli said.\nShe said the withdrawal was meant to allow for consultations within the party and key stakeholders.\nUnlike most central banks in the world, the South African Reserve Bank has been privately owned since it was established in 1921. But its shareholders have no control over monetary policy, financial stability policy or banking regulation.
