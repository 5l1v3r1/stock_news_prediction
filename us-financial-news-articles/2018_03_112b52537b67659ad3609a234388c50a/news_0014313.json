Laine is just one goal behind Wayne Gretzky and Brian Bellows.\nLaine extended his streaks on the same night Devils star Taylor Hall’s point streak was snapped at 26 consecutive appearances.\nJoel Armia and Nikolaj Ehlers also scored for the Jets. Goalie Connor Hellebuyck recorded 41 saves.\nKyle Palmieri and Nico Hischier scored for the Devils. Goalie Keith Schneider made 21 saves.\nLaine scored his eighth goal in four games 4:12 into the first, when he tucked home the rebound after Ehlers’ pass into the crease ticked off the skate of Jets center Paul Stastny.\nAn injury to Devils center Travis Zajac created a shift change that led to the Jets’ second goal at 13:26 of the second. Zajac, who struggled off the ice after he was leveled by Andrew Copp, made it to the bench moments before Armia’s slap shot from just in front of the blue line sailed under the glove of Schneider.\nPalmieri cut the gap in half by taking a multi-zone pass from Hischier and scoring on a breakaway with 3:19 left in the period.\nEhlers extended the lead to 3-1 by putting back the rebound of Dustin Byfuglien’s shot 9:55 into the third. The Devils pulled back within one just 72 seconds later, when Hischier finished a flurry by getting a stick on the rebound of a shot by Jesper Bratt.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:07:23.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
