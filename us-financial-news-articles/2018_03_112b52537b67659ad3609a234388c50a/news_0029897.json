Credits can be bought or sold within the market to meet the government's targets.

China has also overtaken the U.S. to become the world's largest EV market. Controlling road congestion \nMeanwhile, prospective electric car buyers in China may be affected by efforts to ease congestion. \n\"For mega-cities like Beijing and Shanghai , they don't only control the air pollution, but they also control the transport congestion. So they actually control the number of cars on the roads,\" Lei told CNBC. \nThe congestion problems in those mega-cities have seen purchasing and driving restrictions — usually reserved for traditional gasoline-powered cars — extended to EVs. \n\"In the past, we only had that for gasoline cars, but now, because more and more people want to buy EVs, it extended to EVs,\" Lei said.
