People watch a huge screen showing the test launch of intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), July 5, 2017. KCNA/via REUTERS/Files \nFirst South Korean, then Chinese officials have in recent weeks reported North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has told them he is “committed to denuclearisation” on the Korean peninsula. \nKim’s declared commitment to denuclearisation, however, is neither new, nor likely in line with Washington’s expectations. \nNorth Korea has long said it is open to eventually giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States withdraws its troops from South Korea and ends its “nuclear umbrella” security alliance with Seoul, among other conditions. \nThe United States, meanwhile, has insisted on complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantling of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and the facilities needed to build those weapons as soon as possible. \nThe differing interpretations threaten to scuttle potential talks between North Korea and the United States before they begin. \n“As we approach the summits, conceptions of denuclearisation seem to be diverging rather than converging,” said Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists. CONDITIONS AND CAVEATS \nAt the heart of the gulf between what Kim has said and what American and allied leaders may expect are the many caveats and conditions attached. \n“The issue of denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved, if South Korea and the United States respond to our efforts with goodwill,” Kim told Chinese officials during a visit this week, according to Chinese state media outlet Xinhua. \nPrevious North Korean leaders have vowed to end their nuclear programmes through negotiations, and according to South Korean officials, Kim said he would be open to giving up his nuclear weapons if he has adequate security guarantees. \nWashington is unlikely to be able to credibly provide such assurances in the wake of its interventions in Iraq and Libya, said Vipin Narang, an associate professor at MIT’s Security Studies Program.

KCNA/via REUTERS/Files \nIf Trump shares that view and Kim refuses to give ground, then any talks could go nowhere, Mount said. \n“If Trump rejects a phased approach, he will be seen as unreasonable and departing from expectations,” he said. “If that happens, we could see the other players cut Washington out of the process and go it alone.” Additional reporting by Christian Shepherd in BEIJING and Christine Kim in SEOUL; Editing by Lincoln Feast", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T11:48:37.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
