Another outdoor retailer, Mountain Equipment Co-Op, cut ties with Vista Thursday as well. \nBeyond the products REI sells, Vista also owns Savage Arms, which makes “modern sporting rifles.” REI says it was Vista’s silence after the events in Parkland that led to the decision. \n“We believe that it is the job of companies that manufacture and sell guns and ammunition to work towards common sense solutions that prevent the type of violence that happened in Florida last month,” the company said in a statement announcing the change in the relationship status with Vista. “We learned that Vista does not plan to make a public statement that outlines a clear plan of action. As a result, we have decided to place a hold on future orders of products that Vista sells through REI while we assess how Vista proceeds. Companies are showing they can contribute if they are willing to lead. We encourage Vista to do just that.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T13:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T23:13:42.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
