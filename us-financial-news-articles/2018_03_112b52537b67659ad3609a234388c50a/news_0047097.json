Regardless, this is completely unacceptable and violates our policies — to say nothing of our values.\n“When made aware of the issue, we immediately removed the deal — as well as the third-party seller — from our marketplace. Language like this has no place on Groupon, and we’re further strengthening our self-service controls to ensure it doesn’t happen again.”\nHowever, for some Groupon customers, the damage appears to have been done, as many on social media have said that they will no longer be using Groupon’s services.", "external_links": ["https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a19619963/groupon-racial-slur-boots-ad/", "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/offensive_boots.jpeg"], "published": "2018-03-29T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T23:41:17.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
