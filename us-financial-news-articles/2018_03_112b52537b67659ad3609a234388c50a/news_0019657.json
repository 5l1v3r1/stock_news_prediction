To obtain a letter of credit, companies must prove they “have adopted measures to insure they can meet their obligations at the time of payment,” it said.\nPavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank monetary specialist, said state-run banks would now function as an additional filter to ensure companies were solvent and could pay for imports.\nHe said Cuba had experienced similar payments problems every decade since the 1980s.\n“They have figured out that the government can renegotiate the foreign debt, but if the state companies do a poor job managing their finances they face the same problem over and over again,” said Vidal, who teaches at Universidad Javeriana Cali in Colombia.\nReporting by Marc Frank; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:30:34.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
