Now they also have to contend with higher input prices.\nGeneral Mills GIS -8.97% shares were down by more than 9% Wednesday morning after the company lowered operating-profit guidance for its full fiscal year ending in May. The maker of Cheerios cereal, Yoplait yogurt and Progresso soups now forecasts adjusted earnings-per-share growth of zero to 1% for the period, down from its earlier guidance of 3% to 4% growth.\nGeneral Mills Inc., the maker of Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios, lowered operating-profit guidance for its full fiscal year ending in May. Photo: lisa baertlein/Reuters The company cited higher commodity prices—including grains, nuts and dairy—as well as rising logistics and freight costs. On a conference call, management was contrite for not catching the trend of accelerating inflation earlier, and it outlined plans to respond by cutting costs, reconfiguring logistics networks and raising some prices.\nBut analysts on the call voiced skepticism that General Mills has room to pass higher costs on to consumers in the current tough environment. Among other factors, discount grocery chains are taking market share and pressuring suppliers to keep prices low. Shoppers also are increasingly willing and able to compare prices online. During a previous bout of commodity price inflation a decade ago, companies like General Mills raised prices stealthily by shrinking package sizes, but this approach has inherent limits.\nWhile sounding pessimistic on costs, General Mills talked up its sales performance. Having shrunk for several quarters, organic net sales growth turned modestly positive over the past two quarters. This was aided by new products like Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios. But this success shouldn’t be exaggerated. The company’s guidance for the full fiscal year is still for flat organic net sales.\nThe acquisition of natural pet-food maker Blue Buffalo Pet Products will help flatter overall sales growth in future quarters. It won’t do much to aid cost efficiency, though, since pet food is a new product segment with few expense synergies.\nShares of rival packaged-food companies fell along with General Mills Wednesday, with Campbell Soup and Kellogg both down by more than 4% in morning trading. For investors, weak sales and rising costs make for an unappetizing mix.\nWrite to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T19:08:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
