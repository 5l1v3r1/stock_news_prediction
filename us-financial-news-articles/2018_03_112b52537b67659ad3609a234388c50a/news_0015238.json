REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The European Commission ruled in August 2016 that Apple had received unfair tax incentives from Ireland and last October said it was taking Dublin to the European Court of Justice over delays in recovering the money.\nBoth Apple and Dublin are appealing the original ruling, saying the iPhone maker’s tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law.\nThe Commission ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros in back taxes, a figure Ireland’s finance department estimated last year could reach 15 billion euros including EU interest.\nThe finance department said on Wednesday that it would finalize the operational arrangements for the escrow over the coming weeks and that a separate procurement process for investment managers was currently in progress.\nIreland has said it expects to start collecting the money from Apple during the second quarter of the year.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T12:50:47.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
