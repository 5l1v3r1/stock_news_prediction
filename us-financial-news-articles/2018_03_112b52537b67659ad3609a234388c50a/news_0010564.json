(\"Vegalab” or “the Company\"), (OTCQB: VEGL), announced today that it completed its acquisition of The Agronomy Group, LLC effective as of February 1, 2018. The Agronomy Group (“TAG”), located in Tulare County, California, is a producer and distributor of environmentally friendly agrochemicals. TAG had been Vegalab’s top U.S. sales organization, so the acquisition dramatically expands the Company’s internal marketing capability. The purchase price for TAG was paid by the delivery of 600,000 shares of the restricted common stock of Vegalab, and a warrant to purchase 1,600,000 shares of the restricted common stock of Vegalab at an exercise price of $1.20 per share exercisable over a term of five years.\nDavid Selakovic, CEO of Vegalab, Inc., said, “Vegalab’s acquisition of The Agronomy Group puts us in direct relationship with industry leading, national agro-chemical distributors and dealers such as Winfield United, Stanislaus Farm Supply, Buttonwillow Warehouse, and Mid Valley Agricultural Services. We are excited about the potential to increase our sales with the addition of 29 new products from TAG, including 10 of which are listed for use in organic agriculture (9 by the Organic Materials Review Institute, and 1 by the Washington State Department of Agriculture). Our management team determined this to be a highly strategic acquisition opportunity, and we expect TAG’s environmentally friendly products and established distribution channels to substantially increase our revenues and profitability.”\nAbout Vegalab, Inc.\nVegalab, Inc. is the exclusive distributor in North and South America of a line of all-natural, biologically derived pesticides, fertilizers, and specialty agricultural products. Vegalab’s pesticides are highly effective against targeted organisms, non-toxic to beneficial organisms, and safe for the environment.
