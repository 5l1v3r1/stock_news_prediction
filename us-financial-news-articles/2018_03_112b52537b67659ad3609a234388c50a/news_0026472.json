(NYSE: AZZ), a global provider of metal coatings services, welding solutions, specialty electrical equipment and highly engineered services to the power generation, transmission, distribution and industrial markets, announced today it has won the bid to acquire certain assets through a 363 bankruptcy sale process, from Lectrus Corporation, a privately-held Tennessee corporation, that designs and manufactures custom metal enclosures and provides electrical and mechanical integration. The Chattanooga, Tennessee facility of Lectrus is included in the assets acquired.\nKen Lavelle, President of AZZ's Electrical segment commented, \"The opportunity to purchase certain strategic assets from Lectrus through a 363 bankruptcy sale process is a result of the consolidation that is occurring within the metal enclosure industry in the U.S., which is particularly challenging for smaller, less well-capitalized operators. AZZ is well positioned to remain an opportunistic acquirer of strategic assets that will further enhance AZZ's market share and improve operations.\"\nThe Chattanooga facility is located on a 585,000 square-foot site. The operations include a 210,000 square- foot manufacturing facility, as well as engineers, estimators, project management, fabrication, integration and sales personnel. Going forward, the facility will operate as AZZ Enclosure Systems – Chattanooga LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and will complement AZZ's current metal enclosure and switchgear locations in Kansas, Maryland, and Missouri. The acquisition is subject to final court approval of the Sale Order, the Asset Purchase Price Agreement and customary closing conditions. Closing is expected on, or before, March 31, 2018.\nMr. Lavelle concluded, \"The Chattanooga facility will expand our market presence and advance our goal of strengthening our market position in providing custom metal enclosures and related electrical integration to utility, industrial and OEM customers. We look forward to adding the Lectrus heritage and strength of the Chattanooga operations to our AZZ Electrical business. AZZ expects the AZZ Enclosure Systems - Chattanooga facility to be accretive to earnings within the first year of operation.\"\nAbout Lectrus Corporation\nFounded in 1968, Lectrus Corporation is an industry leader in the design and manufacture of custom metal enclosures and related electrical and mechanical integration.
