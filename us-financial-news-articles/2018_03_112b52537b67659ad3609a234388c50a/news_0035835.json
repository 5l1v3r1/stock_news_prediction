Both companies expressed disappointment at not being able to complete the transaction in a timely fashion, citing the desire, in the face of regulatory resistance, to redirect their resources and attention to their businesses. The companies intend to focus on delivering value to their respective customers in a competitive marketplace.\nAbout CDK Global\nWith more than $2 billion in revenues, CDK Global (Nasdaq:CDK) is a leading global provider of integrated information technology and digital marketing solutions to the automotive retail and adjacent industries.
