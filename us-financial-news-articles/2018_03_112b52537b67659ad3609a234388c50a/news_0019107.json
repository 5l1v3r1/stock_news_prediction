Cohn, an economic adviser seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces within Trump's administration, said on Tuesday he would resign, a move that came after he lost a fight over Trump's plans for hefty steel and aluminium import tariffs. The threat of a trade war has led to speculative buying, Kingdom Futures CEO Malcolm Freeman wrote in a note, on expectations that metal will be harder and more expensive to come by when the tariffs are imposed. However, there has so far been little increase in real consumer buying, he added. \"The net result of this could well be another sharp correction to the downside in prices until the markets get into synchronisation and consumer buying starts up again,\" Freeman said.
