The Sky logo is seen on outside of an entrance to offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville/Files The agreement, which is required under UK takeover rules, will allow Sky to disclose information to the two companies that could be relevant in Disney’s separate attempt to buy Fox assets, including its stake in Sky. U.S. cable company Comcast gatecrashed Fox’s agreed offer for Sky with a rival $31 billion bid last month.
