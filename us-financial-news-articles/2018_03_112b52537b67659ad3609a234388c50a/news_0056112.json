We used to be number six or seven in most of our key markets; we’re now, typically, number two or three,” Chief Executive Phil Loney told Reuters.\nThe company reported operating profit before tax on a European embedded value (EEV) basis — a measure of insurance company performance that values future cashflows — of 329 million pounds ($464 million), against 282 million pounds in 2016.\nThat was helped by a 38 percent increase in new life and pensions business to 12 billion pounds, up from 8.7 billion pounds, though the new business margin slipped slightly to 1.8 percent from 1.9 percent.\nRoyal London said customers continued to take advantage of changes to UK pension rules giving individuals more choice about what to do with their money and were looking to invest more in its funds and income-drawdown products that allow pension savers access to their money in stages.\nThe company has also been one of the chief winners from a government drive to force all businesses to offer a workplace pension through so-called auto-enrollment.\nNew business across its pensions operations rose 12 percent to 4.4 billion pounds.\nElsewhere, sales of life insurance products through intermediaries rose 25 percent to 807 million pounds while assets under management at its investment arm, Royal London Asset Management, climbed 14 percent to 114 billion pounds.
