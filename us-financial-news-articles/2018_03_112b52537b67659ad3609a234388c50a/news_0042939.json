SoftBank's possible investment, through its $98 billion Vision Fund, would be part of a fundraising effort by Manbang, which is looking to raise between $500 million and $1 billion in fresh funds to help it expand in China's growing logistics market, the Journal said here .

Manbang, backed by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd and a private-equity firm co-founded by billionaire Jack Ma, would be valued at $5 billion if it raises $500 million, WSJ said. SoftBank and Manbang were not immediately available for comment. SoftBank has been aggressively investing in technology companies worldwide - notably through its London-based Vision Fund - including U.S. ride hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc .
