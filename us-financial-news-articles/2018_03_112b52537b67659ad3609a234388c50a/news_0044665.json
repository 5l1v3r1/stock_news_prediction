REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo The prohibition will cover advertising of initial coin offerings (ICOs) - crowdfunding used to raise cash by creating new coins - as well as token sales and crypto-wallet services, the San-Francisco-based firm told Reuters.\nThe new policy, whose implementation date was not announced, will also - with limited exceptions - stop crypto-exchanges from advertising on its platform\nRelated Coverage Twitter to start ban of most cryptocurrency ads on Tuesday Twitter said this month it was taking measures to prevent crypto-related accounts from “engaging with others in a deceptive manner”, but had faced calls to go further after bans from Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) and Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) Google.\nFacebook has restricted crypto-related adverts, while Google earlier in March announced a ban that comes into force in June .\nRegulators have stepped up warnings that bitcoin and other virtual currencies are highly speculative, some potentially fraudulent and that investors should be prepared to lose everything.\nBut last week the G20 group of rich nations failed to reach a consensus on how to supervise them.\nA man reads tweets on his phone in front of a displayed Twitter logo in Bordeaux, southwestern France, March 10, 2016.

News of the Facebook and Google bans also knocked the price.\nBitcoin fell almost 5 percent on Monday to $8,062 BTC=BTSP on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.\nEthereum .MVETH and Ripple’s XRP .MVXRP, the second and third biggest digital currencies by market capitalization, have tumbled this year too.\nWhile critics call cryptocurrencies a ponzi scheme that will end in tears for the majority of investors, supporters say the coins are backed by powerful new technology that can replace traditional fiat currencies and upend the existing banking system.\nReporting by Tommy Wilkes and Fanny Potkin; Editing by Kevin Liffey and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T19:38:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
