Funds from operations (\"FFO\") increased 9.5% to $804 million for the full year compared to $734 million in 2016. FCF was above our Q2 revised guidance due to better than expected results from our coal recovery plan in the second half of the year.\nComparable EBITDA from generation increased 13% year-over-year, excluding Canadian Coal, due to strong performance in our Wind and Solar, Australian Gas, Canadian Gas and US Coal segments. Australian Gas celebrated the commissioning of the South Hedland power station in July, the Canadian Gas segment benefitted from the settlement of the contract indexation dispute with the Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation (\"OEFC\"), and US Coal and Wind and Solar successfully drove down their costs of generation.\nAs expected, the performance of our Canadian Coal segment, on a year-over-year basis, was negatively impacted by higher coal costs, and higher operating, maintenance, and administrative costs. In 2016, the Canadian Coal segment benefitted from the reversal of an $80 million provision for the Keephills outage in 2013.\n\"Solid performance by our operating team in 2017 allowed us to deliver financial performance over our expectations,\" said Dawn Farrell, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"By the end of 2018, our de-leveraging program will be mostly complete, and we'll be poised to reconsider how we allocate capital to enhance shareholder value.\"\nWith the early repayment of our US$500 million bond this month, the better than expected performance from the business, and the strong outlook for 2018, we are confident in the execution of our plan for 2018 to 2020 and are therefore allocating more capital to our shareholders. Consequently, the Company intends to seek Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") acceptance of a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\"). The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchases of up to 14,000,000 of its common shares, representing approximately five per cent of TransAlta's public float. Purchases under the NCIB are expected to be made through open market transactions on the TSX and any alternative Canadian trading platforms, based on the prevailing market price. Any Common Shares purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled.\nAt the end of the year our total net debt was approximately $3.4 billion, down $530 million from the beginning of the year, due to the scheduled repayment of a US$400 million Senior Note using existing liquidity. Our adjusted FFO to adjusted net debt and adjusted net debt to comparable EBITDA metrics improved significantly to 20.4 per cent and 3.6 times, respectively.\n2018 Outlook\nTransAlta reaffirms its financial outlook for 2018 which was released on December 6, 2017 and is outlined in the table below:\nMeasure\nLow\nHigh\nComparable EBITDA (1)\n$950 million\n$1,050 million\nFFO (1)\n$725 million\n$800 million\nFCF (1)\n$275 million\n$350 million\nFCF (1) Including PPA Termination Payment\n$475 million\n$550 million\nSustaining and Productivity Capital\n$215 million\n$235 million\nRange of key power price assumptions:\nMarket\nPower Prices ($/MWh)\nAlberta Spot\n$50 to $60\nAlberta Contracted\n$35 to $40\nMid-C Spot (US$)\n$20 to $25\nMid-C Contracted (US$)\n$47 to $53\nOther assumptions relevant to 2018 outlook:\nCanadian Coal Capacity Factor\n65% to 75%\nHydro/Wind Resource\nLong term average\n2018 Key Priorities\nIn addition to meeting the financial targets set out in the outlook, everything we do in 2018 will move us closer to 100% clean power by 2025. Our teams are focused on the following:\nBlending our coal with gas to reduce costs, emissions and carbon tax expenses; Progressing the conversion of our coal plants to 100% natural gas; Growing our renewables platform; Increasing our financial flexibility through the execution of our de-leveraging program; and Continuing to lead in safety and environment performance.\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nEntered into a Letter of Intent with Tidewater Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd. for the construction of a 120 kilometre natural gas pipeline to TransAlta's generating units at Sundance and Keephills. The pipeline will facilitate TransAlta's strategy to convert its coal units to natural gas.\nAnnounced the acceleration of the conversion of Sundance Units 3 to 6 and Keephills Units 1 and 2 from coal-fired generation to gas-fired generation in the 2021 to 2022 timeframe, a year earlier than originally planned.\nClarified the optimization plan for the Sundance units in 2018 and 2019 to ensure that two Sundance coal units can operate at high capacity utilizations with lower costs through the period to 2020.\nGained carbon credits for existing renewable assets, specifically our wind and hydro generation, under Alberta's output based allocation system for carbon emissions which became effective January 1, 2018.\nTransAlta Renewables received approximately US$325 million from Fortescue Metals Group for the repurchase of the Solomon power station, and used a portion of those funds to redeem the outstanding $215 million convertible unsecured subordinated debentures held by TransAlta.\nImportant Subsequent Events\nOn February 20, 2018, TransAlta Renewables entered into an arrangement to acquire two construction ready wind projects, consisting of a 90 MW project in Pennsylvania and a 29 MW project in New Hampshire, supported by long-term contracts with highly creditworthy counterparties.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Segmented Review\nComparable EBITDA\n(in CAD$ millions)\n3 Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDec. 31, 2017\nDec. 31, 2016\nDec. 31, 2017\nDec. 31, 2016\nCanadian Coal\n66\n178\n324\n473\nU.S. Coal\n21\n14\n89\n41\nCanadian Gas\n62\n70\n263\n244\nAustralian Gas\n29\n32\n137\n128\nWind and Solar\n78\n66\n214\n195\nHydro\n14\n20\n75\n82\nEnergy Marketing\n25\n13\n45\n52\nCorporate\n(20)\n(19)\n(85)\n(71)\nTotal Comparable EBITDA\n275\n374\n1,062\n1,144\nCanadian Coal: Comparable EBITDA for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017 decreased $149 million compared to 2016, primarily due to the impact in 2016 of the reversal of an $80 million provision for the Keephills outage in 2013. EBITDA for 2017 was negatively impacted during the year by higher coal costs, and higher OM&A costs. U.S. Coal: Comparable EBITDA increased $48 million compared to 2016 due to increased sales volumes that led to increased margins from higher market prices and higher contract rates. Lower coal transportation costs and the favourable impact of mark-to-market on forward financial contracts also had a positive impact to comparable EBITDA. Canadian Gas: Comparable EBITDA for 2017 increased by $19 million compared to 2016, primarily due to the settlement with the OEFC of the retroactive adjustment to price indices at Ottawa and Windsor and the positive impact from the mothballing of our Mississauga gas facility. This was partially offset by a reduction in unrealized mark-to-market positions for gas contracts and the lower earnings at Windsor under a new peaking contract. Australian Gas: Comparable EBITDA for the year increased by $9 million compared to 2016, due to the commissioning of the South Hedland power station and an increase in customer load, partially offset by the early termination of the lease for our Solomon power station. Wind and Solar: Comparable EBITDA for 2017 increased $19 million compared to 2016, primarily driven by higher volumes at contracted facilities, higher prices on contracted and uncontracted assets, and lower costs on some service agreements. Hydro: Comparable EBITDA for 2017 decreased $7 million compared to 2016. The decrease was due to higher OM&A, and a $3 million positive adjustment in 2016 relating to a prior year metering issue at one of our facilities. Energy Marketing: Comparable EBITDA for 2017 from Energy Marketing decreased $7 million compared to 2016, due to unfavourable first quarter results which were impacted by warm winter weather in the Northeast, significant precipitation in the Pacific Northwest, and reduced margins from our customer business. Corporate: Our Corporate overhead costs were $14 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016, due to higher annual incentive compensation and our Greenlight initiative costs, which we expect will translate into significant long-term cost savings.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders was $190 million ($0.66 net loss per share) compared to net earnings of $117 million ($0.41 net earnings per share) in 2016. Earnings in 2017 were negatively impacted by lower comparable EBITDA of $82 million, and $105 million due to the reduction of the U.S. tax rate announced in December. Higher depreciation of $34 million year-over-year was due mostly to: $80 million higher depreciation at Canadian Coal due to the shortening of the useful lives of Keephills 3 and Genesee 3, and higher depreciation at Australian Gas of $20 million due to the commissioning of South Hedland in July, partially offset by lower depreciation at Canadian Gas of $62 million due primarily to the accelerated depreciation of the Mississauga facility in 2016. Last year, Canadian Gas included a $48 million positive impact in connection with the Mississauga re-contracting.\nTotal sustaining capital expenditures of $235 million were $35 million lower compared to 2016. Total capital expenditures of $259 million, which includes productivity capital expenditures, were $21 million lower than 2016 and in-line with our guidance for the year. Our productivity capital includes funding for Project Greenlight transformation initiatives, which are expected to reach payback within two years and result in annual recurring savings.\nFourth Quarter and Year Ended 2017 Highlights\nIn $CAD millions, unless otherwise\nstated\n3 Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDec. 31,\n2017\nDec. 31,\n2016\nDec. 31,\n2017\nDec. 31,\n2016\nAdjusted availability (%) (2,3)\n88.4%\n88.9%\n86.8%\n89.2%\nProduction (GWh) (3)\n10,374\n10,624\n36,900\n38,157\nRevenue\n638\n717\n2,307\n2,397\nComparable EBITDA (1,4)\n275\n374\n1,062\n1,144\nNet Earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders\n(145)\n61\n(190)\n117\nFFO (1,4)\n219\n200\n804\n734\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\n81\n122\n626\n744\nFCF (1,4)\n101\n62\n328\n257\nNet Earnings (loss) per common share\n($0.50)\n$0.21\n($0.66)\n$0.41\nFFO per share (1,4)\n$0.76\n$0.69\n$2.79\n$2.55\nFCF per share (1,4)\n$0.35\n$0.22\n$1.14\n$0.89\nDividends declared per common share\n$0.04\n$0.08\n$0.12\n$0.20\nTransAlta is in the process of filing its Annual Information Form, Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes, as well as the associated Management's Discussion & Analysis (\"MD&A\").

Presenting these items from period to period provides management and investors with the ability to evaluate earnings trends more readily in comparison with prior periods' results. Refer to the Comparable Funds from Operations and Comparable Free Cash Flow and Earnings and Other Measures on a Comparable Basis sections of the Company's MD&A for further discussion of these items, including, where applicable, reconciliations to measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.\n(2) Availability and production includes all generating assets (generation operations and finance leases that we operate).\n(3) Adjusted for economic dispatching at U.S. Coal.\n(4) During the fourth quarter of 2017, we revised our approach to reporting adjustments to arrive at FFO, mainly to better represent FFO as a cash metric. Previously, FFO was adjusted to include, exclude, or to modify the timing of cash impacts related to adjustments made in arriving at comparable EBITDA. As a result, comparable EBITDA, FFO, and FCF for 2016 has been revised accordingly.\nAbout TransAlta Corporation:\nTransAlta owns, operates and develops a diverse fleet of electrical power generation assets in Canada, the United States and Australia with a focus on long-term shareholder value.
