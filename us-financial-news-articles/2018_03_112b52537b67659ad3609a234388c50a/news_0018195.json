This press release also includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, specifically projected non-GAAP net revenues and non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the second fiscal quarter and full fiscal year 2018. The corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, to the extent available without unreasonable effort, are included in this press release.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help it to evaluate Verifone's performance and operations and to compare Verifone's current results with those for prior periods as well as with the results of peer companies. Verifone incurs, due to differences in debt, capital structure and investment history, geographic presence and associated currency impacts, certain income and expense items, such as stock based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other non-cash expenses that differ significantly from Verifone's competitors. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect Verifone's reported operating performance without such items. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in Verifone's budget and planning process. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors in comparing Verifone's operating performance in any period with its performance in other periods and with the performance of other companies that represent alternative investment opportunities. These non-GAAP financial measures contain limitations and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, disclosures made in accordance with GAAP.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and may, therefore, differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all amounts and costs, such as acquisition related costs, employee stock-based compensation costs, income taxes and restructuring charges, associated with Verifone's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFurthermore, Verifone expects to continue to incur income and expense items that are similar to those that are excluded by the non-GAAP adjustments described herein. Management compensates for these limitations by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nOur GAAP and non-GAAP net revenues are presented for our four main geographic regions: North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific. North America includes the US and Canada. Latin America includes South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean. EMEA includes Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa. Asia-Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand, China, India and throughout the rest of Greater Asia, including other Asia-Pacific Rim countries.\nNote A: Non-GAAP net revenues, costs of goods sold and gross margin . Non-GAAP net revenues exclude the fair value decrease (step-down) in deferred revenue at acquisition. Non-GAAP costs of goods sold exclude the costs of goods associated with the fair value decrease (step-down) in deferred revenue at acquisition. Although the step-down of deferred revenue fair value at acquisition and associated costs of goods sold are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, they result in net revenues and gross margins immediately post-acquisition that are lower than net revenues and gross margins that would be recognized in accordance with GAAP on those same services if they were sold under contracts entered into post-acquisition. Accordingly, we adjust the step-down to achieve comparability to net revenues and gross margins of the acquired entity earned pre-acquisition and to our GAAP net revenues and gross margins to be earned on contracts sold in future periods. These adjustments, which relate to our acquisition of AJB during February 2016, enhance the ability of our management and our investors to assess our financial performance and trends. These non-GAAP net revenues, costs of goods sold and gross margin amounts are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP disclosures of net revenues, costs of goods sold and gross margin, and should be read together with our GAAP disclosures.\nNote B: Non-GAAP net revenues, gross margin, and operating income from divested businesses. Verifone determines non-GAAP net revenues, gross margin and operating income from divested businesses as the amounts in the reporting period that are derived from significant businesses that have been divested, such as our China business and taxi solution business, which were sold in June 2017 and December 2017, respectively.\nNote C: Adjusted Non-GAAP net revenues at constant currency . Verifone determines non-GAAP net revenues at constant currency by recomputing non-GAAP net revenues adjusted to exclude divested businesses denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars in the current fiscal period using average exchange rates for that particular currency during the corresponding financial period of the prior year. Verifone uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate business performance and trends on a comparable basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nNote D: Amortization of intangible assets. Verifone incurs amortization of intangible assets in connection with its acquisitions, such as amortization of finite lived customer relationships intangibles. We are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price of each business acquisition to the intangible assets acquired and to amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Because these amounts have no direct correlation to Verifone’s underlying business operations, we eliminate these amortization charges and any associated minority interest impact from our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre-acquisition and post-acquisition operating results. In addition, Verifone's equity method investee companies incur amortization of intangible assets. Because these amounts have no direct correlation to those business' underlying business operations, we also eliminate these amortization charges, net of tax, from our non-GAAP other income and expense to provide better comparability of operating results.\nNote E: Merger and Acquisition Related . Verifone adjusts for contingent consideration fair market value adjustments and interest on contingent consideration that are the result of mergers and acquisitions. In connection with its acquisitions, Verifone owes contingent consideration payments based upon the post-acquisition performance of and other factors related to acquired businesses. These contingent consideration liabilities are reported at fair market value and incur non-cash imputed interest. Changes in the fair market value of contingent consideration and imputed interest expense vary independent of our ongoing operating results and have no direct correlation to our underlying business operations. Accordingly, Verifone excludes these amounts from our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre-acquisition and post-acquisition operating results.\nNote F: Stock-Based Compensation . Our non-GAAP financial measures eliminate the effect of expense for stock-based compensation because they are non-cash expenses and, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types which affect the calculations of stock-based compensation, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies. Stock-based compensation is very different from other forms of compensation. A cash salary or bonus has a fixed and unvarying cash cost. In contrast the expense associated with a stock based award is unrelated to the amount of compensation ultimately received by the employee; and the cost to the company is based on valuation methodology and underlying assumptions that may vary over time and does not reflect any cash expenditure by the company. Furthermore, the expense associated with granting an employee a stock based award can be spread over multiple years and may be reversed based on forfeitures which may differ from our original assumptions unlike cash compensation expense which is typically recorded contemporaneously with the time of award or payment. Accordingly, we believe that excluding stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP operating results facilitates better understanding of our long-term business performance and enhances period-to-period comparability.\nNote G: Other Charges and Income . Verifone excludes certain expenses, other income (expense) and gains (losses) that we have determined are not reflective of ongoing operating results or that vary independent of business performance. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, we exclude them in our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe these items limit the comparability of our ongoing operations with prior and future periods. These adjustments for other charges and income include:\nTransformation related charges: We have incurred expenses, such as professional services, contract cancellation fees, certain personnel costs and asset impairments related to initiatives to transform, streamline, centralize and restructure our global operations. Charges include involuntary termination costs, costs to cancel facility leases, asset impairments, write down of net assets and liabilities held for sale, and associated legal and other advisory fees. Each of these items has been incurred in connection with discrete activities in furtherance of specific business objectives in light of prevailing circumstances, and each item and the associated activity or activities have had differing impacts on our business operations. We do not incur costs of this nature in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, management assesses our operating performance with these amounts included and excluded, and we believe that by providing this information, users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider to be our continuing operations and compare our current operating performance to our past operating performance.\nCosts associated with litigation and other loss contingencies: Our non-GAAP operating results do not include costs associated with litigation and other loss contingencies, penalties and settlements. These costs and loss contingencies relate to events that occurred in prior periods and their ultimate amount and resolution are uncorrelated with our operating performance during the current period. Accordingly, we believe that excluding such amounts provides a better indication of our business performance in the current period and enhances the comparability of our business performance across periods.\nNote H: Income Tax Effect of Non-GAAP exclusions. Income taxes are adjusted for the tax effect of the adjusting items related to our non-GAAP financial measures and to reflect our best estimate of taxes on a non-GAAP basis, in order to provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going comparable performance.\nNote I: Non-GAAP diluted shares . Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding are the same in all periods except where there is a GAAP net loss. In accordance with GAAP, we do not consider dilutive shares in periods that there is a net loss. However, in periods when we have a non-GAAP net income and a GAAP basis net loss, diluted non-GAAP weighted average shares include additional shares that are dilutive for non-GAAP computations of earnings per share.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180308006189/en/\nVerifone\nInvestor Relations:\nChris Mammone, 408-232-7230\nir@verifone.com\nor\nMedia Relations:\nKwiyoung Baumgarten, 770-754-3460\npress@verifone.com\nSource: Verifone", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.verifone.com&esheet=51770468&newsitemid=20180308006189&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.verifone.com&index=1&md5=57649134a695136cecca1fa57b53cb7e", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verifone.com%2Fen%2Fus&esheet=51770468&newsitemid=20180308006189&lan=en-US&anchor=Verifone.com&index=2&md5=df0309c7e3b393be11e035882b196681", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180308006189/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.verifone.com&esheet=51770468&newsitemid=20180308006189&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.verifone.com&index=3&md5=ac8c5317c56181fa8af9a738dfe1c618"], "published": "2018-03-09T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T02:04:08.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
