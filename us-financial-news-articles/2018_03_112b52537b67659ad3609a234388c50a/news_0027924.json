Qualcomm declined comment. The U.S. Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment.\nShares of Broadcom rose more than 3.5 percent on Monday while Qualcomm's stock edged lower.\nDue to the CFIUS investigation, Qualcomm delayed by a month to April 5 its annual meeting, during which shareholders will vote on Broadcom's slate of six nominees to Qualcomm's 11-member board.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Intel Corp's competitive concern about Broadcom's attempt to buy mobile chip rival Qualcomm had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom. Intel has played down the reported interest.
