When I turned around I saw they were shooting point blank at the people in front of the hotel,” he said.\nAt least three people, a soldier guarding the entrance and two hotel workers, were struck by bullets. The soldier later succumbed to his injuries, Karambe and a second witness said.\nOne attacker was also killed.\n“I saw the body of one of the attackers lying on the ground. He had been shot by that same soldier before he was himself gunned down by the other assailants,” said Barema Kassogue, who sells antiques near the hotel.\nThe Hotel la Falaise was once popular with tourists visiting the Dogon people, who inhabit the cliffs of Mali’s central plateau.\nHowever, the area’s tourism industry dried up after Islamist groups, some with links to al Qaeda, seized Mali’s desert north in 2012. They were driven back by a French-led military intervention a year later, but attacks remain frequent.\nThe hotel now mainly caters to humanitarian aid workers responding to the consequences of the violence.\nPrime Minister Maiga and eight of his ministers began a nine-stop national tour last week aimed at shoring up support for the government of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita ahead of national elections planned for July 29.\nThe trip included stops in several areas senior government officials rarely visit because of security concerns.\nCentral Mali’s once peaceful Mopti region, which includes Bandiagara, has become a new flashpoint for violence over the past year as marginalized Fulani herdsmen have joined forces with al Qaeda-allied Islamists based farther north.\nReporting by Cheikh Amadou Diouara; Writing by Joe Bavier; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T01:47:35.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
