Bahraini, Qatari, and UAE officials could not be reached for comment.\nSince January, the Gulf states have traded accusations over infringements of their respective airspace. In June 2017, the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Egypt cut political, economic and transport ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting Islamist extremists. Qatar denies the accusations.\nThe dispute has the potential to disrupt flights in a region with millions of travelers each year. Qatar Airways has flown longer routes since the UAE blocked it from its airspace.\nA passenger jet belonging to Dubai’s Emirates, the region’s biggest airline, was involved in a January incident when two Qatari air force jets allegedly flew dangerously close.\nDoha denies the allegations.\nIn June, ICAO’s governing council is expected to hear arguments by the Gulf states over the boycott, which Qatar is challenging, said the second source.\nICAO last year helped Qatar Airways access contingency routes over international waters.\n(This version of the story has been refiled to show that ICAO has 192 member states, not 191, in fifth paragraph.)\nReporting by Allison Lampert and Alexander Cornwell; editing by Bernadette Baum and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:54:06.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
