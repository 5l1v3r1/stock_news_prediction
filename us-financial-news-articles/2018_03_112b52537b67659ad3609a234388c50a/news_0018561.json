The S&P 500 gained 0.37 percent to 2,736.94 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.49 percent to 7,432.77.\nExpress Scripts was among the top boosts to the S&P 500, rising 14 percent after health insurer Cigna agreed to buy the pharmacy benefits manager for $54-billion deal. Cigna shares slipped 7.6 percent.\nThe deal boosted the S&P healthcare index, up 0.29 percent. But the top gainers were industrials and technology stocks.\nKroger fell 8.8 percent after the supermarket chain issued a disappointing full-year profit forecast.\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters turned 9 percent lower after trading up premarket.\nA Labor Department report showed initial jobless claims rebounded from a more than 48-year low last week, but the trend continued to point to robust labor market conditions.\nA comprehensive reading on jobs and wage is expected on Friday. The average hourly earnings is expected to slow to 2.8 percent in February on an annualized basis, from 2.9 percent in January.\nInvestors are worried that higher wages could lead to faster interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and make borrowing expensive for companies.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,835 to 606. On the Nasdaq, 1,641 issues rose and 655 fell.
