It is due to announce final results later in March.\nIn November, the Supreme Court of Western Australia awarded Australian businessman Clive Palmer’s company about $150 million in damages in a dispute with CITIC regarding Sino Iron mine.\nCITIC had in January filed an appeal regarding the judgment.\nIn its 2016 results the Chinese company made a non-cash impairment charge of HK$7.2 billion on the Sino Iron mine due to lower forecasts for the long-term price of iron ore.\n(Corrects stock code for CITIC in first paragraph.)\nReporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T03:56:38.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
