REUTERS/Mike Blake It was a celebratory moment at an uncertain time for the studio, one of several Fox film and television businesses in the process of being sold to Walt Disney Co.\nFox Searchlight has now collected the Academy Award for best picture a total of four times since 2009 winner“Slumdog Millionaire,” and it has built a reputation for taking chances on unusual movies that appeal to independent film fans.\n“The place I like to live the most is Fox Searchlight,”“Shape of Water” director Guillermo del Toro said as he accepted the best director award.\nDel Toro said studio executives heard his pitch about a fairy tale involving an amphibian god and a mute woman, told in the style of a thriller. Their response? They felt it was“a sure bet,” he said.\nFox Searchlight collected six awards overall, including best actress and supporting actor for dark comedy“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.”\nAt Disney, the film studio focuses on blockbuster franchises such as“The Avengers” and“Star Wars,” raising questions about how much it might invest in lower-budget movies likely to yield smaller box-office returns.\nDisney Chief Executive Bob Iger has praised Fox Searchlight’s work and offered assurances that high-quality, low-cost films have a place at his company, but he has given few details about his plans for Fox’s film units. Disney also is buying the 20th Century Fox studio which produces blockbusters like“Planet of the Apes.”\nThe company’s purchase of Fox businesses is undergoing regulatory review that is expected to take at least a year. Comcast Corp has launched a rival bid for one asset — Britain’s Sky PLC — which has complicated the deal.\n90th Academy Awards - Oscars Backstage - Hollywood, California, U.S., 04/03/2018 - Paul Denham Austerberry, Shane Vieau and Jeffrey A.
