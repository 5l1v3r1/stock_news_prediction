The deal was called off in August.\nLoss before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items stood at 4.4 million pounds ($6.20 million) for the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of 3.9 million pounds a year earlier.\nDX Freight was underperforming, the company said. The freight unit reported a wider 16 pct EBITDA loss of 10.9 million pounds during the period.\n“Trading conditions remain challenging, but we are already seeing encouraging signs that our turnaround plans are gaining traction and expect this to build through the year and into 2019.”\nThe mail, parcels and courier services company also said it incurred an impairment charge of 5.3 million pounds, related to its turnaround plan.\n$1 = 0.7102 pounds Reporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:05:25.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
