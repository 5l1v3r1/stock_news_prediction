In the first, the scandal hits Abe, shakes Abenomics and weakens the BOJ’s monetary easing, prompting bond yields to rise,” said Katsutoshi Inadome, senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n“In the second scenario, Abe emerges from the scandal with less damage. And if he survives, Abe could try to prop up his support ratings with a fresh round of monetary easing, and that would push down JGB yields.”\nJGBs were pressured by stronger stock prices, but this was offset by the BOJ’s regular debt-buying operation.\nThe five-year and 10-year JGB yields were unchanged at minus 0.120 percent and 0.045 percent, respectively. The 30-year yield was also flat, at 0.755 percent.\nThe BOJ on Monday bought 710 billion yen ($6.66 billion) of five- to 40-year JGBs as part of its regular debt-purchasing scheme.\nWhile the political scandal did shave part of the earlier gains, Japan’s Nikkei still managed to gain 1.65 percent, buoyed by Wall Street’s rally on Friday.
