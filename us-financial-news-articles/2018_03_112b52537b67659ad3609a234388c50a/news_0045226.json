The murders are often carried out by family members who believe the relationship has brought “shame” on their community.\nMany killings are instigated by village councils - or “khap panchayats” - comprised of unelected men of a particular clan or caste, according to human rights activists.\nCalling for a crackdown on the practice, Kant filed a public interest litigation in 2010, which described instances where couples were beaten, had their heads shaved, and were sometimes set on fire at the behest of these “kangaroo courts”.\nIn some cases, couples were penalized with “social boycotts” in which they were banished from the community and denied access to temples, wells, markets and celebrations.\n“The collective behaves like a patriarchal monarch which treats the wives, sisters and daughters subordinate, even servile or self-sacrificing,” said three judges in their ruling.\nWhile their power has diminished since 1992 when elected village councils were made mandatory, the khap panchayats remain powerful in socially conservative regions such as Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan states, and parts of Uttar Pradesh.\nThe killings have instilled a “chilling sense of fear” among young people who want to get married, Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra said in the ruling, which called for preventive, remedial and punitive measures.\nThe court suggested safe houses for couples, video-recordings of khap panchayat meetings, and a law to prosecute honor killings.\nAdditional reporting by Suchitra Mohanty in New Delhi, Editing by Jared FerriePlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking and climate change.
