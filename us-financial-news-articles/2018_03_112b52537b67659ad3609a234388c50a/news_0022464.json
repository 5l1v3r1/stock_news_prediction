Iamgold Corp fell 2.9 percent to C$6.34, while Eldorado Gold Corp lost 3.1 percent to C$1.41. * The losses in the commodity-related sectors were offset by a better tone in global markets as world stocks surged to a two-week high. * In Toronto, financial shares helped support the market, with the sector up 0.2 percent. Bank of Nova Scotia was one of the biggest lifts on the index, edging up 0.4 percent to C$81.03. * The TSX posted two new 52-week highs and three new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were 32 new 52-week highs and nine new lows. Volume on the TSX index was 21.19 million shares.
