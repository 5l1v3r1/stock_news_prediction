That would put in him in good standing with Trump's views, said Cramer, who worked for years on their onetime CNBC show, \"Kudlow and Cramer.\" \nBut like Cohn, Kudlow has said recently on CNBC he would have advised the president not to pursue tariffs as a way to bring China and other unfair traders to heel. Kudlow was an informal advisor to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. \nWhile much of the speculation surrounding a Kudlow pick was around trade on Monday, Stockman said any drag from trade policy is far outweighed by the looming Trump \"fiscal disaster.\" \nKudlow thinks the U.S. economy can grow its way out of rising deficits, but this late in the business cycle post-Great Recession that's not possible, Stockman argued. \nIn his reporting, Cramer, host of CNBC's \" Mad Money ,\" stressed that no decision by Trump has been made on Kudlow or anyone else to take Cohn's place.
