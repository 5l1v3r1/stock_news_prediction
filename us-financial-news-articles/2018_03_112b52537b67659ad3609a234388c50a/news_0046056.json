Even in morning trade on Monday, most Asian markets struggled for gains.\nIn Australia, the benchmark ASX 200 closed down 30.20 points, or 0.52 percent, at 5,790.50. The heavily weighted financial sector was down 0.84 percent.\nMajor banking stocks in the country fell — shares of ANZ declined 0.65 percent, Commonwealth Bank was down 1.09 percent and the National Australia Bank dropped 0.66 percent. Westpac shares were down 0.62 percent.\nIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 retraced losses to climb late in the trading session, closing up 148.24 points, or 0.72 percent, at 20,766.10. The Topix index rose 6.38 points, or 0.38 percent, to 1,671.32.\nAcross the Korean Strait, the Kospi climbed 20.32 points, or 0.84 percent, to 2,437.08.\nReuters reported that the U.S. agreed to exempt South Korea from steel tariffs and instead would impose a quota on steel imports. In return, South Korea said it would improve access for U.S. carmakers under the bilateral trade agreement deal known as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement.\nElsewhere, Chinese mainland markets finished mixed, with the Shanghai composite down 18.83 points, or 0.6 percent, at 3,133.92 while the Shenzhen composite rose 23.74 points, or 1.34 percent, to 1,790.35.\nIn Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index erased losses to climb 239.48 points, or 0.79 percent, to 30,548.77.\nBeijing on Friday said it may target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion in response to President Donald Trump 's executive order earlier this month that imposed broad duties on foreign aluminum and steel imports.\nTrump had also announced tariff plans for up to $60 billion in Chinese imports , although China did not officially connect its Friday threats of retaliation to that White House action.\nOn Saturday, some of the world's top economists and business leaders at the China Development Forum in Beijing warned about the risks of a trade war between the two economic powerhouses. Nobel-prize winning economists Robert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz predicted pain ahead for the U.S. economy if Beijing and Washington ramp up tit-for-tat trade penalties.\nStill, Michael Froman, who served as U.S. Trade Representative during President Barack Obama 's second term in the White House, told CNBC that the Trump administration's concerns about China were \"legitimate.\"\nSymbol Name Price Change %Change NIKKEI --- HSI --- ASX 200 --- SHANGHAI --- KOSPI --- CNBC 100 --- One market commentator said there was \"clearly a fair amount of damage done\" from the week's developments, after markets sold off in Asia, Europe and the United States.\n\"Whether this is the sole cause of latest risk market ructions is debatable,\" Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at the National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note. He added that others were suggesting confidence in continued strong synchronized global growth may be slipping, following disappointing economic data.\nHe added that \"rising geopolitical tension\" should also be noted, following the tapping of John Bolton to be Trump's new national security advisor.\n\"This has heightened concerns that Trump will formally repudiate the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that Bolton is on record as saying was a mistake ,\" Attrill said.\nIn the currency market, the dollar index traded around 89.333 at 3:48 p.m. HK/SIN, falling from levels above 90 in the previous week.\nAmong currency majors, the Japanese yen traded at 105.1 to the dollar, weakening from an earlier high of 104.55.\nMajor export stocks in the country finished mixed — Toyota shares rose 0.59 percent, Honda added 0.46 percent while Canon was up 0.16 percent. Sony shares fell 0.33 percent.\nA relatively weak yen is usually a positive for exporters because it increases their overseas profits when converted into the local currency.\nAnalysts at Singapore's DBS Bank said in a morning note that risk aversion is likely to persist in the markets amid the U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\"As long as Washington and Beijing keep up their tit-for-tat trade war rhetoric and actions, safe haven play is likely to drive the Japanese yen stronger against the euro and the Australian dollar,\" they said in the note.\nThe euro/yen pair traded at 130.1 at 3:51 p.m. HK/SIN while the Australian dollar/yen traded at 81.3. Elsewhere, the Australian dollar fetched $0.7736 and the euro traded at $1.2380.\nOil prices fell on Monday with U.S. crude down 0.77 percent at $65.37 a barrel at 3:52 p.m. HK/SIN.
