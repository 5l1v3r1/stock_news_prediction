The case, which has been referred to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution, comes almost a year after Takata launched a recall of about 125 million vehicles worldwide due to faulty airbags. The Commission said the alleged violation of competition rules took place between 2007 and 2008. The contracts were with Honda, Toyota and BMW.
