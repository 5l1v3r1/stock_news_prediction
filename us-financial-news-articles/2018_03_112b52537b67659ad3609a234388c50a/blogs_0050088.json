It listed on the Nasdaq (DBX) last week and Houston’s personal net worth shot up into the billions.\nHouston started Dropbox in 2007 with his MIT classmate, Arash Ferdowsi. They were both in their 20’s and didn’t know much about business, let alone how to run a company back then. As Houston puts it, “we were just getting the company off the ground and coding in a little room.”\nAn avid reader, Houston eventually turned to business books to learn about leading a company. Books by Andy Grove, the CEO of Intel and one of Silicon Valley’s iconic entrepreneurs, were his favorites. “I really admire everything that he did,” Houston gushes.\nAs he looks to the future, Houston has big plans on expanding Dropbox into selling business software to large enterprise businesses. He’s also talking more like a leader of a public company.\n“A big part of my job is helping everybody to stay focused on what I call our inner scorecard,” he says, adding that he can’t control the markets or Dropbox’s stock price. “What we can control is ‘are you building great products. Are your customers happy.’ If we take care of our inner scorecard, the outer scorecard will take care of itself.”\nWatch the video above for more from our interview with Houston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:16:07.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
