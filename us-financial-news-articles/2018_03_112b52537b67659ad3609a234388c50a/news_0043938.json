REUTERS/Andrew Kelly The securities industry averaged 176,900 jobs in New York City last year, down slightly after three straight years of gains.\nEmployment in the industry, a key component of the city’s economy, remains 6 percent smaller than before the financial crisis in 2007.\nProfits for the broker-dealer operations of New York Stock Exchange member firms meanwhile jumped 42 percent to $24.5 billion, the highest level since 2010, driven by growth in wealth management fees, underwriting and M&A advisory fees, the report said.\n“It is too soon to tell how increased volatility in the financial markets might impact profits in 2018,” New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in the report.\nThe report is based on tax withholding data and does not include stock options or other forms of deferred compensation.\nReporting by Reade Levinson; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T19:44:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
