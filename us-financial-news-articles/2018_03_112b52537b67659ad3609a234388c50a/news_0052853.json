It is hoped that following a period of suspension, the players will be able to return to playing the game they love and eventually rebuild their careers.” FINANCIAL FALLOUT \nSmith and Warner have also been stood down from their Indian Premier League (IPL) teams for 2018, representing a significant loss of income after the Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad had paid $1.84-million respectively for their services. \n“First, we waited for ICC’s (International Cricket Council) decision, after that Cricket Australia’s and then we decided on the matter,” IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla told reporters. \n“We have decided to bar them from this season. The replacements will be made available to the two teams. We did not take any decision in haste, it was a well thought-out decision.” \nThere is more financial fallout possible with multinational electronics company LG having already said they will not renew a sponsorship with Warner, while several other partners of Cricket Australia are reviewing their positions in light of the embarrassing scandal. \nThe bans leave the careers of the players on hold, but the damage to the reputation of all three will likely be much more long-lasting and for Warner, 31, it may well spell the end of his international career. \nIt is also a dizzying fall from grace for Smith, who had been touted as the ‘next Don Bradman’ and the golden boy of Australian cricket, but now needs to repair public trust and answer questions as to why he allowed a scandal that has rocked the sport. \nThe players will be available for the World Cup in England and Wales that starts on May 30 next year, as well as the Ashes later in the English summer. \nThe trio will be replaced for the fourth and final test at The Wanderers in Johannesburg by opening batsmen Matthew Renshaw and Joe Burns, as well as all-rounder Glenn Maxwell. \nSouth Africa lead what has been a tempestuous series 2-1 having not enjoyed a home series success against the Australians since 1970.
