(Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced the expiration of the tender offer (the “Offer”) by a wholly owned subsidiary, “Merger Sub”, for all of the shares of common stock of Cascadian Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:CASC), for a price of $10.00 per share in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes. The Offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on March 9, 2018. Seattle Genetics expects to complete today the acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics through a merger without a vote of Cascadian Therapeutics stockholders pursuant to Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nThe depositary for the tender offer has advised Seattle Genetics that, as of the expiration of the Offer, a total of 50,195,129 shares had been validly tendered into and not validly withdrawn from the Offer, which tendered shares represent approximately 91% of Cascadian Therapeutics’ outstanding shares of common stock and a sufficient number of shares such that the minimum tender condition to the Offer was satisfied. Additionally, the depositary has advised that an additional 144,625 shares had been tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery, representing less than 1% of the Cascadian Therapeutics shares of common stock outstanding. Accordingly, all shares that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn were accepted for payment and Seattle Genetics will promptly pay for all such tendered shares in accordance with the terms of the Offer.\nAs a result of the merger, Cascadian Therapeutics will become a subsidiary of Seattle Genetics. In the merger, each share of Cascadian Therapeutics (other than shares owned by stockholders who are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal in connection with the merger and shares owned by Seattle Genetics, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Seattle Genetics and shares owned by Cascadian Therapeutics or any wholly owned subsidiary of Cascadian Therapeutics, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the same $10.00 per share in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, that was paid in the Offer. Following completion of the merger, Cascadian Therapeutics common stock will no longer be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which is expected to take effect later today.\nAbout Seattle Genetics\nSeattle Genetics is an innovative biotechnology company dedicated to improving the lives of people with cancer through novel antibody-based therapies.
