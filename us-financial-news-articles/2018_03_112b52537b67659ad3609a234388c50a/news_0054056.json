Two-thirds of Polish weaponry dates from the era when the country was in the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact.\nThe Patriot deal comes as a relief for Poland which remains in tense relations with Washington, its main NATO ally, over a bill that Warsaw introduced in January to impose jail terms for any suggestion of Poland’s complicity in the Holocaust.\nThe United States says the bill subverts freedom of speech. Israeli officials say it amounts to Holocaust denial, an accusation Poland rejects.\nThe Wednesday deal is for four Patriot fire units, and Warsaw is negotiating with Washington to buy more Patriot systems, a new 360-degree radar and a low-cost interceptor missile as part of a second phase of development.\n“We do expect that Poland will move pretty quickly with Phase II. They have a stated desire to complete that by the end of the year,” Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, told Reuters in a telephone interview ahead of the signing.\nThe deal will allow Poland to conduct air and missile defence operations with NATO allies the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Greece, which already have the Patriot systems, U.S. State Department officials have said.
