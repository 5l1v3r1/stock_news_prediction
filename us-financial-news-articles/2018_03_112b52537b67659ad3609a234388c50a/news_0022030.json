Trump has said there was no collusion between Moscow and his campaign and no obstruction.\nOn Sunday, the president tweeted that his lawyers had shown there was no collusion with Russia, and that the “only Collusion was that done by the DNC, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary,” as he calls Hillary Clinton, his opponent in the 2016 presidential race.\nA spokesman for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did a contact for Clinton.\nWhite House officials expressed concern on Saturday about news that “an impeachment lawyer” might join the team, a third source told Reuters.\nFlood advised Bill Clinton in the late 1990s in impeachment proceedings brought by the U.S. House of Representatives and tried before the U.S. Senate, where he was acquitted.\nFlood also spent two years in the White House Counsel’s office, where he handled executive-privilege related disputes for President George W. Bush’s administration to Congressional investigations and other inquiries. He also once clerked for Associate Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\nLast year, Flood turned down a post that ultimately went to Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer now assisting the president with the special counsel’s probe, Reuters reported in July.\nNew York lawyer Marc Kasowitz was leading Trump’s legal team at the time, a role veteran Washington lawyer John Dowd took over last summer.\nDowd told Reuters on Saturday that he had no knowledge of Flood possibly joining the White House legal team, and that Cobb was not leaving as far as he knew.\nAnother source added that Cobb was not expected to leave until the Russia inquiry was over. It is unclear how Flood’s responsibilities might differ from Cobb’s.\nCobb has been cooperating with Mueller in an effort for the White House to put the probe behind it. In August, soon after he took the job, Cobb told Reuters he would be more than embarrassed if the probe were still haunting the White House in 2018. Many experts said that timeline was unrealistic and stating it in public may have been a strategic move by Cobb.\nFlood’s law firm, Williams and Connolly, represents Hillary Clinton, including in the email scandal, one possible reason that sources told Reuters last year the firm turned down representing Trump as outside counsel.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesperson for the law firm could not be reached for comment.\nReporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Diane Craft and Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T04:38:44.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
