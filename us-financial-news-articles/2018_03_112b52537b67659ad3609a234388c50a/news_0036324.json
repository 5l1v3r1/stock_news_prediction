The meeting and banquet facilities stand to serve as overflow for the Ontario Convention Center or a mid-sized alternative for group business, while Landings Restaurant and Lounge offers a convenient onsite dining experience in a stylish setting for breakfast, dinner and dessert.\nWalking distance from the Ontario Convention Center, the hotel also stands to gain from international growth strides happening at Ontario airport.\nAccording to the Ontario International Airport Authority, 54 percent of all passenger demand that originates in Southern California, for travel to Asia, comes from zip codes closer to Ontario airport than LAX. The airport’s governing body recently offered incentives to any carrier that can bring new commercial flights from Asia, Europe, New Zealand and South America. The growth strategies of the airport are also making history as this marks the first transoceanic flight from any Southern California airport other than Los Angeles, due to the favorable length of their runways.\n“We welcome the Holiday Inn brand to our growing portfolio of southern California hotels,” said Gary Gray, chief investment officer of Twenty Four Seven Hotels. “We plan to leverage the proposed renovation as well as the rapidly expanding passenger and cargo volume from the airport to reach even higher revenue performance in the coming years.”\nThe nearby Ontario Mills Shopping Center, Citizens Business Bank Arena and the LA County Fairgrounds are key attractions for leisure travel to this area.\nGuest rooms include standard king or double, along with an inventory of suites providing enhanced living space. A state of the art fitness facility, comprehensive business center and a heated outdoor pool and hot tub are competitive amenities in the area. In addition, Twenty Four Seven Hotels has partnered with Uber for Business to provide airport transportation at all of its airport properties.\n\"With further improvement through renovation coupled with an exceptional hotel management partner possessing local know-how, the new owner is confident that the property shall continue to expand its share of business revenue in this market,” said Charles Yao, managing director of Aberdeen Realty Corp., who represented the new owner in the acquisition of this hotel. “The positive RevPAR growth renaissance Ontario is currently experiencing will increase the hotel's already impressive operating margin.”\nAbout Twenty Four Seven Hotels\nAn entrepreneurial and spirited hospitality company, Twenty Four Seven Hotels delivers highly specialized services in hotel management, investment, and development.
