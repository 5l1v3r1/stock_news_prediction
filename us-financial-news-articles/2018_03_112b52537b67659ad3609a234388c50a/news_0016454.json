Japan’s benchmark Nikkei share average rose more than 2 percent.\nThe greenback had made ground earlier against the yen as some fears of a global trade war receded after Trump imposed import tariffs on steel and aluminium, while softening his stance by announcing exemptions for Canada and Mexico, and leaving open the chance for other countries to obtain their own.\n“There are a lot of potential exemptions, so I think safe haven flows into the yen have abated,” said Roy Teo, investment strategist for LGT Bank in Singapore.\nThe U.S. dollar had tumbled to 16-month lows against the safe-haven yen late last week as concerns about a trade war gripped markets after Trump initially announced his plan for tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminium.\nThe euro nursed its losses after falling on Thursday as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, while acknowledging faster growth in Europe, said regional inflation remained subdued and rising protectionism is a risk.\nDraghi expressed his view on these issues at his news conference after a central bank policy meeting. It overshadowed the ECB’s dropping of a long-standing pledge to increase its bond purchases if needed, a move that briefly spurred buying of the single currency.\nThe euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.2296, after falling 0.8 percent on Thursday.\nLater on Friday, market participants will turn their attention to the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy decision as well as U.S. jobs data.\nAt the two-day meeting ending on Friday, the BOJ is widely expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged.
