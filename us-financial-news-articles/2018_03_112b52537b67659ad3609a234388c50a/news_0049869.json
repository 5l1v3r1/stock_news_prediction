Canada will not be used as a backdoor into other North American markets,” Trudeau said in a statement.\nCanada will also coordinate more closely with its partners to strengthen border enforcement and meet more often with the United States and Mexico, its partners in the NAFTA trade pact, to discuss problems facing the steel and aluminum industries.\nCanada is the biggest supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States. The measures will come into force after a 15-day consultation period.\nTrump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico but suspended them temporarily, saying his final decision would depend on how much progress was made at talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nTrudeau spoke to President Donald Trump on Monday and “raised the strong measures Canada is taking to address unfair trade in steel and aluminum,” according to a separate statement issued by the Canadian prime minister’s office.
