Mexico's Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell speaks during a news conference after attending an auction of shallow-water oil and gas blocks, in Mexico City, Mexico March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Romero \nPemex expects to invests as much as $300 million overall in a four-year exploration phase for the seven contracts it won, more than any other company, said longtime head of exploration, Jose Antonio Escalera. \nPetroleos Mexicanos, as the state-owned company is formally known, grabbed seven of the 35 blocks on offer, either as an individual bidder or in consortia. \nOverall, 16 blocks were awarded in the last tender scheduled before a July presidential election and the energy ministry forecasts investment of as much as $8.6 billion over the lifetime of the contracts.

Members of Mexico's National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) and participants are seen during an auction of shallow-water oil and gas blocks, in Mexico City, Mexico March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Romero \nTotal said in a statement that it will hold a 50 percent stake in block 32, while Pemex, the operator of the block, will hold the other half. The French oil and gas major will be the operator in block 33 where both companies hold equal shares. \nIn block 34, it said BP will be the operator with a 45.5 percent stake. Total will hold 42.5 percent and PanAmerican 15 percent. \nIn recent years, Pemex has sought more equity partnerships in projects to find and extract new streams of oil and gas as a way for the cash-strapped firm to reverse declining output. \n“One thing that makes us very happy is that today we have two new partners,” Escalera said, referring to Cepsa and Total. Slideshow (6 Images) \nPemex has in the past few years entered into partnerships with Australia’s BHP Billiton, U.S. major Chevron, Anglo-Dutch major Royal Dutch Shell, Japan’s Inpex and Germany’s DEA Deutsche Erdoel. \nEscalera said that in Block 29 that Pemex won as an individual bidder, the company plans further study of the area and to begin drilling a first exploration well by the end of 2019 or the start of 2020. \n“In the others, we’ve only committed to further study” in the projects’ initial phase, he said. \nEscalera said the blocks it won in the Tampico-Misantla basin on Tuesday will permit a cost-saving cluster adjacent to another block it won last year with DEA Deutsche Erdoel. \n“This will allow synergies...and in these areas Petroleos Mexicanos already has oil infrastructure in place,” he said. \nMore than 70 percent of Pemex’s current oil and gas production comes from nearby shallow water projects.
