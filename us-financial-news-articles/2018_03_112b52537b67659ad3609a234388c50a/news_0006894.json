Canadian heavy oil producers depend on U.S. refineries to buy much of their output.\nFurther hampering Canada’s ability to hit back, the provision of national security cited by Trump in announcing the tariff means Canada does not automatically get the retaliatory right under WTO rules, Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Economics, said in a research note.\nThe last time Canada prepared for a trade war with the United States, in 2013 over contentious meat labeling rules, it targeted dozens of seemingly random American exports, from cherries and chocolate, to wine and office chairs.\nThe goods had been chosen to hit where key U.S. legislators live, rather than inflict broader economic pain. U.S. industry groups and voters pressed elected officials to avoid retaliation that would have especially hurt their own districts.\n“They tried the charm offensive, it didn’t do the trick,” said Gerry Ritz, who was Canadian agriculture minister in the Conservative government of the time.“They’ve spent a lot of time and money wandering around down there but haven’t hit the right people.\n“You can’t do a shotgun approach, you need more of a one-on-one sniper approach.”\nAdditional reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg; Writing by Andrea Hopkins; Editing by Amran Abocar and Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T06:04:55.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
