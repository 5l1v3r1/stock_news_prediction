Loan growth was down from 8.35 percent in December 2017, when the pace picked up from the previous month’s 13-month low. The regulator, known as OJK, has said it expects more than 12 percent loan growth this year. Indonesia has been struggling to get higher loan growth. The central bank cut its key interest rate by a total of 200 basis points in 2016 and 2017.
