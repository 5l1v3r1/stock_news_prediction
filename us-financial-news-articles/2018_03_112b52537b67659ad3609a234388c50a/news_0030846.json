A trader works on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., March 14, 2018. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly These factors have weighed on sentiment following a burst of market volatility in February that wiped trillions of dollars from world stocks from which investors are yet to recover fully. Here are 10 charts to watch for warning signs of increasing market turmoil, stress in the banking system and investor flight to safety: U.S. YIELD CURVE The gap between 10-year US10YT=RR and 2-year US Treasury yields US2YT=RR. A ‘flattening’ curve is often considered a portent of slowing economic activity, an ‘inverted’ curve has been a reliable predictor of recession. The curve hit its flattest in a decade in January and has flattened further in recent days on demand for safe-haven, long-dated Treasuries.

In times of market stress or financial stress, the yen often strengthens, pushing dollar/yen lower. Earlier this month, dollar/yen hit its lowest level since November 2016. JPY= (For a graphic of the Dollar vs yen click reut.rs/2HFkrg2 ) VIX The benchmark measure of U.S. stock market volatility, sometimes referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”.

According to the St. Louis Fed, the average value of the index since its inception in 1993 is designed to be zero. Thus, zero is viewed as representing normal financial market conditions. Values below zero suggest below-average financial market stress, while values above zero suggest above-average financial market stress. Although still below zero, the index has risen considerably this year.
