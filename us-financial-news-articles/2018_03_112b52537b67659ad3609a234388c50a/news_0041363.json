National Transportation Safety Board/Handout via REUTERS The law firm of Bellah Perez in Glendale, Arizona, said in a statement it was representing the daughter of Elaine Herzberg, who died on Sunday night after being hit by the Uber self-driving SUV in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. “As the first pedestrian death involving an Uber autonomous vehicle, the incident has sparked a national debate about the safety of self-driving cars, exposing the technology’s blind spots and raising questions of liability,” the law firm said in its statement. Herzberg, 49, who was homeless, was walking across a divided four-lane road with her bicycle when she was struck while in the far right-hand lane. A video taken from a dash-mounted camera inside the vehicle that released by Tempe police on Wednesday showed the SUV travelling along a dark street when suddenly the headlights illuminate Herzberg in front of the SUV. She later died from her injuries.
