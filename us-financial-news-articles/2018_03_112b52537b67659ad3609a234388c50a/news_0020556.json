Commodities trader Trafigura took a stake in the mine last year.\nTalvivaara has since tried to find new business under its new name.\n“During the last four years, the company has been able to complete the corporate reorganization proceedings and clean up its balance sheet, but unfortunately developing the company’s own business projects, acquiring new businesses and securing financing for these actions proved an overwhelming task,” Ahtium chairman Tapani Jarvinen said in a statement.\nIn 2016, a Finnish court fined the company and its founder Pekka Pera for environmental damages.\nPera was also handed a suspended eight month sentence last year, after a court ruled the company misled investors by giving unrealistic forecasts for nickel production in 2012-2013. Pera and the company has appealed both rulings.\nAhtium still has about 80,000 Finnish shareholders and its shares have been suspended from trading since 2014. State of Finland owns 7.6 percent of the firm.
