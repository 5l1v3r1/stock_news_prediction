It’s not quite a return to a chronological feed, but it might satisfy some people—and it’s an acknowledgement that Instagram’s algorithms weren’t taking all the right factors into account when determining what users want to see first.\n“With these changes, your feed will feel more fresh, and you won’t miss the moments you care about,” the company said.\nIt also responded to feedback from people who don’t like being continually thrown back to the top of their feed every time it refreshes, making them lose their place.\n“Today we’re testing a ‘New Posts’ button that lets you choose when you want to refresh, rather than it happening automatically,” Instagram said in a blog post . “Tap the button and you’ll be taken to new posts at the top of feed—don’t tap, and you’ll stay where you are.”\nInstagram also said it would be announcing further tweaks to its feed over the next few months.\nThe Facebook-owned image-sharing platform has more than 800 million users. Platforms such as Instagram need to be very cautious when making significant changes to the way they present posts—as Snapchat recently learned.\nWhen Snapchat decided to create two separate streams for regular people’s posts and those of celebrities and brands earlier this year, its users were outraged. Pointed criticism (over Twitter) from reality star Kylie Jenner trimmed the value of parent company Snap by $1 billion, pretty much immediately.", "external_links": ["https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/03/22/changes-to-improve-your-instagram-feed/"], "published": "2018-03-23T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T20:10:42.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
