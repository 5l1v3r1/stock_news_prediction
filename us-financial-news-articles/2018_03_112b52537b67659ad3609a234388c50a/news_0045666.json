AAC gets about 65 percent of its revenue from the United States.\nThe results come amid fears of a trade war between China and the United States, with the latter recently announcing plans to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports.\nChina has already responded to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum by declaring plans to levy additional duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports, including fruit, nuts and wine.\nHowever, worries have eased following reports of behind-the-scenes talks between the United States and China that rekindled hopes that a damaging trade war could be averted.\nAAC’s managing director, Richard Mok, shrugged off risks of a potential trade war at a media briefing in Hong Kong.\n“I think the tariff situation could be resolved,” Mok told reporters. “We are not seeing or expecting trade to bring any mid-to-long term impact on our company.”\nMok, who declined to comment on any customers, said the company targets to grow its revenue by at least 25 percent this year and maintain a gross profit margin higher than 40 percent.\nMok said the company expects its new optics business to benefit from increasing popularity of 3D sensing and hybrid lens cameras in smartphones, though the segment’s revenue contribution ratio is likely to stay in the single digit.\n($1 = 6.2795 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting by Sijia Jiang; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T14:02:55.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
