REUTERS/Issei Kato EURO REVERSES EARLY GAINS The surge in stocks dragged on the Treasury market, which faces a record $294 billion of new supply this week. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR inched up to 2.848 percent, but remained short of last week’s top at 2.90 percent.\nIn currency markets the early reaction was to offload both the yen and the dollar, helping the euro to an early gain.\nBut the single currency later went into reverse after data showed lending to euro zone companies slowed last month, and European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen said underlying euro zone inflation may remain lower than expected even if growth is robust.\nThe dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, .DXY used the euro’s weakness to rally 0.4 percent to 89.424, bouncing off a five-week low hit on Monday.\nThe improved mood on trade earlier pushed China’s yuan to a two-1/2 year high and gave a fillip to industrial commodities, with copper and iron ore bouncing.\nIn oil markets, Brent crude LCOc1 added 31 cents to $70.43 a barrel.\nDaalder said there had been no clear flight to quality since February’s burst of equity market volatility, with scarce volatility in currencies and little movement in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields.\n“It seems to be that the U.S. has lost some of its shine as the safe market to which people turn when things get rough,” said Daalder. “It’s partly the uncertainty in the U.S. itself which is playing a role.”\nAdditional reporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T04:05:01.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
