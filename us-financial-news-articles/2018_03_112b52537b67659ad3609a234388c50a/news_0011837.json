The company also will offer this year eight onshore projects, including 29 oil blocks for partnerships in an auction that will be decided in September-October.\nReporting by Marianna Parraga; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T22:29:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
