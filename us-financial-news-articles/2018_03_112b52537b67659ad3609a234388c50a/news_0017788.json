Corvus’ lead product candidate, CPI-444, a small molecule inhibitor of the A2A receptor, is currently being evaluated in a multicenter Phase 1/1b clinical trial in patients with various solid tumors. This successive expansion cohort trial is examining the activity of CPI-444 both as a single agent and in combination with Genentech’s Tecentriq, an anti-PD-L1 antibody. Corvus is conducting the trial with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, under a clinical trial collaboration the two companies entered into in October 2015. CPI-444 in combination with Tecentriq is also being evaluated in a Phase 1b/2 randomized control trial in non-small cell lung cancer conducted by Genentech.\nTecentriq® is a registered trademark of Genentech.\nInvestor Contact:\nGuillermo Elias, Ph.D.\nDirector, Business Development\nCorvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n+1-650-900-4511\nGElias@corvuspharma.com\nMedia Contact:\nJulie Normart, W2O Group\n415-946-1087\njnormart@w2ogroup.com\nSource:Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=QdClCkGLD4HA3ygjr1Y1PCQSahkdtN1xK9xvdW8_k4F8elanDdSEZNR4_JRTmFw0d3zRZm6GGtTGW1yAmHjqE15cUIlblpOe9LG8sinZZfUI1ZpIDUxh2clam7NfQo6G4bBP8SO6Z_WnH9mGour4Qw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/70c77c96-f27f-4032-aa6c-454977cdd6a2", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H9-VRv6Oux78Jtf8jGXHOqSelX1dc1m_KYNsBeHExyIIH746NoiXsZOQ0boTxd2wd2d8tQ3tGuFGfhNW0znsm7hH6g8Woc09suFje0C_Hhs=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ALYKvAaOUg2yN0sp0rmuM6Cou3hNXaouNQRUWautTMxg6sWhTYgVuAL64Oudb9lGhYaw3zL-65UNTmegPY-B0olRNTK_ubZ4oU_zO6OkpBHL8yrPPcuWJDDGstZTPQf5KnOqaYqt3lGCbqk5l7-NSg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vOXdSdLmtWqqc_B5iamYd_MH9eLCqry-jGuHr-VEffpy0HAIf_hTRFmjAzOx2C5-JPphHdEd4JZsdRTLcbpNftWWdrUPiRbaS2gsYK5_kG4="], "published": "2018-03-08T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T03:57:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
