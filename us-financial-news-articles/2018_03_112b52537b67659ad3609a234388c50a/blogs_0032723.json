In three years, the organization has built over 850 homes in countries like Bolivia, Mexico, Haiti and El Salvador. But thanks to a new 3-D printer, they will soon be able to build a lot more houses for a lot cheaper. \n\"A traditional style New Story community of about 100 homes will take close to a year to complete. With the 3-D home printer, if we just had one, it would take about three months to complete the community,\" said New Story CEO Brett Hagler. \nAt SXSW this week, New Story revealed a 600-square-foot proof of concept of what its 3-D printed homes will look like. The house was printed in less than 24 hours using a Vulcan printer made by construction company Icon . SOURCE: New Story \n\"Three-D printing opens almost unlimited design possibilities, said Icon co-founder Jason Ballard. \"It uses very resilient materials, produces almost zero waste, and it can be done much more affordably than conventional building methods.\" \nThis particular prototype cost about $10,000 to develop, but Icon and New Story hope to eventually cut that cost to $4,000 per home. That's cheaper than the current $6,500 that it costs New Story to build a home using conventional methods.
