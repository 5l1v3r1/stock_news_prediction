But polls show a tight race and it has emerged as the nation's political hotspot as Lamb tries for an upset.\nLamb reported raising more than $3.3 million in the first seven weeks of 2018, almost five times the $703,000 Saccone reported in filings to the Federal Election Commission on Thursday night.\nLamb spent most of the money, leaving him $837,000 in cash heading into the final three weeks of the race. That was more than twice as much as the $303,000 Saccone reported.\nThe race has drawn heavy attention and millions of dollars from Republicans and Trump in an effort to bolster Saccone and protect the GOP's U.S. House majority. Trump has made one visit to the district, and promised another, while Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's daughter, Ivanka , have made appearances with Saccone in the district, as well.\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is heading to the district Tuesday to campaign for Lamb.\nDemocrats must flip at least 24 GOP-held seats to capture a majority, and a Lamb victory would raise their national hopes considerably.\nTrump won the congressional district easily in 2016, downing Democrat Hillary Clinton by almost 20 percentage points. The former eight-term incumbent, Tim Murphy, never had a close election, and didn't even have a Democratic challenger in his last two elections.\nMurphy, a prominent opponent of abortion rights, resigned in October, after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette obtained text messages in which he suggested a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair get an abortion when they thought she might be pregnant.\nOne key difference between Saccone and Murphy, however, is that Murphy had labor union support, while Saccone does not.\nTo erase Lamb's fundraising advantage, Republican and Trump-aligned groups are pouring millions into the race -- roughly $8 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings -- while Democratic groups have reported spending roughly $1 million.\nSaccone, 60, is a four-term state lawmaker with among the state Legislature's most conservative voting records, based on the American Conservative Union ratings. He is a retired Air Force counterintelligence officer and college professor who served as a civilian adviser in Iraq.\nLamb, 33, left his post as an assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh to run. He was a lawyer in the Marine Corps and comes from a political family, with an uncle who is the elected city controller of Pittsburgh and a grandfather who was the Democratic majority leader in Pennsylvania's state Senate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:35:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
