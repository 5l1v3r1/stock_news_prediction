Gross domestic product grew for a fourth straight quarter in October-December.\nEstablished in 2001 by the Greek government, Taneo invests in venture capital funds, specialising in Greek small and medium size enterprises in the telecommunications, information technology, e-commerce, biotechnology, and new materials sectors.\nMubadala, active in 13 sectors and more than 30 countries, is joining up with the Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC) as part of a consolidation in Abu Dhabi’s investment funds, it was announced last week.\n$1 = 0.8068 euros Reporting by Tom Arnold; editing by Jason Neely and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:11:40.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
