By Thursday, all of McDonald’s social media profiles, including Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, were displaying an upside-down logo.\nThe move was intended to honor “the extraordinary accomplishments of women everywhere and especially in our restaurants,” Wendy Lewis, the company’s global chief diversity officer, said in a statement on Tuesday.\nMore than 62 percent of McDonald’s employees are women, including six out of 10 restaurant managers, Lewis said.\nAbout 100 restaurants across the country plan to participate in the gesture, and customers will also see the flipped logo on packaging and crew member’s hats and shirts, the company said in a statement.
