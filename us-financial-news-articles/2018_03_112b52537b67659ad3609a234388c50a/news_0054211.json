But it won’t be a short-term operation,” Mancini said.\nSorgenia, once controlled by Italy’s De Benedetti family, is owned by a series of Italian banks, including top lenders UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, that took over after a debt restructuring.\nAsked if the banks might cut their stakes and exit the company, Mancini said he did not think so.\n“The banks entered three years ago in a difficult situation and decided to support us. No disposals have been done ever since,” he said.\nSorgenia posted core earnings last year of 160 million euros compared to 40 million euros in 2015.
