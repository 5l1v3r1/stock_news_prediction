In this role, Cleveland leads Curvature's global sales, business development and channel partnership efforts. He reports directly to Curvature CEO and executive chairman Peter Weber.\nWith more than 25 years in the IT industry, Cleveland previously held sales leadership roles at EMC (now Dell EMC). During his tenure as one of the company's most accomplished field leaders, Cleveland reported directly to EMC's vice chairman and president while driving the go-to-market integrations of EMC-acquired storage companies globally. His extensive background in both hardware and software-as-a-service is reinforced by specialized expertise in Flash storage business, unstructured content and analytics software.\n\"Jake brings a wealth of operational, sales and channel expertise to Curvature, which will prove invaluable as our growth trajectory accelerates,\" said Peter Weber, Curvature CEO. \"The quickening pace of data center consolidations and cloud migrations is placing increased pressure on our customers to optimize IT and application lifecycle management. Under Jake's guidance, we can elevate our ability to scale our business globally while delivering unsurpassed network, server and storage solutions.\"\nWith 2,300 employees working from 100 offices and service centers in 11 countries to support more than 15,000 customers worldwide, Curvature remains significantly larger in size and scope than its closest competitor. The company's service offerings include independent, multi-vendor hardware support, remote office/branch office maintenance, professional and managed infrastructure services, pre-owned and new hardware procurement as well as IT asset disposition.\n\"As the leading provider of third-party maintenance, Curvature is unique in its ability to ease application lifecycle management burdens, which multiply quickly during data center consolidations and migrations,\" said Cleveland. \"I'm excited to join Curvature and apply my years of experience to help customers think differently about IT services. My commitment to our customers' businesses extends beyond their data centers to fully enable strategic moves to the cloud.\"\nCleveland also will spearhead the expansion of Curvature's worldwide channel organization. The company currently has partnerships with top-tier network, server and storage manufacturers, including Arista, Aruba Networks, Barracuda Networks, Check Point Software, Cumulus Networks, DataCore Software, Dell EMC, Fortinet and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nCleveland will be based at Curvature's global headquarters in Charlotte. The company recently announced the move to 41,716-square-feet of state-of-the-art space at Coliseum Centre Five, which will take place in the second quarter of this year. Cleveland is a graduate of Ohio University with a Bachelor's of Business Administration.\nAbout Curvature\nAs the global leader in independent IT support, products and services, Curvature is transforming how companies manage, maintain and upgrade equipment and support for multi-vendor, multinational networks and data centers.
