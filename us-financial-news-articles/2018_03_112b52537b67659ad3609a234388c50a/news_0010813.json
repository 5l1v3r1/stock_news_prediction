This wouldn’t have occurred without Hunter Harrison’s vision and leadership. That is Hunter’s legacy at CP, which we will always honor (“ Railroads Clean Up CEO’s Tracks ,” Business & Finance, Feb. 27).\nOver the past five years, we have embarked on a journey to “fix the engine” of this company, and it hasn’t always been easy. We have gone from industry laggard to industry leader. We have all benefited greatly from Hunter Harrison’s leadership and mentorship over that time, including the broader railroad industry, CP shareholders and, yes, CP customers.\nThe art of precision railroading, pioneered by Hunter, involves better utilization of assets, scheduling and discipline. In the process of our transformation, we walked away from some customers and some customers walked away from us. Now that we have built a better CP, we can sell a comprehensive, reliable, total transportation product. We can focus on sustainable, profitable and controlled growth working together with our customers.\nKeith Creel\nPresident and CEO\nCanadian Pacific Railway\nCalgary, Alberta", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T14:28:58.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
