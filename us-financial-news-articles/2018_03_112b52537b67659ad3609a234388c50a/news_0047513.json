There is a lot of discussion about it but I think, actually, as I understand it from firms, we’re seeing less disruption, actually, on the ground, as would perhaps be implied by the headlines.” (Reporting by Simon Jessop, editing by Maiya Keidan)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T15:50:13.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
