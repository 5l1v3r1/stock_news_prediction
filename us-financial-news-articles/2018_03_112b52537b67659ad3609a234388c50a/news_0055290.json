Yeah, something just passed over us,” the pilot said. “I don’t know what it was, but at least two-three thousand feet above us. Yeah, it passed right over the top of us.” \nThe controller was unable to verify that any other aircraft was in the area at the time, according to the FAA, but a spokesperson clarified that this doesn’t necessarily mean the object was otherworldly. \n“We have a close working relationship with a number of other agencies and safely handle military aircraft and civilian aircraft of all types in that area every day, including high-altitude weather balloons,” the FAA spokesperson said . \nAmerican Airlines told Fortune they are directing all questions to the FAA. \nThis incident happened just 500 miles away from Roswell, N.M., a notorious location for UFO activity dating back to 1947, when a flying saucer allegedly crashed there in the desert. \nJust three months before the sighting in Arizona, it was revealed that U.S. Defense Department has been investigating UFOs for years , and videos of Navy pilots sighting mysterious aircraft was released.
