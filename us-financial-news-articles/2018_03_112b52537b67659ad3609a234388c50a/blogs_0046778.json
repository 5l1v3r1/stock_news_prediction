Consumer discretionary stocks are up 3.6 percent since January while the S&P 500 lost more than 1.1 percent.\n\"If you look at the traditional defensives like utilities, staples, telecom, they're all down year-to-date right now,\" Cronk said. \"I do think there are some areas we are starting to push some valuation issues, and tech might be one of those. ... We're even weight on tech right now.\"\nIn addition to being president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute, Cronk is chief investment officer for Wealth and Investment Management, a division of Wells Fargo & Co. that includes Wells Fargo Private Bank, Wells Fargo Advisors, Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Abbot Downing businesses, accounting for more than $1.6 trillion in assets under administration.\nHe also discusses:\nThe state of the U.S. economy and why the market isn't likely to see a recession in 2019. The impact of further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
