Paulo on Friday.\nIf all shareholders accept EIG’s proposal, the transaction may reach 541 million reais ($167 million). The deadline for shareholders to accept the current 11.50 reais offer per share is 4 p.m. local time (1900 GMT) on Friday.\nEIG has already raised its price once, from 9.94 reais per share, after shareholders complained about the price.\nTo delist Prumo, controlling shareholder EIG needs acceptance of two-thirds of the minority shareholders. It is unclear whether EIG will get the necessary 66 percent of the company’s free float.\nIf EIG does not reach the threshold, Prumo will continue as a listed company at B3 SA Brasil Bolsa Balcao.\nShares of Prumo were down 0.63 percent in early afternoon trading at 11.13 reais.
