That's a big swing, when exports are running behind last year's pace.\" \nU.S. corn export sales have spiked so far this year after dry and hot conditions took a toll on the crop in Argentina, the No. 3 global corn and soy exporter. \nThe USDA slashed its outlook for Argentina corn and soy production but increased its estimate for soy production in Brazil, the top global soy producer and exporter. \n\"Argentine soybeans were at 47 million tonnes,\" said MaxYield Cooperative analyst Karl Setzer. \"We did cut off 7 million tonnes from February but according to everybody you talk to, as long as we hold above 44 million tonnes it's not going to impact global balance sheets long term because that's what they need to meet demand.\" \nSeparate USDA weekly data released at midmorning on Thursday showed U.S. corn exports last week at 1.9 million tonnes and soybean sales of 2.7 million tonnes - both above the range of analyst expectations. Weekly sales of 428,400 tonnes of U.S. wheat were within the range of estimates.
