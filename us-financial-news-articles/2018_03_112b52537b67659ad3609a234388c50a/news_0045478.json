While the Avs were on the power play, Soderberg drove to the net and received a cross-slot pass from J.T. Compher, which he promptly one-timed a close-in shot over Golden Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury for his 16th goal of the season.\nWith the number of comeback victories they’ve pulled out this season, it should come as no surprise Marchessault pulled the Golden Knights even just 75 seconds into the third period. Marchessault entered the offensive zone on a one-on-two rush, cut to his forehand and ripped a top-corner wrist shot for his 24th tally of the campaign.\nShortly after, Fleury made a dangerous but successful play when he darted almost out the blue line to attempt a poke check on Blake Comeau when the Avs forward had a breakaway. Comeau kept the puck, but stumbled and couldn’t sweep it into an open net while he was sliding.\nFleury made 29 saves through overtime.\nThe Avalanche were without goalie Jonathan Bernier, slated to serve as backup, because of a cut and infection to his upper body, while forwards Colin Wilson and Sven Andrighetto missed the game due to lower-body injuries. That forced the Avs to dress 11 forwards, and defenseman Mark Alt suited up for his first game with Colorado.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-25T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T17:48:12.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
