That deal means that Microsoft will purchase all the wind energy produced at GE's new, 37 MW Tullahennel wind farm in County Kerry. In November, state-owned Swedish energy company Vattenfall signed a 10-year deal to power Microsoft's international data center operations in the Netherlands using wind power.\n\"We're on track to exceed our goal of powering 50 percent of our global datacentre load with renewable energy this year,\" Christian Belady, Microsoft's general manager for cloud infrastructure strategy and architecture, said.\n\"Once operational, the new solar project will bring Microsoft's total global direct procurement in renewable energy projects to 860 megawatts.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T12:17:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
