Related Coverage \nFacebook’s website lists nine third-party data providers that it has worked with, including Acxiom, Experian, Oracle Data Cloud ( ORCL.N ), TransUnion ( TRU.N ) and WPP PLC ( WPP.L ). \nNone of the companies could immediately be reached for comment. \nFacebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said. \nFacebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users’ anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation. \nFacebook’s shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. \nThe data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook’s lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation. Slideshow (2 Images) \nFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers’ access to user information. \nThere is a new Facebook page - called Access Your Information - where users can see what they have shared and manage it. \n“The biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg’s promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. \nIt was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers. \nThey were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a “right to portability” - to take their data with them - and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law. \nLawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users’ data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica. \nHe plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators. \nZuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL.O ) and Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ) have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing. \nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook, and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened.
