It also posted lower operating profit for a second year running.\n“An eye-catching 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) of gross cost savings aids blue-skying over the longer term. However, nearer-term competitive and foreign excxhange conditions remain highly volatile,” wrote analysts at investment bank Jefferies, who kept a“hold” rating on Carrefour shares.\nCarrefour shares, which fell around 20 percent last year, are down around 3 percent so far in 2018.\n$1 = 0.8199 euros Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta Editing by Leigh Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:02:22.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
