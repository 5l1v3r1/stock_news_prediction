United Airlines is owned by United Continental Holdings Inc.\nThe mayor’s official announcement of the plan came ahead of a city council meeting on Wednesday where he was scheduled to introduce the project and seek up to $4 billion of airport revenue bonds to start financing it.\nThe eight-year plan calls for replacing one of O‘Hare’s existing terminals with a new global terminal, where United and American would be relocated. Other terminals would be renovated to expand gate capacity. Construction is scheduled to begin next year.\nThe expansion relies on a new use and lease agreement with airlines to replace an existing 35-year deal that expires in May. Chicago has already spent billions of dollars to reconfigure and extend runways at the airport.
