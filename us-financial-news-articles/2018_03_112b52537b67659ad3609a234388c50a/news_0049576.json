That’s obviously taking some pressure off the stock at the moment,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director of New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.\n“It’s enough to get some short covering, but as far as pouring in, most investors will wait until the dust settles.”\nBroader markets have suffered this month on a back-and-forth between the United States and China on tariffs and fears of rising interest rates. The main indexes are on track for their worst month since January 2016.\nComments from top officials in the United States and China had given a sense that both the countries would negotiate over President Donald Trump’s move to impose tariffs on Chinese goods.\nChina is expected to soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on US exports, its state-run Global Times reported on Wednesday.\nAt 9:55 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 90.99 points, or 0.38 percent, at 23,948.7 and the S&P 500 was up 5.87 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,618.49.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was down 18.60 points, or 0.27 percent, at 6,990.21.\nThe S&P healthcare index was up nearly 1 percent on gains in Allergan, Celgene and Incyte.\nTesla dropped about 4.4 percent after the U.S. government said it would investigate a fatal crash and vehicle fire of a Model X in California.\nLululemon Athletica surged 8.8 percent after the Canadian athletic apparel maker posted a surprisingly strong fourth-quarter profit and forecast further growth in the first quarter.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 1.41-to-1 ratio and for a 1.06-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
