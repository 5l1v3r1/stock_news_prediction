Fiscal fourth-quarter same-store sales grew 3.6 percent from a year earlier, boosted by a spike in traffic around the holidays, surpassing analysts' expectations. \nTarget shares were falling more than 4 percent by Tuesday afternoon, as investors worried the retailer's investments in e-commerce and employees were weighing too heavily on profit margins. \nThe company has outlined other spending plans for the year, including an expansion of same-day delivery and free two-day shipping on purchases made via Target.com. All the announcements Tuesday tie back to Target's $7 billion investment strategy, which runs through 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T18:56:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
