In February 2018, Aqua Metals authorized such firm to conduct a comprehensive search for a successor CEO, which has been ongoing since such time.\nAdditionally, in February 2018, Aqua Metals commenced a process to identify up to two new independent director candidates to refresh the composition of the Board. This process is intended to ensure that the Board has the best mix of skills, diversity, and industry and other experience to best design and oversee the implementation of the Company’s operating strategy to maximize the value of the Company and return on investment for its shareholders.\nVincent L. DiVito, an Aqua Metals independent director, said: “Steve is a very talented inventor and a true visionary. During his tenure as CEO, Aqua Metals has achieved several important development milestones. Our search for a new CEO is well underway, and we are committed to recruiting an outstanding CEO to lead the Company as it transitions from a founder-led, development stage organization to a more mature public company.”\nAbout Aqua Metals\nAqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQMS) is reinventing lead recycling with its patented and patent-pending AquaRefining™ technology. AquaRefining is a room temperature, water-based process that is fundamentally non-polluting.
