But he stressed that he did so reluctantly. \nTrump slammed the rushed process to pass the more than 2,200-page bill released only Wednesday. Standing near the pile of documents, the president said he was \"disappointed\" in the legislation and would \"never sign another bill like this again.\" \n\"We're very proud of many of the items that we've been able to get. We're very disappointed that in order to fund the military, we had to give up things where we consider in many cases them to be bad or them to be a waste of money. But that's the way unfortunately right now the system works,\" Trump said at the White House. He added that he \"looked very seriously\" at a veto, but his support for the military spending levels \"overrode\" his concerns about the bill. \nTrump teased a veto a day after the White House had said he would sign the legislation despite his misgivings. He raised the risk of a government shutdown only hours before the midnight Friday deadline. Then the president, who enjoys creating tension and drama, announced he would not veto the bill in an event carried on live television. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters President Donald Trump speaks with Vice President Mike Pence at his side as holds an event to sign Congress' $1.3 trillion spending bill in the Diplomatic Room of the White House in Washington. U.S., March 23, 2018. \nTrump highlighted the portions of the bill he supports: the nearly $80 billion increase in defense spending, a $1.6 billion boost to border security funding and a cash injection to fight the opioid epidemic. The border money will go mostly toward surveillance technology and fencing similar to structures that already exist on the southern border. The amount of funding came in far below what the president wanted. \nIn a tweet Friday morning, Trump said he was \"considering a VETO\" because the proposal did not extend protections for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants or fully fund his proposed border wall. Trump tweet \nThe president's tweet threw more chaos into the process to keep the government running Friday, even after it looked like Trump's signature would be a sure thing. Vice President Mike Pence offered support for the bill Thursday. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney answered \"yes\" on Thursday when asked if Trump would sign the bill. \n\"Why? Because it funds his priorities,\" he told reporters. \nThe legislation, which both chambers of Congress passed with bipartisan support, would fund the government through the end of September. It would significantly boost military spending and increase funding for border security, infrastructure and efforts to fight the opioid epidemic. \nIt also includes measures meant to strengthen gun sale background checks and improve school safety. \nWhen Trump threatened a veto, many lawmakers had already left Washington. Some are in Rochester, New York, for the funeral Friday of longtime Rep. Louise Slaughter, who died last week. The Senate had adjourned and was not expected to take up legislative work again until April 9. \nWhile Trump cheered the military funding levels, he was irked by the level of border security funding. While Republicans and the president himself have said the bill funds Trump's \"wall,\" the money goes to miles of new fencing similar to existing structures. \nTrump, who has tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, reportedly wanted $25 billion in long-term wall funding in exchange for protections for the young immigrants. Democrats and some Republicans have sought to extend the DACA program. Trump reportedly did not want to give up to 1.8 million immigrants a pathway to citizenship as part of that deal, as Democrats wanted. \nOn Friday, Trump claimed Democrats do not want to extend the legal protections for the immigrants. \n\"I do want the Hispanic community to know and DACA recipients to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats, who are using you for their own purposes,\" he said. \nSome notable Republicans who opposed the spending bill encouraged Trump to torpedo it on Friday after his veto threat. Earlier, House Freedom Caucus Vice Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio told CNBC the veto threat \"is great\" and said he hoped the president followed through on it. \n\"I think he got a full understanding of how bad this legislation is. â€¦ This is not even close to what the American people elected us to do,\" the hardline House conservative said. \nJordan pushed back on GOP claims that the bill funded the border wall, asking, \"Why do you think [House and Senate Minority Leaders] Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are smiling ear to ear?\" \nEarlier Friday, Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn., told Trump to \"please\" veto the legislation, calling the spending levels \"grotesque.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T16:12:05.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
