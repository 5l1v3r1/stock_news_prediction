(\"AGORA\"), a Texas-based provider of technology solutions for the financial services industry, announces its partnership with industry-leading debt acquisitions expert Nancy Hughes in order to expand the scope of services and solutions AGORA offers to the marketplace of auto finance loans and receivables.\nHughes brings a wealth of experience in managing, pricing, acquiring and disposing of debt and accounts receivable across a wide range of consumer asset classes. In partnering with AGORA, Hughes will lead AGORA's initiatives to develop tools, resources and a marketplace platform for debt and accounts receivable related to the auto finance sector.\nAGORA founder and CEO Steve Burke commented, \"I have known and worked with Nancy for years. She is a true industry leader and a dedicated professional. We are very excited to have her as part of the team!\"\nSince its launch in April 2017, AGORA's flagship loan exchange platform has rapidly revolutionized the secondary market for auto loans, allowing buyers and sellers to publish and exchange loan data directly in an efficient and secure environment without the need of intermediaries or brokers.\n\"Throughout my career, I have worked tirelessly to balance client and company goals resulting in truly successful partnerships. I see tremendous value in the AGORA platform and its groundbreaking technology. The opportunities to lead the effort to bring AGORA into the debt markets and provide access to a client community that I have served for decades is truly revolutionary,\" remarked Nancy Hughes.\nAGORA was created in response to the many friction points and inefficiencies that exist in the manner that auto loan portfolios currently trade – namely poor and inconsistent data, lack of transparency from the brokers that previously dominated the market and heightened regulatory concerns over unsecured transmission of personal consumer data.\n\"Partnering with experts such as Nancy further evidences AGORA's priorities to be forward thinking and to continue our drive to provide fully integrated resources across the consumer finance sector – from performing loans through non-performing and charged-off debt,\" noted Steve Burke.\nAbout Agora Data, Inc.\nFounded by industry veterans, Agora Data, Inc. is an Arlington, Texas-based developer of financial services enabling software and solutions. Its flagship application AGORA was launched to create a true marketplace for buyers and sellers of auto loans. With the launch of its initial commercial release, AGORA has turned to buildout subsequent releases to include extremely robust due diligence, pricing, reporting and compliance modules for the platform.\nVisit www.agoradata.com for more information.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agora-announces-partnership-with-nancy-hughes-and-expands-into-auto-debt-buying-sector-300611736.html\nSOURCE AGORA Data, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.agoradata.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agora-announces-partnership-with-nancy-hughes-and-expands-into-auto-debt-buying-sector-300611736.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T05:10:33.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
