More than 200 workers, representing about 13% of factory personnel, lost their jobs in the company's most recent quarter.\nThe gunmaker said units shipped to distributors and retailers declined 38.3% for the period. Background checks for handguns, a figure that's considered a proxy for consumer demand, also fell 8.8%.\nRead more from USA Today: \nJ.C. Penney slashes roughly 360 jobs, misses investors expectations \nInstant Pot recalls cooker over potential fire hazard\nAmericans are borrowing record amounts for auto loans even as interest rates rise \nAs distributors cut inventory, the company has taken a hit, as well. And increased discounts have compromised profits.\nSales for the third period ended Jan. 31 fell 31.6% to $157.4 million. Net income fell 64.9% to $11.4 million.\nAmerican Outdoor Brands stock fell 5.7% to $8.87 at 10:12 a.m. Friday.\nThe company is projecting \"flattish\" gun revenue for the next 12 to 18 months, saying consumer demand may remain low \"for some time.\"\nAlthough Debney said he heard reports of \"some increased foot traffic\" and higher sales at gun retailers after the Parkland massacre, the uptick is not expected to be significant.\nFirearm companies often benefit from concerns that gun rights could be restricted because some people rush to buy guns before it's too late.\nThe sales report came after Dick's ended sales of assault-style rifles at its Field & Stream locations, after having already banned the weapons at its namesake stores. Dick's, Walmart and Kroger's Fred Meyer stores also raised the minimum age to buy a gun to 21.\nBut the Smith & Wesson maker isn't concerned.\nSales of assault-style rifles by Dick's represented only 0.1% of American Outdoor Brands' overall sales.\n\"So there isn't really any impact,\" Debney said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:47:00.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
