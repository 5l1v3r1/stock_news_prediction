They include Australia’s richest woman Gina Rinehart.\nSo far Sirius’s rival Israel Chemicals (IC) ( ICL.TA )( ICL.N ) is the only company to have actually begun mining polyhalite, a relatively new entrant to the fertilizer market.\nPolyhalite contains four of the six nutrients that ensure plant growth – potassium, sulfur, magnesium and calcium.\nSirius, which calls its product POLY4, says that makes it superior to more widely used potash, which only contains potassium and can leave a damaging chloride residue.\nAlthough the potash market is oversupplied, Fraser said there was a long-term need for fertilizer as a growing global population must be fed.\nInvestment group Shore Capital reiterated its “buy” rating and said Sirius should become “progressively de-risked” as it moves toward production.\nThe share price had risen around 20 percent this year, but was down just over 1 percent after the results on Tuesday.\n(This story corrects paragraph 10 after company clarifies that it is in talks but has not yet secured state-backed guarantees)\nEditing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:44:47.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
