Vernon’s Glasgow Warriors team mates Scott Cummings (lock), Matt Fagerson (loose forward) and Adam Hastings (flyhalf) were included in the squad for the first time this year. The 21-year-old Hastings is the son of former Scotland captain Gavin Hastings. Scotland won their home games against France and England in this year’s competition but lost in Wales and Ireland.
