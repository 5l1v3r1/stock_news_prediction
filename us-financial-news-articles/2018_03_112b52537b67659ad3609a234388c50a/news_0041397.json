In order for the Backstreet Boys to start selling their own, they’ll likely need to partner with an existing brand. From the sounds of things, it looks like that hasn’t quite happened yet. There’s no word on what the tequila would be called.\nTequila also isn’t the only new venture the band is interested in. The band filed documents on Feb. 9 to trademark the name ‘Backstreet Barbecue,’ presumably to open their own barbecue restaurant.\nThe band continues its Las Vegas residency this summer.", "external_links": ["http://www.tmz.com/2018/03/17/backstreet-boys-file-trademark-barbecue-restaurant/", "https://www.tastingtable.com/drinks/national/best-celebrity-liquor-brands-backstreet-boys"], "published": "2018-03-24T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T06:00:11.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
