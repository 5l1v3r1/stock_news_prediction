I’m a pretty damn good athlete. Any guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest S.O.B. in the room.”\nThe comments come on the heels of Biden calling Trump “ a joke ” on CNN, adding, “I just marvel over some of the things he says and does.”\nBiden has never been shy about criticizing Trump. Last January, he said he had “no freakin’ idea ” what Trump would do as president, noting, “It’s like a Rubik’s cube trying to figure this guy out.”", "external_links": ["https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/07/politics/joe-biden-donald-trump-cnntv/index.html", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-beat-hell-trump-high-school-disrespecting-women/story?id=53897309"], "published": "2018-03-21T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T01:04:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
