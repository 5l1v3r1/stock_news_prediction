There are so many unknowns at this time.”\nThe shooting comes as tension is high in schools after a gunman with an assault-style rifle killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14. It was one of the deadliest U.S. school shootings in United States, where dozens of massacres have occurred in recent years.\nThe Alabama school has working metal detectors and would be open on Thursday with heightened security and a crisis team on hand, Lisa Herring, superintendent of Birmingham City Schools, told reporters.\nThe student who died was a graduating senior who would soon be 18 years old, had been accepted to college and wanted to become a nurse, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin told reporters.\n“Our hearts are heavy,” Woodfin said.\nHuffman is one of seven public high schools in Birmingham, the state’s most populous city.\nReporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago and Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T04:00:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
