The people said it was too early to determine an IPO valuation as discussions are still at a preliminary stage.\nBeijing-based Meituan-Dianping, BAML, Goldman and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. All the people declined to be identified as discussions related to the IPO are confidential.\nReuters reported in November that Meituan-Dianping, which offers a broad range of services including travel packages, was considering an IPO in the United States as soon as this year.\nThe company has however shifted focus to Hong Kong, the people said, as the city’s exchange operator is about to allow dual-class shares, which potentially allow founders to weight share voting rights in their favor.\nLed by serial entrepreneur Wang Xing, Meituan-Dianping’s backers also include Sequoia Capital Ltd, Singaporean state investors GIC Pte Ltd [GIC.UL] and Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd [TEM.UL], as well as DST Global and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.\nThe IPO proceeds could help boost the firm’s firepower for investments in offline retail and artificial intelligence, said one of the people, pitching it against China’s leading e-commerce players including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ( BABA.N ) and JD.com Inc ( JD.O ).\nMeituan-Dianping last month said it had about 320 million active buyers and more than 4 million merchants with total revenue reaching $5.4 billion last year. It did not disclose details about profitability.\nThe $30 billion valuation ranked the firm as the world’s fourth-largest “unicorn” - technology start-ups valued at $1 billion or more - according to data and analytics provider CB Insights.\nReporting by Julie Zhu and Fiona Lau of IFR; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee, Jennifer Hughes and Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T07:10:50.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
