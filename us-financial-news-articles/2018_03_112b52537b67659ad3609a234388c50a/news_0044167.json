Cleveland countered by scoring the next 10 points to make it a one-point game on a hoop by Hill with 4:29 left. Cleveland was unable to regain the lead and the Nets held an 89-87 advantage going into the fourth.\nJames returned with 6:17 remaining with the Nets up 100-99 and following a Hill layup, he threw down a two-handed dunk for a 103-100 lead with 5:40 left. A little over a minute later Hill and James connected for another dunk to push Cleveland’s lead to 107-100.\nAfter a Harris 3-pointer made it 111-105, Hood hit a 3-pointer for a nine-point lead with 2:37 left.
