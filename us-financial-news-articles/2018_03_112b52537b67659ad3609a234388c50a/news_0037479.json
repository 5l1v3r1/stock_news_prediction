Walter Thompson advertising agency. Thaler was a junior copywriter and Patterson, who started as a junior copywriter, had worked his way up to creative director. He was 34 years old when he helped create the jingle, he tells the Wall Street Journal . He came up with the line, \"I'm a Toys R Us kid.\"\nThaler initially thought the song was going to be \"one time thing,\" she tells Inside Edition . \"We never thought it was going to go on for so long.\"\nRobin Marchant | Getty Images Author James Patterson But it didn't take Thaler long to realize that she and Patterson had come up with something special. Shortly after the campaign launched, she heard a four-year-old boy running down the street singing the jingle: \"His mother said to him, 'If you don't stop singing that song, we are never going to make it to school.' I thought, 'That's cool.'\"\nThaler went on to create a jingle for Kodak and the former Northwest Airlines. She now runs her own ad agency, The Kaplan Thaler Group.\nPatterson, who sold his first book while working at J. Walter Thompson, has been the world's best-selling author since 2001 and is currently the world's richest author , with a net worth of $700 million .\nThe key to success, he says, is persistence. \"You're lucky to find something you like to do and it's a miracle if somebody will pay you to do it. That's kind of been my gig since I was in my twenties,\" the now 70-year-old author tells Forbes . \"My first book got turned down by 31 publishers ... but you keep churning along.\"\nLike this story?
