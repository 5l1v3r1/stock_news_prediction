We hope that this sentence is changed on appeal,” Peter Manning was Quote: d as saying by another United Arab Emirates newspaper, The National.\nFrancis Matthew served as editor of Gulf News from 1995 to 2005 before becoming editor-at-large, The National said, adding that he had been married to his wife for more than 30 years.\nWriting by Ghaida Ghantous; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-25T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T17:46:12.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
