The global offering will be comprised of a public offering of ordinary shares in the form of ADSs in the United States, Canada and certain countries outside of Europe and a private placement of ordinary shares in Europe (including France). The Company intends to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase additional ordinary shares, which may be in the form of ADSs, in an aggregate amount of up to 15% of the total number of ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) proposed to be sold in the global offering, on the same terms and conditions. Each ADS offered represents the right to receive one-half of one ordinary share. The ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"DBVT\", and the Company's ordinary shares are listed on Euronext Paris under the symbol \"DBV\".\nMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are acting as joint lead book-running managers for the global offering. Barclays and Deutsche Bank Securities are also serving as book-running managers. Bryan, Garnier & Co. is acting as a co-manager for the global offering.\nThe price at which ordinary shares will be sold in the global offering will be determined following a bookbuilding process commencing immediately and will not be less than the volume weighted-average of the trading prices of the Company's ordinary shares on the Euronext Paris over the three trading days prior to commencement of marketing of the global offering, subject to a maximum discount of 5%. The new ordinary shares will be issued through a capital increase without shareholders' pre-emptive rights under the provisions of Article L. 225-136 of the French Commercial Code and pursuant to the decision of the Company's Board of Directors (Conseil d'Administration) on March 20, 2018, in accordance with the delegations granted pursuant to the Resolutions 18, 21 and 23 adopted at the ordinary and extraordinary meeting of the Company's shareholders (Assemblée Générale Mixte) held on June 21, 2016. The final number of ordinary shares offered, including the number of ordinary shares offered in the form of ADSs, and the subscription price therefor will be decided by the Company's Deputy Chief Executive Officer (Directeur Général Délégué), in accordance with a sub-delegation granted by the Company's Board of Directors (Conseil d'Administration) on March 20, 2018; provided, that in no event shall the Company be permitted to issue more than 20% of its share capital outstanding prior to commencement of the global offering.\nThe global offering will commence immediately and the Company plans to announce the result of the global offering as soon as practicable after completion thereof in a subsequent press release. The Company plans to use the net proceeds from the global offering to fund the development and commercialization of Viaskin Peanut, to advance development of its other product candidates and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nEntities affiliated with Baker Bros. Advisors LP and Bpifrance Participations S.A., which are existing shareholders, as well as Pierre-Henri Benhamou, the Company's chief executive officer, have indicated an interest in purchasing up to an aggregate of $73.5 million of ordinary shares and/or ADSs in this offering at the public offering price. However, because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, the underwriters may determine to sell more, fewer or no ordinary shares and/or ADSs in this offering to these entities, or these entities may determine to purchase more, fewer or no ordinary shares and/or ADSs in this offering.\nA registration statement on Form F-3 relating to the securities to be issued in the global offering was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became automatically effective on July 27, 2016.
