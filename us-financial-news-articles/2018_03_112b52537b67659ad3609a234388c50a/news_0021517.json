However, that windfall came from stock entitlements based on earlier work .\nAccording to the Cheddar report, the company has recently been tightening up its employee performance-evaluating processes. It withheld cash bonuses at the end of last year, due to companywide goals being missed.\nPrevious Snap culls, which took place last year and earlier this year, were smaller than that now being reported, measuring a dozen or two apiece.\nSnap (snap) had not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T15:55:27.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
