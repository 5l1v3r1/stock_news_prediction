They appear on a single ticket sold at a Lukoil gas station in Riverdale, New Jersey, the New Jersey Lottery said on Twitter.\nThe drawing follows a March 27 Mega Millions drawing that was the twenty-third in a row without a jackpot-winning ticket.\nThe grand prize has rolled higher since it was last won on Jan. 5 at $451 million by a 20-year-old Florida man, the lottery said.\nFriday’s 11 pm ET jackpot drawing was for the tenth largest prize ever offered in the United States. Powerball holds the record with a $1.586 billion payout in 2016.\nThe Mega Millions record is $656 million won in 2012.\nReporting By Andrew Hay; Additional reporting by Rich McKay and Jonathan Allen; Editing by Tom Hogue and Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-31T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T18:35:00.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
