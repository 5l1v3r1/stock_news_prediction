ProCell has the knowledge, equipment, and resources to tackle every aspect of tower construction. ProCell is committed to implementing, developing, improving strategies, management systems and processes to ensure that all construction activities uphold the highest level of safety performance.\nThis strategic acquisition gives Tower One subsidiary Tower Construction and Technical Services Inc.

ProCell is also an approved contractor for American Tower and Crown Castle that operate internationally and throughout South America.\nAlejandro Ochoa, CEO of Tower One, states: “This strategic acquisition will allow economies of scale in the services business, cost reduction through consolidation of many expenses including insurance and additional clients for the combined entity.
