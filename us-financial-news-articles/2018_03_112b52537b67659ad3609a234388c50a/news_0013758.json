Cohn was seen as someone with business-friendly policies and is well-liked on Wall Street.\n\"You're going to see the market try to come back here and see if there's another shoe to drop in the White House,\" Cashin said. \nEarlier Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross dismissed the notion that Cohn's resignation was part of a \"palace coup.\" The Commerce Department had recommended imposing heavy tariffs or quotas on foreign producers of steel and aluminum last month in the interest of national security. President Donald Trump then announced last Thursday that he would be imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.\n\n\"He's done very good work on the taxes, he's done very good work on the infrastructure,\" Ross told CNBC. \"Gary, as you know from all kind of media, has been contemplating some sort of a move for some little while.\"\nWATCH: Cashin tries to make sense of tariffs and Cohn's departure show chapters Cashin: Growing feeling President trying his own version of 'Art of the Deal'      2 Hours Ago Sign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
