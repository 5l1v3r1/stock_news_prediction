He added that his plan would allow some of those late-payment fees to flow back to the state.\nThe legislation, which passed an Illinois Senate committee last week, would give the treasurer’s office priority to purchase receivables before the four currently active private lenders in the program.\nWhile bills more than 90 days past due accumulate interest penalties of 1 percent per month, the fine would be reduced to 0.3 percent per month for receivables held by the treasurer, under the legislation.\nFrerichs said he would be able to devote $500 million to $1 billion in investable state funds to the vendor payment program. It was designed to avert a shutdown of essential services such as state employee health insurance, prison food supplies and fuel for state trooper cars, due to the late payment of bills.\nThe biggest private lender, Vendor Assistance Program (VAP), has acquired $3.5 billion in Illinois receivables and has been repaid $2.5 billion by the state, according to the firm’s website.\nFollowing the passage of a fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion income tax hike in July, Illinois sold $6 billion of bonds in October to shrink the bill pile, which currently totals $8.9 billion.\nThe governor’s office has estimated the backlog of bills will by the end of fiscal 2023 grow to just under $14 billion.\nReporting by Karen Pierog; Editing by Daniel Bases and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T10:43:11.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
