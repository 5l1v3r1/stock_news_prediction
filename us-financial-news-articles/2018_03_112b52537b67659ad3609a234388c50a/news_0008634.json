(NASDAQ: YGYI ), a leading omni-direct lifestyle company, today announced the acquisition of ViaViente, distributors of The ViaViente Miracle, a highly-concentrated, energizing whole fruit puree blend that is rich in Anti-Oxidants and naturally-occurring vitamins and minerals.\nViaViente, was introduced to the public in 2003 following years of research that included studies of mineral rich waters whose source is found in the Andes Mountains and flow thru Vilcabamba, Ecuador, a region known for its high concentration of centenarians. In 2007 ViaViente became the first product in the market to receive the coveted Brunswick Labs ORAC Seal of Certification for its Anti-Oxidant content.\n“ViaViente is a welcome addition to Youngevity’s family of products and embodies our philosophy that nutrition can change the way a person ages.” Stated Dave Briskie, President and CFO of Youngevity International, Inc. “Over the last two quarters, as our international footprint has begun to take hold, we sought to acquire companies whose distribution would be accretive to the integration of this international expansion. Similar to our recent acquisition of Nature Direct in Australia, ViaViente certainly checked these and other boxes, since more than seventy-five per cent of their recent distribution is to Japan We feel very fortunate to be able to incorporate ViaViente’s products into Youngevity at this time and believe this acquisition to be an important strategic piece of our overall plan of expanding Youngevity’s distribution internationally.”\nViaviente issued the following statement:\n“For over 20 years, our management team has known the Youngevity founders and executives, Dr. Joel, Steve and Michelle Wallach, and have seen Youngevity grow as a company over those years. We believe Youngevity has the talent base and operational knowhow, combined with technology to lead our distributors to higher levels across more countries. The ViaViente management team looks forward to a very bright future as a result of becoming part of Youngevity International.”\nAbout Youngevity International, Inc.\nYoungevity International, Inc.
