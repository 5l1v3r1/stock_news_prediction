Those layoffs would be offset by a projected 10,000 to 15,000 in hiring by domestic steel and aluminum producers, Zandi said.\nZandi was speaking on a conference call to reporters after the release of the ADP National Employment Report for February earlier Wednesday, which showed a 235,000 increase in private hiring.\nThe ADP jobs report was jointly developed by ADP Research Institute and Moody’s Analytics.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:35:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
