The sales totaled about $31 million. \nAfter the trades, Icahn owned 4.85 percent of the company, down from his previous stake of 7.5 percent.\nManitowoc shares dropped 4.8 percent on Feb. 16 after Commerce Sec. Wilbur Ross released \"Steel and Aluminum 232\" reports at noon that day, which recommended a global tariff of at least 24 percent on all steel imports.\nThe company's stock dropped another 6 percent on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced his plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum as early as next week.\nConstruction equipment makers like Manitowoc use steel in their manufacturing.\nThe investor also reduced his positions in Freeport-McMoRan and Xerox last month, according to filings.
